0706.1601	discovery of 11 new t dwarfs in the two micron all-sky survey, including  a possible l/t transition binary	we present the discovery of 11 new t dwarfs, found during the course of aphotometric survey for mid-to-late t dwarfs in the 2mass point source catalogand from a proper motion selected sample of ultracool dwarfs in the 2massworking database. using the nasa infrared telescope facility spex spectrograph,we obtained low-resolution (r~150) spectroscopy, allowing us to derivenear-infrared spectral types of t2-t8. one of these new t dwarfs, 2massj13243559+6358284, was also discovered independently by metchev et al., inprep. this object is spectroscopically peculiar and possibly a binary and/orvery young (&lt;300 myr). we specifically attempted to model the spectrum of thissource as a composite binary to reproduce its peculiar spectralcharacteristics. the latest-type object in our sample is a t8 dwarf, 2massj07290002-3954043, now one of the four latest-type t dwarfs known. all 11 tdwarfs are nearby given their spectrophotometric distance estimates, with 1 tdwarf within 10 pc and 8 additional t dwarfs within 25 pc, if single. these newadditions increase the 25 pc census of t dwarfs by ~14%. their proximity offersan excellent opportunity to probe for companions at closer separations than arepossible for more distant t dwarfs.

0911.3844	physical properties of young brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars  inferred from high-resolution model spectra	by comparing near-infrared spectra with atmosphere models, we infer theeffective temperature, surface gravity, projected rotational velocity, andradial velocity for 21 very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. the unique sampleconsists of two sequences in spectral type from m6-m9, one of 5-10 myr objectsand one of &gt;1 gyr field objects. a third sequence is comprised of only ~m6objects with ages ranging from &lt;1 myr to &gt;1 gyr. spectra were obtained in the jband at medium (r~2,000) and high (r~20,000) resolutions with nirspec on thekeck ii telescope. synthetic spectra were generated from atmospheric structurescalculated with the phoenix model atmosphere code. using multi-dimensionalleast-squares fitting and monte carlo routines we determine the best-fit modelparameters for each observed spectrum and note which spectral regions provideconsistent results. we identify successes in the reproduction of observedfeatures by atmospheric models, including pressure-broadened ki lines, andinvestigate deficiencies in the models, particularly missing feh opacity, thatwill need to be addressed in order to extend our analysis to cooler objects.the precision that can be obtained for each parameter using medium- and high-resolution near-infrared spectra is estimated and the implications for futurestudies of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs are discussed.

0912.3774	a young planetary-mass object in the rho oph cloud core	we report the discovery of a young planetary-mass brown dwarf in the rho ophcloud core. the object was identified as such with the aid of a 1.5-2.4 micronlow-resolution spectrum obtained using the nirc instrument on the keck itelescope. based on the cond model, the observed spectrum is consistent with areddened (av ~ 15-16) brown dwarf whose effective temperature is in the range1200-1800 k. for an assumed age of 1 myr, comparison with isochrones furtherconstrains the temperature to ~ 1400 k and suggests a mass of ~ 2-3 jupitermasses. the inferred temperature is suggestive of an early t spectral type,which is supported by spectral morphology consistent with weak methaneabsorption. based on its inferred distance (~ 100 pc) and the presence ofoverlying visual absorption, it is very likely to be a rho oph cluster member.in addition, given the estimated spectral type, it may be the youngest andleast massive t dwarf found so far. its existence suggests that the initialmass function for the rho oph star-forming region extends well into theplanetary-mass regime.

0912.3808	spex spectroscopy of unresolved very low-mass binaries. i.  identification of seventeen candidate binaries straddling the l dwarf/t dwarf  transition	we report the identification of 17 candidate brown dwarf binaries whosecomponents straddle the l dwarf/t dwarf transition. these sources were culledfrom a large near-infrared spectral sample of l and t dwarfs observed with theinfrared telescope facility spex spectrograph. candidates were selected on thebasis of spectral ratios which segregate known (resolved) l dwarf/t dwarf pairsfrom presumably single sources. composite templates, constructed by combining13581 pairs of absolute flux-calibrated spectra, are shown to providestatistically superior fits to the spectra of our seventeen candidates ascompared to single templates. ten of these candidates appear to have secondarycomponents that are significantly brighter than their primaries over the1.0-1.3 micron band, indicative of rapid condensate depletion at the l dwarf/tdwarf transition. our results support prior indications of enhancedmultiplicity amongst early-type t dwarfs; 53+/-7% of the t0-t4 dwarfs in ourspectral sample are found to be either resolved or unresolved (candidate)pairs, although this is consistent with an intrinsic (volume complete) browndwarf binary fraction of only 15%. if verified, this sample of spectralbinaries more than doubles the number of known l dwarf/t dwarf transitionpairs, enabling a broader exploration of this poorly-understood phase of browndwarf atmospheric evolution.

1003.3447	the enigmatic young low-mass variable twa 30	twa 30 is a remarkable young (7+/-3 myr), low-mass (0.12+/-0.04 msun),late-type star (m5+/-1) residing 42+/-2 pc away from the sun in the tw hydraeassociation. it shows strong outflow spectral signatures such as [s ii], [o i],[o ii], [o iii], and mg i], while exhibiting weak halpha emission (-6.8+/-1.2angstroms). emission lines of [s ii] and [o i] are common to t tauri starsstill residing in their natal molecular clouds, while [o iii] and mg i]emission lines are incredibly rare in this same population; in the case of twa30, these latter lines may arise from new outflow material colliding into olderoutflow fronts. the weak halpha emission and small radial velocity shifts ofline emission relative to the stellar frame of rest (generally &lt;=10 km/s)suggest that the disk is viewed close to edge-on and that the stellar axis maybe inclined to the disk, similar to the aa tau system, based on its temporalchanges in emission/absorption line strengths/profiles and variable reddening(a_v=1.5-9.0). the strong li absorption (0.61+/-0.13 angstroms) and commonkinematics with members of the twa confirm its age and membership to theassociation. given the properties of this system such as its proximity, lowmass, remarkable outflow signatures, variability, and edge-on configuration,this system is a unique case study at a critical time in disk evolution andplanet-building processes.

1004.1436	ultracool field brown dwarf candidates selected at 4.5 microns	we have identified a sample of cool field brown dwarf candidates using iracdata from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs). the candidates wereselected from 400,000 sdwfs sources with [4.5] &lt;= 18.5 mag and required to have[3.6]-[4.5] &gt;= 1.5 and [4.5] - [8.0] &lt;= 2.0 on the vega system. the first colorrequirement selects objects redder than all but a handful of presently knownbrown dwarfs with spectral classes later than t7, while the second eliminates14 probable reddened agn. optical detection of 4 of the remaining 18 sourcesimplies they are likely also agn, leaving 14 brown dwarf candidates. for two ofthe brightest candidates (sdwfs j143524.44+335334.6 and sdwfsj143222.82+323746.5), the spectral energy distributions including near-infrareddetections suggest a spectral class of ~ t8. the proper motion is &lt; 0.25 "/yr,consistent with expectations for a luminosity inferred distance of &gt;70 pc. thereddest brown dwarf candidate (sdwfs j143356.62+351849.2) has [3.6] -[4.5]=2.24 and h - [4.5] &gt; 5.7, redder than any published brown dwarf in thesecolors, and may be the first example of the elusive y-dwarf spectral class.models from burrows et al. (2003) predict larger numbers of cool brown dwarfsshould be found for a chabrier (2003) mass function. suppressing the model[4.5] flux by a factor of two, as indicated by previous work, brings theburrows models and observations into reasonable agreement. the recentlylaunched wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) will probe a volume ~40xlarger and should find hundreds of brown dwarfs cooler than t7.

1006.2506	deep near-infrared imaging of the rho oph cloud core: clues to the  origin of the lowest-mass brown dwarfs	a search for young substellar objects in the rho oph cloud core region hasbeen made using the deep-integration combined calibration scan images of the2mass extended mission in j, h and ks bands, and spitzer irac images at 3.6,4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 microns. the field of view of the combined observations was 1deg x 9.3 arcmin, and the 5 sigma limiting magnitude at j was 20.5. comparisonof the observed seds with the predictions of the cond and dusty models, for anassumed age of 1 myr, supports the identification of many of the sources withbrown dwarfs, and enables the estimation of effective temperature, teff. thecluster members are then readily distinguishable from background stars by theirlocations on a plot of flux density versus teff. the range of estimated teffextends down to ~ 750 k, suggesting the presence of objects of sub-jupitermass. the results also suggest that the mass function for the rho oph cloudresembles that of the sigma orionis cluster based on a recent study, with bothrising towards lower masses. the other main result from our study is theapparent presence of a progressive blueward skew in the distribution of j-h andh-ks colors, such that the blue end of the range becomes increasingly bluerwith increasing magnitude. we suggest that this behavior might be understood interms of the 'ejected stellar embryo' hypothesis, whereby some of thelowest-mass brown dwarfs could escape to locations close to the front edge ofthe cloud, and thereby be seen with less extinction.

0710.1123	clouds, gravity and metallicity in blue l dwarfs: the case of 2mass  j11263991-5003550	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the newly discovered peculiar ldwarf 2mass j11263991-5003550 are presented. folkes et al. identified thissource as a high proper motion l9+/-1 dwarf based on its strong h2o absorptionat 1.4 micron. we find that the optical spectrum of 2mass j1126-5003 is in factconsistent with that of a normal l4.5 dwarf with notably enhanced fehabsorption at 9896 a. however, its near-infrared spectrum is unusually blue,with strong h2o and weak co bands similar in character to several recentlyidentified ``blue l dwarfs''. using 2mass j1126-5003 as a case study, andguided by trends in the condensate cloud models of burrows et al. and marley etal., we find that the observed spectral peculiarities of these sources can beadequately explained by the presence of thin and/or large-grained condensateclouds as compared to normal field l dwarfs. atypical surface gravities ormetallicities alone cannot reproduce the observed peculiarities, although theymay be partly responsible for the unusual condensate properties. we also ruleout unresolved multiplicity as a cause for the spectral peculiarities of 2massj1126-5003. our analysis is supported by examination of spitzer mid-infraredspectral data from cushing et al. which show that bluer l dwarfs tend to haveweaker 10 micron absorption, a feature tentatively associated with silicateoxide grains. with their unique spectral properties, blue l dwarfs like 2massj1126-5003 should prove useful in studying the formation and properties ofcondensates and condensate clouds in low temperature atmospheres.

1108.4678	the discovery of y dwarfs using data from the wide-field infrared survey  explorer (wise)	we present the discovery of seven ultracool brown dwarfs identified with thewide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). near-infrared spectroscopy revealsdeep absorption bands of h_2o and ch_4 that indicate all seven of the browndwarfs have spectral types later than ugps j072227.51-054031.2, the latest typet dwarf currently known. the spectrum of wisep j182831.08+265037.8 is distinctin that the heights of the j- and h-band peaks are approximately equal in unitsof f_lambda, so we identify it as the archetypal member of the y spectralclass. the spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorptionon the blue wing of the h-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to nh_3. thesespectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between the t dwarfsand the y dwarfs. in order to produce a smooth near-infrared spectral sequenceacross the t/y dwarf transition, we have reclassified ugps j0722-0540 as the t9spectral standard and tentatively assign wisep j173835.52+273258.9 as the y0spectral standard. in total, six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classifiedas y dwarfs: four are classified as y0, one is classified as y0 (pec?), andwisep j1828+2650 is classified as &gt;y0. we have also compared the spectra to themodel atmospheres of marley and saumon and infer that the brown dwarfs haveeffective temperatures ranging from 300 k to 500 k, making them the coldestspectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs known to date.

1211.3977	new m, l, and t dwarf companions to nearby stars from the wide-field  infrared survey explorer	we present 11 candidate late-type companions to nearby stars identified withdata from the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) and the two micronall-sky survey (2mass). eight of the candidates are likely to be companionsbased on their common proper motions with the primaries. the remaining threeobjects are rejected as companions, one of which is a free-floating t7 dwarf.spectral types are available for five of the companions, which consist of m2v,m8.5v, l5, t8, and t8. based on their photometry, the unclassified companionsare probably two mid-m dwarfs and one late-m/early-l dwarf. one of the t8companions, wise j142320.84+011638.0, has already been reported by pinfield andcoworkers. the other t8 companion, ulas j095047.28+011734.3, was discovered byburningham and coworkers through the united kingdom infrared telescope infrareddeep sky survey, but its companionship has not been previously recognized inthe literature. the l5 companion, 2mass j17430860+8526594, is a new member of aclass of l dwarfs that exhibit unusually blue near-ir colors. among thepossible mechanisms that have been previously proposed for the peculiar colorsof these l dwarfs, low metallicity does not appear to be a viable explanationfor 2mass j17430860+8526594 since our spectrum of the primary suggests that itsmetallicity is not significantly subsolar.

1211.6977	parallaxes and proper motions of ultracool brown dwarfs of spectral  types y and late t	we present astrometric measurements of eleven nearby ultracool brown dwarfsof spectral types y and late-t, based on imaging observations from a variety ofspace-based and ground-based telescopes. these measurements have been used toestimate relative parallaxes and proper motions via maximum likelihood fittingof geometric model curves. to compensate for the modest statisticalsignificance (&lt;~ 7) of our parallax measurements we have employed a novelbayesian procedure for distance estimation which makes use of an a prioridistribution of tangential velocities, vtan, assumed similar to that implied byprevious observations of t dwarfs. our estimated distances are thereforesomewhat dependent on that assumption. nevertheless, the results have yieldeddistances for five of our eight y dwarfs and all three t dwarfs. estimateddistances in all cases are &gt;~ 3 pc. in addition, we have obtained significantestimates of vtan for two of the y dwarfs; both are &lt;100 km/s, consistent withmembership in the thin disk population. comparison of absolute magnitudes withmodel predictions as a function of color shows that the y dwarfs aresignificantly redder in j-h than predicted by a cloud-free model

1301.1669	the coldest brown dwarf (or free floating planet)?: the y dwarf wise  1828+2650	we have monitored the position of the cool y dwarf wisepa j182831.08+265037.8using a combination of ground- and space-based telescopes and have determinedits distance to be 11.2$_{-1.0}^{+1.3}$ pc. its absolute h magnitude,m$_h=22.21^{+0.25}_{-0.22}$ mag, suggests a mass in the range 0.5-20 m$_{jup}$for ages of 0.1-10 gyr with an effective temperature in the range 250-400 k.the broad range in mass is due primarily to the unknown age of the object.since the high tangential velocity of the object, 51$\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, ischaracteristic of an old disk population, a plausible age range of 2-4 gyrleads to a mass range of 3-6 m$_{jup}$ based on fits to the (highly uncertain)cond evolutionary models. the range in temperature is due to the fact that nosingle model adequately represents the 1-5 $\mu$m spectral energy distribution(sed) of the source, failing by factors of up to 5 at either the short or longwavelength portions of the spectral energy distribution. the appearance of thisvery cold object may be affected by non-equilibrium chemistry or lowtemperature condensates forming clouds, two atmospheric processes that areknown to be important in brown dwarf atmospheres but have proven difficult tomodel. finally, we argue that there would have to be a very steep upturn in thenumber density of late type y-dwarfs to account for the putative population ofobjects suggested by by recent microlensing observations. whether wise1828+2650 sits at the low mass end of the brown dwarf population or is thefirst example of a large number of "free-floating" planets is not yet known.

1301.3913	a study of the diverse t dwarf population revealed by wise	we report the discovery of 87 new t dwarfs uncovered with the wide-fieldinfrared survey explorer (wise) and three brown dwarfs with extremely rednear-infrared colors that exhibit characteristics of both l and t dwarfs. twoof the new t dwarfs are likely binaries with l7+/-1 primaries and mid-type tsecondaries. in addition, our follow-up program has confirmed 10 previouslyidentified t dwarfs and four photometrically-selected l and t dwarf candidatesin the literature. this sample, along with the previous wise discoveries,triples the number of known brown dwarfs with spectral types later than t5.using the wise all-sky source catalog we present updated color-color andcolor-type diagrams for all the wise-discovered t and y dwarfs. near-infraredspectra of the new discoveries are presented, along with spectralclassifications. to accommodate later t dwarfs we have modified the integratedflux method of determining spectral indices to instead use the median flux.furthermore, a newly defined j-narrow index differentiates the early-type ydwarfs from late-type t dwarfs based on the j-band continuum slope. the k/jindices for this expanded sample show that 32% of late-type t dwarfs havesuppressed k-band flux and are blue relative to the spectral standards, whileonly 11% are redder than the standards. comparison of the y/j and k/j index tomodels suggests diverse atmospheric conditions and supports the possiblere-emergence of clouds after the l/t transition. we also discuss peculiar browndwarfs and candidates that were found not to be substellar, including two youngstellar objects and two active galactic nuclei. the coolest wise-discoveredbrown dwarfs are the closest of their type and will remain the only sample oftheir kind for many years to come.

1401.1194	wise y dwarfs as probes of the brown dwarf-exoplanet connection	we have determined astrometric positions for 15 wise-discovered late-typebrown dwarfs (6 t8-9 and 9 y dwarfs) using the keck ii telescope, the spitzerspace telescope, and the hubble space telescope. combining data from 8 to 20epochs we derive parallactic and proper motions for these objects which put themajority within 15 parsecs. for ages greater than a few gyr, as suggested fromkinematic considerations, we find masses of 10-30 m$_{jup}$ based on standardmodels for the evolution of low mass objects with a range of mass estimates forindividual objects depending on the model in question. three of the coolestobjects have effective temperatures $\sim$ 350 k and inferred masses of 10-15m$_{jup}$. our parallactic distances confirm earlier photometric estimates(kirkpatrick et al. 2012) and direct measurements (marsh et al. 2013, beichmanet al. 2013, dupuy and krauss 2013) and suggest that the number of objects withmasses below about 15 m$_{jup}$ must be flat or declining relative to highermass objects. the masses of the coldest y dwarfs may be similar to thoseinferred for recently imaged planet-mass companions to nearby young stars.objects in this mass range, which appear to be rare in both the interstellarand proto-planetary environments, may both have formed via gravitationalfragmentation: the brown dwarfs in interstellar clouds and companion objects ina protoplanetary disk. in both cases, however, the fact that objects in thismass range are relatively infrequent, suggests that this mechanism must beinefficient in both environments.

1410.0746	the luminosities of the coldest brown dwarfs	in recent years brown dwarfs have been extended to a new y-dwarf class witheffective temperatures colder than 500k and masses in the range 5-30 jupitermasses. they fill a crucial gap in observable atmospheric properties betweenthe much colder gas-giant planets of our own solar system (at around 130k) andboth hotter t-type brown dwarfs and the hotter planets that can be imagedorbiting young nearby stars (both with effective temperatures of in the range1500-1000k). distance measurements for these objects deliver absolutemagnitudes that make critical tests of our understanding of very coolatmospheres. here we report new distances for nine y dwarfs and seven very-latet dwarfs. these reveal that y dwarfs do indeed represent a continuation of thet dwarf sequence to both fainter luminosities and cooler temperatures. theyalso show that the coolest objects display a large range in absolute magnitudefor a given photometric colour. the latest atmospheric models show goodagreement with the majority of these y dwarf absolute magnitudes. this is alsothe case for wise0855-0714 the coldest and closest brown dwarf to the sun,which shows evidence for water ice clouds. however, there are also someoutstanding exceptions, which suggest either binarity or the presence ofcondensate clouds. the former is readily testable with current adaptive opticsfacilities. the latter would mean that the range of cloudiness in y dwarfs issubstantial with most hosting almost no clouds -- while others have denseclouds making them prime targets for future variability observations to studycloud dynamics.

0806.1059	discovery of two nearby, peculiar l dwarfs from the 2mass proper motion  survey: young or metal-rich?	we present the discovery of two nearby l dwarfs from our 2mass proper motionsearch, which uses multi-epoch 2mass observations covering ~4700 square degreesof sky. 2mass j18212815+1414010 and 2mass j21481628+4003593 were overlooked byearlier surveys due to their faint optical magnitudes and their proximity tothe galactic plane (10 degrees &lt; |b| &lt; 15 degrees). assuming that both dwarfsare single, we derive spectrophotometric distances of ~10 pc, thus increasingthe number of known l dwarfs within 10 pc to 10. in the near-infrared, 2massj21481628+4003593 shows a triangular-shaped h-band spectrum, strong coabsorption, and a markedly red j-ks color (2.38+/-0.06) for its l6 opticalspectral type. 2mass j18212815+1414010 also shows a triangular-shaped h-bandspectrum and a slightly red j-ks color (1.78+/-0.05) for its l4.5 opticalspectral type. both objects show strong silicate absorption at 9-11 microns.cumulatively, these features imply an unusually dusty photosphere for both ofthese objects. we examine several scenarios to explain the underlying cause fortheir enhanced dust content and find that a metal-rich atmosphere or alow-surface gravity are consistent with these results. 2mass j18212815+1414010may be young (and therefore have a low-surface gravity) based on its lowtangential velocity of 10 km/s. on the other hand, 2mass j21481628+4003593 hasa high tangential velocity of 62 km/s and is therefore likely old. hence, highmetallicity and low-surface gravity may lead to similar effects.

1512.00318	a proper motion survey using the first sky pass of neowise-reactivation  data	the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) was reactivated in december of2013 (neowise) to search for potentially hazardous near-earth objects. we haveconducted a survey using the first sky pass of neowise data and the allwisecatalog to identify nearby stars and brown dwarfs with large proper motions($\mu_{\rm total}$ $\gtrsim$ 250 mas yr$^{-1}$). a total of 20,548 high propermotion objects were identified, 1,006 of which are new discoveries. this surveyhas uncovered a significantly larger sample of fainter objects (w2 $\gtrsim$13mag) than the previous wise motion surveys of luhman (2014a) and kirkpatrick etal. (2014). many of these objects are predicted to be new l and t dwarfs basedon near- and mid-infrared colors. using estimated spectral types along withdistance estimates, we have identified several objects likely belonging to thenearby solar neighborhood (d $&lt;$ 25 pc). we have followed up 19 of these newdiscoveries with near-infrared or optical spectroscopy, focusing on potentiallynearby objects, objects with the latest predicted spectral types, and potentiallate-type subdwarfs. this subset includes 6 m dwarfs, 5 of which are likelysubdwarfs, as well as 8 l dwarfs and 5 t dwarfs, many of which have bluenear-infrared colors. as an additional supplement, we provide 2mass and allwisepositions and photometry for every object found in our search, as well as2mass/allwise calculated proper motions.

astro-ph;0003035	j-band infrared spectroscopy of a sample of brown dwarfs using nirspec  on keck ii	near-infrared spectroscopic observations of a sample of very cool, low-massobjects are presented with higher spectral resolution than in any previousstudies. six of the objects are l-dwarfs, ranging in spectral class from l2 tol8/9, and the seventh is a methane or t-dwarf. these new observations wereobtained during commissioning of nirspec, the first high-resolutionnear-infrared cryogenic spectrograph for the keck ii 10-meter telescope onmauna kea, hawaii. spectra with a resolving power of r=2500 from 1.135 to 1.360microns (approximately j-band) are presented for each source. at thisresolution, a rich spectral structure is revealed, much of which is due toblending of unresolved molecular transitions. strong lines due to neutralpotassium (k i), and bands due to iron hydride (feh) and steam (h2o) changesignificantly throughout the l sequence. iron hydride disappears between l5 andl8, the steam bands deepen and the k i lines gradually become weaker but widerdue to pressure broadening. an unidentified feature occurs at 1.22 micronswhich has a temperature dependence like feh but has no counterpart in theavailable feh opacity data. because these objects are 3-6 magnitudes brighterin the near-infrared compared to the i-band, spectral classification isefficient. one of the objects studied (2massw j1523+3014) is the coolestl-dwarf discovered so far by the 2-micron all-sky survey (2mass), but itsspectrum is still significantly different from the methane-dominated objectssuch as gl229b or sdss 1624+0029.

astro-ph;0003068	an improved red spectrum of the methane or t-dwarf sdss 1624+0029: role  of the alkali metals	a keck~ii low resolution spectrum shortward of ome-micron is presented forsdss 1624+0029, the first field methane or t dwarf discovered in the sloandigital sky survey. significant flux is detected down to the spectrum's shortwavelength limit of 6200\aa. the spectrum exhibits a broad absorption featurecentered at 7700\aa, which we interpret as the k~i 7665/7699 resonance doublet.the observed flux declines shortward of 7000\aa, due most likely to the redwing of the na~i doublet. both cs~i doublet lines are detected more stronglythan in an earlier red spectrum. neither li~i absorption nor h$\alpha$ emissionare detected. an exploratory model fit to the spectrum suggests that the shapeof the red spectrum can be primarily accounted for by the broad wings of thek~i and na~i doublets. this behavior is consistent with the argument profferedby burrows, marley and sharp that strong alkali absorption is principallyresponsible for depressing t dwarf spectra shortward of 1$\mu$m. in particular,there seems no compelling reason at this time to introduce dust or anadditional opacity source in the atmosphere of the sdss object. the width ofthe k~i and strengths of the cs~i lines also indicate that the sloan object iswarmer than gl~229b.

astro-ph;0004361	new neighbors from 2mass: activity and kinematics at the bottom of the  main sequence	we have combined 2mass and poss ii data in a search for nearby ultracool(later than m6.5) dwarfs with k_s&lt;12. spectroscopic follow-up observationsidentify 53 m7 to m9.5 dwarfs and seven l dwarfs. the observed space density is0.0045 +- 0.0008 m8-m9.5 dwarfs per cubic parsec, without accounting forbiases, consistent with a mass function that is smooth across thestellar/substellar limit. we show the observed frequency of h alpha emissionpeaks at ~100% for m7 dwarfs and then decreases for cooler dwarfs. in absoluteterms, however, as measured by the ratio of h alpha to bolometric luminosity,none of the ultracool m dwarfs can be considered very active compared toearlier m dwarfs, and we show that the decrease that begins at spectral type m6continues to the latest l dwarfs. we find that flaring is common among thecoolest m dwarfs and estimate the frequency of flares at 7% or higher. we showthat the kinematics of relatively active (ew_{h alpha}&gt;6 angstroms) ultracool mdwarfs are consistent with an ordinary old disk stellar population, while thekinematics of inactive ultracool m dwarfs are more typical of a 0.5 gyr oldpopulation. the early l dwarfs in the sample have kinematics consistent withold ages, suggesting that the hydrogen burning limit is near spectral typesl2-l4. we use the available data on m and l dwarfs to show that chromosphericactivity drops with decreasing mass and temperature, and that at a given (m8 orlater) spectral type, the younger field (brown) dwarfs are less active thanmany of the older, more massive field stellar dwarfs. thus, contrary to thewell-known stellar age-activity relationship, low activity in field ultracooldwarfs can be an indication of comparative youth and substellar mass.

astro-ph;0010202	a search for l dwarf binary systems	we present analysis of hst planetary camera images of twenty l dwarfsidentified in the course of the two micron all-sky survey. four of the targetshave faint, red companions at separations between 0.07 and 0.29 arcseconds (1.6to 7.6 au). in three cases, the bolometric magnitudes of the components differby less than 0.3 magnitudes. since the cooling rate for brown dwarfs is astrong function of mass, similarity in luminosities implies comparable masses.the faint component in the 2m0850 system, however, is over 1.3 magnitudesfainter than the primary in the i-band, and ~0.8 magnitudes fainter in m(bol).indeed, 2m0850b is ~0.8 magnitudes fainter in i than the lowest luminosity ldwarf currently known, while the absolute magnitude we deduce at j is almostidentical with m_j for gl 229b. theoretical models indicate a mass ratio of\~0.75. the mean separation of the l dwarf binaries in the current sample issmaller by a factor of two than amongst m dwarfs. we discuss the implicationsof these results for the temperature scale in the l/t transition region and forthe binary frequency amongst l dwarfs.

astro-ph;0108452	the spectra of t dwarfs i: near-infrared data and spectral  classification	we present near-infrared spectra for a sample of t dwarfs, including elevennew discoveries made using the two micron all sky survey. these objects aredistinguished from warmer (l-type) brown dwarfs by the presence of methaneabsorption bands in the 1--2.5 $\micron$ spectral region. a first attempt at anear-infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs is made, based on thestrengths of ch$_4$ and h$_2$o bands and the shapes of the 1.25, 1.6, and 2.1$\micron$ flux peaks. subtypes t1 v through t8 v are defined, and spectralindices useful for classification are presented. the subclasses appear tofollow a decreasing t$_{eff}$ scale, based on the evolution of ch$_4$ andh$_2$o bands and the properties of l and t dwarfs with known distances.however, we speculate that this scale is not linear with spectral type for cooldwarfs, due to the settling of dust layers below the photosphere and subsequentrapid evolution of spectral morphology around t$_{eff}$ $\sim$ 1300--1500 k.similarities in near-infrared colors and continuity of spectral featuressuggest that the gap between the latest l dwarfs and earliest t dwarfs has beennearly bridged. this argument is strengthened by the possible role of ch$_4$ asa minor absorber shaping the k-band spectra of the latest l dwarfs. finally, wediscuss one peculiar t dwarf, 2mass 0937+2931, which has very bluenear-infrared colors (j-k$_s$ = $-0.89\pm$0.24) due to suppression of the 2.1$\micron$ peak. the feature is likely caused by enhanced collision-inducedh$_2$ absorption in a high pressure or low metallicity photosphere.

astro-ph;0109227	theoretical spectral models of t dwarfs at short wavelengths and their  comparison with data	we have generated new, self-consistent spectral and atmosphere models for theeffective temperature range 600 k to 1300 k thought to encompass the known tdwarfs. for the first time, theoretical models are compared with a {\it family}of measured t dwarf spectra at wavelengths shortward of $\sim$1.0 micron. bydefining spectral indices and standard colors in the optical and verynear-infrared, we explore the theoretical systematics with \teff, gravity, andmetallicity. we conclude that the short- wavelength range is rich indiagnostics that complement those in the near-infrared now used for spectralsubtyping. we also conclude that the wings of the na d and k i (7700\aa)resonance lines and aggressive rainout of heavy metals (with the resultingenhancement of the sodium and potassium abundances at altitude) are required tofit the new data shortward of 1.0 \mic. furthermore, we find that the waterbands weaken with increasing gravity, that modest decreases in metallicityenhance the effect in the optical of the sodium and potassium lines, and thatat low \teffs, in a reversal of the normal pattern, optical spectra becomebluer with further decreases in \teff. moreover, we conclude that t dwarfsubtype is not a function of \teff alone, but that it is a non-trivial functionof gravity and metallicity as well. as do marley et al. (2001), we see evidencein early t dwarf atmospheres of a residual effect of clouds. with cloudlessmodels, we obtain spectral fits to the two late t dwarfs with known parallaxes,but a residual effect of clouds on the emergent spectra of even late t dwarfscan not yet be discounted.

astro-ph;0109390	near-infrared spectroscopy of brown dwarfs: methane and the transition  between the l and t spectral types	we report the possible identification of weak methane spectral features inthe near-infrared k band in two late l dwarfs, denis 0205-11 (l7) and 2mass1523+30 (l8). new, high signal-to-noise ratio flux-calibrated spectra, spanningthe wavelength interval 1.10 - 2.35 microns with an average resolving power r =1800 were obtained using nirspec on the keck ii telescope. results are reportedand compared for three late l dwarfs (l5, l7, and l8) and two t dwarfs (t1 andt6). the spectra, which are continuous through the atmospheric absorptionbands, show the development of deep steam bands and the weakening of ironhydride features through the l dwarfs and the emergence of strong methane bandsin the t dwarfs. a detailed comparison of the k band regions with syntheticspectra suggests that the weak features seen in the l7 and l8 dwarfs at 2.20microns are likely to be methane. we see no evidence for methane in the h band.at the r = 1800 resolution, significant differences are evident between thespectral signatures of the l8 and the t1, leaving room for additionaltransition objects (l9 or t0).

astro-ph;0201382	a search for variability in the active t dwarf 2mass 1237+6526	we present spectroscopic and imaging observations of the active t dwarf 2mass1237+6526, intended to investigate the emission mechanism of this cool browndwarf. the h$\alpha$ emission line first detected in 1999 july appears to bepersistent over 1.6 years, with no significant variation from$\log_{10}(l_{h{\alpha}}$/l$_{bol}$) = $-$4.3, ruling out flaring as a possiblesource. the relatively high level of emission in this object appears to beunique amongst observed late-l and t dwarfs. one of our spectra shows anapparent velocity shift in the h$\alpha$ line, which could be indicative of anaccretion hot spot in orbit around the brown dwarf; further confirmation ofthis shift is required. j-band monitoring observations fail to detect anysignificant variability (e.g., eclipsing events) at the $\pm$0.025 mag levelover periods of up to 2.5 hours, and there appears to be no statisticalevidence of variability for periods of up to 14 hours. these limits constrainthe mass of a hypothetical interacting secondary to m$_2$ $\lesssim$ 20m$_{jup}$ for inclinations $i$ $\gtrsim$ 60$\degr$. while our observations donot explicitly rule out the binary hypothesis for this object, it does suggestthat other mechanisms, such as youthful accretion, may be responsible.

0808.3153	a sample of very young field l dwarfs and implications for the brown  dwarf "lithium test" at early ages	using a large sample of optical spectra of late-type dwarfs, we identify asubset of late-m through l field dwarfs that, because of the presence oflow-gravity features in their spectra, are believed to be unusually young. froma combined sample of 303 field l dwarfs, we find observationally that7.6+/-1.6% are younger than 100 myr. this percentage is in agreement withtheoretical predictions once observing biases are taken into account. we findthat these young l dwarfs tend to fall in the southern hemisphere (dec &lt; 0 deg)and may be previously unrecognized, low-mass members of nearby, youngassociations like tucana-horologium, tw hydrae, beta pictoris, and ab doradus.we use a homogeneously observed sample of roughly one hundred and fifty6300-10000 angstrom spectra of l and t dwarfs taken with the low-resolutionimaging spectrometer at the w. m. keck observatory to examine the strength ofthe 6708-a li i line as a function of spectral type and further corroborate thetrends noted by kirkpatrick et al. (2000). we use our low-gravity spectra toinvestigate the strength of the li i line as a function of age. the data weaklysuggest that for early- to mid-l dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum fora few 100 myr, whereas for much older (few gyr) and much younger (&lt;100 myr) ldwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. we show that a weakening of lithiumat lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effectpartially corroborated by existing observational data. larger samplescontaining l dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test thisempirically. if verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited inkirkpatrick et al.

astro-ph;0312285	s ori 70: just a foreground field brown dwarf?	we examine recent claims that the t-type brown dwarf s ori 053810.1-023626 (sori 70) is a spectroscopically verified low mass (3$^{+5}_{-1}$ m$_{jup}$)member of the 1--8 myr $\sigma$ orionis cluster. comparative arguments bymart{\'{i}}n &amp; zapatero osorio asserting that s ori 70 exhibits low surfacegravity spectral features indicative of youth and low mass are invalidated bythe fact that their comparison object was not the field t dwarf 2mass0559$-$1404 but rather a nearby background star. instead, we find that the1--2.5 $\micron$ spectra of s ori 70 are well-matched to older (age $\sim$ fewgyr) field t6--t7 dwarfs. moreover, we find that spectral model fits tolate-type field t dwarf spectra tend to yield low surface gravities ($\log{g}$= 3.0--3.5), and thus young ages ($\lesssim$ 5 myr) and low masses ($\lesssim$3 m$_{jup}$), inconsistent with expected and/or empirical values. finally, weshow that the identification of one t dwarf in the field imaged by zapateroosorio et al. is statistically consistent with the expected foregroundcontamination. based on the re-examined evidence, we conclude that s ori 70 maysimply be an old, massive (30--60 m$_{jup}$) field brown dwarf lying in theforeground of the $\sigma$ orionis cluster. this interpretation should beconsidered before presuming the existence of so-called ``cluster planets.''

astro-ph;0508150	the 2mass wide-field t dwarf search. iv unting out t dwarfs with methane  imaging	we present first results from a major program of methane filter photometryfor low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. the definition of a new methane filterphotometric system is described. a recipe is provided for the differentialcalibration of methane imaging data using existing 2mass photometry. we showthat these filters are effective in discriminating t dwarfs from other types ofstars, and demonstrate this with anglo-australian telescope observations usingthe iris2 imager. methane imaging data and proper motions are presented for tent dwarfs identified as part of the 2mass "wide field t dwarf search" -- sevenof them initially identified as t dwarfs using methane imaging.  we also present near-infrared moderate resolution spectra for five t dwarfs,newly discovered by this technique. spectral types obtained from these spectraare compared to those derived from both our methane filter observations, andspectral types derived by other observers. finally, we suggest a range offuture programs to which these filters are clearly well suited: the winnowingof t dwarf and y dwarf candidate objects coming from the next generation ofnear-infrared sky surveys; the robust detection of candidate planetary-massbrown dwarfs in clusters; the detection of t dwarf companions to known l and tdwarfs via deep methane imaging; and the search for rotationally-modulatedtime-variable surface features on cool brown dwarfs.

astro-ph;0510090	a unified near infrared spectral classification scheme for t dwarfs	a revised near infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs is presented,based on and superseding prior schemes developed by burgasser et al. andgeballe et al., and defined following the precepts of the mk process. drawingfrom two large spectroscopic libraries of t dwarfs identified largely in thesloan digital sky survey and the two micron all sky survey, nine primaryspectral standards and five alternate standards spanning spectral types t0 tot8 are identified that match criteria of spectral character, brightness,absence of a resolved companion and accessibility from both northern andsouthern hemispheres. the classification of t dwarfs is formally made by thedirect comparison of near infrared spectral data of equivalent resolution tothe spectra of these standards. alternately, we have redefined five keyspectral indices measuring the strengths of the major h$_2$o and ch$_4$ bandsin the 1-2.5 micron region that may be used as a proxy to direct spectralcomparison. two methods of determining t spectral type using these indices areoutlined and yield equivalent results. these classifications are alsoequivalent to those from prior schemes, implying that no revision of existingspectral type trends is required. the one-dimensional scheme presented hereprovides a first step toward the observational characterization of the lowestluminosity brown dwarfs currently known. future extensions to incorporatespectral variations arising from differences in photospheric dust content,gravity and metallicity are briefly discussed. a compendium of all currentlyknown t dwarfs with updated classifications is presented.

astro-ph;0510707	a method for determining the physical properties of the coldest known  brown dwarfs	we present a method for measuring the physical parameters of the coldestt-type brown dwarfs using low resolution near infrared spectra. by comparingh_2o- and h_2-sensitive spectral ratios between empirical data and theoreticalatmosphere models, and calibrating these ratios to measurements for thewell-characterized 2-5 gyr companion brown dwarf gliese 570d, we deriveestimates of the effective temperatures and surface gravities for 13 mid- andlate-type field t dwarfs. we also deduce the first quantitative estimate ofsubsolar metallicity for the peculiar t dwarf 2mass 0937+2931. derivedtemperatures are consistent with prior estimates based on parallax andbolometric luminosity measurements, and examination of possible systematiceffects indicate that the results are robust. two recently discovered late-typet dwarfs, 2mass 0939-2448 and 2mass 1114-2618, both appear to be &gt;50 k coolerthan the latest-type t dwarf, 2mass 0415-0935, and are potentially the coldestand least luminous brown dwarfs currently known. we find that, in general,higher surface gravity t dwarfs have lower effective temperatures andluminosities for a given spectral type, explaining previously observed scatterin the teff/spectral type relation for these objects. masses, radii and agesare estimated for the t dwarfs in our sample using the evolutionary models ofburrows et al.; we also determine masses and radii independently for eight tdwarfs with measured luminosities. these two determinations are largelyconsistent, lending support to the validity of evolutionary models at lateages. our method is well suited to large samples of faint brown dwarfs, and canultimately be used to directly measure the substellar mass function andformation history in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0511462	discovery of a very young field l dwarf, 2mass j01415823-4633574	while following up l dwarf candidates selected photometrically from the twomicron all sky survey, we uncovered an unusual object designated 2massj01415823-4633574. its optical spectrum exhibits very strong bands of vanadiumoxide but abnormally weak absorptions by titanium oxide, potassium, and sodium.morphologically such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate betweenold, field early-l dwarfs (log(g)~5) and very late m giants (log(g)~0), leadingus to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signaturesof this l dwarf. such a low gravity can be explained only if this l dwarf ismuch lower in mass than a typical old field l dwarf of similar temperature andis still contracting to its final radius. these conditions imply a very youngage. further evidence of youth is found in the near-infrared spectrum,including a triangular-shaped h-band continuum reminiscent of young brown dwarfcandidates discovered in the orion nebula cluster. using the above informationalong with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models, ourcurrent best estimate is that this l dwarf has an age of 1-50 myr and a mass of6-25 m_jupiter. the location of 2mass 0141-4633 on the sky coupled with adistance estimate of ~35 pc and the above age estimate suggests that thisobject may be a brown dwarf member of either the 30-myr-old tucana/horologiumassociation or the ~12-myr-old beta pic moving group.

astro-ph;0603382	discovery of the coolest extreme subdwarf	we report the discovery of lehpm 2-59 as the coolest extreme m subdwarf(esdm) found to date. optical and near infrared spectroscopy demonstrate thatthis source is of later spectral type than the esdm7 apmpm 0559-2903, with thepresence of strong alkali lines (including rb i), vo absorption at 7400 a andh2o absorption at 1.4 microns. current optical classification schemes yield aspectral type of esdm8, making lehpm 2-59 one of only two ultracool esdmsknown. the substantial space velocity of this object (v_galactic ~ -180 km/s)identifies it as a halo star. spectral model fits to the optical and nearinfrared spectral data for this and four other late-type esdms indicate thatlehpm 2-59 is the coolest esdm currently known, with teff = 2800-3000 k and-1.5 &lt;~ [m/h] &lt;~ -2.0. comparison of teff determinations for m dwarfs and esdmsbased on spectral model fits from this study and the literature demonstrate adivergence in teff scales beyond spectral types m5/esdm5, as large as 600-800 kby types m8/esdm8. while this divergence is likely an artifact of theunderlying classification scheme, it may lead to systematic errors in thederived properties of intermediate metallicity subdwarfs. we comment on thefuture of ultracool subdwarf classification, and suggest several ideas foraddressing shortcomings in current (largely extrapolated) schemes.

astro-ph;0605577	hubble space telescope nicmos observations of t dwarfs: brown dwarf  multiplicity and new probes of the l/t transition	we present the results of a hubble space telescope nicmos imaging survey of22 t-type field brown dwarfs. five are resolved as binary systems with angularseparations of 0"05-0"35, and companionship is established on the basis ofcomponent f110w-f170m colors (indicative of ch4 absorption) and lowprobabilities of background contamination. prior ground-based observations show2mass 1553+1532ab to be a common proper motion binary. the properties of thesesystems - low multiplicity fraction (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected forsample selection baises), close projected separations (a = 1.8-5.0 au) andnear-unity mass ratios - are consistent with previous results for field browndwarf binaries. three of the binaries have components that span thepoorly-understood transition between l dwarfs and t dwarfs. spectraldecomposition analysis of one of these, sdss 1021-0304ab, reveals a peculiarflux reversal between its components, as its t5 secondary is ~30% brighter at1.05 and 1.27 micron than its t1 primary. this system, 2mass 0518-2828ab andsdss 1534+1615ab all demonstrate that the j-band brightening observed betweenlate-type l to mid-type t dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of this spectraltransition, albeit less pronounced than previously surmised. we also find thatthe resolved binary fraction of l7 to t3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other l andt dwarfs, an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid evolution ofbrown dwarfs through the l/t transition, perhaps driven by dynamic(nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric condensates.

astro-ph;0607537	a sensitive search for variability in late l dwarfs: the quest for  weather	we have conducted a photometric monitoring program of 3 field late-l browndwarfs looking for evidence of non-axisymmetric structure or temporalvariability in their photospheres. the observations were performed usingspitzer/irac 4.5 and 8 micron bandpasses and were designed to cover at leastone rotational period of each object. one-sigma rms (root mean squared)uncertainties of less than 3 mmag at 4.5 micron and around 9 mmag at 8 micronwere achieved. two out of the three objects studied exhibit some modulation intheir light curves at 4.5 micron - but not 8 micron - with periods of 7.4 hrand 4.6 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 10 mmag and 8 mmag. although the lackof detectable 8 micron variation suggests an instrumental origin for thedetected variations, the data may nevertheless still be consistent withintrinsic variability since the shorter wavelength irac bandpasses probe moredeeply into late l dwarf atmospheres than the longer wavelengths. a cloudfeature occupying a small percentage (1-2 %) of the visible hemisphere couldaccount for the observed amplitude of variation. if, instead, the variabilityis indeed instrumental in origin, then our non-variable l dwarfs could beeither completely covered with clouds or objects whose clouds are smaller anduniformly distributed. such scenarios would lead to very small photometricvariations. followup irac photometry at 3.6 and 5.8 micron bandpasses shoulddistinguish between the two cases. in any event, the present observationsprovide the most sensitive search to date for structure in the photospheres oflate-l dwarfs at mid-ir wavelengths, and our photometry provides stringentupper limits to the extent to which the photospheres of these transition ldwarfs are structured.

0812.0364	young l dwarfs identified in the field: a preliminary low-gravity,  optical spectral sequence from l0 to l5	we present an analysis of 23 l dwarfs whose optical spectra display unusualfeatures. twenty-one were uncovered during our search for nearby, late-typeobjects using the two micron all-sky survey while two were identified in theliterature. the unusual spectral features, notably weak feh molecularabsorption and weak na i and k i doublets, are attributable to low-gravity andindicate that these l dwarfs are young, low-mass brown dwarfs. we use thesedata to expand the spectral classification scheme for l0 to l5-type dwarfs toinclude three gravity classes. most of the low-gravity l dwarfs have southerlydeclinations and distance estimates within 60 pc. their implied youth, on-skydistribution, and distances suggest that they are members of nearby,intermediate-age (~10-100 myr), loose associations such as the beta pictorismoving group, the tucana/horologium association, and the ab doradus movinggroup. at an age of 30 myr and with effective temperatures from 1500 to 2400 k,evolutionary models predict masses of 11-30 m_jupiter for these objects. oneobject, 2m 0355+11, with j-k_s=2.52+/-0.03, is the reddest l dwarf found in thefield and its late spectral type and spectral features indicative of a very lowgravity suggest it might also be the lowest-mass field l dwarf. however, beforeages and masses can be confidently adopted for any of these low-gravity ldwarfs, additional kinematic observations are needed to confirm clustermembership.
