0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0903.1495	the extreme star formation activity of arp299 revealed by spitzer irs  spectral mapping	we present spitzer/irs spectral mapping observations of the luminous infraredgalaxy (lirg) arp299 (ic694 + ngc3690) covering the central 45arcsec ~ 9kpc.the integrated mid-ir spectrum of arp299 is similar to that of local starburstsdespite its strongly interacting nature and high infrared luminosity, l_ir ~6x10^11 lsun. this is explained because the star formation (probed by e.g. high[neiii]15.56micron/[neii]micron line ratios) is spread across at least 6-8kpc.moreover, a large fraction of this star formation is taking place in youngregions of moderate mid-ir optical depths such as the c+c' complex in theoverlap region between the two galaxies and in hii regions in the disks of thegalaxies. it is only source a, the nuclear region of ic694, that shows thetypical mid-ir characteristics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, l_ir&gt; 10^12 lsun), that is, very compact (less than 1kpc) and dust-enshrouded starformation resulting in a deep silicate feature and moderate equivalent widthsof the pahs. the nuclear region of ngc3690, known as source b1, hosts alow-luminosity agn and is surrounded by regions of star formation. although thehigh excitation [nev]14.32micron line typical of agn is not detected in b1, itsupper limit is consistent with the value expected from the x-ray luminosity.the agn emission is detected in the form of a strong hot dust component thataccounts for 80-90% of the 6micron luminosity of b1. the similarity between thearp299 integrated mid-ir spectrum and those of high-z ulirgs suggests thatarp299 may represent a local example, albeit with lower ir luminosity andpossibly higher metallicity, of the star-formation processes occurring athigh-z.

0908.0952	cosmic evolution of star formation in sdss quasar hosts since z=1	we present spitzer irs observations of a complete sample of 57 sdss type-1quasars at z~1. aromatic features at 6.2 and/or 7.7 um are detected in abouthalf of the sample and show profiles similar to those seen in normal galaxiesat both low- and high-redshift, indicating a star-formation origin for thefeatures. based on the ratio of aromatic to star-formation ir (sfir)luminosities for normal star-forming galaxies at z~1, we have constructed thesfir luminosity function (lf) of z~1 quasars. as we found earlier forlow-redshift pg quasars, these z~1 quasars show a flatter sfir lf than do z~1field galaxies, implying the quasar host galaxy population has on average ahigher sfr than the field galaxies do. as measured from their sfir lf,individual quasar hosts have on average lirg-level sfrs, which mainly arise inthe circumnuclear regions. by comparing with similar measurements oflow-redshift pg quasars, we find that the comoving sfir luminosity density inquasar hosts shows a much larger increase with redshift than that in fieldgalaxies. the behavior is consistent with pure density evolution since theaverage sfr and the average sfr/bh-accretion-rate in quasar hosts show littleevolution with redshift. for individual quasars, we have found a correlationbetween the aromatic-based sfr and the luminosity of the nuclear radiation,consistent with predictions of some theoretical models. we propose that type 1quasars reside in a distinct galaxy population that shows elliptical morphologybut that harbors a significant fraction of intermediate-age stars and isexperiencing intense circumnuclear star formation.

0909.0658	local luminous infrared galaxies: spatially resolved mid-infrared  observations with spitzer/irs	luminous infrared (ir) galaxies (lirgs) are an important cosmological classof galaxies as they are the main contributors to the co-moving star formationrate density of the universe at z=1. in this paper we present a gto spitzer irsprogram aimed to obtain spectral mapping of a sample of 14 local (d&lt;76mpc)lirgs. the data cubes map, at least, the central 20arcsec x 20arcsec to30arcsec x 30arcsec regions of the galaxies, and use all four irs modulescovering the full 5-38micron spectral range. the final goal of this project isto characterize fully the mid-ir properties of local lirgs as a first step tounderstanding their more distant counterparts. in this paper we present thefirst results of this gto program. the irs spectral mapping data allow us tobuild spectral maps of the bright mid-ir emission lines (e.g., [neii], [neiii],[siii], h_2), continuum, the 6.2 and 11.3micron pah features, and the 9.7micronsilicate feature, as well as to extract 1d spectra for regions of interest ineach galaxy. the irs data are used to obtain spatially resolved measurements ofthe extinction using the 9.7micron silicate feature, and to trace star formingregions using the neon lines and the pah features. we also investigate a numberof agn indicators, including the presence of high excitation emission lines anda strong dust continuum emission at around 6micron. we finally use theintegrated spitzer/irs spectra as templates of local lirgs. we discuss severalpossible uses for these templates, including the calibration of the starformation rate of ir-bright galaxies at high redshift. we also predict theintensities of the brightest mid-ir emission lines for lirgs as a function ofredshift, and compare them with the expected sensitivities of future space irmissions.

0910.5476	spitzer and hht observations of starless cores: masses and environments	we present spitzer observations of a sample of 12 starless cores selected tohave prominent 24 micron shadows. the spitzer images show 8 and 24 micronshadows and in some cases 70 micron shadows; these spatially resolvedabsorption features trace the densest regions of the cores. we have carried outa 12co (2-1) and 13co (2-1) mapping survey of these cores with the heinrichhertz telescope (hht). we use the shadow features to derive optical depth maps.we derive molecular masses for the cores and the surrounding environment; wefind that the 24 micron shadow masses are always greater than or equal to themolecular masses derived in the same region, a discrepancy likely caused by cofreeze--out onto dust grains. we combine this sample with two additional coresthat we studied previously to bring the total sample to 14 cores. using asimple jeans mass criterion we find that ~ 2/3 of the cores selected to haveprominent 24 micron shadows are collapsing or near collapse, a result that issupported by millimeter line observations. of this subset at least half haveindications of 70 micron shadows. all cores observed to produce absorptionfeatures at 70 micron are close to collapse. we conclude that 24 micronshadows, and even more so the 70 micron ones, are useful markers of cloud coresthat are approaching collapse.

0912.0075	a warm molecular hydrogen tail due to ram pressure stripping of a  cluster galaxy	we have discovered a remarkable warm (130-160 k) molecular hydrogen tail witha h_2 mass of approximately 4*10^7 solar masses extending 20 kpc from a clusterspiral galaxy, eso 137-001, in abell 3627. at least half of this gas is lostpermanently to the intracluster medium, as the tail extends beyond the tidalradius of the galaxy. we also detect a hot (400-550 k) component in the tailthat is approximately 1% of the mass. the large h_2 line to ir continuumluminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a majorexcitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. this discoveryconfirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, asalso indicated by its x-ray and halpha tails found previously. we estimate thegalaxy is losing its warm h_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. thetrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas andatomic gas. we predict that the galaxy will lose most of its gas in a singlepass through the core and place a strong upper limit on the ram-pressuretimescale of 1 gyr. we also study the star-forming properties of the galaxy andits tail. we identify most of the previously discovered external halpha sourceswithin the tail in our 8 um data but not in our 3.6 um data; irs spectroscopyof the region containing these halpha sources also reveals aromatic featurestypically associated with star formation. from the positions of these hiiregions, it appears that star formation is not occurring throughout themolecular hydrogen tail but only immediately downstream of the galaxy. some ofthese hii regions lie outside the tidal radius of the galaxy, indicating thatram-pressure stripping can be a source of intracluster stars.

1004.1364	local luminous infrared galaxies. i. spatially resolved observations  with spitzer/irs	we present results from the spitzer/irs spectral mapping observations of 15local luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). in this paper we investigate thespatial variations of the mid-ir emission which includes: fine structure lines,molecular hydrogen lines, polycyclic aromatic features (pahs), continuumemission and the 9.7um silicate feature. we also compare the nuclear andintegrated spectra. we find that the star formation takes place in extendedregions (several kpc) as probed by the pah emission as well as the [neii] and[neiii] emissions. the behavior of the integrated pah emission and 9.7umsilicate feature is similar to that of local starburst galaxies. we also findthat the minima of the [neiii]/[neii] ratio tends to be located at the nucleiand its value is lower than that of hii regions in our lirgs and nearbygalaxies. it is likely that increased densities in the nuclei of lirgs areresponsible for the smaller nuclear [neiii]/[neii] ratios. this includes thepossibility that some of the most massive stars in the nuclei are stillembedded in ultracompact hii regions. in a large fraction of our sample the11.3um pah emission appears more extended than the dust 5.5um continuumemission. we find a dependency of the 11.3um pah/7.7 um pah and [neii]/11.3umpah ratios with the age of the stellar populations. smaller and larger ratiosrespectively indicate recent star formation. the estimated warm (300 k &lt; t &lt;1000 k) molecular hydrogen masses are of the order of 10^8 m_sun, which aresimilar to those found in ulirgs, local starbursts and seyfert galaxies.finally we find that the [neii] velocity fields for most of the lirgs in oursample are compatible with a rotating disk at ~kpc scales, and they are in agood agreement with h-alpha velocity fields.

1004.2077	unobscured type 2 agns	type 2 agns with intrinsically weak broad emission lines (bels) would beexceptions to the unified model. after examining a number of proposedcandidates critically, we find that the sample is contaminated significantly byobjects with bels of strengths indicating that they actually containintermediate-type agns, plus a few compton-thick sources as revealed byextremely low ratios of x-ray to nuclear ir luminosities. we developquantitative metrics that show two (ngc 3147 and ngc 4594) of the remainingcandidates to have bels 2-3 orders of magnitude weaker than those of typicaltype-1 agns. several more galaxies remain as candidates to have anomalouslyweak bels, but this status cannot be confirmed with the existing information.although the parent sample is poorly defined, the two confirmed objects arewell under 1% of its total number of members, showing that the absence of a belis possible, but very uncommon in agn. we evaluate these two objects in detailusing multi-wavelength measurements. they have little x-ray extinction with n_h&lt; 10^21 cm^{-2}. their ir spectra show strong silicate emission (ngc 4594) orweak aromatic features on a generally power law continuum with a suggestion ofsilicates in emission (ngc 3147). no polarized bel is detected in ngc 3147.these results indicate that the two unobscured type-2 objects havecircumnuclear tori that are approximately face-on. combined with their x-rayand optical/uv properties, this behavior implies that we have an unobscuredview of the nuclei and thus that they have intrinsically weak bels. we comparetheir properties with those of the other less-extreme candidates. we thencompare the distributions of bolometric luminosities and accretion rates ofthese objects with theoretical models that predict weak bels.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

1009.2752	the effect of active galactic nuclei on the mid-infrared aromatic  features	we present spitzer measurements of the aromatic (also known as pah) featuresfor 35 seyfert galaxies from the revised shapley-ames sample and find that therelative strengths of the features differ significantly from those observed instar-forming galaxies. specifically, the features at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micronare suppressed relative to the 11.3 micron feature in seyferts. furthermore, wefind an anti-correlation between the l(7.7 micron)/l(11.3 micron) ratio and thestrength of the rotational h2 (molecular hydrogen) emission, which tracesshocked gas. this suggests that shocks suppress the short-wavelength featuresby modifying the structure of the aromatic molecules or destroying the smallestgrains. most seyfert nuclei fall on the relationship between aromatic emissionand [ne ii] emission for star-forming galaxies, indicating that aromatic-basedestimates of the star-formation rate in agn host galaxies are generallyreasonable. for the outliers from this relationship, which have small l(7.7micron)/l(11.3 micron) ratios and strong h2 emission, the 11.3 micron featurestill provides a valid measure of the star-formation rate.

1010.0675	morphology and size differences between local &amp; high redshift luminous  infrared galaxies	we show that the star-forming regions in high-redshift luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) and submillimeter galaxies(smgs) have similar physical scales to those in local normal star-forminggalaxies. to first order, their higher infrared (ir) luminosities result fromhigher luminosity surface density. we also find a good correlation between their luminosity and ir luminosity surface density in starburst galaxies acrossover five orders of magnitude of ir luminosity from local normal galaxies to z~ 2 smgs. the intensely star-forming regions of local ulirgs are significantlysmaller than those in their high-redshift counterparts and hence divergesignificantly from this correlation, indicating that the ulirgs found locallyare a different population from the high-redshift ulirgs and smgs. based onthis relationship, we suggest that luminosity surface density should serve as amore accurate indicator for the ir emitting environment, and hence theobservable properties, of star-forming galaxies than their ir luminosity. wedemonstrate this approach by showing that ulirgs at z ~ 1 and a lensed galaxyat z ~ 2.5 exhibit aromatic features agreeing with local lirgs that are anorder of magnitude less luminous, but have similar ir luminosity surfacedensity. a consequence of this relationship is that the aromatic emissionstrength in star-forming galaxies will appear to increase at z &gt; 1 for a givenir luminosity compared to their local counterparts.

1106.3565	the relationship between black hole growth and star formation in seyfert  galaxies	we present estimates of black hole accretion rates and nuclear, extended, andtotal star-formation rates for a complete sample of seyfert galaxies. usingdata from the spitzer space telescope, we measure the active galactic nucleus(agn) luminosity using the [o iv] 25.89 micron emission line and thestar-forming luminosity using the 11.3 micron aromatic feature and extended 24micron continuum emission. we find that black hole growth is stronglycorrelated with nuclear (r&lt;1 kpc) star formation, but only weakly correlatedwith extended (r&gt;1 kpc) star formation in the host galaxy. in particular, thenuclear star-formation rate (sfr) traced by the 11.3 micron aromatic featurefollows a relationship with the black hole accretion rate (bhar) of the formsfr\proptobhar^0.8, with an observed scatter of 0.5 dex. this sfr-bharrelationship persists when additional star formation in physically matched r=1kpc apertures is included, taking the form sfr\proptobhar^0.6. however, therelationship becomes almost indiscernible when total sfrs are considered. thissuggests a physical connection between the gas on sub-kpc and sub-pc scales inlocal seyfert galaxies that is not related to external processes in the hostgalaxy. it also suggests that the observed scaling between star formation andblack hole growth for samples of agns will depend on whether the star formationis dominated by a nuclear or extended component. we estimate the integratedblack hole and bulge growth that occurs in these galaxies and find that an agnduty cycle of 5-10% would maintain the ratio between black hole and bulgemasses seen in the local universe.

1109.0921	the x-ray emission of local luminous infrared galaxies	we study the x-ray emission of a representative sample of 27 local luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs). the median ir luminosity of our sample is logl_ir/l_sun = 11.2, thus the low-luminosity end of the lirg class is wellrepresented. we used new xmm-newton data as well as chandra and xmm-newtonarchive data. the soft x-ray (0.5-2 kev) emission of most of the galaxies(&gt;80%), including lirgs hosting a seyfert 2 nucleus, is dominated bystar-formation related processes. these lirgs follow the star-formation rate(sfr) versus soft x-ray luminosity correlation observed in local starbursts. wefind that ~15% of the non-seyfert lirgs (3 out of 20) have an excess hard x-rayemission relative to that expected from star-formation that might indicate thepresence of an obscured agn. the rest of the non-seyfert lirgs follow the sfrversus hard x-ray (2-10 kev) luminosity correlation of local starbursts. thenon-detection of the 6.4 kev fe k alpha emission line in the non-seyfert lirgsallows us to put an upper limit to the bolometric luminosity of an obscuredagn, l_bol &lt;1043 erg s-1 . that is, in these galaxies, if they hosted a lowluminosity agn, its contribution to total luminosity would be less than 10%.finally we estimate that the agn contribution to the total luminosity for oursample of local lirgs is between 7% and 10%.

1109.1372	local luminous infrared galaxies. ii. agn activity from spitzer/irs  spectra	we quantify the active galactic nucleus (agn) contribution to themid-infrared (mid-ir) and the total infrared (ir, 8-1000micron) emission in acomplete volume-limited sample of 53 local luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs).we decompose the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) low-resolution 5-38micronspectra of the lirgs into agn and starburst components using clumpy torusmodels and star-forming galaxy templates, respectively. we find that 50%(25/50) of local lirgs have an agn component detected with this method. thereis good agreement between these agn detections through mid-ir spectraldecomposition and other agn indicators, such as the optical spectral class,mid-ir spectral features and x-ray properties. taking all the agn indicatorstogether, the agn detection rate in the individual nuclei of lirgs is ~62%. thederived agn bolometric luminosities are in the range l_bol(agn)=0.4 -50x10^{43}erg/s. the agn bolometric contribution to the ir luminosities of the galaxiesis generally small, with 70% of lirgs having l_bol(agn)/l_ir&lt;0.05. only ~8% oflocal lirgs have a significant agn bolometric contribution l_bol(agn)/l_ir &gt;0.25. from the comparison of our results with literature results ofultraluminous infrared galaxies, we confirm that in the local universe the agnbolometric contribution to the ir luminosity increases with the ir luminosityof the galaxy/system. if we add up the agn bolometric luminosities we find thatagns only account for 5%^{+8%}_{-3%} of the total ir luminosity produced bylocal lirgs (with and without agn detections). this proves that the bulk of their luminosity of local lirgs is due to star formation activity. taking thenewly determined ir luminosity density of lirgs in the local universe, we thenestimate an agn ir luminosity density of omega_ir(agn) = 3x10^5 l_sun mpc^{-3}$in lirgs.

1111.0296	modeling collisional cascades in debris disks: steep dust-size  distributions	we explore the evolution of the mass distribution of dust incollision-dominated debris disks, using the collisional code introduced in ourprevious paper. we analyze the equilibrium distribution and its dependence onmodel parameters by evolving over 100 models to 10 gyr. with our numericalmodels, we confirm that systems reach collisional equilibrium with a massdistribution that is steeper than the traditional solution by dohnanyi (1969).our model yields a quasi steady-state slope of n(m) ~ m^{-1.88} [n(a) ~a^{-3.65}] as a robust solution for a wide range of possible model parameters.we also show that a simple power-law function can be an appropriateapproximation for the mass distribution of particles in certain regimes. thesteeper solution has observable effects in the submillimeter and millimeterwavelength regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. we assemble data for ninedebris disks that have been observed at these wavelengths and, using asimplified absorption efficiency model, show that the predicted slope of theparticle mass distribution generates seds that are in agreement with theobserved ones.

1205.1040	variability of the infrared excess of extreme debris disks	debris disks with extremely large infrared excesses (fractional luminosities$&gt; 10^{-2}$) are rare. those with ages between 30 and 130 myr are of interestbecause their evolution has progressed well beyond that of protoplanetary disks(which dissipate with a timescale of order 3 myr), yet they represent a periodwhen dynamical models suggest that terrestrial planet building may still beprogressing through large, violent collisions that could yield large amounts ofdebris and large infrared excesses. for example, our moon was formed through aviolent collision of two large proto-planets during this age range. we reporttwo disks around the solar-like stars id8 and hd 23514 in this age range wherethe 24 {\mu}m infrared excesses vary on timescales of a few years, even thoughthe stars are not variable in the optical. variations this rapid are difficultto understand if the debris is produced by collisional cascades, as it is formost debris disks. it is possible that the debris in these two systems arisesin part from condensates from silicate-rich vapor produced in a series ofviolent collisions among relatively large bodies. if their evolution is rapid,the rate of detection of extreme excesses would indicate that major collisionsmay be relatively common in this age range.

1210.0547	resolved debris discs around a stars in the herschel debris survey	the majority of debris discs discovered so far have only been detectedthrough infrared excess emission above stellar photospheres. while discproperties can be inferred from unresolved photometry alone under variousassumptions for the physical properties of dust grains, there is a degeneracybetween disc radius and dust temperature that depends on the grain sizedistribution and optical properties. by resolving the disc we can measure theactual location of the dust. the launch of herschel, with an angular resolutionsuperior to previous far-infrared telescopes, allows us to spatially resolvemore discs and locate the dust directly. here we present the nine resolveddiscs around a stars between 20 and 40 pc observed by the debris survey. we usethese data to investigate the disc radii by fitting narrow ring models toimages at 70, 100 and 160 {\mu}m and by fitting blackbodies to full spectralenergy distributions. we do this with the aim of finding an improved way ofestimating disc radii for unresolved systems. the ratio between the resolvedand blackbody radii varies between 1 and 2.5. this ratio is inverselycorrelated with luminosity and any remaining discrepancies are most likelyexplained by differences to the minimum size of grain in the size distributionor differences in composition. we find that three of the systems are well fitby a narrow ring, two systems are borderline cases and the other four likelyrequire wider or multiple rings to fully explain the observations, reflectingthe diversity of planetary systems.

1211.1415	the collisional evolution of debris disks	we explore the collisional decay of disk mass and infrared emission in debrisdisks. with models, we show that the rate of the decay varies throughout theevolution of the disks, increasing its rate up to a certain point, which isfollowed by a leveling off to a slower value. the total disk mass falls off ~t^-0.35 at its fastest point (where t is time) for our reference model, whilethe dust mass and its proxy -- the infrared excess emission -- fadessignificantly faster (~ t^-0.8). these later level off to a decay rate ofm_tot(t) ~ t^-0.08 and m_dust(t) or l_ir(t) ~ t^-0.6. this is slower than the ~t^-1 decay given for all three system parameters by traditional analyticmodels.  we also compile an extensive catalog of spitzer and herschel 24, 70, and 100micron observations. assuming a log-normal distribution of initial disk masses,we generate model population decay curves for the fraction of debris diskharboring stars observed at 24 micron and also model the distribution ofmeasured excesses at the far-ir wavelengths (70-100 micron) at certain ageregimes. we show general agreement at 24 micron between the decay of ournumerical collisional population synthesis model and observations up to a gyr.we associate offsets above a gyr to stochastic events in a few select systems.we cannot fit the decay in the far infrared convincingly with grain strengthproperties appropriate for silicates, but those of water ice give fits moreconsistent with the observations.

1212.1450	the debris disk around gamma doradus resolved with herschel	we present observations of the debris disk around gamma doradus, an f1v star,from the herschel key programme debris (disc emission via bias-freereconnaissance in the infrared/submillimetre). the disk is well-resolved at 70,100 and 160 micron, resolved along its major axis at 250 micron, detected butnot resolved at 350 micron, and confused with a background source at 500micron. it is one of our best resolved targets and we find it to have aradially broad dust distribution. the modelling of the resolved images cannotdistinguish between two configurations: an arrangement of a warm inner ring atseveral au (best-fit 4 au) and a cool outer belt extending from ~55 to 400 auor an arrangement of two cool, narrow rings at ~70 au and ~190 au. thissuggests that any configuration between these two is also possible. both modelshave a total fractional luminosity of ~10^{-5} and are consistent with the diskbeing aligned with the stellar equator. the inner edge of either possibleconfiguration suggests that the most likely region to find planets in thissystem would be within ~55 au of the star. a transient event is not needed toexplain the warm dust's fractional luminosity.

1301.4015	local luminous infrared galaxies. iii. co-evolution of black hole growth  and star formation activity?	local luminous infrared (ir) galaxies (lirgs) have both high star formationrates (sfr) and a high agn (seyfert and agn/starburst composite) incidence.therefore, they are ideal candidates to explore the co-evolution of black hole(bh) growth and star formation (sf) activity, not necessarily associated withmajor mergers. here, we use spitzer/irs spectroscopy of a completevolume-limited sample of local lirgs (distances of &lt;78mpc). we estimate typicalbh masses of 3x10^7 m_sun using [neiii]15.56micron and optical [oiii]5007a gasvelocity dispersions and literature stellar velocity dispersions. we find thatin a large fraction of local lirgs the current sfr is taking place not only inthe inner nuclear ~1.5kpc region, as estimated from the nuclear 11.3micron pahluminosities, but also in the host galaxy. we next use the ratios between thesfrs and bh accretion rates (bhar) to study whether the sf activity and bhgrowth are contemporaneous in local lirgs. on average, local lirgs have sfr tobhar ratios higher than those of optically selected seyferts of similar agnluminosities. however, the majority of the ir-bright galaxies in the rsaseyfert sample behave like local lirgs. moreover, the agn incidence tends to behigher in local lirgs with the lowest sfrs. all this suggests that in locallirgs there is a distinct ir-bright star forming phase taking place prior tothe bulk of the current bh growth (i.e., agn phase). the latter is reflectedfirst as a composite and then as a seyfert, and later as a non-lirg opticallyidentified seyfert nucleus with moderate sf in its host galaxy.

1307.1735	signpost of multiple planets in debris disks	we review the nearby debris disk structures revealed by multi-wavelengthimages from spitzer and herschel, and complemented with detailed spectralenergy distribution modeling. similar to the definition of habitable zonesaround stars, debris disk structures should be identified and characterized interms of dust temperatures rather than physical distances so that the heatingpower of different spectral type of stars is taken into account and commonfeatures in disks can be discussed and compared directly. common features, suchas warm (~150 k) dust belts near the water-ice line and cold (~50 k)kuiper-belt analogs, give rise to our emerging understanding of the levels oforder in debris disk structures and illuminate various processes about theformation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. in light of the diskstructures in the debris disk twins (vega and fomalhaut), and the currentlimits on the masses of planetary objects, we suggest that the large gapbetween the warm and cold dust belts is the best signpost for multiple(low-mass) planets beyond the water-ice line.

1308.2223	a trend between cold debris disk temperature and stellar type:  implications for the formation and evolution of wide-orbit planets	cold debris disks trace the limits of planet formation or migration in theouter regions of planetary systems, and thus have the potential to answer manyof the outstanding questions in wide-orbit planet formation and evolution. wecharacterized the infrared excess spectral energy distributions of 174 colddebris disks around 546 main-sequence stars observed by both spitzer irs andmips. we found a trend between the temperature of the inner edges of colddebris disks and the stellar type of the stars they orbit. this argues againstthe importance of strictly temperature-dependent processes (e.g. non-water icelines) in setting the dimensions of cold debris disks. also, we found noevidence that delayed stirring causes the trend. the trend may result fromoutward planet migration that traces the extent of the primordialprotoplanetary disk, or it may result from planet formation that halts at anorbital radius limited by the efficiency of core accretion.

1407.7547	probing the terrestrial regions of planetary systems: warm debris disks  with emission features	observations of debris disks allow for the study of planetary systems, evenwhere planets have not been detected. however, debris disks are often onlycharacterized by unresolved infrared excesses that resemble featurelessblackbodies, and the location of the emitting dust is uncertain due to adegeneracy with the dust grain properties. here we characterize the spitzer irsspectra of 22 debris disks exhibiting 10 micron silicate emission features.such features arise from small warm dust grains, and their presence cansignificantly constrain the orbital location of the emitting debris. we findthat these features can be explained by the presence of an additional dustcomponent in the terrestrial zones of the planetary systems, i.e. anexozodiacal belt. aside from possessing exozodiacal dust, these debris disksare not particularly unique; their minimum grain sizes are consistent with theblowout sizes of their systems, and their brightnesses are comparable to thoseof featureless warm debris disks. these disks are in systems with a range ofages, although the older systems with features are found only around a-typestars. the features in young systems may be signatures of terrestrial planetformation. analyzing the spectra of unresolved debris disks with emissionfeatures may be one of the simplest and most accessible ways to study theterrestrial regions of planetary systems.

1410.0688	tracing ram-pressure stripping with warm molecular hydrogen emission	we use the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) to study four infallingcluster galaxies with signatures of on-going ram-pressure stripping. h$_2$emission is detected in all four; two show extraplanar h$_2$ emission. theemission usually has a warm (t $\sim$ $115 - 160$k) and a hot (t $\sim$ 400 $-$600k) component that is approximately two orders of magnitude less massive thanthe warm one. the warm component column densities are typically $10^{19} -10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ with masses of $10^6 - 10^8 m_\odot$. the warm h$_2$ isanomalously bright compared with normal star-forming galaxies and therefore maybe excited by ram-pressure. in the case of cgcg 97-073, the h$_2$ is offsetfrom the majority of star formation along the direction of the galaxy's motionin the cluster, suggesting it is forming in the ram-pressure wake of thegalaxy. another galaxy, ngc 4522, exhibits a warm h$_2$ tail approximately 4kpc in length. these results support the hypothesis that h$_2$ within thesegalaxies is shock-heated from the interaction with the intracluster medium.stripping of dust is also a common feature of the galaxies. for ngc 4522, wherethe distribution of dust at 8 $\mu$m is well resolved, knots and ripplesdemonstrate the turbulent nature of the stripping process. the h$\alpha$ and 24$\mu$m luminosities show that most of the galaxies have star formation ratescomparable to similar mass counterparts in the field. finally, we suggest apossible evolutionary sequence primarily related to the strength ofram-pressure a galaxy experiences to explain the varied results observed in oursample.

1412.0675	exo-zodi modelling for the large binocular telescope interferometer	habitable zone dust levels are a key unknown that must be understood toensure the success of future space missions to image earth analogues aroundnearby stars. current detection limits are several orders of magnitude abovethe level of the solar system's zodiacal cloud, so characterisation of thebrightness distribution of exo-zodi down to much fainter levels is needed. tothis end, the large binocular telescope interferometer (lbti) will detectthermal emission from habitable zone exo-zodi a few times brighter than solarsystem levels. here we present a modelling framework for interpreting lbtiobservations, which yields dust levels from detections and upper limits thatare then converted into predictions and upper limits for the scattered lightsurface brightness. we apply this model to the hosts survey sample of nearbystars; assuming a null depth uncertainty of 10$^{-4}$ the lbti will besensitive to dust a few times above the solar system level around sun-likestars, and to even lower dust levels for more massive stars.

0804.3223	the behavior of the aromatic features in m101 hii regions: evidence for  dust processing	the aromatic features in m101 were studied spectroscopically andphotometrically using observations from all three instruments on the spitzerspace telescope. the global sed of m101 shows strong aromatic feature (commonlycalled pah feature) emission. the spatially resolved spectral and photometricmeasurements of the aromatic feature emission show strong variations withsignificantly weaker emission at larger radii. we compare these variations withchanges in the ionization index (as measured by [neiii]/[neii] and [siv/siii],which we probe over the ranges 0.03-20 and 0.044-15 respectively) andmetallicity (expressed as log(o/h)+12, which ranges from 8.1 to 8.8). overthese ranges, the spectroscopic equivalent widths of the aromatic features from7 hii regions and the nucleus were found to correlate better with ionizationindex than with metallicity. this implies that the weakening of the aromaticemission in massive star forming regions is due primarily to processing of thedust grains in these environments, not to differences in how they form(although formation could still be important on a secondary basis). thebehavior of the correlation between the aromatic feature equivalent widths andionization index can be described as a constant equivalent width until athreshold in ionization index is reached ([neiii]/[neii] ~ 1), above which theequivalent widths decrease with a power law dependence. this behavior for m101hii regions is also seen for the sample of starburst galaxies presented in thecompanion study of engelbracht et al. (2008) which expands the range of[neiii]/[neii] ratios to 0.03-25 and log(o/h)+12 values to 7.1-8.8. the form ofthe correlation explains seemingly contradictory results present in theliterature.

astro-ph;0212142	the [feii]1.644micron emission in m82 and ngc253: is it a measure of the  supernova rate?	we present hst/nicmos [feii]1.644micron, pa-alpha (1.87micron) and continuumimages of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253 at an unprecedented spatialresolution. in both galaxies we detect [feii] compact sources superimposed on adiffuse background in the disk of the galaxies together with a component aboveand below the plane of the galaxy. the radio and [feii] emissions perpendicularto the disk of m82 show a remarkable similarity to each other, suggesting thatboth emissions originate in shocks from supernova explosions. we find a spatialcorrespondence between bright compact [feii] emitting regions and the locationof radio supernova remnants (snr) for approximately 30-50% of radio snrs in m82and ngc253. this lack of a one-to-one correspondence, more than beingindicative of a different origin for the radio and [feii] emission instarbursts, suggests two populations of snrs: an older population(&lt;10^4yr)traced by the [feii] emission and a younger population (a few hundred yearsold) traced by the radio snrs. we therefore conclude that the [feii] emissionin starburst galaxies provides a good estimate of the supernova activity. usingour newly determined [feii] luminosities (corrected for extinction) of m82 andngc253, we reevaluate the calibration of the supernova rate in terms of the[feii] luminosity for starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0303617	spectral energy distributions of seyfert nuclei	we present nuclear spectral energy distributions (seds) in the range0.4-16micron for an expanded cfa sample of seyfert galaxies. the spectralindices from 1-16micron range from alpha_ir 0.9 to 3.8. the shapes of thespectra are correlated with seyfert type in the sense that steeper nuclear seds(nu*f_nu increasing with increasing wavelength) tend to be found in seyfert 2sand flatter seds (nu *f_nu constant) in seyfert 1-1.5s. the galaxies opticallyclassified as seyferts 1.8s and 1.9s display values of alpha_ir as in type 1objects, or values intermediate between those of seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s. theintermediate seds of many seyfert 1.8-1.9s may be consistent with the presenceof a pure seyfert 1 viewed through a moderate amount (a_v &lt;5mag) of foregroundgalaxy extinction. we find, however, that between 10 and 20% of galaxies withbroad optical line components have steep infrared seds.  torus models usually adopt high equatorial opacities to reproduce theinfrared properties of seyfert 1s and 2s, resulting in a dichotomy of infraredseds (flat for type 1s, and steep for type 2s). such a dichotomy, however, isnot observed in our sample. the wide range of spectral indices observed in thetype 2 objects, the lack of extremely steep seds, and the large numbers ofobjects with intermediate spectral indices cannot be reconciled withpredictions from existing optically thick torus models. we discuss possiblemodifications to improve torus models, including low optical depth tori, clumpydusty tori, and high-optical-depth tori with an extended optically thincomponent.

astro-ph;0305147	gravity indicators in the near-infrared spectra of brown dwarfs	we investigate the sensitivity to temperature and gravity of the strongabsorption features in the j- and k-band spectra of substellar objects. wecompare the spectra of giants and young m dwarfs (of low gravity) to field mand l dwarfs (of high gravity) and to model spectra from the lyon group. wefind that low-resolution spectra of m4 - m9 stars and young brown dwarfs at r ~350 and s/n &gt; 70 can determine the spectral type to a precision of pm 1subtype, using the h2o and co bands, and can measure the surface gravity to pm0.5 dex, using the atomic lines of ki and nai. this result points toward thedevelopment of photometric spectral indices to separate low-mass members fromforeground and background objects in young clusters and associations. we alsoemphasize the complexity of the interpretation of the empirical quantities(e.g., spectral types) in terms of the physical variables (e.g., temperature,opacities) in the cool atmospheres of young brown dwarfs.

astro-ph;0405093	obscured star formation in the central region of the dwarf galaxy  ngc5253	we present hst/nicmos observations (1.1-2.2micron) and 1.9-4.1micronspectroscopy of the central region of the dwarf galaxy ngc5253. the hst/nicmosobservations reveal the presence of a nuclear double star cluster separated by0.3-0.4arcsec or 6-8pc (for a distance d=4.1mpc). the double star cluster, alsoa bright double source of pa-alpha emission, appears to be coincident with thedouble radio nebula detected at 1.3cm. the eastern near-infrared star cluster(c1) is identified with the youngest optical cluster, whereas the western starcluster (c2), although it is almost completely obscured in the optical, becomesthe brightest star cluster in the central region of ngc 5253 at wavelengthslonger than 2micron. both clusters are extremely young with ages ofapproximately 3.5 million years old. c2 is more massive than c1 by a factor of6 to 20 (m(c2)= 7.7 x 10^5 - 2.6 x 10^6msun, for a salpeter imf in the massrange 0.1-100msun). analysis of the circumnuclear spectrum excluding c1 and c2,as well as of a number of other near-infrared selected clusters with a range of(young) ages, suggests that the star formation was triggered across the centralregions of the galaxy. we have also modelled the nuclear uv to mid-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) of ngc5253 and found that the infrared partis well modelled with a highly obscured (a_v= 17mag) young starburst with astellar mass consistent with our photometric estimates for c1 and c2. the sedmodel predicts a moderately bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)feature at 3.3micron that is not detected in our nuclear l-band spectrum.ngc5253's low metallicity and a top-heavy imf likely combine to suppress the3.3micron pah emission that is commonly seen in more massive starburst systems.

astro-ph;0502246	towards an understanding of the rapid decline of the cosmic star  formation rate	we present a first analysis of deep 24 micron observations with the spitzerspace telescope of a sample of nearly 1500 galaxies in a thin redshift slice,0.65&lt;z&lt;0.75. we combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frameluminosities, and colors from combo-17, and with morphologies from hubble spacetelescope images collected by the gems and goods projects. to characterize thedecline in star-formation rate (sfr) since z~0.7, we estimate the total thermalinfrared (ir) luminosities, sfrs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in thissample. at z~0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate and high-mass galaxies (withstellar masses &gt;2x10^10 solar masses) are undergoing a period of intense starformation above their past-averaged sfr. in contrast, less than 1% ofequally-massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense starformation activity. morphologically-undisturbed galaxies dominate the totalinfrared luminosity density and sfr density: at z~0.7, more than half of theintensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than\~30% are strongly interacting. thus, a decline in major-merger rate is not theunderlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic sfr since z~0.7. physicalproperties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology - for example, gasconsumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies - appear to beresponsible.

astro-ph;0505101	spitzer view on the evolution of star-forming galaxies from z=0 to z~3	we use a 24 micron selected sample containing more than 8,000 sources tostudy the evolution of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range from z=0 toz~3. we obtain photometric redshifts for most of the sources in our surveyusing a method based on empirically-built templates spanning from ultravioletto mid-infrared wavelengths. the accuracy of these redshifts is better than 10%for 80% of the sample. the derived redshift distribution of the sourcesdetected by our survey peaks at around z=0.6-1.0 (the location of the peakbeing affected by cosmic variance), and decays monotonically from z~1 to z~3.we have fitted infrared luminosity functions in several redshift bins in therange 0&lt;z&lt;~3. our results constrain the density and/or luminosity evolution ofinfrared-bright star-forming galaxies. the typical infrared luminosity (l*)decreases by an order of magnitude from z~2 to the present. the cosmic starformation rate (sfr) density goes as (1+z)^{4.0\pm0.2} from z=0 to z=0.8. fromz=0.8 to z~1.2, the sfr density continues rising with a smaller slope. at1.2&lt;z&lt;3, the cosmic sfr density remains roughly constant. the sfr density isdominated at low redshift (z&lt;0.5) by galaxies which are not very luminous inthe infrared (l_tir&lt;1.e11 l_sun, where l_tir is the total infrared luminosity,integrated from 8 to 1000 micron). the contribution from luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies (l_tir&gt;1.e11 l_sun) to the total sfr densityincreases steadily from z~0 up to z~2.5, forming at least half of thenewly-born stars by z~1.5. ultraluminous infrared galaxies (l_tir&gt;1.e12 l_sun)play a rapidly increasing role for z&gt;~1.3.

astro-ph;0512069	infrared luminosity function of the coma cluster	using mid-ir and optical data, we deduce the total infrared (ir) luminositiesof galaxies in the coma cluster and present their infrared luminosity function(lf). the shape of the overall coma ir lf does not show significant differencesfrom the ir lfs of the general field, which indicates the general independenceof global galaxy star formation on environment up to densities $\sim$ 40 timesgreater than in the field (we cannot test such independence above $l_{ir}\approx 10^{44} {\rm ergs s}^{-1}$). however, a shallower faint end slope and asmaller $l_{ir}^{*}$ are found in the core region (where the densities arestill higher) compared to the outskirt region of the cluster, and most of thebrightest ir galaxies are found outside of the core region. the ir lf in thengc 4839 group region does not show any unique characteristics. by integratingthe ir lf, we find a total star formation rate in the cluster of about 97.0$m_{\sun}{\rm yr}^{-1}$. we also studied the contributions of early- andlate-type galaxies to the ir lf. the late-type galaxies dominate the bright endof the lf, and the early-type galaxies, although only making up a small portion($\approx$ 15%) of the total ir emission of the cluster, contribute greatly tothe number counts of the lf at $l_{ir} &lt; 10^{43} {\rm ergs s}^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0604286	dynamical masses in luminous infrared galaxies	we have studied the dynamics and masses of a sample of ten nearby luminousand ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs), using 2.3 micron coabsorption line spectroscopy and near-infrared h- and ks-band imaging. bycombining velocity dispersions derived from the spectroscopy, diskscale-lengths obtained from the imaging, and a set of likely model densityprofiles, we calculate dynamical masses for each lirg. for the majority of thesample, it is difficult to reconcile our mass estimates with the large amountsof gas derived from millimeter observations and from a standard conversionbetween co emission and h_2 mass. our results imply that lirgs do not have hugeamounts of molecular gas (10^10-10^11 msolar) at their centers, and supportprevious indications that the standard conversion of co to h_2 probablyoverestimates the gas masses and cannot be used in these environments. this inturn suggests much more modest levels of extinction in the near-infrared forlirgs than previously predicted (a_v~10-20 versus a_v~100-1000). the lower gasmass estimates indicated by our observations imply that the star formationefficiency in these systems is very high and is triggered by cloud-cloudcollisions, shocks, and winds rather than by gravitational instabilities incircumnuclear gas disks.

astro-ph;0604604	warm dust and spatially variable pah emission in the dwarf starburst  galaxy ngc 1705	we present spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705obtained as part of sings. the galaxy morphology is very different shortwardand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying redstellar population, with the central super star cluster (ssc) dominating theluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from twooff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the ssc. these regions show littleextinction at optical wavelengths. the galaxy has a relatively low global dustmass (~2e5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 timeslower than the milky way average). the off-nuclear dust emission appears to bepowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for theexcitation of the observed h alpha emission; these photons are unassociatedwith the ssc (though a contribution from embedded sources to the ir luminosityof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). low-resolution irsspectroscopy shows moderate-strength pah emission in the 11.3 micron band inthe eastern peak; no pah emission is detected in the ssc or the western dustemission complex. there is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scalingand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable pah emissionstrengths revealed by the irs data suggest caution in the interpretation ofdiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from pah carriers alone. the metallicityof ngc 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by engelbracht andcollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatiallyvariable pah emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8micron emission. a radio continuum non-detection, ngc 1705 deviatessignificantly from the canonical far-ir vs. radio correlation.

astro-ph;0605605	ultraviolet through far-infrared spatially resolved analysis of the  recent star formation in m81 (ngc3031)	the recent star formation (sf) in the early-type spiral galaxy m81 ischaracterized using imaging observations from the far-ultraviolet (uv) to thefar-infrared (ir). we compare these data with models of the stellar, gas, anddust emission for sub-galactic regions. our results suggest the existence of adiffuse dust emission not directly linked to the recent sf. we find a radialdecrease of the dust temperature and dust mass density, and in the attenuationof the stellar light. the ir emission in m81 can be modeled with threecomponents: 1) cold dust with a temperature &lt;t_c&gt;=18+-2 k, concentrated nearthe hii regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust witht_w=53+-7 k, directly linked with the hii regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,with diffuse morphology peaking around the hii regions. we derive severalrelationships to obtain total ir luminosities from ir monochromatic fluxes, andwe compare five different star formation rate (sfr) estimators for hii regionsin m81 and m51: the uv, halpha, and three estimators based on spitzer data. wefind that the halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24microns emission. the correlation with the total ir luminosity is not as good.important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the totalsfr with the 24 microns or the total ir emission alone. the most reliableestimations of the total sfrs are obtained by combining the halpha emission (orthe uv) and an ir luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probethe unobscured and obscured sf, respectively. for the entire m81 galaxy, about50% of the total sf is obscured by dust. the percentage of obscured sf rangesfrom 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.

astro-ph;0702208	the dependence of star formation on galaxy stellar mass	we combine spitzer 24micron observations with data from the combo-17 surveyfor ~15,000 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 galaxies to determine how the average star formation rates(sfr) have evolved for galaxy sub-populations of different stellar masses. inthe determination of &lt;sfr&gt; we consider both the ultraviolet (uv) and theinfrared (ir) luminosities, and account for the contributions of galaxies thatare individually undetected at 24micron through image stacking. for allredshifts we find that higher-mass galaxies have substantially lower specificsfr, &lt;sfr&gt;/&lt;m*&gt;, than lower-mass ones. however, we find the striking resultthat the rate of decline in cosmic sfr with redshift is nearly the same formassive and low-mass galaxies, i.e. not a strong function of stellar mass. thisanalysis confirms one version of what has been referred to as `downsizing',namely that the epoch of major mass build-up in massive galaxies issubstantially earlier than the epoch of mass build-up in low-mass galaxies. yetit shows that star formation activity is not becoming increasingly limited tolow-mass galaxies towards the present epoch. we argue that this suggests thatheating by agn-powered radio jets is not the dominant mechanism responsible forthe decline in cosmic sfr since z~1, which is borne out by comparison withsemi-analytic models that include this effect.

0704.0953	ir observations of ms 1054-03: star formation and its evolution in rich  galaxy clusters	we study the infrared (ir) properties of galaxies in the cluster ms 1054-03at z=0.83 by combining mips 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400galaxies and a very deep k-band selected catalog. 19 ir cluster members areselected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by theirphotometric redshifts. we derive the ir luminosity function of the cluster andfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass coma cluster. the bestfitting schechter function gives l*_{ir}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 l_sun with a fixedfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in coma. therate of evolution of the ir luminosity from coma to ms 1054-03 is consistentwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internalmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for thegeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) in differentenvironments. the mass-normalized integrated sfr within 0.5r_200 in ms 1054-03also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, butthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. anonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively andthe overdensity of ir galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. it isunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from thesurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their starformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

0812.0427	the ir luminosity functions of rich clusters	we present mips observations of the cluster a3266. about 100 spectroscopiccluster members have been detected at 24 micron. the ir luminosity function ina3266 is very similar to that in the coma cluster down to the detection limitl_ir~10^43 ergs/s, suggesting a universal form of the bright end ir lf forlocal rich clusters with m~10^15 m_sun. the shape of the bright end of thea3266-coma composite ir lf is not significantly different from that of nearbyfield galaxies, but the fraction of ir-bright galaxies (sfr &gt; 0.2m_sun/yr) inboth clusters increases with cluster-centric radius. the decrease of the bluegalaxy fraction toward the high density cores only accounts for part of thetrend; the fraction of red galaxies with moderate sfrs (0.2 &lt; sfr &lt; 1 m_sun/yr)also decreases with increasing galaxy density. these results suggest that forthe ir bright galaxies, nearby rich clusters are distinguished from the fieldby a lower star-forming galaxy fraction, but not by a change in l*_ir. thecomposite ir lf of coma and a3266 shows strong evolution when compared with thecomposite ir lf of two z~0.8 clusters, ms 1054 and rx j0152, with l*_ir \propto(1+z)^{3.2+/-0.7},phi*_ir \propto (1+z)^{1.7+/-1.0}. this l*_ir evolution isindistinguishable from that in the field, and the phi*_ir evolution isstronger, but still consistent with that in the field. the similarity of theevolution of bright-end ir lf in very different cluster and field environmentssuggests either this evolution is driven by the mechanism that works in bothenvironments, or clusters continually replenish their star-forming galaxiesfrom the field, yielding an evolution in the ir lf that is similar to thefield. the mass-normalized integrated star formation rates (sfrs) of clusterswithin 0.5r_200 also evolve strongly with redshift, as (1+z)^5.3.
