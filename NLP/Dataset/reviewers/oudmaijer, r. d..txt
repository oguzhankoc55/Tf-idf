0902.4356	the close be star companion of beta cephei	the prototype of the beta cep class of pulsating stars, beta cep, rotatesrelatively slowly, and yet displays episodic halpha emission. such behaviour istypical of a classical be star. for some time this posed a contradiction to ourunderstanding of the be phenomena as rapid rotation is thought to be aprerequisite for the emission phases of be stars. recent work has demonstratedthat the halpha emission is in fact due to a close companion (separation~0.25") of the star. this resolves the apparent enigma if this close companionis a classical be star. we aim to test the hypothesis that this close companionis a valid be star by determining properties such as its spectral type and vsini. we employed spectroastrometry to investigate the close binary system. usingthe spectroastrometric signatures observed, we split the composite binaryspectra into its constituent spectra in the b band and r band. the splitspectra allow us to estimate spectral types of the binary components. we findthat the primary of the close binary system has a spectral type of b2iii andthe secondary a spectral type of b5ve. from the relationship between mass andspectral type, we determine the masses of the binary components to be m_p =12.6+/-3.2 m_* and m_s = 4.4+/-0.7 m_* respectively. the spectroastrometricdata allow some constraint on the orbit, and we suggest a moderate revision tothe previously determined orbit. we confirm that the primary of the system is aslow rotator (vsin i =29 +43/-29 km/s), while the secondary rotatessignificantly faster, at a vsin i =230+/-45 km/s. we show that the closecompanion to the beta cep primary is a valid classical be star. it has aspectral type of b5ve and is a relatively fast rotator.

0905.1174	the rms survey: 6 cm continuum vla observations towards candidate  massive ysos in the northern hemisphere	(abridged) context: the red msx source (rms) survey is an ongoingmulti-wavelength observational programme designed to return a large,well-selected sample of massive young stellar objects (mysos). we haveidentified $\sim$2000 myso candidates located throughout the galaxy bycomparing the colours of msx and 2mass point sources to those of known mysos.aims: to identify the populations of uchii regions and pne within the sampleand examine their galactic distribution. method: we have conducted highresolution radio continuum observations at 6 cm towards 659 myso candidates inthe northern hemisphere ($10\degr&lt; l &lt; 250\degr$) using the vla. in addition tothese targeted observations we present archival data towards a further 315 rmssources extracted from a previous vla survey of the inner galaxy. results: wefind radio emission towards 272 ($\sim$27% of the observed sample). usingresults from other parts of our multi-wavelength survey we separate theserms-radio associations into two distinct types of objects, classifying 51 aspne and a further 208 as either compact or uc hii regions. using this wellselected sample of hii regions we estimate their galactic scale height to be0.6\degr. conclusions: using radio continuum and archival data we haveidentified 79 pne and 391 hii regions within the northern rms catalogue. weestimate the total fraction of contamination by pne in the rms sample is oforder 10%. the sample of hii regions is probably the best representation todate of the galactic population of hii regions as a whole.

0909.0888	on the presence and absence of disks around o-type stars	(abridged) as the favoured progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts,massive stars may represent our best signposts of individual objects in theearly universe, but special conditions seem required to make these bursters,which might originate from the progenitor's rapid rotation and associatedasymmetry. to obtain empirical constraints on the interplay between stellarrotation and wind asymmetry, we perform linear halpha spectropolarimetry on asample of 18 spectroscopically peculiar massive o stars, including ovz, of?p,oe, and onfp stars, supplemented by an earlier sample of 20 o supergiants.despite their rapid rotation (with vsin(i) up to 400 km/s) most o-type starsare found to be spherically symmetric, but with notable exceptions amongstspecific object classes. we divide the peculiar o stars into four distinctcategories: groups iii and iv include the oe stars and onfp stars, which are onthe high-end tail of the o star rotation distribution and have in the past beenclaimed to be embedded in disks. here we report the detection of a classicaldepolarization ``line effect'' in the oe star hd 45314, but the overallincidence of line effects amongst oe stars is significantly lower (1 out of 6)than amongst be stars. the chance that the oe and be datasets are drawn fromthe same parent population is negligible (with 95% confidence). this impliesthere is as yet no evidence for a disk hypothesis in oe stars, providingrelevant constraints on the physical mechanism that is responsible for the bephenomenon. finally, we find that 3 out of 4 of the group iv onfp stars showevidence for complex polarization effects, which are likely related to rapidrotation, and we speculate on the evolutionary links to b[e] stars.

0910.1774	the mass ratio and formation mechanisms of herbig ae/be star binary  systems	we present b and r band spectroastrometry of a sample of 45 herbig ae/bestars in order to study their binary properties. all but one of the targetsknown to be binary systems with a separation of ~0.1-2.0 arcsec are detected bya distinctive spectroastrometric signature. some objects in the sample exhibitspectroastrometric features that do not appear attributable to a binary system.we find that these may be due to light reflected from dusty halos or materialentrained in winds. we present 8 new binary detections and 4 detections of anunknown component in previously discovered binary systems. the data confirmprevious reports that herbig ae/be stars have a high binary fraction, 74+/-6per cent in the sample presented here. we use a spectroastrometricdeconvolution technique to separate the spatially unresolved binary spectrainto the individual constituent spectra. the separated spectra allow us toascertain the spectral type of the individual binary components, which in turnallows the mass ratio of these systems to be determined. in addition, weappraise the method used and the effects of contaminant sources of flux. wefind that the distribution of system mass ratios is inconsistent with randompairing from the initial mass function, and that this appears robust despite adetection bias. instead, the mass ratio distribution is broadly consistent withthe scenario of binary formation via disk fragmentation.

0912.2682	the rms survey: far-infrared photometry of young massive stars	context: the red msx source (rms) survey is a multi-wavelength campaign offollow-up observations of a colour-selected sample of candidate massive youngstellar objects (mysos) in the galactic plane. this survey is returning thelargest well-selected sample of mysos to date, while identifying other dustcontaminant sources with similar mid-infrared colours including a large numberof new ultra-compact (uc)hii regions. aims:to measure the far-infrared (ir)flux, which lies near the peak of the spectral energy distribution (sed) ofmysos and uchii regions, so that, together with distance information, theluminosity of these sources can be obtained. methods:less than 50% of rmssources are associated with iras point sources with detections at 60 micron and100 micron, though the vast majority are visible in spitzer mipsgal or irasgalaxy atlas (iga) images. however, standard aperture photometry is notappropriate for these data due to crowding of sources and strong spatiallyvariable far-ir background emission in the galactic plane. a new techniqueusing a 2-dimensional fit to the background in an annulus around each source istherefore used to obtain far-ir photometry for young rms sources.results:far-ir fluxes are obtained for a total of 1113 rms candidatesidentified as young sources. of these 734 have flux measurements using iga 60micron and 100 micron images and 724 using mipsgal 70 micron images, with 345having measurements in both data sets.

0912.2869	the origin of mid-infrared emission in massive young stellar objects:  multi-baseline vlti observations of w33a	the circumstellar structure on 100 au scales of the massive young stellarobject w33a is probed using the vlti and the midi instrument. n-bandvisibilities on 4 baselines are presented which are inconsistent with aspherically symmetric geometry. the visibility spectra and sed aresimultaneously compared to 2d axi-symmetric dust radiative transfer models witha geometry including a rotationally flattened envelope and outflow cavities. weassume an o7.5 zams star as the central source, consistent with the observedbolometric luminosity. the observations are also compared to models with andwithout (dusty and gaseous) accretion disks. a satisfactory model isconstructed which reproduces the visibility spectra for each (u,v) point. itfits the silicate absorption, the mid-ir slope, the far-infrared peak, and the(sub)mm of the sed. it produces a 350 micron morphology consistent withobservations. the 10 micron emission on 100 au scales is dominated by theirradiated walls of the cavity sculpted by the outflow. the visibilities ruleout the presence of dust disks with total (gas and dust) masses more than 0.01msun. however, optically thick accretion disks, interior to the dustsublimation radius, are allowed to accrete at rates equalling the envelope'smass infall rate (up to 10^(-3) msun/yr) without substantially affecting thevisibilities due to the extinction by the extremely massive envelope of w33a.

1007.3289	probing discs around massive young stellar objects with co first  overtone emission	we present high resolution (r~50,000) spectroastrometry over the co 1stovertone bandhead of a sample of seven intermediate/massive young stellarobjects. these are primarily drawn from the red msx source (rms) survey, asystematic search for young massive stars which has returned a large, wellselected sample of such objects. the mean luminosity of the sample isapproximately 5 times 10^4 l_\odot, indicating the objects typically have amass of ~15 solar masses. we fit the observed bandhead profiles with a model ofa circumstellar disc, and find good agreement between the models andobservations for all but one object. we compare the high angular precision(0.2-0.8 mas) spectroastrometric data to the spatial distribution of theemitting material in the best-fitting models. no spatial signatures of discsare detected, which is entirely consistent with the properties of thebest-fitting models. therefore, the observations suggest that the co bandheademission of massive young stellar objects originates in small-scale disks, inagreement with previous work. this provides further evidence that massive starsform via disc accretion, as suggested by recent simulations.

1008.3149	the rms survey: distribution and properties of a sample of massive young  stars	the red msx source (rms) survey has identified a large sample of massiveyoung stellar objects (mysos) and ultra compact (uc) hii regions from a sampleof ~2000 msx and 2mass colour selected sources. using a recent catalogue ofmolecular clouds derived from the boston university-five college radioastronomy observatory galactic ring survey (grs), and by applying a galacticscaleheight cut off of 120 pc, we solve the distance ambiguity for rms sourceslocated within 18\degr &lt; |l| &gt; 54\degr. these two steps yield kinematicdistances to 291 sources out of a possible 326 located within the grs longituderange. combining distances and integrated fluxes derived from spectral energydistributions, we estimate luminosities to these sources and find that &gt; 90%are indicative of the presence of a massive star. we find the completenesslimit of our sample is ~10^4 lsun, which corresponds to a zero age mainsequence (zams) star with a mass of ~12 msun. selecting only these sources, weconstruct a complete sample of 196 sources. comparing the properties of thesample of young massive stars with the general population, we find therms-clouds are generally larger, more massive, and more turbulent. we examinethe distribution of this sub-sample with respect to the location of the spiralarms and the galactic bar and find them to be spatially correlated. we identifythree significant peaks in the source surface density at galactocentric radiiof approximately 4, 6 and 8 kpc, which correspond to the proposed positions ofthe scutum, sagittarius and perseus spiral arms, respectively. fitting a scaleheight to the data we obtain an average value of ~29+-0.5 pc, which agrees wellwith other reported values in the literature, however, we note a dependence ofthe scale height on galactocentric radius with it increases from 30 pc to 45 pcbetween 2.5 and 8.5 kpc.

1012.0179	mid-infrared interferometry towards the massive young stellar object crl  2136: inside the dust rim	we apply mid-infrared spectro-interferometry to the massive young stellarobject crl2136. the observations were performed with the very large telescopeinterferometer and the midi instrument at a 42m baseline probing angular scalesof 50 milli-arcseconds. we model the observed visibilities in parallel withdiffraction-limited images at both 24.5micron and in the n-band (withresolutions of 0.6" and 0.3", respectively), as well as the spectral energydistribution. the arcsec-scale spatial information reveals the well-resolvedemission from the dusty envelope. by simultaneously modelling the spatial andspectral data, we find that the bulk of the dust emission occurs at severaldust sublimation radii (approximately 170 au). this reproduces the highmid-infrared fluxes and at the same time the low visibilities observed in themidi data for wavelengths longward of 8.5micron. however, shortward of thiswavelength the visibility data show a sharp up-turn indicative of compactemission. we discuss various potential sources of this emission. we exclude adust disk being responsible for the observed spectral imprint on thevisibilities. a cool supergiant star and an accretion disk are considered andboth shown to be viable origins of the compact mid-infrared emission. wepropose that crl2136 is embedded in a dusty envelope, which truncates atseveral times the dust sublimation radius. a dust torus is manifest in theequatorial region. we find that the spectro-interferometric n-band signal canbe reproduced by either a gaseous disk or a bloated central star. if the diskextends to the stellar surface, it accretes at a rate of 3.0 10^(-3) msun/yr.

1106.3949	on the alignment between the circumstellar disks and orbital planes of  herbig ae/be binary systems	the majority of the pre-main-sequence herbig ae/be stars reside in binarysystems. as these systems are young, their properties may contain an imprint ofthe star formation process at intermediate masses. however, these systems aregenerally spatially unresolved, making it difficult to probe theircircumstellar environment to search for manifestations of their formationprocess, such as accretion disks. here we investigate the formation mechanismof herbig ae/be (hae/be) binary systems by studying the relative orientation oftheir binary orbits and circumstellar disks. we present linearspectropolarimetric observations of hae/be stars over the halpha line, whichare used to determine the orientation of their circumstellar disks. inconjunction with data from the literature, we obtain a sample of 20 binarieswith known disk position angles (pas). we compare our disk pa data to a modelto investigate whether hae/be binary systems and their disks are co-planar.moreover, in the light of a recent suggestion that some hae/be starspectropolarimetric signatures may not necessarily be related to circumstellardisks, we re-assess the relationship between spectropolarimetric signatures anddisk pas. we do this by comparing spectropolarimetric and high spatialresolution observations of young stellar objects. we find thatspectropolarimetric observations of pre-main-sequence stars do tracecircumstellar disks. this finding is significant above the 3 sigma level. usingthis result, our data are entirely consistent with the situation in whichhae/be binary systems and circumstellar disks are co-planar, while randomorientations can be rejected at the 2.2 sigma level. we conclude that hae/bebinary systems and the disks around the primaries are likely to be co-planar,which is consistent with the notion that these systems form via monolithiccollapse and subsequent disk fragmentation (abridged).

1202.4348	probing the envelopes of massive young stellar objects with diffraction  limited mid-infrared imaging	massive stars form whilst they are still embedded in dense envelopes. as aresult, the roles of rotation, mass loss and accretion in massive starformation are not well understood. this study evaluates the source of theq-band, lambda=19.5 microns, emission of massive young stellar objects (mysos).this allows us to determine the relative importance of rotation and outflowactivity in shaping the circumstellar environments of mysos on 1000 au scales.we obtained diffraction limited mid-infrared images of a sample of 20 mysosusing the vlt/visir and subaru/comics instruments. for these 8 m classtelescopes and the sample selected, the diffraction limit, ~0.6", correspondsto approximately 1000 au. we compare the images and the spectral energydistributions (seds) observed to a 2d, axis-symmetric dust radiative transfermodel that reproduces vlti/midi observations of the myso w33a. we vary theinclination, mass infall rate, and outflow opening angle to simultaneouslyrecreate the behaviour of the sample of mysos in the spatial and spectraldomains. the mid-ir emission of 70 percent of the mysos is spatially resolved.in the majority of cases, the spatial extent of their emission and their sedscan be reproduced by the w33a model featuring an in-falling, rotating dustyenvelope with outflow cavities. there is independent evidence that most of thesources which are not fit by the model are associated with ultracompact hiiregions and are thus more evolved. we find that, in general, the diverse 20micron morphology of mysos can be attributed to warm dust in the walls ofoutflow cavities seen at different inclinations. this implies that the warmdust in the outflow cavity walls dominates the q-band emission of mysos. inturn, this emphasises that outflows are an ubiquitous feature of massive starformation.

1205.2296	tracers of discs and winds around intermediate and high mass young  stellar objects	we present a study of the kinematical properties of a small sample of nearbynear-infrared bright massive and intermediate mass young stellar objects usingemission lines sensitive to discs and winds. we show for the first time thatthe broad ($\sim500$kms$^{-1}$) symmetric line wings on the hi brackett serieslines are due to stark broadening or electron scattering, rather than puredoppler broadening due to high speed motion. the results are consistent withthe presence of a very dense circumstellar environment. in addition, many ofthese lines show evidence for weak line self-absorption, suggestive of a windor disc-wind origin for that part of the absorbing material. the weakness ofthe self-absorption suggests a large opening angle for such an outflow. we alsostudy the fluorescent 1.688$\mu$m feii line, which is sensitive to densematerial. we fitted a keplerian disc model to this line, and find reasonablefits in all bar one case, in agreement with previous finding for classical bestars that fluorescent iron transitions are reasonable disc tracers. overallthe picture is one in which these stars still have accretion discs, with a verydense inner circumstellar environment which may be tracing either the innerregions of a disc, or of a stellar wind, and in which ionised outflow is alsopresent. the similarity with lower mass stars is striking, suggesting that atleast in this mass range they form in a similar fashion.

1205.4734	accretion-related properties of herbig ae/be stars. comparison with t  tauris	we look for trends relating the mass accretion rate (macc) and the stellarages (t), spectral energy distributions (seds), and disk masses (mdisk) for asample of 38 haebe stars, comparing them to analogous correlations found forclassical t tauri stars. our goal is to shed light on the timescale andphysical processes that drive evolution of intermediate-mass pre-main sequenceobjects.  macc shows a dissipation timescale \tau = 1.3^{+1.0}_{-0.5} myr from anexponential law fit, while a power law yields macc(t) \propto t^{-\eta}, with\eta = 1.8^{+1.4}_{-0.7}. this result is based on our whole haebe sample (1-6msun), but the accretion rate decline most probably depends on smaller stellarmass bins. the near-ir excess is higher and starts at shorter wavelengths (jand h bands) for the strongest accretors. active and passive disks are roughlydivided by 2 x 10^{-7} msun/yr. the mid-ir excess and the sed shape from themeeus et al. classification are not correlated with macc. we find macc \proptomdisk^{1.1 +- 0.3}. most stars in our sample with signs of inner dustdissipation typically show accretion rates ten times lower and disk massesthree times smaller than the remaining objects.  the trends relating macc with the near-ir excess and mdisk extend those for ttauri stars, and are consistent with viscous disk models. the differences inthe inner gas dissipation timescale, and the relative position of the starswith signs of inner dust clearing in the macc-mdisk plane, could be suggestinga slightly faster evolution, and that a different process - such asphotoevaporation - plays a more relevant role in dissipating disks in the haeberegime compared to t tauri stars. our conclusions must consider the mismatchbetween the disk mass estimates from mm fluxes and the disk mass estimates fromaccretion, which we also find in haebe stars.

1206.6252	amber and crires observations of the binary sgb[e] star hd 327083:  evidence of a gaseous disc traced by co bandhead emission	hd 327083 is a sgb[e] star that forms a binary system with an orbitalsemi-major axis of ~1.7 au. our previous observations using the vlti and amberin the medium resolution k-band mode spatially resolved the environment of hd327083. the continuum visibilities obtained indicate the presence of acircumbinary disc. co bandhead emission was also observed. however, due to thelimited spectral resolution of the previous observations, the kinematicstructure of the emitting material was not constrained. in this paper, weaddress this and probe the source of the co emission with high spectralresolution and spatial precision. we have observed hd 327083 with high spectralresolution (25 &amp; 6 km/s) using amber and crires. the observations are comparedto kinematical models to constrain the source of the emission. it is shown thatthe co bandhead emission can be reproduced using a model of a keplerian discwith an inclination and size consistent with our previous vlti observations.the model is compared to amber differential phase measurements, which have aprecision as high as 30-micro-arcseconds. a differential phase signalcorresponding to 0.15 milli-arcseconds (~5 sigma) is seen over the bandheademission, which is in excellent agreement with the model that fits the criresobservations. in comparison, a model of an equatorial outflow, as envisaged inthe standard sgb[e] scenario, does not reproduce the observations well. theexcellent agreement between the disc model and observations in the spatial andspectral domains is compelling evidence that the co bandhead emission of hd327083 originates in a circumbinary keplerian disc. in contrast, the model ofan equatorial outflow cannot reproduce the observations well. this suggeststhat the standard sgb[e] scenario is not applicable to hd 327083, whichsupports the hypothesis that the b[e] behaviour of hd 327083 is due to binarity(abridged).

1212.0554	co bandhead emission of massive young stellar objects: determining disc  properties	massive stars play an important role in many areas of astrophysics, butnumerous details regarding their formation remain unclear. in this paper wepresent and analyse high resolution (r ~ 30,000) near-infrared 2.3 micronspectra of 20 massive young stellar objects from the rms database, in thelargest such study of co first overtone bandhead emission to date. we fit theemission under the assumption it originates from a circumstellar disc inkeplerian rotation. we explore three approaches to modelling the physicalconditions within the disc - a disc heated mainly via irradiation from thecentral star, a disc heated mainly via viscosity, and a disc in which thetemperature and density are described analytically. we find that the modelsdescribed by heating mechanisms are inappropriate because they do not providegood fits to the co emission spectra. we therefore restrict our analysis to theanalytic model, and obtain good fits to all objects that possess sufficientlystrong co emission, suggesting circumstellar discs are the source of thisemission. on average, the temperature and density structure of the discscorrespond to geometrically thin discs, spread across a wide range ofinclinations. essentially all the discs are located within the dust sublimationradius, providing strong evidence that the co emission originates close to thecentral protostar, on astronomical unit scales. in addition, we show that theobjects in our sample appear no different to the general population of mysos inthe rms database, based on their near- and mid-infrared colours. thecombination of observations of a large sample of mysos with co bandheademission and our detailed modelling provide compelling evidence of the presenceof small scale gaseous discs around such objects, supporting the scenario inwhich massive stars form via disc accretion.

1301.4109	the rms survey: near-ir spectroscopy of massive young stellar objects	near-infrared h- and k-band spectra are presented for 247 objects, selectedfrom the red msx source (rms) survey as potential young stellar objects (ysos).195 (~80%) of the targets are ysos, of which 131 are massive ysos (l_bol &gt;5x10^3 l_solar), m &gt; 8m_solar. this is the largest spectroscopic study ofmassive ysos to date, providing a valuable resource for the study of massivestar formation. in this paper we present our exploratory analysis of the data.the ysos observed have a wide range of embeddedness (2.7 &lt; a_v &lt; 114),demonstrating that this study covers minimally obscured objects right throughto very red, dusty sources. almost all ysos show some evidence for emissionlines, though there is a wide variety of observed properties. the most commonlydetected lines are brgamma, h_2, fluorescent feii, co bandhead, [feii] and hei2-1 2^1s-2^1p, in order of frequency of occurrence. in total, ~40% of the ysosdisplay either fluorescent feii 1.6878um or co bandhead emission (or both),indicative of a circumstellar disc; however, no correlation of the strength ofthese lines with bolometric luminosity was found. we also find that ~60% of thesources exhibit [feii] or h_2 emission, indicating the presence of an outflow.three quarters of all sources have brgamma in emission. a good correlation withbolometric luminosity was observed for both the brgamma and h_2 emission linestrengths, covering 1 l_solar&lt; l_bol &lt; 3.5x10^5 l_solar. this suggests that theemission mechanism for these lines is the same for low-, intermediate-, andhigh-mass ysos, i.e. high-mass ysos appear to resemble scaled-up versions oflow-mass ysos.

1301.6480	investigation of dust properties of the proto-planetary nebula iras  18276-1431	we investigate the circumstellar dust properties of the oxygen-rich bipolarproto-planetary nebula iras 18276-1431 by means of two-dimensional radiativetransfer simulations of the circumstellar dust shell. the model geometry isassumed to have a torus and an envelope. the parameters of the dust and thedust shell are constrained by comparing the sed and nir intensity andpolarisation data with the models. the polarisation in the envelope reaches 50-- 60 % and is nearly constant in the h and k_s bands in the observations. thisweak wavelength dependence of the polarisation can be reproduced with a grainsize distribution function for the torus: 0.05 micron &lt;= a withn(a)=a^{-(p=5.5)}exp(-a/{a_c=0.3 micron}). the power index p is significantlysteeper than that for interstellar dust. similar results have also been foundin some other ppns and suggest that mechanisms that grind down large particlesmay also have acted when the dust particles formed. the spectral opacity indexbeta is found to be 0.6+/-0.5 from the millimeter fluxes. this low valueindicates the presence of large dust grains in the torus. we discuss twopossible dust models for the torus. one has a size distribution function of 1.0micron &lt;= a &lt;= a_max=5,000.0 micron with n(a)=a^{-(p=2.5)} and the other is 1.0micron &lt;= a &lt;= a_max=10,000.0 micron with n(a)=a^{-(p=3.5)}. the former hasbeta of 0.633, but we are not able to find reasonable geometry parameters tofit the sed in the infrared. the latter has beta of 1.12, but reproduces thesed better over a wide wavelength range. with this dust model, the geometricparameters are estimated as follows: the inner and outer radii are 30 au and1000 au and the torus mass is 3.0 m_sun. assuming an expansion velocity of 15kms^{-1}, the torus formation time and mass-loss rate are found to be \sim300yrs and \sim10^{-2}m_sun yr^{-1} respectively.

0801.0878	spectropolarimetry of the massive post-red supergiants irc +10420 and hd  179821	we present medium resolution spectropolarimetry and long termphoto-polarimetry of two massive post-red supergiants, irc +10420 and hd179821. the data provide new information on their circumstellar material aswell as their evolution. in irc +10420, the polarization of the halpha line isdifferent to that of the continuum, which indicates that theelectron-scattering region is not spherically symmetric. the observed long termchanges in the polarimetry can be associated with an axi-symmetric structure,along the short axis of the extended reflection nebulosity. long termphotometry reveals that the star increased in temperature until themid-nineties, after which the photospheric flux in the optical levelled off. asthe photometric changes are mostly probed in the red, they do not trace highstellar temperatures sensitively. and so, it is not obvious whether the starhas halted its increase in temperature or not. for hd 179821 we find nopolarization effects across any absorption or emission lines, but observe verylarge polarization changes of order 5% over 15 years. unexpectedly, during thesame period, the optical photometry displayed modest variability at the 0.2magnitude level. several explanations for this puzzling fact are discussed.most of which, involving asymmetries in the circumstellar material, seem tofail as there is no evidence for the presence of hot, dusty material close tothe star. alternatively, the variations can be explained by the presence of anon-radially pulsating photosphere. changes in the photometry hint at anincrease in temperature corresponding to a change through two spectralsubclasses over the past ten years.

1308.3248	accretion variability of herbig ae/be stars observed by x-shooter. hd  31648 and hd 163296	this work presents x-shooter/vlt spectra of the prototypical, isolated herbigae stars hd 31648 (mwc 480) and hd 163296 over five epochs separated bytimescales ranging from days to months. each spectrum spans over a widewavelength range covering from 310 to 2475 nm. we have monitored the continuumexcess in the balmer region of the spectra and the luminosity of twelveultraviolet, optical and near infrared spectral lines that are commonly used asaccretion tracers for t tauri stars. the observed strengths of the balmerexcesses have been reproduced from a magnetospheric accretion shock model,providing a mean mass accretion rate of 1.11 x 10^-7 and 4.50 x 10^-7 msunyr^-1 for hd 31648 and hd 163296, respectively. accretion rate variations areobserved, being more pronounced for hd 31648 (up to 0.5 dex). however, from thecomparison with previous results it is found that the accretion rate of hd163296 has increased by more than 1 dex, on a timescale of ~ 15 years. averagedaccretion luminosities derived from the balmer excess are consistent with theones inferred from the empirical calibrations with the emission lineluminosities, indicating that those can be extrapolated to hae stars. in spiteof that, the accretion rate variations do not generally coincide with thoseestimated from the line luminosities, suggesting that the empiricalcalibrations are not useful to accurately quantify accretion rate variability.

1310.4758	the rms survey: galactic distribution of massive star formation	abridged: we have used the well-selected sample of ~1750 embedded, young,massive stars identified by the rms survey to investigate the galacticdistribution of recent massive star formation. we describe the various methodsused to assign distances extracted from the literature, and solve the distanceambiguities towards ~200 sources located within the solar circle using archivalhi data. these distances are used to calculate bolometric luminosities andestimate the survey completeness (~2x10^4 lsun). in total, we calculate thedistance and luminosity of ~1650 sources, one third of which are above thesurvey's completeness threshold. examination of the sample's longitude,latitude, radial velocities and mid-infrared images has identified ~120 smallgroups of sources, many of which are associated with well known star formationcomplexes, such as w43, w49 and w51.  we compare the positional distribution of the sample with the expectedlocations of the spiral arms, assuming a model of the galaxy consisting of fourgaseous arms. the distribution of young massive stars in the milky way isspatially correlated with the spiral arms, with strong peaks in the sourceposition and luminosity distributions at the arms' galactocentric radii. theoverall source and luminosity surface densities are both well correlated withthe surface density of the molecular gas, which suggests that the massive starformation rate per unit molecular mass is approximately constant across thegalaxy.  we estimate the total luminosity of the embedded massive star population tobe ~0.76x10^8 lsun, 30% of which is associated with the ten most active starforming complexes. we measure the scale height as a function of galactocentricdistance and find that it increases only modestly from ~20-30 pc between 4 and8 kpc, but much more rapidly at larger distances.

1405.7378	stellar parameters and accretion rate of the transition disk star hd  142527 from x-shooter	hd 142527 is a young pre-main sequence star with properties indicative of thepresence of a giant planet or/and a low-mass stellar companion. we haveanalyzed an x-shooter/very large telescope spectrum to provide accurate stellarparameters and accretion rate. the analysis of the spectrum, together withconstraints provided by the sed fitting, the distance to the star (140 +- 20pc) and the use of evolutionary tracks and isochrones, lead to the followingset of parameters t_eff = 6550 +- 100 k, log g = 3.75 +- 0.10, l_*/l_sun = 16.3+- 4.5, m_*/m_sun = 2.0 +- 0.3 and an age of 5.0 +- 1.5 myr. this stellar ageprovides further constrains to the mass of the possible companion estimated bybiller et al. (2012), being in-between 0.20 and 0.35 m_sun. stellar accretionrates obtained from uv balmer excess modelling, optical photospheric lineveiling, and from the correlations with several emission lines spanning fromthe uv to the near-ir, are consistent to each other. the mean value from allprevious tracers is 2 (+- 1) x 10^-7 m_sun yr^-1, which is within the upperlimit gas flow rate from the outer to the inner disk recently provided bycassasus et al. (2013). this suggests that almost all gas transferred betweenboth components of the disk is not trapped by the possible planet(s) in-betweenbut fall onto the central star, although it is discussed how the gap flow ratecould be larger than previously suggested. in addition, we provide evidenceshowing that the stellar accretion rate of hd 142527 has increased by a factor~ 7 on a timescale of 2-5 years.

1507.02696	on the origin of the correlations between the accretion luminosity and  emission line luminosities in pre-main sequence stars	correlations between the accretion luminosity and emission line luminosities(l_acc and l_line) of pre-main sequence (pms) stars have been published formany different spectral lines, which are used to estimate accretion rates.despite the origin of those correlations is unknown, this could be attributedto direct or indirect physical relations between the emission line formationand the accretion mechanism. this work shows that all (near-uv/optical/near-ir)l_acc-l_line correlations are the result of the fact that the accretionluminosity and the stellar luminosity (l_star) are correlated, and are notnecessarily related with the physical origin of the line. synthetic andobservational data are used to illustrate how the l_acc-l_line correlationsdepend on the l_acc-l_star relationship. we conclude that because pms starsshow the l_acc-l_star correlation immediately implies that l_acc alsocorrelates with the luminosity of all emission lines, for which thel_acc-l_line correlations alone do not prove any physical connection withaccretion but can only be used with practical purposes to roughly estimateaccretion rates. when looking for correlations with possible physical meaning,we suggest that l_acc/l_star and l_line/l_star should be used instead of l_accand l_line. finally, the finding that l_acc has a steeper dependence on l_starfor t-tauri stars than for intermediate-mass herbig ae/be stars is alsodiscussed. that is explained from the magnetospheric accretion scenario and thedifferent photospheric properties in the near-uv.

1507.05967	a spectroscopic survey of herbig ae/be stars with x-shooter i: stellar  parameters and accretion rates	herbig ae/be stars span a key mass range that links low and high mass stars,and thus provide an ideal window from which to explore their formation. thispaper presents vlt/x-shooter spectra of 91 herbig ae/be stars, haebes; thelargest spectroscopic study of haebe accretion to date. a homogeneous approachto determining stellar parameters is undertaken for the majority of the sample.measurements of the ultra-violet (uv) are modelled within the context ofmagnetospheric accretion, allowing a direct determination of mass accretionrates. multiple correlations are observed across the sample between accretionand stellar properties: the youngest and often most massive stars are thestrongest accretors, and there is an almost 1:1 relationship between theaccretion luminosity and stellar luminosity. despite these overall trends ofincreased accretion rates in haebes when compared to classical t tauri stars,we also find noticeable differences in correlations when considering the herbigae and herbig be subsets. this, combined with the difficulty in applying amagnetospheric accretion model to some of the herbig be stars, could suggestthat another form of accretion may be occurring within the herbig be massrange.

1509.05411	high-resolution br-gamma spectro-interferometry of the transitional  herbig ae/be star hd 100546: a keplerian gaseous disc inside the inner rim	we present spatially and spectrally resolved br-gamma emission around theplanet-hosting, transitional herbig ae/be star hd 100546. aiming to gaininsight into the physical origin of the line in possible relation to accretionprocesses, we carried out br-gamma spectro-interferometry using amber/vlti fromthree different baselines achieving spatial and spectral resolutions of 2-4 masand 12000. the br-gamma visibility is larger than that of the continuum for allbaselines. differential phases reveal a shift between the photocentre of thebr-gamma line -displaced 0.6 mas (0.06 au at 100 pc) ne from the star- and thatof the k-band continuum emission -displaced 0.3 mas ne from the star. thephotocentres of the redshifted and blueshifted components of the br-gamma lineare located nw and se from the photocentre of the peak line emission,respectively. moreover, the photocentre of the fastest velocity bins within thespectral line tends to be closer to that of the peak emission than thephotocentre of the slowest velocity bins. our results are consistent with abr-gamma emitting region inside the dust inner rim (&lt;0.25 au) and extendingvery close to the central star, with a keplerian, disc-like structure rotatingcounter-clockwise, and most probably flared (25 deg). even though the maincontribution to the br-gamma line does not come from gas magneticallychannelled on to the star, accretion on to hd 100546 could be magnetospheric,implying a mass accretion rate of a few 10^-7 msun/yr. this value indicatesthat the observed gas has to be replenished on time-scales of a few months toyears, perhaps by planet-induced flows from the outer to the inner disc as hasbeen reported for similar systems.

0806.0953	the rms survey: $^{13}$co observations of candidate massive ysos in the  northern galactic plane	context: the red msx source (rms) survey is an ongoing multi-wavelengthobservational programme designed to return a large, high-resolutionmid-infrared colour-selected sample of massive young stellar objects.  aims: a critical part of our follow-up programme is to conduct 13co molecularline observations in order to determine kinematic distances to all of our mysocandidates. these distances will allow us to identify and remove nearbylow-mass ysos and help in identifying evolved stars which are weak co emitters.  method: we have used the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt), the 13.7m telescope of the purple mountain observatory (pmo), the 20 m onsala telescopeand the 22m mopra telescope to conduct molecular line observations towards 508mysos candidates located in the 1st and 2nd quadrants.  results: we detect 13co emission towards 780 rms sources which corresponds toapproximately 84% of those observed (911). a total of 2595 emission componentsare detected above 3sigma level (typically t^*_{\rm{a}} &gt; 0.3k), with multiplecomponents being observed towards the majority of these sources -- 520 sources(~56%) -- with an average of ~4 molecular clouds detected along each line ofsight. we have used archival cs (j=2-1) and maser velocities to resolve thecomponent multiplicity towards 175 sources (~20%) and have derived a criterionwhich is used to identify the most likely component for a further 191 multiplecomponent sources. combined with the single component detections we haveobtained unambiguous kinematic velocities for 638 of the 780 mysos candidatestowards which co is detected (~80% of the detections). using the galacticrotation curve we calculate kinematic distances for all detected components.

1511.02289	vlt/muse discovers a jet from the evolved b[e] star mwc 137	not all stars exhibiting the optical spectral characteristics of b[e] starsshare the same evolutionary stage. the galactic b[e] star mwc 137 is a primeexample of an object with uncertain classification, with previous worksuggesting pre- and post-main sequence classification. our goal is to settlethis debate and provide reliable evolutionary classification. integral fieldspectrograph observations with vlt muse of the cluster sh 2-266 are used toanalyze the nature of mwc 137. a collimated outflow is discovered that isgeometrically centered on mwc 137. the central position of mwc 137 in thecluster sh 2-266 within the larger nebula suggests strongly that it is a memberof this cluster and that it is both at the origin of the nebula and the newlydiscovered jet. comparison of the color-magnitude diagram of the brightestcluster stars with stellar evolutionary models results in a distance of about5.2$\pm$1.4 kpc. we estimate that the cluster is at least 3 myr old. the jetextends over 66" (1.7 pc) projected on the plane of the sky, shows severalknots, and projected velocities of up to $\pm$450 km s$^{-1}$. from the balmeremission line decrement of the diffuse intracluster nebulosity we determinee(b-v)=1.4 mag for the inner 1' cluster region. the spectral energydistribution of the brightest cluster stars yield a slightly lower extinctionof e(b-v)~1.2 mag. the extinction towards mwc 137 is estimated to be e(b-v)~1.8mag (a$_v$~5.6 mag). our analysis of the optical and near-infraredcolor-magnitude and color-color diagrams suggests a post-main sequence stage ofmwc 137. the existence of a jet in this object implies the presence of anaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0002325	multi-colour pl-relations of cepheids in the hipparcos catalogue and the  distance to the lmc	we analyse a sample of 236 cepheids from the hipparcos catalog, using themethod of ``reduced parallaxes'' in v, i, k and the reddening-free``wesenheit-index''. we compare our sample to those considered by feast &amp;catchpole (1997) and lanoix et al. (1999).  we stress the importance of two systematic effects which influence thedistance to the lmc: the slopes of the galactic pl-relations and metallicitycorrections. in order to assess the influence of these various effects, wepresent 27 distance moduli (dm) to the lmc, based on three different colours(v,i,k), three different slopes, and three different metallicity corrections.  the dm to the lmc based on the parallax data can be summarised as follows.based on the pl-relation in v and i, and the wesenheit-index, the dm is 18.60\pm 0.11 (\pm 0.08 slope)(^{+0.08}_{-0.15} metallicity), which is our currentbest estimate.  based on the pl-relation in k the dm is 18.52 \pm 0.18$ (\pm 0.03 slope) (\pm0.06 metallicity)(^{+0.10}_{-0} sampling bias}).  the random error is mostly due to the given accuracy of the hipparcosparallaxes and the number of cepheids in the respective samples. the termsbetween parentheses indicate the possible systematic uncertainties due to theslope of the galactic pl-relations, the metallicity corrections, and in thek-band, due to the limited number of stars. recent work by sandage et al.(1999) indicates that the effect of metallicity towards shorter distances maybe smaller in v and i than indicated here.

astro-ph;0110641	export: optical photometry and polarimetry of vega-type and pre-main  sequence stars	this paper presents optical ubvri broadband photo-polarimetry of the exportsample obtained at the 2.5m nordic optical telescope. the database consists ofmulti-epoch photo-polarimetry of 68 pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars.an investigation of the polarization variability indicates that 22 objects arevariable at the 3sigma level in our data. all these objects are pre-mainsequence stars, consisting of both t tauri and herbig ae/be objects while themain sequence, vega type and post-t tauri type objects are not variable. thepolarization properties of the variable sources are mostly indicative of theuxor-type behaviour; the objects show highest polarization when the brightnessis at minimum. we add seven new objects to the class of uxor variables (bh cep,vx cas, dk tau, hk ori, lkha 234, kk oph and ry ori). the main reason for theirdiscovery is the fact that our data-set is the largest in its kind, indicatingthat many more young uxor-type pre-main sequence stars remain to be discovered.the set of vega-like systems has been investigated for the presence ofintrinsic polarization. as they lack variability, this was done using indirectmethods, and apart from the known case of bd +31.643, the following stars werefound to be strong candidates to exhibit polarization due to the presence ofcircumstellar disks: 51 oph, bd +31.643c, hd 58647 and hd 233517.

astro-ph;0206391	the population of the galactic plane as seen by msx	the combination of mid-infrared data from the msx satellite mission andground-based near-infrared photometry is used to characterise the properties ofthe mid-infrared population of the galactic plane. the colours of the youngestsources still heavily embedded within their natal molecular clouds are ingeneral different from evolved stars shrouded within their own dust shells. ourmain motivation is to use msx for an unbiased search for a large (~1000) sampleof massive young stellar objects (mysos). a simple analysis shows that the msxpoint source catalogue should contain most of the mysos within our galaxy. wedevelop colour selection criteria using combined near- and mid-infrared datafor mysos, which produces a list of 3071 objects, excluding the galactic centreregion. the programme of follow-up observations already underway to separatethe mysos from compact h ii regions and other remaining objects is brieflydescribed. we also show that these data can be used, just as iras data has beenpreviously, to provide a separation between evolved stars with carbon rich andoxygen rich dust. these data may also be used to search for evidence of dustaround normal main sequence stars, such as low mass pre-main sequence stars orthe vega-excess class of objects where debris disks are presumed to remain fromthe planet formation process. we discuss the accuracy and completeness of themsx point source catalogue, and show that the errors present tend to be of akind that is not significant for the main stellar populations we discuss inthis paper.

astro-ph;0208322	a dynamical study of the circumstellar gas in ux orionis	we present the results of a high spectral resolution study of thecircumstellar (cs) gas around the intermediate mass, pre-main sequence star uxori. the results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the staron time scales of months, days and hours. a large number of transientblueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the balmer andin many metallic lines. a multigaussian fit is applied to determine for eachtransient absorption the velocity, v, dispersion velocity, delta v, and theparameter r, which provides a measure of the absorption strength of the cs gas.the time evolution of those parameters is presented and discussed. a comparisonof intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-likecomposition of the cs gas. this confirms previous results and excludes a verymetal-rich environment as the cause of the transient features in ux ori. thefeatures can be grouped by their similar velocities into 24 groups, of which 17are redshifted and 7 blueshifted. an analysis of the velocity of the groupsallows us to identify them as signatures of the dynamical evolution of 7 clumpsof gas, of which 4 represent accretion events and 3 outflow events. most of theevents decelerate at a rate of tenths of ms-2, while 2 events accelerate atapproximately the same rate; one event is seen experiencing both anacceleration and a deceleration phase and lasts for a period of few days. thistime scale seems to be the typical duration of outflowing and infalling eventsin ux ori. the dispersion velocity and the relative aborption strength of thefeatures do not show drastic changes during the lifetime of the events, whichsuggests they are gaseous blobs preserving their geometrical and physicalidentity.

astro-ph;0402614	dynamics of the circumstellar gas in the herbig ae stars bf orionis, sv  cephei, ww vulpeculae and xy persei	we present high resolution (lambda / delta_lambda = 49000) echelle spectra ofthe intermediate mass, pre-main sequence stars bf ori, sv cep, ww wul and xyper. the spectra cover the range 3800-5900 angstroms and monitor the stars ontime scales of months and days. all spectra show a large number of balmer andmetallic lines with variable blueshifted and redshifted absorption featuressuperimposed to the photospheric stellar spectra. synthetic kurucz models areused to estimate rotational velocities, effective temperatures and gravities ofthe stars. the best photospheric models are subtracted from each observedspectrum to determine the variable absorption features due to the circumstellargas; those features are characterized in terms of their velocity, v, dispersionvelocity, delta v, and residual absorption, r_max. the absorption componentsdetected in each spectrum can be grouped by their similar radial velocities andare interpreted as the signature of the dynamical evolution of gaseous clumpswith, in most cases, solar-like chemical composition. this infalling andoutflowing gas has similar properties to the circumstellar gas observed in uxori, emphasizing the need for detailed theoretical models, probably in theframework of the magnetospheric accretion scenario, to understand the complexenvironment in herbig ae (hae) stars. ww vul is unusual because, in addition toinfalling and outflowing gas with properties similar to those observed in theother stars, it shows also transient absorption features in metallic lines withno obvious counterparts in the hydrogen lines. this could, in principle,suggest the presence of cs gas clouds with enhanced metallicity around ww vul.the existence of such a metal-rich gas component, however, needs to beconfirmed by further observations and a more quantitative analysis.

astro-ph;0509662	near-infrared line spectropolarimetry of hot massive stars	in order to study the inner parts of the circumstellar material aroundoptically faint, infrared bright objects, we present the firstmedium-resolution spectropolarimetric data taken in the near-infrared. in thispaper we discuss pa beta line data of gl 490, a well-known embedded massiveyoung stellar object, and of mwc 349a and mwc 342, two optically faint starsthat are proposed to be in the pre-main sequence phase of evolution. as a checkon the method, the classical be star zeta tau, known to display linepolarization changes at optical wavelengths, was observed as well. three of ourtargets show a ``line effect'' across pa beta. for zeta tau and mwc 349a thisline effect is due to depolarisation by a circumstellar electron-scatteringdisk. in both cases, the position angle of the polarisation is consistent withthat of the larger scale disks imaged at other wavelengths, validating infraredspectropolarimetry as a means to detect flattening on small scales. thetentative detection of a rotation in the polarization position angle at pa betain the embedded massive young stellar object gl 490 suggests the presence of asmall scale rotating accretion disk with an inner hole - similar to thoserecently discovered at optical wavelengths in herbig ae and t tauri stars.

astro-ph;0511712	resolving the kinematic distance ambiguity of southern massive young  stellar object candidates	we investigate the use of hi data to resolve the near/far ambiguity inkinematic distances of massive young stellar object (myso) candidates.kinematic distances were obtained from 13co 1-0 spectral line observations withthe mopra telescope towards 94 candidates selected from the red msx source(rms) survey in the fourth galactic quadrant. hi data from the southerngalactic plane survey (spgs) was used in conjunction with the hiself-absorption technique to determine the near or far distance. we resolvedthe kinematic distance ambiguity to 70% of the sources. we can alsosimultaneously solve for any multiple line-of-sight component sources. wediscuss the advantages and disadvantages of this technique in comparison withother methods, and also perform confidence checks on the reliability of usingthe hi self-absorption technique. we examined the projected location of thesesources in both the galactic plane and longitude-velocity diagrams to ascertainany recognisable spiral arm pattern. although no obvious spiral pattern wasfound when compared to that proposed by cordes &amp; lazio, far distance sourcestended to lie on or near spiral arm loci. near distance sources, however, hadpeculiar velocity uncertainties consistent with the separation between thespiral arms themselves. the longitude-velocity plot shows a more consistentpicture, with tangent points of the spiral arm loci easily seen. we concludethat using the hi self-absorption technique to determine kinematic distanceambiguities is a quick and reliable method in most cases, with an 80% successrate in determining the correct designation of whether an object is at the nearor far distance.

astro-ph;0512589	a ch3cn and hco+ survey towards southern methanol masers associated with  star formation	we present the initial results of a 3-mm spectral line survey towards 83methanol maser selected massive star-forming regions. here we reportobservations of the j=5-4 and 6-5 rotational transitions of methyl cyanide(ch3cn) and the j=1-0 transition of hco+and h13co+.  ch3cn emission is detected in 58 sources (70 %) of our sample). we estimatethe temperature and column density for 37 of these using the rotational diagrammethod. the temperatures we derive range from 28-166 k, and are lower thanpreviously reported temperatures, derived from higher j transitions. we findthat ch3cn is brighter and more commonly detected towards ultra-compact hii(uchii) regions than towards isolated maser sources. detection of ch3cn towardsisolated maser sources strongly suggests that these objects are internallyheated and that ch3cn is excited prior to the uchii phase of massivestar-formation.  hco+ is detected towards 82 sources (99 % of our sample), many of whichexhibit asymmetric line profiles compared to h13co+. skewed profiles areindicative of inward or outward motions, however, we find approximately equalnumbers of red and blue-skewed profiles among all classes. column densities arederived from an analysis of the hco+ and h13co+ line profiles.  80 sources have mid-infrared counterparts: 68 seen in emission and 12 seen inabsorption as `dark clouds'. seven of the twelve dark clouds exhibit asymmetrichco+ profiles, six of which are skewed to the blue, indicating infallingmotions. ch3cn is also common in dark clouds, where it has a 90 % detectionrate.

astro-ph;0605738	the rms survey: radio observations of candidate massive ysos in the  southern hemisphere	the red msx source (rms) survey is a multi-wavelength program of follow-upobservations designed to distinguish between genuine massive young stellarobjects (mysos) and other embedded or dusty objects, such as ultra compact (uc)hii regions, evolved stars and planetary nebulae (pne). we have identifiednearly 2000 massive ysos candidates by comparing the colours of msx and 2masspoint sources to those of known mysos. unfortunately, there are several othertypes of embedded or dust enshrouded objects that have similar colours as mysosand contaminate our sample. two sources of contamination are from uchii regionsand pne, both of which can be identified from the radio emission emitted bytheir ionised nebulae. in order to identify uchii regions and pne thatcontaminate our sample we have conducted high resolution radio continuumobservations at 3.6 and 6 cm of all southern mysos candidates ($235&lt; l &lt; 350$)using the australia telescope compact array (atca). these observations have aspatial resolution of $\sim$1--2\arcsec and typical image rms noise values of$\sim$0.3 mjy -- sensitive enough to detect a b0.5 star at the far side of thegalaxy. of the 826 rms sources observed we found 199 to be associated withradio emission, $\sim$25% of the sample. more significant than those sourcesassociated with radio emission are the 627 rms sources for which no radioemission was detected as these sources are still potential mysos. the galacticdistribution, morphologies and spectral indices of the radio sources associatedwith the rms sources are consistent with these sources being uchii regions. inaddition to the 826 rms sources observed we present observations of a further190 fields. these observations were made towards msx sources that passed cutsin earlier versions of the survey, but were later excluded.

astro-ph;0610198	on the h$\alpha$ emission from the $\beta$ cephei system	be stars, which are characterised by intermittent emission in their hydrogenlines, are known to be fast rotators. this fast rotation is a requirement forthe formation of a keplerian disk, which in turn gives rise to the emission.however, the pulsating, magnetic b1iv star $\beta$ cephei is a very slowrotator that still shows h$\alpha$ emission episodes like in other be stars,contradicting current theories. we investigate the hypothesis that theh$\alpha$ emission stems from the spectroscopically unresolved companion of$\beta$ cep. spectra of the two unresolved components have been separated inthe 6350-6850\aa range with spectro-astrometric techniques, using 11 longslitspectra obtained with alfosc at the nordic optical telescope, la palma. we findthat the h$\alpha$ emission is not related to the primary in $\beta$ cep, butis due to its 3.4 magnitudes fainter companion. this companion has beenresolved by speckle techniques, but it remains unresolved by traditionalspectroscopy. the emission extends from about $-$400 to +400 km s$^{-1}$. thecompanion star in its 90-year orbit is likely to be a classical be star with aspectral type around b6-8. by identifying its be-star companion as the originof the h$\alpha$ emission behaviour, the enigma behind the be status of theslow rotator $\beta$ cep has been resolved.

astro-ph;9906120	the spectral evolution of post-agb stars	a parameter study of the spectral evolution of a typical post-agb star, withparticular emphasis on the evolution of the infrared colours, is presented. themodels are based on the latest evolutionary tracks for hydrogen burningpost-agb stars. for such tracks the evolutionary rate is very dependent on theassumed mass loss rate as a function of time. we investigate this effect bymodifying the mass loss prescription. the newly calculated evolutionary ratesand density distributions are used to model the spectral evolution of apost-agb star with the photo-ionization code cloudy, including dust in theradiative transfer. different assumptions for the dust properties and dustformation are considered. it is shown that by varying these parameters in areasonable way, entirely different paths are followed in the iras colour-colourdiagram. first of all, the effects of the evolution of the central star on theexpanding dust shell can not be neglected. also the dust properties and thedefinition of the end of the agb phase have an important effect. the modeltracks show that objects occupying the same location in the iras colour-colourdiagram can have a different evolutionary past, and therefore the position inthe iras colour-colour diagram alone can not a priori give a uniquedetermination of the evolutionary status of an object. an alternativecolour-colour diagram, the k-[12] vs. [12]-[25] diagram, is presented. thetracks in this diagram seem less affected by particulars of the grain emission.this diagram may be a valuable additional tool for studying post-agb evolution.
