1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3018	a search for debris disks in the herschel atlas	aims: we aim to demonstrate that the herschel atlas (h-atlas) is suitable fora blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debrisdisks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstrationfield of the survey. we show that h-atlas reveals a population offar-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objectson the sdss main-sequence locus. we validate our approach by comparing theproperties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.methods: we use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequencestars in the sdss dr7 catalogue and a bayesian likelihood ratio method toidentify h-atlas catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify themost likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminatinggalaxies using ukidss las k-band images. results: we identify 78 h-atlassources associated with sdss point sources on the main-sequence locus, of whichtwo are the most likely debris disk candidates: h-atlas j090315.8 and h-atlasj090240.2. we show that they are plausible candidates by comparing theirproperties to the known population of debris disks. our initial resultsindicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identifiedin a search sample of 851 stars. we also show that h-atlas can derive usefulupper limits for debris disks associated with hipparcos stars in the field andoutline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.0673	hermes : spire detection of high redshift massive compact galaxies in  goods-n field	we have analysed the rest-frame far infrared (fir) properties of a sample ofmassive (mstar &gt; 10^11msun) galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3 in the goods (great observatoriesorigins deep survey) north field using the spectral and photometric imagingreceiver (spire) instrument aboard the herschel space observatory. to conductthis analysis we take advantage of the data from the hermes key program. thesample comprises 45 massive galaxies with structural parameters characterisedwith hst nicmos-3. we study detections at submm herschel bands, together withspitzer 24{\mu}m data, as a function of the morphological type, mass and size.we find that 26/45 sources are detected at mips-24{\mu}m and 15/45 (allmips-24{\mu}m detections) are detected at spire-250{\mu}m, with disk-likegalaxies more easily detected. we derive star formation rates (sfr) andspecific star formation rates (ssfr) by fitting the spectral energydistribution (sed) of our sources, taking into account non-detections for spireand systematic effects for mips derived quantities. we find that the mean sfrfor the spheroidal galaxies (50-100 msun*yr^-1) is substantially (a factor ~ 3)lower than the mean value presented by disk-like galaxies (250-300 msun*yr^-1).

1010.5782	the first release of data from the herschel atlas: the spire images	we have reduced the data taken with the spectral and photometric imagingreceiver (spire) photometer on board the herschel space observatory in thescience demonstration phase (sdp) of the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas). we describe the data reduction, which poses specificchallenges, both because of the sheer size of the data, and because only twoscans are made for each region. we implement effective solutions to process thebolometric timelines into maps, and show that correlations among detectors arenegligible, and that the photometer is stable on time scales up to 250 s. thisis longer than the time the telescope takes to cross the observed sky region,and it allows us to use naive binning methods for an optimal reconstruction ofthe sky emission. the maps have equal contribution of confusion and whiteinstrumental noise, and the latter is estimated to 5.3, 6.4, and 6.7 mjy/beam(1-{\sigma}), at 250, 350, and 500 \mu{m}, respectively. this pipeline is usedto reduce other h-atlas observations, as they became available, and we discusshow it can be used with the optimal map maker implemented in the herschelinteractive processing environment (hipe), to improve computational efficiencyand stability. the sdp dataset is available from http://www.h-atlas.org/.

1010.5787	herschel-atlas: first data release of the science demonstration phase  source catalogues	the herschel-atlas is a survey of 550 square degrees with the herschel spaceobservatory in five far--infrared and submillimetre bands. the first data forthe survey, observations of a field 4x4 sq. degrees in size, were taken duringthe science demonstration phase, and reach a 5 sigma noise level of 33 mjy/beamat 250 microns. this paper describes the source extraction methods used tocreate the corresponding science demonstration phase catalogue, which contains6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees. spire sourcesare extracted using a new method specifically developed for herschel data; pacscounterparts of these sources are identified using circular apertures placed atthe spire positions. aperture flux densities are measured for sourcesidentified as extended after matching to optical wavelengths. the reliabilityof this catalogue is also discussed, using full simulated maps at the threespire bands. these show that a significant number of sources at 350 and 500microns have undergone flux density enhancements of up to a factor of ~2, duemainly to source confusion. correction factors are determined for theseeffects. the sdp dataset and corresponding catalogue will be available fromhttp://www.h-atlas.org/.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1112.3653	spitzer irac identification of herschel-atlas spire sources	we use spitzer-irac data to identify near-infrared counterparts tosubmillimeter galaxies detected with herschel-spire at 250um in the herschelastrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas). using a likelihood ratioanalysis we identify 146 reliable irac counterparts to 123 spire sources out ofthe 159. we find that, compared to the field population, the spire counterpartsoccupy a distinct region of 3.6 and 4.5um color-magnitude space, and we usethis property to identify a further 23 counterparts to 13 spire sources. theirac identification rate of 86% is significantly higher than those that havebeen demonstrated with wide-field ground-based optical and near-ir imaging ofherschel fields. we estimate a false identification rate of 3.6%, correspondingto 4 to 5 sources. among the 73 counterparts that are undetected in sdss, 57have both 3.6 and 4.5um coverage. of these 43 have [3.6] - [4.5]&gt; 0 indicatingthat they are likely to be at z &gt; 1.4. thus, ~ 40% of identified spire galaxiesare likely to be high redshift (z &gt; 1.4) sources. we discuss the statisticalproperties of the irac-identified spire galaxy sample including far-irluminosities, dust temperatures, star-formation rates, and stellar masses. themajority of our detected galaxies have 10^10 to 10^11 l_sun total irluminosities and are not intense starbursting galaxies as those found at z ~ 2,but they have a factor of 2 to 3 above average specific star-formation ratescompared to near-ir selected galaxy samples.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1208.3079	herschel-atlas: multi-wavelength seds and physical properties of 250  micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5	we present a pan-chromatic analysis of an unprecedented sample of 1402 250micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5 (mean z = 0.24) from the herschel-atlassurvey. we complement our herschel 100-500 micron data with uv-k-bandphotometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey and apply themagphys energy-balance technique to produce pan-chromatic seds for arepresentative sample of 250 micron selected galaxies spanning the most recent5 gyr of cosmic history. we derive estimates of physical parameters, includingstar formation rates, stellar masses, dust masses and infrared luminosities.the typical h-atlas galaxy at z &lt; 0.5 has a far-infrared luminosity in therange 10^10 - 10^12 lsolar (sfr: 1-50 msolar/yr) thus is broadly representativeof normal star forming galaxies over this redshift range. we show that 250micron-selected galaxies contain a larger mass of dust at a given infra-redluminosity or star formation rate than previous samples selected at 60 micronfrom iras. we derive typical seds for h-atlas galaxies, and show that theemergent sed shape is most sensitive to specific star formation rate. theoptical-uv seds also become more reddened due to dust at higher redshifts. ourtemplate seds are significantly cooler than existing infra-red templates. theymay therefore be most appropriate for inferring total ir luminosities frommoderate redshift submillimetre selected samples and for inclusion in models ofthe lower redshift submillimetre galaxy populations.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1211.6668	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: blank-field number counts of  450um-selected galaxies and their contribution to the cosmic infrared  background	the first deep blank-field 450um map (1-sigma~1.3mjy) from the scuba-2cosmology legacy survey (s2cls), conducted with the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt) is presented. our map covers 140 arcmin^2 of the cosmos field,in the footprint of the hst candels area. using 60 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) detected at &gt;3.75-sigma, we evaluate the number counts of 450um-selectedgalaxies with flux densities s_450&gt;5mjy. the 8-arcsec jcmt beam and highsensitivity of scuba-2 now make it possible to directly resolve a largerfraction of the cosmic infrared background (cib, peaking at ~200um) into theindividual galaxies responsible for its emission than has previously beenpossible at this wavelength. at s_450&gt;5mjy we resolve (7.4[+/-]0.7)x10^-2mjy/sr of the cib at 450um (equivalent to 16[+/-]7% of the absolute brightnessmeasured by cobe at this wavelength) into point sources. a further ~40% of thecib can be recovered through a statistical stack of 24um emitters in thisfield, indicating that the majority (~60%) of the cib at 450um is emitted bygalaxies with s_450&gt;2mjy. the average redshift of 450um emitters identifiedwith an optical/near-infrared counterpart is estimated to be &lt;z&gt;=1.3, implyingthat the galaxies in the sample are in the ultraluminous class (l_ir~1.1x10^12l_sun). if the galaxies contributing to the statistical stack lie at similarredshifts, then the majority of the cib at 450um is emitted by galaxies in thelirg class with l_ir&gt;3.6x10^11 l_sun.

1212.2650	inferring the mass of sub-millimetre galaxies by exploiting their  gravitational magnification of background galaxies	dust emission at sub-millimetre wavelengths allows us to trace the earlyphases of star formation in the universe. in order to understand the physicalprocesses involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gainknowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses -that sub-millimetre galaxies live in. here we use the magnification effect ofgravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content ofsub-millimetre galaxies with 250mu flux densities of s_250&gt;15mjy selected usingdata from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey. the positions ofhundreds of sub-millimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with thepositions of background lyman-break galaxies at z~3-5 selected using opticaldata from the canada-france hawaii telescope legacy survey. we detect across-correlation signal at the 7-sigma level over a sky area of one squaredegree, with ~80% of this signal being due to magnification, whereas theremaining ~20% comes from dust extinction. adopting some simple assumptions forthe dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us toestimate the average mass of the halos hosting the sub-millimetre galaxies tobe log(m_200/m_sun)=13.17+0.05-0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction(at radii of &gt;10kpc) to be m_dust/m_200~6x10^-5. this supports the picture thatsub-millimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside inmassive group-sized halos, and are a crucial phase in the assembly andevolution of structure in the universe.

0712.3613	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - ix: the  environment, mass and redshift dependence of star formation	we present a comparison between the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) at 450 and 850 microns in the lockman hole east with a deep spitzerspace telescope survey at 3.6-24 microns conducted in guaranteed time. usingstacking analyses we demonstrate a striking correspondence between the galaxiescontributing the submm extragalactic background light, with those likely todominate the backgrounds at spitzer wavelengths. using a combination brizk plusspitzer photometric redshifts, we show that at least a third of thespitzer-identified submm galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 appear to reside in overdensitieswhen the density field is smoothed at 0.5-2 mpc comoving diameters, supportingthe high-redshift reversal of the local star formation - galaxy densityrelation. we derive the dust-shrouded cosmic star formation history of galaxiesas a function of assembled stellar masses. for model stellar masses &lt;10^11msun, this peaks at lower redshifts than the ostensible z~2.2 maximum for submmpoint sources, adding to the growing consensus for ``downsizing'' in starformation. our surveys are also consistent with ``downsizing'' in massassembly. both the mean star formation rates &lt;dm/dt&gt; and specific starformation rates &lt;(1/m)dm/dt&gt; are in striking disagreement with somesemi-analytic predictions from the millenium simulation. the discrepancy couldeither be resolved with a top-heavy initial mass function, or a significantcomponent of the submm flux heated by the interstellar radiation field.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1308.5681	h-atlas: estimating redshifts of herschel sources from sub-mm fluxes	upon its completion the herschel atlas (h-atlas) will be the largestsubmillimetre survey to date, detecting close to half-a-million sources. itwill only be possible to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a small fractionof these sources. however, if the rest-frame spectral energy distribution (sed)of a typical h-atlas source is known, this sed and the observed herschel fluxescan be used to estimate the redshifts of the h-atlas sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts. in this paper, we use a subset of 40 h-atlas sourceswith previously measured redshifts in the range 0.5&lt;z&lt;4.2 to derive a suitableaverage template for high redshift h-atlas sources. we find that a templatewith two dust components t_c = 23.9 k, t_h = 46.9 k and ratio of mass of colddust to mass of warm dust of 30.1) provides a good fit to the rest-frame fluxesof the sources in our calibration sample. we use a jackknife technique toestimate the accuracy of the redshifts estimated with this template, finding aroot mean square of delta z/(1+z) = 0.26. for sources for which there is priorinformation that they lie at z &gt; 1 we estimate that the rms of delta z/(1+z) =0.12. we have used this template to estimate the redshift distribution for thesources detected in the h-atlas equatorial fields, finding a bimodaldistribution with a mean redshift of 1.2, 1.9 and 2.5 for 250, 350 and 500 umselected sources respectively. \end{abstract}

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1401.0986	herschel-atlas/gama:how does the far-ir luminosity function depend on  galaxy group properties?	we use the herschel atlas (h-atlas) phase i data to study the conditionalluminosity function of far-ir (250 um) selected galaxies in optically-selectedgalaxy groups from the gama spectroscopic survey, as well as environmentaleffects on the far-ir-to-optical colour. we applied two methods, which gaveconsistent results for the far-ir conditional luminosity functions. the directmatching method matches h-atlas sources to gama/sdss galaxies, then links theoptical counterparts to gama groups. the stacking method counts the number offar-ir sources within the projected radii of gama groups, subtracting the localbackground. we investigated the dependence of the far-ir (250 um) luminosityfunction on group mass in the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt; 10d14msun/h and on redshiftin the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, using a sample of 3000 groups containing h-atlassources with gama redshifts over an area of 126 sq. deg. we find that thecharacteristic 250 um luminosity, l^*(250), increases with group mass up to m_h~ 10d13msun/h, but is roughly constant above this, while it increases withredshift at high group masses, but less so at low masses. we also find that thegroup far-ir luminosity-to-mass ratio l(250)/m_h increases with redshift and ishigher in low-mass groups. we estimate that around 70% of the 250 um luminositydensity in the local universe is contributed by groups with m_h &gt; 10d12msun/h.we also find that the far-ir-to-optical colours of h-atlas galaxies areindependent of group mass over the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt;10d14msun/h in the localuniverse. we also compare our observational results with recent semi-analyticalmodels, and find that none of these galaxy formation model can reproduce theconditional far-ir luminosity functions of galaxy groups.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1403.2994	herschel-atlas: properties of dusty massive galaxies at low and high  redshifts	we present a comparison of the physical properties of a rest-frame $250\mu$mselected sample of massive, dusty galaxies from $0&lt;z&lt;5.3$. our sample comprises29 high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs) from the literature, and 843dusty galaxies at $z&lt;0.5$ from the herschel-atlas, selected to have a similarstellar mass to the smgs. the $z&gt;1$ smgs have an average sfr of$390^{+80}_{-70}\,$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ which is 120 times that of thelow-redshift sample matched in stellar mass to the smgs (sfr$=3.3\pm{0.2}$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). the smgs harbour a substantial mass of dust($1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times{10}^9\,$m$_\odot$), compared to$(1.6\pm0.1)\times{10}^8\,$m$_\odot$ for low-redshift dusty galaxies. at lowredshifts the dust luminosity is dominated by the diffuse ism, whereas a largefraction of the dust luminosity in smgs originates from star-forming regions.at the same dust mass smgs are offset towards a higher sfr compared to thelow-redshift h-atlas galaxies. this is not only due to the higher gas fractionin smgs but also because they are undergoing a more efficient mode of starformation, which is consistent with their bursty star-formation histories. theoffset in sfr between smgs and low-redshift galaxies is similar to that foundin co studies, suggesting that dust mass is as good a tracer of molecular gasas co.

1404.5676	herschel-atlas: far-infrared properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet  quasars	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from thefaint im- ages radio sky at twenty-one centimetres (first) and the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7), over the h-atlas phase 1 area(9h, 12h and 14.5h). using a stacking analysis we find a significantcorrelation between the far-infrared luminosity and 1.4-ghz luminosity forradio-loud quasars. partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsiccorrelation after removing the redshift contribution while for radio-quietquasars no partial correlation is found. using a single-temperature grey-bodymodel we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in the case ofradio-loud quasars comparing to radio-quiet quasars. also, radio-loud quasarsare found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift andoptical luminosity bins. in addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at loweroptical luminosities tend to have on average higher fir and 250-micronluminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same opticalluminosites. even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe thefir data, the fir luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.these results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with starformation especially at lower accretion rates.

1406.1487	lens models of herschel-selected galaxies from high-resolution near-ir  observations	we present keck-adaptive optics and hubble space telescope high resolutionnear-infrared (ir) imaging for 500 um-bright candidate lensing systemsidentified by the herschel multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) andherschel astrophysical terahertz survey (h-atlas). out of 87 candidates withnear-ir imaging, 15 (~17%) display clear near-ir lensing morphologies. wepresent near-ir lens models to reconstruct and recover basic rest-frame opticalmorphological properties of the background galaxies from 12 new systems.sources with the largest near-ir magnification factors also tend to be the mostcompact, consistent with the size bias predicted from simulations and pre-vious lensing models for sub-millimeter galaxies. for four new sources thatalso have high-resolution sub-mm maps, we test for differential lensing betweenthe stellar and dust components and find that the 880 um magnification factor(u_880) is ~1.5 times higher than the near-ir magnification factor (u_nir), onaverage. we also find that the stellar emission is ~2 times more extended insize than dust. the rest-frame optical properties of our sample ofherschel-selected lensed smgs are consistent with those of unlensed smgs, whichsuggests that the two populations are similar.

1407.5994	colour matters: the effects of lensing on the positional offsets between  optical and submillimetre galaxies in herschel-atlas	we report an unexpected variation in the positional offset distributionsbetween herschel-atlas sub-millimetre (submm) sources and their opticalassociations, depending on both 250-{\mu}m signal-to-noise ratio and250/350-{\mu}m colour. we show that redder and brighter submm sources haveoptical associations with a broader distribution of positional offsets thanwould be expected if these offsets were due to random positional errors in thesource extraction. the observation can be explained by two possible effects:either red submm sources trace a more clustered population than blue ones, andtheir positional errors are increased by confusion; or red submm sources aregenerally at high redshifts and are frequently associated with low-redshiftlensing structures which are identified as false counterparts. we performvarious analyses of the data, including the multiplicity of opticalassociations, the redshift and magnitude distributions in h-atlas in comparisonto hermes, and simulations of weak lensing, and we conclude that the effectsare most likely to be explained by widespread weak lensing of herschel-spiresources by foreground structures. this has important consequences forcounterpart identification and derived redshift distributions and luminosityfunctions of submm surveys.

1409.2499	the temperature dependence of the far-infrared-radio correlation in the  herschel-atlas	we use 10,387 galaxies from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) to probe the far-infrared radio correlation (firc) of starforming galaxies as a function of redshift, wavelength, and effective dusttemperature. all of the sources in our 250 {\mu}m-selected sample havespectroscopic redshifts, as well as 1.4 ghz flux density estimates measuredfrom the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres (first) survey.this enables us to study not only individual sources, but also the averageproperties of the 250 {\mu}m selected population using median stackingtechniques. we find that individual sources detected at $\geq 5\sigma$ in boththe h-atlas and first data have logarithmic flux ratios (i.e. firc $q_\lambda$parameters) consistent with previous studies of the firc. in contrast, thestacked values show larger $q_\lambda$, suggesting excess far-ir fluxdensity/luminosity in 250{\mu}m selected sources above what has been seen inprevious analyses. in addition, we find evidence that 250 {\mu}m sources withwarm dust seds have a larger 1.4 ghz luminosity than the cooler sources in oursample. though we find no evidence for redshift evolution of the monochromaticfirc, our analysis reveals significant temperature dependence. whilst the fircis reasonably constant with temperature at 100 {\mu}m, we find increasinginverse correlation with temperature as we probe longer pacs and spirewavelengths. these results may have important implications for the use ofmonochromatic dust luminosity as a star formation rate indicator instar-forming galaxies, and in the future, for using radio data to determinegalaxy star formation rates.

1410.4502	cross-correlation between the cmb lensing potential measured by planck  and high-z sub-mm galaxies detected by the herschel-atlas survey	we present the first measurement of the correlation between the map of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) lensing potential derived from the\emph{planck} nominal mission data and $z\gtrsim 1.5$ galaxies detected by the\emph{herschel}-atlas (h-atlas) survey covering about $600\,\hbox{deg}^2$, i.e.about 1.4\% of the sky. we reject the hypothesis that there is no correlationbetween cmb lensing and galaxy detection at a $20\,\sigma$ significance,checking the result by performing a number of null tests. the significance ofthe detection of the theoretically expected cross-correlation signal is foundto be $10\,\sigma$. the galaxy bias parameter, $b$, derived from a jointanalysis of the cross-power spectrum and of the auto-power spectrum of thegalaxy density contrast is found to be $b=2.80^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, consistentwith earlier estimates for h-atlas galaxies at similar redshifts. on the otherhand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be a factor $1.62 \pm0.16$ higher than expected from the standard model and also found bycross-correlation analyses with other tracers of the large-scale structure. theenhancement due to lensing magnification can account for only a fraction of theexcess cross-correlation signal. we suggest that part of it may be due to anincomplete removal of the contamination of the cib, that includes the h-atlassources we are cross-correlating with. in any case, the highly significantdetection reported here using a catalog covering only 1.4\% of the skydemonstrates the potential of cmb lensing correlations with submillimetersurveys.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1503.01128	a multi-wavelength exploration of the [cii]/ir ratio in h-atlas/gama  galaxies out to z=0.2	we explore the behaviour of [cii]-157.74um forbidden fine-structure lineobserved in a sample of 28 galaxies selected from ~50deg^2 of the h-atlassurvey. the sample is restricted to galaxies with flux densities higher thans_160um&gt;150mjy and optical spectra from the gama survey at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2. far-irspectra centred on this redshifted line were taken with the pacs instrumenton-board the herschel space observatory. the galaxies span 10&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12(where l_ir=l_ir[8-1000um]) and 7.3&lt;log(l_[cii]/lo)&lt;9.3, covering a variety ofoptical galaxy morphologies. the sample exhibits the so-called [cii] deficit athigh ir luminosities, i.e. l_[cii]/l_ir (hereafter [cii]/ir) decreases at highl_ir. we find significant differences between those galaxies presenting[cii]/ir&gt;2.5x10^-3 with respect to those showing lower ratios. in particular,those with high ratios tend to have: (1) l_ir&lt;10^11lo; (2) cold dusttemperatures, t_d&lt;30k; (3) disk-like morphologies in r-band images; (4) a wisecolour 0.5&lt;s_12um/s_22um&lt;1.0; (5) low surface brightness sigma_ir~10^8-9 lokpc^-2, (6) and specific star-formation rates of ssfr~0.05-3 gyr^-1. we suggestthat the strength of the far-uv radiation fields (&lt;g_o&gt;) is main parameterresponsible for controlling the [cii]/ir ratio. it is possible that relativelyhigh &lt;g_o&gt; creates a positively charged dust grain distribution, impeding anefficient photo-electric extraction of electrons from these grains to thencollisionally excite carbon atoms. within the brighter ir population,11&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12, the low [cii]/ir ratio is unlikely to be modified by [cii]self absorption or controlled by the presence of a moderately luminous agn(identified via the bpt diagram).

1511.07430	the bolometric and uv attenuation in normal spiral galaxies of the  herschel reference survey	the dust in nearby galaxies absorbs a fraction of theuv-optical-near-infrared radiation produced by stars. this energy isconsequently re-emitted in the infrared. we investigate the portion of thestellar radiation absorbed by spiral galaxies from the hrs by modelling theiruv-to-submillimetre spectral energy distributions. our models provide anattenuated and intrinsic sed from which we find that on average 32 % of allstarlight is absorbed by dust. we define the uv heating fraction as thepercentage of dust luminosity that comes from absorbed uv photons and find thatthis is 56 %, on average. this percentage varies with morphological type, withlater types having significantly higher uv heating fractions. we find a strongcorrelation between the uv heating fraction and specific star formation rateand provide a power-law fit. our models allow us to revisit the irx-afuvrelations, and derive these quantities directly within a self-consistentframework. we calibrate this relation for different bins of nuv-r colour andprovide simple relations to relate these parameters. we investigated therobustness of our method and we conclude that the derived parameters arereliable within the uncertainties which are inherent to the adopted sed model.this calls for a deeper investigation on how well extinction and attenuationcan be determined through panchromatic sed modelling.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.

astro-ph;0208548	deep spectroscopy of z~1 6c radio galaxies - i. the effects of radio  power and size on the properties of the emission line gas	(abridged) the results of deep long-slit optical spectroscopy for a sample of8 6c radio galaxies at z~1 are presented. emission line ratios are derived foremission lines with rest-frame wavelengths of 1500 - 4500ang, and the kinematicpropertiess of the emission line gas are derived from an analysis of the 2-dstructure of thee [oii]3727 ang emission line at ~5ang spectral resolution. ingeneral, the 6c spectra display many characteristics similar to those of morepowerful 3cr sources at the same redshifts. the emission line region gaskinematics are more extreme for the smaller radio sources in the sample, whichoften display distorted velocity profiles. the ionization state of the emissionline region also varies with radio size: the spectra of large radio sources(&gt;120kpc) are consistent with photoionization by an obscured agn, whilstsmaller (&lt;120kpc) sources typically exist in a lower ionization state and havespectra which are better explained by additional ionization due to shocksassociated with the expanding radio source. the kinematic and ionizationproperties of the 6c radio galaxies are clearly linked. as for the 3cr sources,smaller radio sources also typically possess more extensive emission lineregions, with enhanced emission line luminosities. it is clear that the bestinterpretation of the spectra of radio sources requires a combination ofionization mechanisms.

astro-ph;0609287	the evolution of the near-ir galaxy luminosity function and colour  bimodality up to z ~ 2 from the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infraredgalaxy luminosity function, derived from the analysis of a new sample of\~22,000 k(ab) &lt; 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees fromthe early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds). our study hasexploited the multi-wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the newukidss wfcam k and j-band imaging, the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and thespitzer-swire survey. the unique combination of large area and depth providedby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and hasallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sourcesout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.  in agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosityof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0and z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2. using the rest-frame(u-b) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm theclassic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z&lt;1. however, the strength ofthe colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, andseems to disappear by z&gt;1.5. due to the large size of our sample we are able toinvestigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxypopulations. it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies(m_k &lt; -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sourcesdominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&lt;1. incontrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease inspace density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominatethe bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&gt;1.

astro-ph;9811202	15um iso observations of a cfrs field: the cosmic sfr as derived from  uv, optical, mid-ir and radio photometry	the cfrs 1452+52 field has been deeply imaged with the infrared spaceobservatory (iso) using isocam through the lw3 filter (12-18um). careful dataanalysis and comparison to deep optical and radio data have allowed us togenerate a catalog of 78 15um sources with both radio and opticalidentifications. they are redder and lie at higher redshift than i-bandselected galaxies, with most of them being star-forming galaxies. we haveconsidered the galaxies detected at radio and 15$\mu$m wavelengths whichpotentially include all strong and heavily extincted starbursts, up to z=1.spectral energy distributions (sed) for each of the sources have been derivedusing deep radio, mid-ir, near-ir, optical and uv photometry. the sources werethen spectrally classified by comparing to seds of well known nearby galaxies.by deriving their fir luminosities by interpolation, we can estimate their starformation rate (sfr) in a way which does not depend sensitively on theextinction. 75% (-40%, +10%) of the star formation at $z \le 1$ is related toir emission and the global extinction is in the range av=0.5 -- 0.85. whileheavily extincted starbursts, with sfr in excess of 100 mo/yr constitute lessthan a percent of all galaxies, they contribute about 18% of the sfr densityout to z=1. their morphologies range from s0 to sab, and more than a third areinteracting systems. the sfr derived by fir fluxes is likely to be ~2.9 timeshigher than those previously estimated from uv fluxes. the derived stellar massformed since the redshift of 1 could be too high when compared to the presentday stellar mass density. this might be due to an imf in distant star-forminggalaxies different from the solar neighborhood one, or to an underestimate ofthe local stellar mass density.
