0901.3781	central mass-to-light ratios and dark matter fractions in early-type  galaxies	dynamical studies of local etgs and the fundamental plane point to a strongdependence of m/l ratio on luminosity (and stellar mass) with a relation of theform $m/l \propto l^{\gamma}$. the "tilt" $\gamma$ may be caused by variousfactors, including stellar population properties, imf, rotational support,luminosity profile non-homology and dark matter (dm) fraction. we evaluate theimpact of all these factors using a large uniform dataset of local etgs fromprugniel &amp; simien (1997). we take particular care in estimating the stellarmasses, using a general star formation history, and comparing differentpopulation synthesis models. we find that the stellar m/l contributes little tothe tilt. we estimate the total m/l using simple jeans dynamical models, andfind that adopting accurate luminosity profiles is important but does notremove the need for an additional tilt component, which we ascribe to dm. wesurvey trends of the dm fraction within one effective radius, finding it to beroughly constant for galaxies fainter than $m_b \sim -20.5$, and increasingwith luminosity for the brighter galaxies; we detect no significant differencesamong s0s and fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals. we construct simplifiedcosmological mass models and find general consistency, where the dm transitionpoint is caused by a change in the relation between luminosity and effectiveradius. a more refined model with varying galaxy star formation efficiencysuggests a transition from total mass profiles (including dm) of faint galaxiesdistributed similarly to the light, to near-isothermal profiles for the brightgalaxies. these conclusions are sensitive to various systematic uncertaintieswhich we investigate in detail, but are consistent with the results of dynamicsstudies at larger radii.

0902.4383	on the origin of the scatter around the fundamental plane: correlations  with stellar population parameters	we present a fundamental plane (fp) analysis of 141 early-type galaxies inthe shapley supercluster at z=0.049 based on spectroscopy from the aaomegaspectrograph at the aat and photometry from the wfi on the eso/mpi 2.2mtelescope. the key feature of the survey is its coverage of low-mass galaxiesdown to sigma_0~50km/s. we obtain a best-fitting fp relation log r_e=1.06 logsigma_0 - 0.82 log &lt; i &gt;_e + cst in the r band. the shallow exponent of sigma_0is a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions. weinvestigate the origin of the intrinsic fp scatter, using estimates of age,metallicity and alpha/fe. we find that the fp residuals anti-correlate(&gt;3sigma) with the mean stellar age in agreement with previous work. however, astronger (&gt;4sigma) correlation with alpha/fe is also found. these correlationsindicate that galaxies with effective radii smaller than those predicted by thefp have stellar populations systematically older and with alpha over-abundanceslarger than average, for their sigma_0. including alpha/fe as a fourthparameter in the fp, the total scatter decreases from 0.088 dex to 0.075 dexand the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 dex to 0.049 dex.thus, variations in alpha/fe account for &gt;&gt; 30% of the total variance aroundthe fp, and &gt;&gt; 50% of the estimated intrinsic variance. this result indicatesthat the distribution of galaxies around the fp are tightly related to theenrichment, and hence to the timescale of star-formation. our results appear tobe consistent with the merger hypothesis for the formation of ellipticals whichpredicts that a significant fraction of the scatter is due to variations in theimportance of dissipation in forming merger remnants of a given mass.

0903.4758	sersic galaxy with sersic halo models of early-type galaxies: a tool for  n-body simulations	we present spherical, non-rotating, isotropic models of early-type galaxieswith stellar and dark-matter components both described by deprojected sersicdensity profiles, and prove that they represent physically admissible stablesystems. using empirical correlations and recent results of n-body simulations,all the free parameters of the models are expressed as functions of one singlequantity: the total (b-band) luminosity of the stellar component.  we analyze how to perform discrete n-body realizations of sersic models. tothis end, an optimal smoothing length is derived, defined as the softeningparameter minimizing the error on the gravitational potential for thedeprojected sersic model. it is shown to depend on the sersic index $n$ and onthe number of particles of the n-body realization.  a software code allowing the computations of the relevant quantities of one-and two-component sersic models is provided. both the code and the results ofthe present work are primarily intended as tools to perform n-body simulationsof early-type galaxies, where the structural non-homology of these systems(i.e. the variation of the shape parameter along the galaxy sequence) might betaken into account.

1004.4896	color and stellar population gradients in galaxies. correlation with  mass	we analyze the color gradients (cgs) of ~50000 nearby sdss galaxies. fromsynthetic spectral models based on a simplified star formation recipe, wederive the mean spectral properties, and explain the observed radial trends ofthe color as gradients of the stellar population age and metallicity (z). themost massive etgs (m_* &gt; 10^{11} msun) have shallow cgs in correspondence ofshallow (negative) z gradients. in the stellar mass range 10^(10.3-10.5) &lt; m_*&lt; 10^(11) msun, the z gradients reach their minimum of ~ -0.5 dex^{-1}. at m_*~ 10^{10.3-10.5} msun, color and z gradient slopes suddenly change. they turnout to anti-correlate with the mass, becoming highly positive at the very lowmasses. we have also found that age gradients anti-correlate with z gradients,as predicted by hierarchical cosmological simulations for etgs. on the otherside, ltgs have gradients which systematically decrease with mass (and arealways more negative than in etgs), consistently with the expectation from gasinfall and sn feedback scenarios. z is found to be the main driver of the trendof color gradients, especially for ltgs, but age gradients are not negligibleand seem to play a significant role too. we have been able to highlight thatolder galaxies have systematically shallower age and z gradients than youngerones. our results for high-mass galaxies are in perfect agreement withpredictions based on the merging scenario, while the evolution of ltgs andyounger and less massive etgs seems to be mainly driven by infall and snfeedback.

1010.1533	the pn.s elliptical galaxy survey: a standard lcdm halo around ngc 4374?	as part of our current programme to test lcdm predictions for dark matter(dm) haloes using extended kinematical observations of early-type galaxies, wepresent a dynamical analysis of the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 4374 (m84)based on ~450 planetary nebulae (pne) velocities from the pn.spectrograph,along with extended long-slit stellar kinematics. this is the first suchanalysis of a galaxy from our survey with a radially constant velocitydispersion profile. we find that the spatial and kinematical distributions ofthe pne agree with the field stars in the region of overlap. the velocitykurtosis is consistent with zero at almost all radii. we construct a series ofjeans models, fitting both velocity dispersion and kurtosis to help break themass-anisotropy degeneracy. our mass models include dm halos either withshallow cores or with central cusps as predicted by cosmological simulations -along with the novel introduction in this context of adiabatic halo contractionfrom baryon infall. both classes of models confirm a very massive dark haloaround ngc 4374, demonstrating that pn kinematics data are well able to detectsuch haloes when present. considering the default cosmological mass model, weconfirm earlier suggestions that bright galaxies tend to have haloconcentrations higher than lcdm predictions, but this is found to be solved ifeither a salpeter imf or adiabatic contraction with a kroupa imf is assumed.thus for the first time a case is found where the pn dynamics may well beconsistent with a standard dark matter halo. a cored halo can also fit thedata, and prefers a stellar mass consistent with a salpeter imf. the lessdramatic dark matter content found in lower-luminosity "ordinary" ellipticalssuggests a bimodality in the halo properties which may be produced by divergentbaryonic effects during their assembly histories.

1101.5092	unravelling the origins of s0 galaxies using maximum likelihood analysis  of planetary nebulae kinematics	to investigate the origins of s0 galaxies, we present a new method ofanalyzing their stellar kinematics from discrete tracers such as planetarynebulae. this method involves binning the data in the radial direction so as toextract the most general possible non-parametric kinematic profiles, and usinga maximum likelihood fit within each bin in order to make full use of theinformation in the discrete kinematic tracers. both disk and spheroid kinematiccomponents are fitted, with a two-dimensional decomposition of imaging dataused to attribute to each tracer a probability of membership in the separatecomponents. likelihood clipping also allows us to identify objects whoseproperties are not consistent with the adopted model, rendering the techniquerobust against contaminants and able to identify additional kinematic features.  the method is first tested on an n-body simulated galaxy to assess possiblesources of systematic error associated with the structural and kinematicdecomposition, which are found to be small. it is then applied to the s0 systemngc~1023, for which a planetary nebula catalogue has already been released andanalyzed by (noordermeer et al., 2008). the correct inclusion of the spheroidalcomponent allows us to show that, contrary to previous claims, the stellarkinematics of this galaxy are indistinguishable from those of a normal spiralgalaxy, indicating that it may have evolved directly from such a system via gasstripping or secular evolution. the method also successfully identifies apopulation of outliers whose kinematics are different from those of the maingalaxy; these objects can be identified with a stellar stream associated withthe companion galaxy ngc~1023a.

0712.0859	testing the nature of s0 galaxies using planetary nebula kinematics in  ngc 1023	we investigate the manner in which lenticular galaxies are formed by studyingtheir stellar kinematics: an s0 formed from a fading spiral galaxy shoulddisplay similar cold outer disc kinematics to its progenitor, while an s0formed in a minor merger should be more dominated by random motions. in a pilotstudy to attempt to distinguish between these scenarios, we have measured theplanetary nebula (pn) kinematics of the nearby s0 system ngc 1023. using theplanetary nebula spectrograph, we have detected and measured the line-of-sightvelocities of 204 candidate pne in the field of this galaxy. out tointermediate radii, the system displays the kinematics of a normalrotationally-supported disc system. after correction of its rotationalvelocities for asymmetric drift, the galaxy lies just below the spiral galaxytully-fisher relation, as one would expect for a fading system. however, atlarger radii the kinematics undergo a gradual but major transition to randommotion with little rotation. this transition does not seem to reflect a changein the viewing geometry or the presence of a distinct halo component, since thenumber counts of pne follow the same simple exponential decline as the stellarcontinuum with the same projected disc ellipticity out to large radii. thegalaxy's small companion, ngc 1023a, does not seem to be large enough to havecaused the observed modification either. this combination of properties wouldseem to indicate a complex evolutionary history in either the transition toform an s0 or in the past life of the spiral galaxy from which the s0 formed.more data sets of this type from both spirals and s0s are needed in order todefinitively determine the relationship between these types of system.

1304.1382	planetary nebula spectrograph survey of s0 galaxy kinematics. ii. clues  to the origins of s0 galaxies	the stellar kinematics of the spheroids and discs of s0 galaxies containclues to their formation histories. unfortunately, it is difficult todisentangle the two components and to recover their stellar kinematics in thefaint outer parts of the galaxies using conventional absorption linespectroscopy. this paper therefore presents the stellar kinematics of six s0galaxies derived from observations of planetary nebulae (pne), obtained usingthe planetary nebula spectrograph. to separate the kinematics of the twocomponents, we use a maximum-likelihood method that combines the discretekinematic data with a photometric component decomposition. the results of thisanalysis reveal that: the discs of s0 galaxies are rotationally supported;however, the amount of random motion in these discs is systematically higherthan in comparable spiral galaxies; and the s0s lie around one magnitude belowthe tully--fisher relation for spiral galaxies, while their spheroids lienearly one magnitude above the faber--jackson relation for ellipticals. all ofthese findings are consistent with a scenario in which spirals are convertedinto s0s through a process of mild harassment or "pestering," with their discssomewhat heated and their spheroid somewhat enhanced by the conversion process.in such a scenario, one might expect the properties of s0s to depend onenvironment. we do not see such an effect in this fairly small sample, althoughany differences would be diluted by the fact that the current location does notnecessarily reflect the environment in which the transformation occurred.similar observations of larger samples probing a broader range of environments,coupled with more detailed modelling of the transformation process to match thewide range of parameters that we have shown can now be measured, should take usfrom these first steps to the definitive answer as to how s0 galaxies form.

1409.0859	evolution of central dark matter of early-type galaxies up to z ~ 0.8	we investigate the evolution of dark and luminous matter in the centralregions of early-type galaxies (etgs) up to z ~ 0.8. we use a spectroscopicallyselected sample of 154 cluster and field galaxies from the ediscs survey,covering a wide range in redshifts (z ~ 0.4-0.8), stellar masses ($\logm_{\star}/ m_{\odot}$ ~ 10.5-11.5 dex) and velocity dispersions($\sigma_{\star}$ ~ 100-300 \, km/s). we obtain central dark matter (dm)fractions by determining the dynamical masses from jeans modelling of galaxyaperture velocity dispersions and the $m_{\star}$ from galaxy colours, andcompare the results with local samples. we discuss how the correlations ofcentral dm with galaxy size (i.e. the effective radius, $r_{\rm e}$),$m_{\star}$ and $\sigma_{\star}$ evolve as a function of redshift, findingclear indications that local galaxies are, on average, more dm dominated thantheir counterparts at larger redshift. this dm fraction evolution with $z$ canbe only partially interpreted as a consequence of the size-redshift evolution.we discuss our results within galaxy formation scenarios, and conclude that thegrowth in size and dm content which we measure within the last 7 gyr isincompatible with passive evolution, while it is well reproduced in themultiple minor merger scenario. we also discuss the impact of the imf on our dminferences and argue that this can be non-universal with the lookback time. inparticular, we find the salpeter imf can be better accommodated by low redshiftsystems, while producing stellar masses at high-$z$ which are unphysicallylarger than the estimated dynamical masses (particularly forlower-$\sigma_{\star}$ systems).

0804.1226	global properties of the rich cluster abcg 209 at z~0.2. spectroscopic  and photometric catalogue	this paper is aimed at giving an overview of the global properties of therich cluster of galaxies abcg 209. this is achieved by complementing thealready available data with new medium resolution spectroscopy and nirphotometry which allow us to i) analyse in detail the cluster dynamics,distinguishing among galaxies belonging to different substructures and derivingtheir individual velocity distributions, using a total sample of 148 galaxiesin the cluster region, of which 134 belonging to the cluster; ii) derive thecluster nir luminosity function; iii) study the kormendy relation and thephotometric plane of cluster early-type galaxies (etgs). finally we provide anextensive photometric (optical and nir) and spectroscopic dataset for such acomplex system to be used in further analyses investigating the nature,formation and evolution of rich clusters of galaxies. the observationalscenario confirms that abcg 209 is presently undergoing strong dynamicalevolution with the merging of two or more subclumps. this interpretation isalso supported by the detection of a radio halo (giovannini et al. 2006)suggesting that there is a recent or ongoing merging. cluster etgs follow akormendy relation whose slope is consistent with previous studies both atoptical and nir wavelengths. we investigate the origin of the intrinsic scatterof the photometric plane due to trends of stellar populations, using lineindices as indicators of age, metallicity and alpha/fe enhancement. we findthat the chemical evolution of galaxies could be responsible for the intrinsicdispersion of the photometric plane.

0804.1517	the evolution of the galaxy red sequence in simulated clusters and  groups	n-body + hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxygroups and clusters in a lambdacdm cosmology are used in order to follow thebuilding-up of the colour-magnitude relation in two clusters and in 12 groups.we have found that galaxies, starting from the more massive, move to the redsequence (rs) as they get aged over times and eventually set upon a ``deadsequence'' (ds) once they have stopped their bulk star formation activity.fainter galaxies keep having significant star formation out to very recentepochs and lie broader around the rs.  environment plays a role as galaxies in groups and cluster outskirts holdstar formation activity longer than the central cluster regions. howevergalaxies experiencing infall from the outskirts to the central parts keep starformation on until they settle on to the ds of the core galaxies. mergingcontributes to mass assembly until z~1, after which major events only involvethe brightest cluster galaxies.  the emerging scenario is that the evolution of the colour-magnitudeproperties of galaxies within the hierarchical framework is mainly driven bystar formation activity during dark matter halos assembly. galaxiesprogressively quenching their star formation settle to a very sharp ``red anddead'' sequence, which turns out to be universal, its slope and scatter beingalmost independent of the redshift (since at least z~1.5) and environment.  differently from the ds, the operatively defined rs evolves more evidentlywith z, the epoch when it changes its slope being closely corresponding to thatat which the passive galaxies population takes over the star forming one: thisgoes from z~1 in clusters down to 0.4 in normal groups.

1509.04496	supernova rates from the sudare vst-omegacam search. i	we describe the observing strategy, data reduction tools and early results ofa supernova (sn) search project, named sudare, conducted with the eso vsttelescope aimed at measuring the rate of the different types of sne in theredshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. the search was performed in two of the best-studiedextragalactic fields, cdfs and cosmos, for which a wealth of ancillary data areavailable in the literature or public archives.  (abridged)  we obtained a final sample of 117 sne, most of which are snia (57%) and theremaining core collapse events of which 44% type ii, 22% type iin and 34% typeib/c. in order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxiesin the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a limiting magnitude k_ab=23.5 mag. wemeasured the sn rate per unit volume for sn ia and core collapse sne indifferent bin of redshifts. the values are consistent with other measurementsfrom the literature. the dispersion of the rate measurements for sne ia iscomparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (sd) anddouble degenerate (dd) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allowto disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. however, we maynotice that among the three tested models, sd and two flavours of dd, eitherwith a steep (ddc) or a wide (ddw) delay time distribution, the sd gives abetter fit across the whole redshift range whereas the ddc better matches thesteep rise up to redshift ~1.2. the ddw appears instead less favoured. the corecollapse sn rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the predictionbased on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standardprogenitor mass range.

astro-ph;0001156	discovery of 9 ly alpha emitters at redshift z~3.1 using narrow-band  imaging and vlt spectroscopy	narrow-band imaging surveys aimed at detecting the faint emission from the5007 [o iii] line of intracluster planetary nebulae in virgo also probe highredshift z=3.1 ly alpha emitters. here we report on the spectroscopicidentification of 9 ly alpha emitters at z=3.13, obtained with the forsspectrograph at unit 1 of the eso very large telescope (vlt ut1). the spectraof these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated ly alpha emission withvery faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalentwidth. no other features are visible in our spectra. our ly alpha emitters arequite similar to those found by hu (1998), cowie &amp; hu (1998) and hu et al.(1998). using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that thesesources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearlyoptically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain thehigh observed ly alpha equivalent widths. for the cosmological and starformation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem tocorrespond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhapsdestined to merge. the implied star formation density in our sampled comovingvolume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude asthe star formation density at z=3 derived by other authors from lyman-breakgalaxy surveys. this result agrees with the expectation that the ly alphaemitters are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of starforming regions at high redshifts. finally, the ly alpha emitters maycontribute as many h-ionizing photons as qsos at z=3.

astro-ph;0011075	fitting planes to early-type galaxies: mist for the determination of the  fundamental plane	the present study deals with the problem of deriving the coefficients of thefundamental plane (fp) of early-type galaxies.  we introduce statistical models of the fp and relative fitting methods: themist (measurement errors and intrinsic scatter three dimensional) fits. themist fits account for the measurement errors on the variables and theircorrelations as well as for the intrinsic scatter. we show that the lack of amodel of the intrinsic scatter of the fp is the origin of the systematicdifferences between the various fitting methods.  we also address the problem of estimating the uncertainties of the fpcoefficients and determine a simple relation between the sample size and theexpected accuracy of the coefficients.  the present study leads to define a `minimum sample size' for a correctestimate of the uncertainties. for n &lt; 30, both theoretical formulae andre-sampling techniques, like the bootstrap, do not give reliable estimates.  the question of the 'universality' of the fp is addressed by applying themist fits to ten samples of cluster galaxies. the fp slopes are actuallyconsistent between the different samples, but, due to the large uncertainties,they could also hide significant systematic differences.  the feasibility of the measurement of the possible variations of the fpslopes as a function of redshift is also proved.

astro-ph;0109075	detection, photometry and slitless radial velocities of 535 planetary  nebulae in the flattened elliptical galaxy ngc 4697	we have detected 535 planetary nebulae (pns) in ngc 4697, using the classicon-band, off-band filter technique with the focal reducer and spectrograph(fors) at the cassegrain focus of the first 8-meter telescope unit of the esovery large telescope. from our photometry we have built the [o iii] 5007planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf) of ngc 4697. it indicates adistance of 10.5 mpc, substantially smaller than a previous estimate of 24 mpcused in earlier dynamical studies. the pnlf also provides an estimate of thespecific pn formation rate. combining the information from on-band images withpn positions on dispersed, slitless grism images, we have obtained radialvelocities for 531 of the 535 pns. they provide kinematic information up to adistance of almost three effective radii from the nucleus. some rotation isdetected in the outer regions, but the rotation curve of this galaxy appears todrop beyond one effective radius. assuming an isotropic velocity distribution,the velocity dispersion profile is consistent with no dark matter within threeeffective radii of the nucleus (however, some dark matter can be present if thevelocity distribution is anisotropic). we obtain a blue mass-to-light ratio of11. earlier m/l ratios for ngc 4697 were too small, because of the too largedistance used for their derivation.

astro-ph;0112533	ngc 1399: a complex dynamical case	evidence for a disturbed velocity structure in the outer regions of thegalaxy ngc1399 comes from a re-analysis of the planetary nebulae data fromarnaboldi et al. (1994). we find a strong rotation along a p.a.=140 degrees forr&lt;=140'' which is followed by a rapid drop off at larger radii, where thevelocity dispersion starts to increase. this kinematical behavior can beinterpreted as an indication for an interaction scenario. interaction isadvocated in previous analysis of the halo regions of this system, based ondifferent dynamical tracers such as globular clusters and x-rays, but in allthese studies the mass distribution is derived under the equilibriumhypothesis, which is not appropriate when an interaction takes place. here weattempt a non-equilibrium dynamical analysis of ngc1399: with a simple modeland under the impulse approximation, we show that the observed kinematics isconsistent with an energy injection caused by a flyby encounter of ngc 1399with the nearby system ngc 1404. in this approach, we find a mass-to-lightratio, m/l_b=26 within r=400'', which is about half of that requested whenequilibrium is assumed, i.e. m/l_b=56.

astro-ph;0206403	age, metallicity and star formation history of cluster galaxies at z~0.3  f	we investigate the color-magnitude distribution in the rich cluster ac 118 atz=0.31. the sample is selected by the photometric redshift technique, allowingto study a wide range of properties of stellar populations, and is complete inthe k-band, allowing to study these properties up to a given galaxy mass. weuse galaxy templates based on population synthesis models to translate thephysical properties of the stellar populations - formation epoch, time-scale ofstar formation, and metallicity - into observed magnitudes and colors. in thisway we show that a sharp luminosity-metallicity relation is inferred withoutany assumption on the galaxy formation scenario (either monolithic orhierarchical). our data exclude significant differences in star formationhistories along the color-magnitude relation, and therefore confirm a puremetallicity interpretation for its origin, with an early (z~5) formation epochfor the bulk of stellar populations. the dispersion in the color-magnitudediagram implies that fainter galaxies in our sample (k~18) ceased to form starsas late as z~0.5, in agreement with the picture that these galaxies wererecently accreted into the cluster environment. the trend with redshift of thetotal stellar mass shows that half of the luminous mass in ac 118 was alreadyformed at $z~2, but also that 20% of the stars formed at z&lt;1.

astro-ph;0212294	on the invariant distribution of galaxies in the re--mie plane out to z  = 0.64	we study the evolution of the relation between half-light (effective) radius,r_e, and mean surface brightness, mi_e, known as kormendy relation, out toredshift z=0.64 in v-band restframe on the basis of a large sample ofspheroidal galaxies (n=228) belonging to three clusters of galaxies. thepresent sample constitutes the largest data set for which the kormendy relationis investigated up to a look-back time of 6 gyr (h_0= 70 km/s/mpc, omega_m=0.3,omega_lambda=0.7). a new fitting procedure, which suitably accounts forselection criteria effects, allows for the first time to study the trend of theslope (beta) and of the intrinsic dispersion (sigma_mi_e) of the kormendyrelation, and the properties of the whole distribution in the r_e -- mi_e,plane as a function of look-back time. the slope beta of the relation does notchange from z=0.64 to the present epoch: beta=2.92+/-0.08, implying a tightconstraint of 18--28% on the variation of the stellar formation epoch along thesequence of spheroidal galaxies per decade of radius. the intrinsic dispersionof the relation, sigma_i_&lt;mi&gt;_e=0.40+/-0.03, does not vary with redshift andthe distribution of galaxy sizes as well as the distribution in the plane ofthe effective parameters do not vary among the clusters, as proven by thekolmogorov--smirnov tests. we conclude that, whatever the mechanism drivinggalaxy evolution is, it does not affect significantly the properties of brightgalaxies in the log(r_e) -- mi_e, plane at least since z=0.64. the evolution ofthe zeropoint of the kormendy relation is fully explained by the cosmologicaldimming in an expanding universe plus the passive luminosity evolution ofstellar populations with high formation redshift (z_f&gt;2).

astro-ph;0411639	mass-to-light ratio gradients in early-type galaxy haloes	since the near future should see a rapidly expanding set of probes of thehalo masses of individual early-type galaxies, we introduce a convenientparameter for characterising the halo masses from both observational andtheoretical results: \dml, the logarithmic radial gradient of the mass-to-lightratio. using halo density profiles from lcdm simulations, we derive predictionsfor this gradient for various galaxy luminosities and star formationefficiencies $\epsilon_{sf}$. as a pilot study, we assemble the available \dml\data from kinematics in early-type galaxies - representing the first unbiassedstudy of halo masses in a wide range of early-type galaxy luminosities - andfind a correlation between luminosity and \dml, such that the brightestgalaxies appear the most dark-matter dominated. we find that the gradients inmost of the brightest galaxies may fit in well with the lcdm predictions, butthat there is also a population of fainter galaxies whose gradients are so lowas to imply an unreasonably high star formation efficiency $\epsilon_{sf} &gt; 1$.this difficulty is eased if dark haloes are not assumed to have the standardlcdm profiles, but lower central concentrations.

astro-ph;0501508	new insights into the structure of early-type galaxies: the photometric  plane at z~0.3	we study the photometric plane (php), namely the relation between theeffective radius re, the mean surface brightness within that radius &lt;mi&gt;e, andthe sersic index n, in optical (r and i) and near-infrared (k) bands for alarge sample of early-type galaxies (etgs) in the rich cluster ms1008-1224 atz=0.306. the php relation has an intrinsic dispersion of ~32% in re, and turnsout to be independent of waveband. this result is consistent with the fact thatinternal colour gradients of etgs can have only a mild dependence on galaxyluminosity (mass). there is no evidence for a significant curvature in the php.we show that this can be explained if this relation origins from a systematicvariation of the specific entropy of etgs along the galaxy sequence, as wassuggested from previous works. the intrinsic scatter of the php issignificantly smaller than for other purely photometric relations, such as thekormendy relation and the photometric fundamental plane, which is constructedby using colours in place of velocity dispersions. the scatter does not dependon the waveband and the residuals about the plane do not correlate withresiduals of the colour-magnitude relation. finally, we compare thecoefficients of the php at z~0.3 with those of etgs at z~0, showing that thephp is a valuable tool to constrain the luminosity evolution of etgs withredshift. the slopes of the php do not change significantly with redshift,while the zero-point is consistent with cosmological dimming of the surfacebrightness in an expanding universe plus the passive fading of galaxy stellarpopulations with a high formation redshift (z_f &gt;1-2).

astro-ph;0611264	the environmental dependencies of star-formation and the origin of the  bimodality in galaxy properties	we examine the origins of the bimodality observed in the global properties ofgalaxies by comparing the environmental dependencies of star-formation forgiant and dwarf galaxy populations. using sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr4spectroscopic data to create a volume-limited sample complete to m*+3, we findthat the environmental dependences of giant and dwarf galaxies are quitedifferent, implying fundamental differences in their evolution. whereas thestar-formation histories of giant galaxies are determined primarily by theirmerger history, resulting in passively-evolving giant galaxies being found inall environments, we show that this is not the case for dwarf galaxies. inparticular, we find that old or passive dwarf galaxies are only found assatellites within massive halos (clusters, groups or giant galaxies), with nonein the lowest density regions. this implies that star-formation in dwarfgalaxies must be much more resilient to the effects of mergers, and that theevolution of dwarf galaxies is primarily driven by the mass of their host halo,through effects such as suffocation, ram-pressure stripping or galaxyharassment.

astro-ph;0703047	the pn.s elliptical galaxy survey: data reduction, planetary nebula  catalog, and basic dynamics for ngc 3379	we present results from planetary nebula spectrograph (pn.s) observations ofthe elliptical galaxy ngc 3379 and a description of the data reductionpipeline. we detected 214 planetary nebulae of which 191 are ascribed to ngc3379, and 23 to the companion galaxy ngc 3384. comparison with data from theliterature show that the pn.s velocities have an internal error of &lt;20km/s anda possible offset of similar magnitude. we present the results of kinematicmodelling and show that the pn kinematics are consistent with absorption-linedata in the region where they overlap. the resulting combined kinematic dataset, running from the center of ngc 3379 out to more than seven effective radii(reff), reveals a mean rotation velocity that is small compared to the randomvelocities, and a dispersion profile that declines rapidly with radius. from aseries of jeans dynamical models we find the b-band mass-to-light ratio inside5 reff to be 8 to 12 in solar units, and the dark matter fraction inside thisradius to be less than 40%. we compare these and other results of dynamicalanalysis with those of dark-matter-dominated merger simulations, finding thatsignificant discrepancies remain, reiterating the question of whether ngc 3379has the kind of dark matter halo that the current lambdacdm paradigm requires.

astro-ph;9304004	deep kinematics and dynamics of edge-on s0 galaxies. i. ngc 3115	as a first step of a program aimed to the detection of dark matter (or radialvariations of m/l) in early-type galaxies, we report deep spectroscopicobservations of the bulge-dominated edge-on s0 galaxy ngc 3115, made at eso, lasilla, using efosc at the 3.6m telescope and emmi at ntt. such observationsallow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii)from the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \mu_b ~ 24 magarcsec**-2. the rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260km/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range ofour observations. the line-of-sight velocity dispersion has also been measured;it decreases steeply from a rather high central value and flattens out(&lt;\sigma&gt; ~ 100 km/s) within our observing range (a ~&lt; 1.3 a_e). models builton these data and simple dynamical arguments show that the m/l of ngc 3115 mustthus be increasing from m/l = 6 (in solar units) in the inner regions (~ 1 a_e)to at least m/l &gt;= 10 in the outermost regions (~ 2 a_e).

astro-ph;9703157	the relative distances to the virgo, fornax, and coma clusters of  galaxies through the dn-sigma and the fundamental plane relations	we derive the relative distances to the virgo, fornax, and coma clusters ofgalaxies by applying the dn-sigma and the fundamental plane (fp) relations tothe data of the homogeneous samples of early--type galaxies studied by caonetal, lucey etal, and jorgensen etal. the two distance indicators giveconsistent results, the relative distance moduli to fornax and coma withrespect to virgo being dmu(fv)=0.45+-0.15 and dmu(cv)=3.55+-0.15) respectively.the formal error on d(m-m) may be as small as 0.07 mag (~3% in distance),provided that all the sources of bias are taken into account and a correctstatistical approach is used. much of the actual uncertainty in the relativedistance of the clusters (12-15%), is due to the existence of systematicdepartures in the measurements of the velocity dispersions among the variousdatasets, and to the corrections for aperture effects. the above result for thefornax cluster is supported by the l-sigma-mu relation and, with lesseraccuracy, by the log(m)-log(re) relations. our value of dmu(fv) is in fairagreement with the one derived using planetary nebulae and sne-ia, while is inopen contrast with that coming from surface brightness fluctuations, globularclusters luminosity function, and infrared tully-fisher relation. in our datacoma appears slightly nearer than indicated by the other distance indicators,but now a better agreement with the tully-fisher relation seems to exist.finally we found that there aren't correlations of the residuals of thedn-sigma with the effective surface brightness, the total luminosity of thegalaxies, with the ellipticity and the shape parameter a4. instead acorrelation seems to exists with maximum vrot, with (v/sigma) and with theexponent m of the r^1/m fit to major axis light of galaxies.

astro-ph;9707142	the stellar distribution of the globular cluster m55	we have used extensive v, i photometry (down to v=20.9) of 33615 stars in thedirection of the globular cluster m55 to study the dynamical interaction ofthis cluster with the tidal fields of the galaxy. an entire quadrant of thecluster has been covered, out to ~2.0 times the tidal radius. a cmd down toabout 4 magnitudes below the turn-off is presented and analysed. a largepopulation of bs has been identified. the bs are significantly moreconcentrated in the inner 300 arcsec, while they become less concentrated inthe cluster envelope. we have obtained luminosity functions at various radialintervals from the center and their corresponding mass functions. both clearlyshow the presence of mass segregation inside the cluster. a dynamical analysisshows that the observed mass segregation is compatible with what is predictedby multi-mass king-michie models. the global mass function is very flat with apower-law slope of x=-1.0+/-0.4. this suggest that m55 might have sufferedselective losses of stars, caused by tidal interactions with the galactic diskand bulge. the radial density profile of m55 out to ~2.0 r_t suggests thepresence of extra-tidal stars whose nature could be connected with the cluster.

astro-ph;9803134	the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851: its dynamical and evolutionary  properties	we have completely mapped the globular cluster ngc 1851 with vi ccdphotometry, obtaining a cmd for ca. 20500 stars. from the apparent luminosityof the hb we derive a distance modulus (m-m)o=15.44+/-0.20. the presence of 7"supra-hb" stars is confirmed. six of them are identified as evolveddescendants from hb progenitors. synthetic hr diagrams demonstrate that theproblem of the hb morphology could be solved by assuming a bimodal efficiencyof the mass loss along the rgb. we find evidence that the radial distributionof the blue hb stars is different from that of the red hb and sgb stars. thefirst measurement of the mean absolute i magnitude for 22 known rr lyrvariables (&lt;m(i)&gt;=0.12+/-0.20 at [fe/h]=-1.28), is given. we found 7 new rr lyrcandidates (6 ab type and 1 c type), lowering the ratio n(c)/n(ab) to 0.38.  from a sample of 25 globular clusters (including ngc 1851) a new calibrationfor dv(bump,hb) as a function of metallicity is derived, and we find someevidence for an age-metallicity relation among gcs. we identify 13 bluestraggler stars, which do not show any sign of variability. the blue stragglersare less concentrated than the sgb stars with similar magnitudes for r&gt;80".finally, a radial dependence of the lf, a sign of mass segregation, is found.transforming the lf into a mass function and correcting for mass segregation bymeans of multi-mass king-michie models, we find a global mf exponentx(0)=0.2+/-0.3.

astro-ph;9809213	structure and kinematics of the peculiar galaxy ngc 128	this is a multiband photometric and spectroscopic study of the peculiar s0galaxy ngc128. we present results from broad (b and r) and narrow band opticalccd photometry, near (nir) and far (fir) infrared observations, long slitspectroscopy, and fabry-perot interferometry (cigale). the peculiar peanutshape morphology of the galaxy is observed both at optical and near-infraredwavelengths. the stellar disk is thick and distorted (arc-bended), with a colorasymmetry along the major axis due to the presence of a large amount of dust,estimated through nir and fir data of ~6x10^6 m_sun, in the region ofinteraction with the companion galaxy ngc127. the color maps are nearly uniformover the whole galaxy, but for the major axis asymmetry, and a small gradienttoward the center indicating the presence of a redder disk-like component. theh_alpha image indeed reveals the existence of a tilted gaseous ``disk'' aroundthe center, oriented with the major axis toward the companion galaxy ngc127.long slit and cigale data confirm the presence of gas in a disk-like componentcounter-rotating and inclined approximately of 50 deg. to the line of sight.the mass of the gas disk in the inner region is ~2.7x10^4 m_sun. the stellarvelocity field is cylindrical up to the last measured points of the derivedrotation curves, while the velocity dispersion profiles are typical for an s0galaxy, but for an extended constant behaviour along the minor axis.

0809.4125	gauging the dark matter fraction in a $l_*$ s0 galaxy at z=0.47 through  gravitational lensing from deep hst/acs imaging	we analyze a new gravitational lens, oac-gl j1223-1239, serendipitously foundin a deep i-band image of the hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera forsurveys (acs). the lens is a l_*, edge-on s0 galaxy at z=0.4656. thegravitational arc has a radius of 0.42 arcsec. we have determined the totalmass and the dark matter (dm) fraction within the einstein radius as a functionof the lensed source redshift, which is presently unknown. for z ~ 1.3, whichis in the middle of the redshift range plausible for the source according tosome external constraints, we find the central velocity dispersion to be ~180km/s. with this value, close to that obtained by means of the faber-jacksonrelation at the lens redshift, we compute a 30% dm fraction within the einsteinradius (given the uncertainty in the source redshift, the allowed range for thedm fraction is 25-35 % in our lensing model). when compared with the galaxiesin the local universe, the lensing galaxy, oac-gl j1223-1239 seems to fall inthe transition regime between massive dm dominated galaxies and lower-mass, dmdeficient systems.

0810.1291	the pn.s elliptical galaxy survey: the dark matter in ngc 4494	we present new planetary nebula spectrograph observations of the ordinaryelliptical galaxy ngc 4494, resulting in positions and velocities of 255 pneout to 7 effective radii (25 kpc). we also present new wide-field surfacephotometry from mmt/megacam, and long-slit stellar kinematics from vlt/fors2.the spatial and kinematical distributions of the pne agree with the field starsin the region of overlap. the mean rotation is relatively low, with a possiblekinematic axis twist outside 1 re. the velocity dispersion profile declineswith radius, though not very steeply, down to ~70 km/s at the last data point.  we have constructed spherical dynamical models of the system, including jeansanalyses with multi-component lcdm-motivated galaxies as well as logarithmicpotentials. these models include special attention to orbital anisotropy, whichwe constrain using fourth-order velocity moments. given several different setsof modelling methods and assumptions, we find consistent results for the massprofile within the radial range constrained by the data. some dark matter (dm)is required by the data; our best-fit solution has a radially anisotropicstellar halo, a plausible stellar mass-to-light ratio, and a dm halo with anunexpectedly low central density. we find that this result does notsubstantially change with a flattened axisymmetric model.  taken together with other results for galaxy halo masses, we find suggestionsfor a puzzling pattern wherein most intermediate-luminosity galaxies have verylow concentration halos, while some high-mass ellipticals have very highconcentrations. we discuss some possible implications of these results for dmand galaxy formation.

0811.3203	kinematic properties of early-type galaxy haloes using planetary nebulae	we present new planetary nebulae (pne) positions, radial velocities, andmagnitudes for 6 early-type galaxies obtained with the planetary nebulaespectrograph, their two-dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion fields. weextend this study to include an additional 10 early-type galaxies with pneradial velocity measurements available from the literature, to obtain a broaderdescription of the outer-halo kinematics in early-type galaxies. these dataextend the information derived from stellar kinematics to typically up to ~8re. the combination of photometry, stellar and pne kinematics shows: i) goodagreement between the pne number density and the stellar surface brightness inthe region where the two data sets overlap; ii) good agreement between pne andstellar kinematics; iii) that the mean rms velocity profiles fall into twogroups: with of the galaxies characterized by slowly decreasing profiles andthe remainder having steeply falling profiles; iv) a larger variety of velocitydispersion profiles; v) that twists and misalignments in the velocity fieldsare more frequent at large radii, including some fast rotators; vi) that outerhaloes are characterised by more complex radial profiles of the specificangular momentum-related lambda_r parameter than observed within 1re; vii) thatmany objects are more rotationally dominated at large radii than in theircentral parts; and viii) that the halo kinematics are correlated with othergalaxy properties, such as total luminosity, isophotal shape, total stellarmass, v/sigma, and alpha parameter, with a clear separation between fast andslow rotators.

0812.0911	white dwarfs in the capodimonte deep field	in this article we describe the search for white dwarfs (wds) in themulti-band photometric data of the capodimonte deep field survey. the wdcandidates were selected through the v-r_c vs b-v color-color diagram. for twobright objects, the wd nature has been confirmed spectroscopically, and theatmospheric parameters (teff and logg) have been determined. we have computedsynthetic stellar population models for the observed field and the expectednumber of white dwarfs agrees with the observations. the possible contaminationby turn-off and horizontal branch halo stars has been estimated. the quasar(qso) contamination has been determined by comparing the number of wdcandidates in different color bins with state-of-the-art models and previousobservations. the wd space density is measured at different distances from thesun. the total contamination (non-degenerate stars + qsos) in our sample isestimated to be around 30%. this work should be considered a small experimentin view of more ambitious projects to be performed in the coming years inlarger survey contexts.
