0902.0745	comparative direct analysis of type ia supernova spectra. v. insights  from a larger sample and quantitative subclassification	a comparative study of optical spectra of type ia supernovae (sne ia) isextended, in the light of new data. the discussion is framed in terms of thefour groups defined in previous papers of this series: core normal (cn); broadline (bl); cool (cl); and shallow silicon (ss). emerging features of the sn iaspectroscopic diversity include evidence (1) that extreme cl sn 1991bg-likesare not a physically distinct subgroup and (2) for the existence of asubstantial number of sn 1999aa-like sss that are very similar to each otherand distinguishable from cn even as late as three weeks after maximum light. sn1999aa-likes may be relatively numerous, yet not a physically distinctsubgroup. the efficacy of quantitative spectroscopic subclassification of sneia based on the equivalent widths of absorption features near 5750 a and 6100 anear maximum light is discussed. the absolute magnitude dispersion of a smallsample of cns is no larger than the characteristic absolute magnitudeuncertainty.

0902.1876	a new formal solution of the radiative transfer in arbitrary velocity  fields	we present a new formal solution of the lagrangian equation of radiativetransfer that is useful in solving the equation of radiative transfer in thepresence of arbitrary velocity fields. normally a term due to the inclusion ofthe wavelength derivative in the lagrangian equation of radiative transfer isassociated with a generalised opacity. in non-monotonic velocity fields, thisgeneralised opacity may become negative. to ensure that the opacity remainspositive, this term of the derivative is included in the formal solution of theradiative transfer problem.  the new definition of the generalised opacity allows for a new solution ofthe equation of radiative transfer in the presence of velocity fields. it isespecially useful for arbitrary velocity fields, where it effectively preventsthe occurrences of negative generalised opacities and still allows the explicitconstruction of the lambda-operator of the system needed for an acceleratedlambda-iteration. we performed test calculations, where the results of old,established solutions were compared with the new solution. the relativedeviations never exceeded 1% and so the new solution is indeed suitable for usein radiative-transfer modelling. non-monotonic velocity fields along photonpaths frequently occur in three-dimensional hydrodynamical models ofastrophysical atmospheres. therefore, the formal solution will be of use formultidimensional radiative transfer and has immediate applications in themodelling of pulsating stars and astrophysical shock fronts.

0903.2486	a 3d radiative transfer framework: v. homologous flows	observations and theoretical calculations have shown the importance ofnon-spherically symmetric structures in supernovae. thus, the interpretation ofobserved supernova spectra requires the ability to solve the transfer equationin 3-d moving atmospheres. we present an implementation of the solution of theradiative transfer equation in 3-d homologously expanding atmospheres inspherical coordinates. the implementation is exact to all orders in v/c. we usea new affine method that makes use of the fact that photons travel on straightlines. we compare our results in 3-d for spherically symmetric test problemswith high velocity fields and find excellent agreement. our well-tested 1-dresults are based on methods where the momentum directions vary along thecharacteristic (co-moving momentum directions). thus, we are able to verifyboth the analytic framework and its numerical implementation. additionally, wehave been able to test the parallelization over characteristics. using 512^2momentum angles we ran the code on 16,384 opteron processors and achievedexcellent scaling. it is now possible to calculate synthetic spectra fromrealistic 3d hydro simulations. this should open an era of progress in hydromodeling, similar to that that occurred in the 1980s when 1-d models wereconfronted with synthetic spectra.

0910.0552	on the hydrogen recombination time in type ii supernova atmospheres	nlte radiative transfer calculations of differentially expanding supernovaeatmospheres are computationally intensive and are almost universally performedin time-independent snapshot mode. the validity of the steady-stateapproximation in the rate equations has recently been questioned. we calculatethe effective recombination time of hydrogen in sn ii using our general purposemodel atmosphere code phoenix. while we find that the recombination time forthe conditions of sne ii at early times is increased over the classical valuefor the case of a simple hydrogen model atom with energy levels correspondingto just the first 2 principle quantum numbers, the classical value of therecombination time is recovered in the case of a multi-level hydrogen atom. wealso find that the recombination time at most optical depths is smaller in thecase of a multi-level atom than for a simple two-level hydrogen atom. we findthat time dependence in the rate equations is important in the early epochs ofa supernova's lifetime. the changes due to the time dependent rate equation (atconstant input luminosity) are manifested in physical parameters such as thelevel populations which directly affects the spectra. the h-alpha profile isaffected by the time dependent rate equations at early times. at later timestime dependence does not significantly modify the level populations andtherefore the h-alpha profile is roughly independent of whether thesteady-state or time-dependent approach is used.

1005.0580	hydrogen recombination with multilevel atoms	hydrogen recombination is one of the most important atomic processes  in many astrophysical objects such as type ii supernova (sn~ii)  atmospheres, the high redshift universe during the cosmological recombination  era, and h ii regions in the interstellar medium. accurate predictions of  the ionization fraction can be quite different from those given by a  simple solution  if one takes into account many angular momentum sub-states,  non-resonant processes, and calculates the rates of all atomic  processes from the solution of the radiative transfer equation  instead of using a planck function under the assumption of thermalequilibrium. we use the general  purpose model atmosphere code phoenix 1d to  compare how the fundamental probabilities such as the photo-ionization  probability, the escape probability, and the collisional de-excitation  probability are affected by the presence of other metals in the  environment, multiple angular momentum sub-states, and  non-resonant processes. our comparisons are based on a model of sn  1999em, a sne type ii, 20 days after its explosion.

1105.3328	comparative analysis of peculiar type ia 1991bg-like supernovae spectra	spectroscopic analyses of type ia supernovae have shown there exist fourspectroscopic groups---cools, broad line, shallow silicon, and corenormal---defined by the widths of the si ii features at 5972 angstroms and 6355angstroms. 1991bg-likes are classified as "cools". cools are dim, undergo arapid decline in luminosity, and produce significantly less nickel than normaltype ia supernovae. they also have an unusually deep and wide trough in theirspectra around 4200 angstroms and a relatively strong si ii absorptionattributed to the line at 5972 angstroms. we examine the spectra of supernova(sn) 1991bg and the cools sn 1997cn, sn 1999by, and sn 2005bl using the highlyparameterized synthetic spectrum code synow, and find general agreement withsimilar spectroscopic studies. our analysis reveals that this group ofsupernovae is fairly homogeneous, with many of the blue spectral features wellfit by fe ii. the nature of the spectroscopic commonalities and the variationsin the class are discussed. finally, we examine intermediates such as sn 2004eoand discuss the spectroscopic subgroup distribution of type ia supernovae.

0709.4177	detailed spectral modeling of a 3-d pulsating reverse detonation model:  too much nickel	we calculate detailed nlte synthetic spectra of a pulsating reverse  detonation (prd) model, a novel explosion mechanism for type ia supernovae.while the hydro models are calculated in 3-d, the spectra use an angle averagedhydro model and thus some of the 3-d details are lost, but the overall averageshould be a good representation of the average observed spectra. we study themodel at 3 epochs: maximum light, seven days prior to maximum light, and 5 daysafter maximum light. at maximum the defining si ii feature is prominent, butthere is also a prominent c ii feature, not usually observed in normal sne ianear maximum. we compare to the early spectrum of sn 2006d which did show aprominent c ii feature, but the fit to the observations is not compelling.finally we compare to the post-maximum uv+optical spectrum of sn 1992a. withthe broad spectral coverage it is clear that the iron-peak elements on theoutside of the model push too much flux to the red and thus the particular prdrealizations studied would be intrinsically far redder than observed sne ia. webriefly discuss variations that could improve future prd models.

1205.0814	a physical model for sn 2001ay, a normal, bright, extremely slowly  declining type ia supernova	we present a study of the peculiar type ia supernova 2001ay (sn 2001ay). thedefining features of its peculiarity are: high velocity, broad lines, and afast rising light curve, combined with the slowest known rate of decline. it isone magnitude dimmer than would be predicted from its observed value ofdelta-m15, and shows broad spectral features. we base our analysis on detailedcalculations for the explosion, light curves, and spectra. we demonstrate thatconsistency is key for both validating the models and probing the underlyingphysics. we show that this sn can be understood within the physics underlyingthe delta-m15 relation, and in the framework of pulsating delayed detonationmodels originating from a chandrasekhar mass, white dwarf, but with aprogenitor core composed of 80% carbon. we suggest a possible scenario forstellar evolution which leads to such a progenitor. we show that the unusuallight curve decline can be understood with the same physics as has been used tounderstand the delta-m15 relation for normal sne ia. the decline relation canbe explained by a combination of the temperature dependence of the opacity andexcess or deficit of the peak luminosity, alpha, measured relative to theinstantaneous rate of radiative decay energy generation. what differentiates sn2001ay from normal sne ia is a higher explosion energy which leads to a shiftof the ni56 distribution towards higher velocity and alpha &lt; 1. this result isresponsible for the fast rise and slow decline. we define a class of sn2001ay-like sne ia, which will show an anti-phillips relation.

1209.3520	supernova resonance--scattering line profiles in the absence of a  photosphere	in supernova spectroscopy relatively little attention has been given to theproperties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following thephotosphere's recession. most treatments and analyses of post-photosphericoptical spectra of supernovae assume that forbidden-line emission comprisesmost if not all spectral features. however, evidence exists which suggests thatsome spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thickresonance-scattering even months or years after the supernova explosion. toexplore this possibility we present a geometrical approach to supernovaspectrum formation based on the "elementary supernova" model, wherein weinvestigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thicklines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emittingnon-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided bydecaying 56co formed during the explosion. we develop the mathematicalframework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under theseconditions, and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. ourcomparisons with analogous results from the elementary supernova code synowreveal several marked differences in line formation. most notably, resonancelines in these conditions form p cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaksand absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from theline's rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the sphericallysymmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. theseproperties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentificationof lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material atpost-photospheric times in supernova optical spectra.

1503.03088	identification of the feature that causes the i-band secondary maximum  of a type ia supernova	we obtained a time series of spectra covering the secondary maximum in thei-band of the bright type ia supernova 2014j in m82 with the tigre telescope.comparing the observations with theoretical models calculated with the timedependent extension of the phoenix code, we identify the feature that causesthe secondary maximum in the i-band light curve. fe ii 3d6(3d)4s-3d6(5d)4p andsimilar high excitation transitions produce a blended feature at 7500 {\aa},which causes the rise of the light curve towards the secondary maximum. theseries of observed spectra of sn 2014j and archival data of sn 2011fe confirmthis conclusion. we further studied the plateau phase of the rband light curveof sn 2014j and searched for features which contribute to the flux. thetheoretical models do not clearly indicate a new feature that may cause therband plateau phase. however, co ii features in the range of 6500 - 7000 {\aa}and the fe ii feature of the i-band are clearly seen in the theoreticalspectra, but do not appear to provide all of the flux necessary for the r-bandplateau.

0804.4473	the dartmouth stellar evolution database	the ever-expanding depth and quality of photometric and spectroscopicobservations of stellar populations increase the need for theoretical models inregions of age-composition parameter space that are largely unexplored atpresent. stellar evolution models that employ the most advanced physics andcover a wide range of compositions are needed to extract the most informationfrom current observations of both resolved and unresolved stellar populations.the dartmouth stellar evolution database is a collection of stellar evolutiontracks and isochrones that spans a range of [fe/h] from -2.5 to +0.5,[alpha/fe] from -0.2 to +0.8 (for [fe/h] &lt;=0) or +0.2 (for [fe/h] &gt;0), andinitial he mass fractions from y=0.245 to 0.40. stellar evolution tracks werecomputed for masses between 0.1 and 4 msun, allowing isochrones to be generatedfor ages as young as 250 myr. for the range in masses where the core he flashoccurs, separate he-burning tracks were computed starting from the zero agehorizontal branch. the tracks and isochrones have been transformed to theobservational plane in a variety of photometric systems including standardubv(ri)c, stromgren uvby, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, and hst acs-wfc and wfpc2.the dartmouth stellar evolution database is accessible through a website athttp://stellar.dartmouth.edu/~models/ where all tracks, isochrones, andadditional files can be downloaded.

1504.05237	theoretical clues to the ultraviolet diversity of type ia supernovae	the effect of metallicity on the observed light of type ia supernovae (sneia) could lead to systematic errors as the absolute magnitudes of local anddistant sne ia are compared to measure luminosity distances and determinecosmological parameters. the uv light may be especially sensitive tometallicity, though different modeling methods disagree as to the magnitude,wavelength dependence, and even the sign of the effect. the outer densitystructure, ^56 ni, and to a lesser degree asphericity, also impact the uv. wecompute synthetic photometry of various metallicity-dependent models andcompare to uv/optical photometry from the swift ultra-violet/optical telescope.we find that the scatter in the mid-uv to near-uv colors is larger thanpredicted by changes in metallicity alone and is not consistent with reddening.we demonstrate that a recently employed method to determine relative abundancesusing uv spectra can be done using uvot photometry, but we warn that accurateresults require an accurate model of the cause of the variations. the abundanceof uv photometry now available should provide constraints on models thattypically rely on uv spectroscopy for constraining metallicity, density, andother parameters. nevertheless, uv spectroscopy for a variety of sn explosionsis still needed to guide the creation of accurate models. a betterunderstanding of the influences affecting the uv is important for using sne iaas cosmological probes, as the uv light may test whether sne ia aresignificantly affected by evolutionary effects.

1508.04774	spectral models for early time sn 2011fe observations	we use observed uv through near ir spectra to examine whether sn 2011fe canbe understood in the framework of branch-normal sne ia and to examine itsindividual peculiarities. as a benchmark, we use a delayed-detonation modelwith a progenitor metallicity of z_solar/20. we study the sensitivity offeatures to variations in progenitor metallicity, the outer density profile,and the distribution of radioactive nickel. the effect of metallicityvariations in the progenitor have a relatively small effect on the syntheticspectra. we also find that the abundance stratification of sn 2011fe resemblesclosely that of a delayed detonation model with a transition density that hasbeen fit to other branch-normal type ia supernovae. at early times, the modelphotosphere is formed in material with velocities that are too high, indicatingthat the photosphere recedes too slowly or that sn 2011fe has a lower specificenergy in the outer ~0.1 m_sun than does the model. we discuss severalexplanations for the discrepancies. finally, we examine variations in both thespectral energy distribution and in the colors due to variations in theprogenitor metallicity, which suggests that colors are only weak indicators forthe progenitor metallicity, in the particular explosion model that we havestudied. we do find that the flux in the u band is significantly higher atmaximum light in the solar metallicity model than in the lower metallicitymodel and the lower metallicity model much better matches the observedspectrum.

astro-ph;0006049	non-lte treatment of molecules in the photospheres of cool stars	we present a technique to treat systems with very many levels, likemolecules, in non-lte. this method is based on a superlevel formalism coupledwith rate operator splitting. superlevels consist of many individual levelsthat are assumed to be in lte relative to each other. the usage of superlevelsreduces the dimensionality of the rate equations dramatically and, thereby,makes the problem computationally more easily treatable. our superlevelformalism retains maximum accuracy by using direct opacity sampling (dos) whencalculating the radiative transitions and the opacities. we developed thismethod in order to treat molecules in cool dwarf model calculations in non-lte.cool dwarfs have low electron densities and a radiation field that is far froma black body radiation field, both properties may invalidate the conditions forthe common lte approximation. therefore, the most important opacity sources,the molecules, need to be treated in non-lte. as a case study we applied ourmethod to carbon monoxide. we find that our method gives accurate results sincethe conditions for the superlevel method are very well met for molecules. dueto very high collisional cross sections with hydrogen, and the high densitiesof h_2 the population of co itself shows no significant deviation from lte.

astro-ph;0010614	preliminary spectral analysis of the type ii supernova 1999em	we have calculated fast direct spectral model fits to two early-time spectraof the type-ii plateau sn 1999em, using the synow synthetic spectrum code. thefirst is an extremely early blue optical spectrum and the second a combined hstand optical spectrum obtained one week later. spectroscopically this supernovaappears to be a normal type ii and these fits are in excellent agreement withthe observed spectra. our direct analysis suggests the presence of enhancednitrogen. we have further studied these spectra with the full nlte generalmodel atmosphere code phoenix. while we do not find confirmation for enhancednitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. an even moreintriguing possible line identification is complicated balmer and he i lines,which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallowdensity gradient. we also show that very early spectra such as those presentedhere combined with sophisticated spectral modeling allows an independentestimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum isvery blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot bereproduced by altering the ``temperature'' of the emitted radiation. theseresults are extremely encouraging since they imply that detailed modeling ofearly spectra can shed light on both the abundances and total extinction of sneii, the latter improving their utility and reliability as distance indicators.

astro-ph;0104148	nickel mixing in the outer layers of sn 1987a	supernova 1987a remains the most well-observed and well-studied supernova todate. observations produced excellent broad-band photometric and spectroscopiccoverage over a wide wavelength range at all epochs. here, we focus on the veryearly spectroscopic observations. only recently have numerical models been ofsufficient detail to accurately explain the observed spectra. in sn 1987a, goodagreement has been found between observed and synthetic spectra for day one,but by day four, the predicted balmer lines become much weaker than theobserved lines. we present the results of work based on aradiation-hydrodynamic model by blinnikov and collaborators. synthetic non-ltespectra generated from this model by the general radiation transfer codephoenix strongly support the theory that significant mixing of nickel into theouter envelope is required to maintain strong balmer lines. preliminary resultssuggest a lower limit to the average nickel mass of 1.0 \times 10^{-5} solarmasses is required above 5000 \kmps by day four. phoenix models thus have thepotential to be a sensitive probe for nickel mixing in the outer layers of asupernova.

astro-ph;0107464	spectral consequences of deviation from spherical composition symmetry  in type ia supernovae	we investigate the prospects for constraining the maximum scale of clumpingin composition that is consistent with observed type ia supernova flux spectra.synthetic spectra generated without purely spherical composition symmetryindicate that gross asymmetries make prominent changes to absorption features.motivated by this, we consider the case of a single unblended line forming inan atmosphere with perturbations of different scales and spatial distributions.perturbations of about 1% of the area of the photodisk simply weaken theabsorption feature by the same amount independent of the line of sight.conversely, perturbations of about 10% of the area of the photodisk introducevariation in the absorption depth which does depend on the line of sight. thus,1% photodisk area perturbations may be consistent with observed profilehomogeneity but 10% photodisk area perturbations can not. based on this, wesuggest that the absence of significant variation in the depths of si ii 6355absorption features in normal type ia spectra near maximum light indicates thatany composition perturbations in these events are quite small. this alsoconstrains future three-dimensional explosion models to produce ejecta profileswith only small scale inhomogeneities.

astro-ph;0207470	detectibility of hydrogen mixing in type ia supernova pre-maximum  spectra	the presence of a small amount of hydrogen is expected in most singledegenerate scenarios for producing a type ia supernova (sn ia). while hydrogenmay be detected in very early high resolution optical spectra, in early radiospectra, and in x-ray spectra, here we examine the possibility of detectinghydrogen in early low resolution spectra such as those that will be obtained byproposed large scale searches for nearby sne ia. we find that definitivedetections will require both very early spectra (less than 5 days afterexplosion) and perhaps slightly higher amounts of hydrogen than are currentlypredicted to be mixed into the outer layers of sne ia. thus, the non-detectionof hydrogen so far does not in and of itself rule out any current progenitormodels. nevertheless, very early spectra of sne ia will provide significantclues to the amount of hydrogen present and hence to the nature of the sn iaprogenitor system. spectral coverage in both the optical and ir will berequired to definitively identify hydrogen in low resolution spectra.

astro-ph;0301312	analysis of the flux and polarization spectra of the type ia supernova  sn 2001el: exploring the geometry of the high-velocity ejecta	sn 2001el is the first normal type ia supernova to show a strong, intrinsicpolarization signal. in addition, during the epochs prior to maximum light, thecaii ir triplet absorption is seen distinctly and separately at both normalphotospheric velocities and at very high velocities. the high-velocity tripletabsorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than therest of the spectrum. the unique observation allows us to construct arelatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of thesupernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere(v \approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,high-velocity structure (v \approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high caii lineopacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. by partially obscuring theunderlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incompletecancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives riseto the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity irtriplet feature. in an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop atechnique for calculating 3-d synthetic polarization spectra and use it togenerate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations. inparticular, we examine the case where the inner ejecta layers are ellipsoidaland the outer, high-velocity structure is one of four possibilities: aspherical shell, an ellipsoidal shell, a clumped shell, or a toroid. thesynthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, andfind a best fit with the clumped shell. we show further that differentgeometries can be more clearly discriminated if observations are obtained fromseveral different lines of sight.

astro-ph;0309264	low luminosity type ii supernovae: spectroscopic and photometric  evolution	in this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric observations for fourcore collapse supernovae (sne), namely sne 1994n, 1999br, 1999eu and 2001dc.together with sn 1997d, we show that they form a group of exceptionallylow-luminosity events. these sne have narrow spectral lines (indicating lowexpansion velocities) and low luminosities at every phase (significantly lowerthan those of typical core-collapse supernovae). the very low luminosity duringthe ^{56}co radioactive decay tail indicates that the mass of ^{56}ni ejectedduring the explosion is much smaller (m(ni) ~ 2-8 x 10^{-3} mo) than theaverage (m(ni) ~ 6-10 x 10^{-2} mo). two supernovae of this group (sn 1999brand sn 2001dc) were discovered very close to the explosion epoch, allowing usto determine the lengths of their plateaux (~ 100 days) as well asestablishiing the explosion epochs of the other, less-completely observed sne.it is likely that this group of sne represent the extreme low-luminosity tailof a single continuous distribution of sn ii-p events. their kinetic energy isalso exceptionally low. although an origin from low mass progenitors has alsobeen proposed for low-luminosity core-collapse sne, recent work providesevidence in favour of the high mass progenitor scenario. the incidence of theselow--luminosity sne could be as high as 4-5$ $ of all type ii sne.

astro-ph;0408212	co-moving frame radiative transfer in spherical media with arbitrary  velocity fields	recently, with the advances in computational speed and availability there hasbeen a growth in the number and resolution of fully 3-d hydrodynamicalsimulations. however, all of these simulations are purely hydrodynamical andthere has been little attempt to include the effects of radiative transferexcept in a purely phenomenological manner because the computational cost istoo large even for modern supercomputers. while there has been an effort todevelop 3-d monte carlo radiative transfer codes, most of these have been forstatic atmospheres or have employed the sobolev approximation, which limitstheir applicability to studying purely geometric effects such as macroscopicmixing. also the computational requirements of monte carlo methods are suchthat it is difficult to couple with 3-d hydrodynamics. here, we present analgorithm for calculating 1-d spherical radiative transfer in the presence ofnon-monotonic velocity fields in the co-moving frame. non-monotonic velocityflows will occur in convective, and raleigh--taylor unstable flows, in flowswith multiple shocks, and in pulsationally unstable stars such as mira andcepheids. this is a first step to developing fully 3-d radiative transfer thancan be coupled with hydrodynamics. we present the computational method and theresults of some test calculations.

astro-ph;0512572	hydrogen and helium traces in type ib-c supernovae	the spectroscopic properties of a selected optical photospheric spectra ofcore collapse supernovae (ccsne) are investigated.special attention is devotedto traces of hydrogen at early phases.  the generated spectra are found to match the observed ones reasonably well,including a list of only 23 candidate ions. guided by sn ib 1990i, the observedtrough near 6300\aa is attributed to h$\alpha$ in almost all type ib events,although in some objects it becomes too weak to be discernible, especially atlater phases. alternative line identifications are discussed. differences inthe way hydrogen manifests its presence within ccsne are highlighted. in typeib sne, the h$\alpha$ contrast velocity (i.e. line velocity minus thephotospheric velocity) seems to increase with time at early epochs, reachingvalues as high as 8000 km s$^{-1}$ around 15-20 days after maximum and thenremains almost constant. the derived photospheric velocities, indicate a lowervelocity for type ii sne 1987a and 1999em as compared to sn ic 1994i and sn iib1993j, while type ib events display a somewhat larger variation. the scatter,around day 20, is measured to be $\sim$5000 km s$^{-1}$. following two simpleapproaches, rough estimates of ejecta and hydrogen masses are given. a mass ofhydrogen of approximately 0.02 $m_\odot$ is obtained for sn 1990i, while sne1983n and 2000h ejected $\sim$0.008 $m_\odot$ and $\sim$0.08 $m_\odot$ ofhydrogen, respectively. sn 1993j has a higher hydrogen mass, $\sim 0.7$$m_\odot$ with a large uncertainty. a low mass and thin hydrogen layer withvery high ejection velocities above the helium shell, is thus the most likelyscenario for type ib sne. some interesting and curious issues relating tooxygen lines suggest future investigations.

astro-ph;0607084	goodness-of-fit tests diff1 and diff2 for locally-normalized supernova  spectra	two quantitative tests diff1 and diff2 for measuring goodness-of-fit betweentwo locally-normalized supernova spectra are presented. locally-normalizedspectra are obtained by dividing a spectrum by the same spectrum smoothed overa wavelength interval relatively large compared to line features, butrelatively small compared to continuum features. diff1 essentially measures themean relative difference between the line patterns of locally-normalizedspectra and diff2 is diff1 minimized by a relative logarithmic wavelength shiftbetween the spectra: the shift is effectively an artificial relative dopplershift. both diff1 and diff2 measure the physical similarity of line formation,and thus of supernovae. diff1 puts more weight on overall physical similarityof the supernovae than diff2 because the diff2 shift compensates somewhat forsome physical distinction in the supernovae. both tests are useful in orderingsupernovae into empirical groupings for further analysis. we present someexamples of locally-normalized spectra for type iib supernova sn 1993j withsome analysis of these spectra. the uv parts of two of the sn 1993j spectra arehst spectra that have not been published before. we also give an example offitted locally-normalized spectra and, as an example of the utility of diff1and diff2, some preliminary statistical results for hydrogen-deficientcore-collapse (hdcc) supernova spectra. this paper makes use of and refers tomaterial to found at the first author's online supernova spectrum databasesuspend (supernovae spectra pending further analysis: seehttp://www.nhn.ou.edu/~jeffery/astro/sne/spectra/spectra.html)

astro-ph;0701198	direct analysis of spectra of the unusual type ib supernova 2005bf	synthetic spectra generated with the parameterized supernovasynthetic-spectrum code synow are compared to spectra of the unusual type ibsupernova 2005bf. we confirm the discovery by folatelli et al. (2006) that veryearly spectra (about 30 days before maximum light) contain bothphotospheric-velocity (8000 km/s) features of he i, ca ii, and fe ii, anddetached high-velocity (14,000 km/s) features of h-alpha, ca ii, and fe ii. anearly spectrum of sn 2005bf is an almost perfect match to a near-maximum-lightspectrum of the type ib sn 1999ex. although these two spectra were at verydifferent times with respect to maximum light (20 days before maximum for sn2005bf and five days after for sn 1999ex), they were for similar times afterexplosion - about 20 days for sn 2005bf and 24 days for sn 1999ex. the almostperfect match clinches the previously suggested identification of h-alpha in sn1999ex and supports the proposition that many if not all type ib supernovaeeject a small amount of hydrogen. the earliest available spectrum of sn 2005bfresembles a near-maximum-light spectrum of the type ic sn 1994i. these twospectra also were at different times with respect to maximum light (32 daysbefore maximum for sn 2005bf and four days before for sn 1994i) but at similartimes after explosion - about eight days for sn 2005bf and 10 days for sn1994i. the resemblance motivates us to consider a reinterpretation of thespectra of type ic supernovae, involving coexisting photospheric-velocity andhigh-velocity features. the implications of our results for the geometry of thesn 2005bf ejecta, which has been suggested to be grossly asymmetric, arebriefly discussed.

(1995b), in spite of the fact that they do nottake into account any dependence of sn ia absolute magnitude on the nature ofthe parent galaxy.  some implications of the statistical connections between sne ia and thecolors of their parent galaxies, for identifying the progenitor binary systemsof sne ia and for using high--redshift sne ia to measure q$_0$, are brieflydiscussed.

astro-ph;9601149	the effects of fe ii nlte on nova atmospheres and spectra	the atmospheres of novae at early times in their outbursts are very extended,expanding shells with low densities. models of these atmospheres show that nlteeffects are very important and must be included in realistic calculations. wehave, therefore, been improving our atmospheric studies by increasing thenumber of ions treated in nlte. one of the most important ions is fe ii whichhas a complex structure and numerous lines in the observable spectrum. in thispaper we investigate nlte effects for fe ii for a wide variety of parameters.we use a detailed fe ii model atom with 617 level and 13675 primary lines,treated using a rate-operator formalism. we show that the radiative transferequation in nova atmospheres {\em must} be treated with sophisticated numericalmethods and that simple approximations, such as the sobolev method, {\emcannot} be used because of the large number of overlapping lines in theco-moving frame.  our results show that the formation of the fe ii lines is strongly affectedby nlte effects. for low effective temperatures, $\teff &lt; 20,000\,$k, theoptical fe ii lines are most influenced by nlte effects, while for higher$\teff$ the uv lines of fe ii are very strongly affected by nlte. the departurecoefficients are such that fe ii tends to be overionized in nlte when comparedto lte. therefore, fe ii-nlte must be included with sophisticated radiativetransfer in nova atmosphere models in order to reliably analyze observed novaspectra.

astro-ph;9601155	nlte model atmospheres for m dwarfs and giants	the atmospheres of m stars are dominated by a small number of very strongmolecular compounds (h$_2$o, tio, h$_2$, co, vo). most of the hydrogen islocked in molecular h$_2$, most of the carbon in co; and h$_2$o, tio and voopacities define a pseudo-continuum covering the entire flux distribution ofthese stars. the optical ``continuum'' is due to tio vibrational bands whichare often used as temperature indicators for these stars. these may be thedepth of the bands relative to the troughs in between them; or the depth of thevo bands; or of the atomic lines relative to the local ``continuum''; or eventhe strength of the infrared water bands; all of these depend on the strengthof the tio bands and the amount of flux-redistribution to longer wavelengthsexerted by them. departures from lte of the ti i atom, and thus theconcentration of the important tio molecule, could, therefore, have severe andmeasurable consequences on the atmospheric structure and spectra of thesestars.  in this paper we discuss nlte effects of ti i in fully self-consistent modelsfor a few representative m/brown dwarf and m giant model atmospheres andspectra.

astro-ph;9604006	low hubble constant from type ia supernovae by van den bergh's method	an interesting way to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of remote type iasupernovae (sne ia) that are well out in the hubble flow, and thus determinethe value of the hubble constant, h_0, has been introduced by van den bergh.his approach relies on calculations of the peak absolute magnitudes andbroad--band colors for sn ia explosion models. it does not require anycorrections for extinction by interstellar dust, and no sne ia are excluded ongrounds of peculiarity. within the last few years distances have beendetermined to the parent galaxies of six sne ia by means of cepheid variables.cepheid--based distances also have become available for three other sne ia ifone is willing to use the distance to a galaxy in the same group in lieu of thedistance to the parent galaxy itself. here we determine the value of h_0 in away that is analogous to that of van den bergh, but now using cepheid--baseddistances instead of calculated light curves. we obtain h_0 = 55 km/s/mpc. thisvalue, with lambda=0 and omega=1, corresponds to a cosmic expansion time of 12gyr, which is consistent with several recent determinations of the ages ofglobular clusters.

astro-ph;9605088	nlte effects in modeling of supernovae near maximum light	supernovae, with their diversity of compositions, velocities, envelopemasses, and interactions are good testing grounds for probing the importance ofnlte in expanding atmospheres. in addition to treating h, he, li i, o i, ne i,na i, and mg ii in nlte, we use a very large model atom of fe ii to test theimportance of nlte processes in both sne ia and ii. since the total number ofpotential line transitions that one has to include is enormous ($\approx 40$million), approximations and simplifications are required to treat the problemaccurately and in finite computer time. with our large fe ii model atom (617levels, 13,675 primary nlte line transitions) we are able to test severalassumptions for treating the background opacity that are needed to obtaincorrect uv line blanketing which determines the shape of near-maximum lightsupernova spectra. we find that, due to interactions within the multiplets,treating the background lines as pure scattering (thermalization parameter$\epsilon = 0$) is a poor approximation and that an overall mean value of$\epsilon \sim 0.05 - 0.10 $ is a far better approximation. this is true evenin sne ia, where the continuum absorption optical depth at 5000 \aa\ ($\equiv\tau_{\rm std}$) is $&lt;&lt; 1$. we also demonstrate that a detailed treatment ofnlte effects is required to properly determine the ionization states of bothabundant and trace elements.

astro-ph;9709238	parallel implementation of the phoenix generalized stellar atmosphere  program. ii: wavelength parallelization	we describe an important addition to the parallel implementation of ourgeneralized nlte stellar atmosphere and radiative transfer computer programphoenix. in a previous paper in this series we described data and task parallelalgorithms we have developed for radiative transfer, spectral line opacity, andnlte opacity and rate calculations. these algorithms divided the work spatiallyor by spectral lines, that is distributing the radial zones, individualspectral lines, or characteristic rays among different processors and employ,in addition task parallelism for logically independent functions (such asatomic and molecular line opacities). for finite, monotonic velocity fields,the radiative transfer equation is an initial value problem in wavelength, andhence each wavelength point depends upon the previous one. however, forsophisticated nlte models of both static and moving atmospheres needed toaccurately describe, e.g., novae and supernovae, the number of wavelengthpoints is very large (200,000--300,000) and hence parallelization overwavelength can lead both to considerable speedup in calculation time and theability to make use of the aggregate memory available on massively parallelsupercomputers. here, we describe an implementation of a pipelined design forthe wavelength parallelization of phoenix, where the necessary data from theprocessor working on a previous wavelength point is sent to the processorworking on the succeeding wavelength point as soon as it is known. ourimplementation uses a mimd design based on a relatively small number ofstandard mpi library calls and is fully portable between serial and parallelcomputers.

0706.0808	stellar population models and individual element abundances i:  sensitivity of stellar evolution models	integrated light from distant galaxies is often compared to stellarpopulation models via the equivalent widths of spectral features--spectralindices--whose strengths rely on the abundances of one or more elements. suchcomparisons hinge not only on the overall metal abundance but also on relativeabundances. studies have examined the influence of individual elements onsynthetic spectra but little has been done to address similar issues in thestellar evolution models that underlie most stellar population models. stellarevolution models will primarily be influenced by changes in opacities. in orderto explore this issue in detail, twelve sets of stellar evolution tracks andisochrones have been created at constant heavy element mass fraction z thatself-consistently account for varying heavy element mixtures. these setsinclude scaled-solar, alpha-enhanced, and individual cases where the elementsc, n, o, ne, mg, si, s, ca, ti, and fe have been enhanced above theirscaled-solar values. the variations that arise between scaled-solar and theother cases are examined with respect to the h-r diagram and main sequencelifetimes.

0706.0847	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. ii. stellar evolution  tracks, isochrones, luminosity functions, and synthetic horizontal-branch  models	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters, an hst treasury project, willdeliver high quality, homogeneous photometry of 65 globular clusters. thispaper introduces a new collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochronessuitable for analyzing the acs survey data. stellar evolution models werecomputed at [fe/h]= -2.5, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, and 0; [alpha/fe]= -0.2, 0,0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8; and three initial he abundances for masses from 0.1 to1.8 msun and ages from 2 to 15 gyr. each isochrone spans a wide range inluminosity from mv~14 up to the tip of the red giant branch. these arecomplemented by a set of he-burning tracks that extend from the zero agehorizontal branch to the onset of thermal pulsations on the asymptotic giantbranch. in addition, a set of computer programs are provided that make itpossible to interpolate the isochrones in [fe/h], generate luminosity functionsfrom the isochrones, and create synthetic horizontal branch models. the tracksand isochrones have been converted to the observational plane with twodifferent color-teff transformations, one synthetic and one semi-empirical, inground-based b, v, and i, and f606w and f814w for both acs-wfc and wfpc2systems. all models and programs presented in this paper are available fromhttp://stellar.dartmouth.edu/~models/
