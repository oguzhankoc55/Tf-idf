0901.4627	photometric properties of ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 in the cosmos 2  square degree field	we present results of a survey for ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 based onoptical narrowband (lambda_c=7126 angstrom, delta lambda=73 angstrom) andbroadband (b, v, r', i', and z') observations of the cosmic evolution survey(cosmos) field using suprime-cam on the subaru telescope. we find 79 laecandidates at z=4.86 over a contiguous survey area of 1.83 deg^2, down to thely alpha line flux of 1.47 x 10^-17 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. we obtain the ly alphaluminosity function with a best-fit schechter parameters of logl^*=42.9^+0.5_-0.3 ergs s^-1 and phi^* = 1.2^+8.0_-1.1 x 10^-4 mpc^-3 foralpha=-1.5 (fixed). the two-point correlation function for our lae sample isxi(r) = (r/4.4^+5.7_-2.9 mpc)^-1.90+/-0.22. in order to investigate thefield-to-field variations of the properties of ly alpha emitters, we divide thesurvey area into nine tiles of 0.5^circ x 0.5^circ each. we find that thenumber density varies with a factor of ~ 2 from field to field with highstatistical significance. however, we find no significant field-to-fieldvariance when we divide the field into four tiles with 0.7^circ x 0.7^circeach. we conclude that at least 0.5 deg^2 survey area is required to deriveaveraged properties of laes at z~5, and our survey field is wide enough toovercome the cosmic variance.

0902.0625	designing future dark energy space mission: i. building realistic galaxy  spectro-photometric catalogs and their first applications	future dark energy space missions such as jdem and euclid are being designedto survey the galaxy population to trace the geometry of the universe and thegrowth of structure, which both depend on the cosmological model. to reach thegoal of high precision cosmology they need to evaluate the capabilities ofdifferent instrument designs based on realistic mock catalog. the aim of thispaper is to construct realistic and flexible mock catalogs based on ourknowledge of galaxy population from current deep surveys. we explore twocategories of mock catalog : (i) based on luminosity functions fit ofobservations (goods, udf,cosmos,vvds) using the le phare software (ii) based onthe observed cosmos galaxy distribution which benefits from all the propertiesof the data-rich cosmos survey. for these two catalogs, we have producedsimulated number counts in several bands, color diagrams and redshiftdistribution for validation against real observational data. we also derivesome basic requirements to help designing future dark energy mission in termsof number of galaxies available for the weak-lensing analysis as a function ofthe psf size and depth of the survey. we also compute the spectroscopic successrate for future spectroscopic redshift surveys (i) aiming at measuring bao inthe case of the wide field spectroscopic redshift survey, and (ii) for thephotometric redshift calibration survey which is required to achieve weaklensing tomography with great accuracy. they will be publicly accessible athttp://lamwws.oamp.fr/cosmowiki/realisticspectrophotcat, or by request to thefirst author of this paper.

0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

0906.1873	hst/acs morphology of lyman alpha emitters at redshift 5.7 in the cosmos  field	we present detailed morphological properties of lyman alpha emitters (laes)at z~ 5.7 in the cosmos field, based on {\it hubble space telescope} advancedcamera for surveys (acs) data. the acs imaging in the f814w filter covered 85laes of the 119 laes identified in the full two square degree field, and 47laes of them are detected in the acs images. nearly half of them are spatiallyextended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4arcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). the others are nearly unresolved compact objects.two laes show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging ofbuilding components to form more massive galaxies. by stacking the acs imagesof all the detected sources, we obtain a sersic parameter of n~0.7 with ahalf-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (0.76 kpc), suggesting that the majority ofacs detected laes have not spheroidal-like but disk-like or irregular lightprofiles. comparing acs f814w magnitudes (i_814) with subaru/suprime-cammagnitudes in the nb816, i', and z' bands, we find that the acs imaging in thef814w band mainly probes uv continuum rather than lyman alpha line emission. uvcontinuum sizes tend to be larger for laes with larger ly\alpha emissionregions as traced by the nb816 imaging. the non-detection of 38 laes in the acsimages is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too lowboth in the uv continuum and lyalpha emission. estimating i_814 for the laeswith acs non-detection from the z' and nb816 magnitudes, we find that 16 ofthese are probably laes with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in uv continuum.all these results suggest that our lae sample contains systematically largerlaes in uv continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0911.0003	heavily obscured agn in star-forming galaxies at z~2	we study the properties of a sample of 211 heavily-obscured active galacticnucleus (agn) candidates in the extended chandra deep field-south selectingobjects with f_24/f_r&gt;1000 and r-k&gt;4.5. of these, 18 were detected in x-raysand found to be obscured agn with neutral hydrogen column densities of ~10^23cm^-2. in the x-ray undetected sample, the following evidence suggests a largefraction of heavily-obscured (compton thick) agn: (i) the stacked x-ray signalof the sample is strong, with an observed ratio of soft to hard x-ray countsconsistent with a population of ~90% heavily obscured agn combined with 10%star-forming galaxies. (ii) the x-ray to mid-ir ratios for these sources aresignificantly larger than that of star-forming galaxies and ~2 orders ofmagnitude smaller than for the general agn population, suggesting columndensities of n_h&gt;5x10^24 cm^-2. (iii) the spitzer near- and mid-ir colors ofthese sources are consistent with those of the x-ray-detected sample if theeffects of dust self-absorption are considered. spectral fitting to therest-frame uv/optical light (dominated by the host galaxy) returns stellarmasses of ~10^11 m_sun and &lt;e(b-v)&gt; =0.5, and reveals evidence for asignificant young stellar population, indicating that these sources areexperiencing considerable star-formation. this sample of heavily-obscured agncandidates implies a space density at z~2 of ~10^-5 mpc^-3, finding a strongevolution in the number of l_x&gt;10^44 erg/s sources from z=1.5 to 2.5, possiblyconsistent with a short-lived heavily-obscured phase before an unobscuredquasar is visible.

0911.1158	the morphology of passively evolving galaxies at z ~ 2 from hst/wfc3  deep imaging in the hubble ultradeep field	we present near-ir images, obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst) andthe wfc3/ir camera, of six passive and massive galaxies at redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4(ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}; stellar mass m~10^{11} m_{sun}), selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey (goods). these images, which have aspatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc, provide the deepest view of the opticalrest-frame morphology of such systems to date. we find that the light profileof these galaxies is regular and well described by a sersic model with indextypical of today's spheroids. their size, however, is generally much smallerthan today's early types of similar stellar mass, with four out of six galaxieshaving r_e ~ 1 kpc or less, in quantitative agreement with previous similarmeasures made at rest-frame uv wavelengths. the images reach limiting surfacebrightness mu~26.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the f160w bandpass; yet, there is noevidence of a faint halo in the galaxies of our sample, even in their stackedimage. we also find that these galaxies have very weak "morphologicalk-correction" between the rest-frame uv (from the acs z-band), and therest--frame optical (wfc3 h-band): the sersic index, physical size and overallmorphology are independent or only mildly dependent on the wavelength, withinthe errors.

1001.1736	bars in early- and late-type disks in cosmos	we investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of m&gt; 10^10.5 msun disk galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 in the cosmos field. the fractionof barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific starformation rate (ssfr). at intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun)the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by afactor ~2, than that in late-type disks. this trend is reversed at higherstellar mass (m &gt; 10^11 msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disksbecomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.the bar fractions for galaxies with low and high ssfrs closely follow those ofthe morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,respectively. this indicates a close correspondence between morphology and ssfrin disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. interestingly, the total bar fractionin 10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over theredshift interval explored, while for m &gt; 10^11 msun disks it remains roughlyconstant. this indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphologicaltransformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to thefamiliar hubble sequence that we observe in the local universe, while forintermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limitedsamples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. finally, theevolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on thelarge-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probedwith the available photometric redshifts).

1002.3154	identifications and photometric redshifts of the 2 ms chandra deep  field-south sources	[abridged] we present reliable multiwavelength identifications andhigh-quality photometric redshifts for the 462 x-ray sources in the ~2 mschandra deep field-south. source identifications are carried out using deepoptical-to-radio multiwavelength catalogs, and are then combined to createlists of primary and secondary counterparts for the x-ray sources. weidentified reliable counterparts for 446 (96.5%) of the x-ray sources, with anexpected false-match probability of ~6.2%. a likelihood-ratio method is usedfor source matching, which effectively reduces the false-match probability atfaint magnitudes compared to a simple error-circle matching method. weconstruct a master photometric catalog for the identified x-ray sourcesincluding up to 42 bands of uv-to-infrared data, and then calculate theirphotometric redshifts (photo-z's). the reliability of the photo-z's isevaluated using the subsample of 220 sources with secure spectroscopicredshifts. we achieve an accuracy of ~1% [|delta z|/(1+z)] and an outlierfraction of ~1.4% for sources with spectroscopic redshifts. we performed blindtests to derive a more realistic estimate of the photo-z quality for sourceswithout spectroscopic redshifts. we expect there are ~9% outliers for therelatively brighter sources (r&lt;26), and the outlier fraction will increase to~15-25% for the fainter sources (r&gt;26). the typical photo-z accuracy is ~6-7%.the outlier fraction and photo-z accuracy do not appear to have a redshiftdependence (for z~0-4). these photo-z's appear to be the best obtained so farfor faint x-ray sources, and they have been significantly (&gt;50%) improvedcompared to previous estimates of the photo-z's for the x-ray sources in the ~2ms chandra deep field-north and ~1 ms chandra deep field-south.

1003.0675	identifying dynamically young galaxy groups via wide-angle tail  galaxies: a case study in the cosmos field at z=0.53	we present an analysis of a wide-angle tail (wat) radio galaxy located in agalaxy group in the cosmos field at a redshift of z=0.53 (hereafter cwat-02).we find that the host galaxy of cwat-02 is the brightest galaxy in the group,although it does not coincide with the center of mass of the system. estimatinga) the velocity of cwat-02, relative to the intra-cluster medium (icm), and b)the line-of-sight peculiar velocity of cwat-02's host galaxy, relative to theaverage velocity of the group, we find that both values are higher than thoseexpected for a dominant galaxy in a relaxed system. this suggests thatcwat-02's host group is dynamically young and likely in the process of anongoing group merger. our results are consistent with previous findings showingthat the presence of a wide-angle tail galaxy in a galaxy group or cluster canbe used as an indicator of dynamically young non-relaxed systems. taking theunrelaxed state of cwat-02's host group into account, we discuss the impact ofradio-agn heating from cwat-02 onto its environment, in the context of themissing baryon problem in galaxy groups. our analysis strengthens recentresults suggesting that radio-agn heating may be powerful enough to expelbaryons from galaxy groups.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

1103.5618	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): strong  lensing analysis of abell 383 from 16-band hst wfc3/acs imaging	we examine the inner mass distribution of the relaxed galaxy cluster abell383 in deep 16-band hst/acs+wfc3 imaging taken as part of the clash multi-cycletreasury program. our program is designed to study the dark matter distributionin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage tobetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. thisinformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensinganalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, sothat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrainthe inner mass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r&lt;160 kpc).we find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the fullrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01&lt;z&lt;6.03, with the higher redshiftsources deflected through larger angles as expected. the inner mass profilederived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensinganalysis of wide-field subaru images, with good agreement in the region ofoverlap. the overall mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile withm_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h and a relativelyhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above thestandard c-m relation similar to other well-studied clusters. the criticalradius of abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,r_{e}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number oflensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates ourimaging strategy for the clash survey. in total we aim to provide similarlyhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are x-ray selectedrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative massprofile free from lensing bias.

1105.2522	the tumultuous formation of the hubble sequence at z &gt; 1 examined with  hst/wfc3 observations of the hubble ultra deep field	we examine in this paper a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies at 1 &lt; z&lt; 3 within the hubble ultra deep field, utilising wfc3 imaging to study therest-frame optical morphological distribution of galaxies at this epoch. wemeasure how apparent morphologies (disk, elliptical, peculiar) correlate withphysical properties, such as quantitative structure and spectral-types. oneprimary result is that apparent morphology does not correlate strongly withstellar populations, nor with galaxy structure at this epoch, suggesting achaotic formation history for hubble types at z &gt; 1. by using a locally defineddefinition of disk and elliptical galaxies based on structure andspectral-type, we find no true ellipticals at z &gt; 2, and a fraction of3.2+/-2.3% at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2. local counterparts of disk galaxies are at a similarlevel of 7-10%, much lower than the 75% fraction at lower redshifts. we furthercompare wfc3 images with the rest-frame uv view of galaxies from acs imaging,showing that galaxies imaged with acs that appear peculiar often contain an`elliptical' like morphology in wfc3. we show through several simulations thatthis larger fraction of elliptical-like galaxies is partially due to thecourser psf of wfc3, and that the `elliptical' class very likely includesearly-type disks. we also measure the merger history for our sample using casparameters, finding a redshift evolution increasing with redshift, and a peakmerger fraction of ~30% at z~2 for the most massive galaxies with m_*&gt; 10^{10}m_sol, consistent with previous results from acs and nicmos. we compare ourresults to semi-analytical model results and find a relatively good agreementbetween our morphological break-down and the predictions. finally, we arguethat the peculiars, ellipticals and peculiar ellipticals have similarproperties, suggesting similar formation modes, likely driven by major mergers.

1107.2649	clash: new multiple-images constraining the inner mass profile of macs  j1206.2-0847	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847($z$=0.44) using uv, optical, and ir, hst/acs/wfc3 data taken as part of theclash multi-cycle treasury program, with vlt/vimos spectroscopy for some of themultiply-lensed arcs. the clash observations, combined with our mass-model,allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. theseimages, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\laz\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and toaccurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of thiscluster. we find an inner profile slope of $d\log \sigma/d\log \theta\simeq-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), ascommonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. using the manysystems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and einstein radiifor different source redshifts. for a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the criticalcurve encloses a large area with an effective einstein radius of$\theta_{e}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. from the current understanding of structure formation inconcordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at$z\sim0.5$, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusterssuch as macs j1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the $\lambda$cdmparadigm.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

1110.3794	candels observations of the structural properties and evolution of  galaxies in a cluster at z=1.62	we discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in az=1.62 proto-cluster using near-ir imaging data from hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 data of the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphologyrelation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally havemorphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistentwith ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. the sizedistribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (&lt;1kpc), massive galaxies compared to candels field galaxies at z=1.6. as aresult the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizescompared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent clustergalaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). if this result is generalizable, then it implies thatphysical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to havecaused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slowersubsequent growth at z&lt;1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. thequiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lowerredshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggestthat they contain extended stellar disks. we argue the cluster galaxies requiredissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the diskmaterial and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, andcolor of early-type galaxies in z&lt;1 clusters.

1111.2447	fe k emission from active galaxies in the cosmos field	we present a rest-frame spectral stacking analysis of ~1000 x-ray sourcesdetected in the xmm-cosmos field in order to investigate the iron k lineproperties of active galaxies beyond redshift z~1. in type i agn that have atypical x-ray luminosity of lx~1.5e44 erg/s and z~1.6, the cold fe k at 6.4 kevis weak (ew~0.05kev), in agreement with the known trend. in contrast,high-ionization lines of fe xxv and fe xxvi are pronounced. thesehigh-ionization fe k lines appear to have a connection with high accretionrates. while no broad fe emission is detected in the total spectrum, it mightbe present, albeit at low significance, when the x-ray luminosity is restrictedto the range below 3e44 erg/s, or when an intermediate range of eddington ratioaround 0.1 is selected. in type ii agn, both cold and high-ionzation linesbecome weak with increasing x-ray luminosity. however, strong high-ionizationfe k (ew~0.3 kev) is detected in the spectrum of objects at z&gt;2, while no 6.4kev line is found. it is then found that the primary source of thehigh-ionization fe k emission is those objects detected with spitzer-mips at 24micron. given their median redshift of z=2.5, their bolometric luminosity islikely to reach 10^13 lsun and the mips-detected emission most likelyoriginates from hot dust heated by embedded agn, probably accreting at higheddington ratio. these properties match those of rapidly growing black holes inultra-luminous infrared galaxies at the interesting epoch (z=2-3) of galaxyformation.

1201.6416	a panchromatic catalog of early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift  in the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 early release science field	in the first of a series of forthcoming publications, we present apanchromatic catalog of 102 visually-selected early-type galaxies (etgs) fromobservations in the early release science (ers) program with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) on the hubble space telescope (hst) of the great observatoriesorigins deep survey-south (goods-s) field. our etgs span a large redshiftrange, 0.35 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, with each redshift spectroscopically-confirmed byprevious published surveys of the ers field. we combine our measured wfc3 ersand acs goods-s photometry to gain continuous sensitivity from the rest-framefar-uv to near-ir emission for each etg. the superior spatial resolution of thehst over this panchromatic baseline allows us to classify the etgs by theirsmall-scale internal structures, as well as their local environment. by fittingstellar population spectral templates to the broad-band photometry of the etgs,we determine that the average masses of the etgs are comparable to thecharacteristic stellar mass of massive galaxies, 11&lt; log(m [solar]) &lt; 12.  by transforming the observed photometry into the galex fuv and nuv, johnsonv, and sdss g' and r' bandpasses we identify a noteworthy diversity in therest-frame uv-optical colors and find the mean rest-frame (fuv-v)=3.5 and(nuv-v)=3.3, with 1$\sigma$ standard deviations approximately equal to 1.0. theblue rest-frame uv-optical colors observed for most of the etgs are evidencefor star-formation during the preceding gigayear, but no systems exhibituv-optical photometry consistent with major recent (&lt;~50 myr) starbursts.future publications which address the diversity of stellar populations likelyto be present in these etgs, and the potential mechanisms by which recentstar-formation episodes are activated, are discussed.

1204.2940	evolution in the dust lane fraction of edge-on l* spiral galaxies since  z=0.8	the presence of a well-defined and narrow dust lane in an edge-on spiralgalaxy is the observational signature of a thin and dense molecular disk, inwhich gravitational collapse has overcome turbulence. using a sample ofgalaxies out to z~1 extracted from the cosmos survey, we identify the fractionof massive disks that display a dust lane. our goal is to explore the evolutionin the stability of the molecular ism disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmictimescale. we check the reliability of our morphological classificationsagainst changes in restframe wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with(artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from sdss. we find that thefraction of l* disks with dust lanes in cosmos is consistent with the localfraction (~80%) out to z~0.7. at z=0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightlylower. a somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentativelysupports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficientlydestroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. a small subsample of higher redshiftcosmos galaxies display low internal reddening (e[b-v]), as well as a lowincidence of dust lanes. these may be disks in which the growth of the dustyism disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. we note that at z=0.8, the mostmassive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. asmall contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massivepopulation may be responsible. the fact that the fraction of galaxies with dustlanes in cosmos is consistent with little or no evolution implies that modelsto explain the spectral energy distribution or the host galaxy dust extinctionof supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshiftspirals. it also suggests that dust lanes are long lived phenomena or can bereformed over very short time-scales.

(2010).two scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of cid-42: a gwrecoiling smbh and a double type 1/ type 2 agn system, where one of the two isrecoiling because of slingshot effect. in both scenario, one of the opticalnuclei hosts an unobscured agn, while the other one, either an obscured agn ora star forming compact region. the x-ray chandra data allow to unambiguouslyresolve the x-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sourcesin cid-42. we find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for thewhole x-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the fluxof the second optical nucleus is measured. the upper limit on the x-rayluminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energydistribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second sourcerather than an obscured smbh, thus favoring the gw recoil scenario. however thepresence of a very obscured smbh cannot be fully ruled-out. a new x-rayfeature, in a sw direction with respect to the main source, is discovered anddiscussed.

1212.0860	the uv continua and inferred stellar populations of galaxies at z ~ 7 -  9 revealed by the hubble ultra deep field 2012 campaign	we use the new ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra-deepfield (hudf) provided by our udf12 hst wfc3/ir campaign to explore therest-frame uv properties of galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 6.5. we present the firstunbiased measurement of the average uv power-law index, beta, for faintgalaxies at z ~ 7, the first meaningful measurements of beta at z ~ 8, andtentative estimates for a new sample of galaxies at z ~ 9. utilising galaxyselection in the new f140w imaging to minimize colour bias, and applying bothcolour and power-law estimators of beta, we find beta = -2.1 (+/-0.2) at z ~ 7for galaxies with m_uv ~ -18. this means that the faintest galaxies uncoveredat this epoch have, on average, uv colours no more extreme than those displayedby the bluest star-forming galaxies at low redshift. at z ~ 8 we find a similarvalue, beta = -1.9 (+/-0.3). at z ~ 9, we find beta = -1.8 (+/-0.6),essentially unchanged from z ~ 6 - 7 (albeit highly uncertain). finally, weshow that there is as yet no evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter inbeta within our new, robust z ~ 7 galaxy sample. our results are most easilyexplained by a population of steadily star-forming galaxies with either ~ solarmetallicity and zero dust, or moderately sub-solar (~ 10-20%) metallicity withmodest dust obscuration (a_v ~ 0.1-0.2). this latter interpretation isconsistent with the predictions of a state-of-the-art galaxy-formationsimulation, which also suggests that a significant population of very-lowmetallicity, dust-free galaxies with beta ~ -2.5 may not emerge until m_uv &gt;-16, a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the james webb spacetelescope.

1311.1305	the incidence of obscuration in active galactic nuclei	we study the incidence of nuclear obscuration on a complete sample of 1310agn selected on the basis of their rest-frame 2-10 kev x-ray flux from thexmm-cosmos survey, in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5. we classify the agn asobscured or un-obscured on the basis of either the optical spectral propertiesand the overall sed or the shape of the x-ray spectrum. the two classificationsagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be furthersubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities x-ray un-obscured agndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/uv continuum emission in theiroptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at highluminosities broad line agn may have absorbed x-ray spectra, which hints at anincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. weconfirm that the fraction of obscured agn is a decreasing function of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significantevolution only for the most luminous agn, which appear to be more commonlyobscured at higher redshift. we find no significant difference between the meanstellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured agn hosts.we conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscurationin agn is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclearluminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere ofinfluence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the widerscale galactic conditions.

1311.5559	candels+3d-hst: compact sfgs at z~2-3, the progenitors of the first  quiescent galaxies	we analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive(log(m/msun)&gt;10) compact star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 2&lt;z&lt;3 to explorewhether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2. theoptical/nir and far-ir spitzer/herschel colors indicate that most compact sfgsare heavily obscured. nearly half (47%) host an x-ray bright agn. in contrast,only about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host agns. compact sfgshave centrally-concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similarto quiescent galaxies, and are thus strikingly different from other sfgs. mostcompact sfgs lie either within the sfr-m main sequence (65%) or below (30%), onthe expected evolutionary path towards quiescent galaxies. these results showconclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas anddust, quenching star formation. using extensive hst photometry from candels andgrism spectroscopy from the 3d-hst survey, we model their stellar populationswith either exponentially declining (tau) star formation histories (sfhs) orphysically-motivated sfhs drawn from semi-analytic models (sams). sams predictlonger formation timescales and older ages ~2 gyr, which are nearly twice asold as the estimates of the tau models. while both models yield good sed fits,sam sfhs better match the observed slope and zero point of the sfr-m mainsequence. some low-mass compact sfgs (log(m/msun)=10-10.6) have younger agesbut lower ssfrs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that thelow-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. if the progenitors of compactsfgs are extended sfgs, state-of-the-art sams show that mergers and diskinstabilities are both able to shrink galaxies, but disk instabilities are morefrequent (60% versus 40%) and form more concentrated galaxies. we confirm thisresult via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

1401.5477	morphologies of z~0.7 agn host galaxies in candels: no trend of merger  incidence with agn luminosity	the processes that trigger active galactic nuclei (agn) remain poorlyunderstood. while lower luminosity agn may be triggered by minor disturbancesto the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to triggerluminous agn. major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for agntriggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques.there is however little observational evidence for a strong connection betweenagn and major mergers. we analyse the morphological properties of agn hostgalaxies as a function of agn and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to acarefully matched sample of control galaxies. agn are x-ray selected in theredshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and have luminosities 41 &lt; log(l_x [erg/s]) &lt;44.5. 'fake agn' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sourceswith the magnitude of the matched agn. we find that agn host and controlgalaxies have comparable assymetries, sersic indices and ellipticities atrestframe ~950nm. agn host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries norhigher fractions of very disturbed objects. there is no increase in theprevalence of merger signatures with agn luminosity. at 95% confidence we findthat major mergers are responsible for &lt;6% of all agn in our sample as well as&lt;40% of the highest luminosity agn log(l_x [erg/s]) ~ 43.5). major mergerstherefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of agn in theluminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features toremain visible.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.0023	constraining the galaxy mass content in the core of a383 using velocity  dispersion measurements for individual cluster members	we use velocity dispersion measurements of 21 individual cluster members inthe core of abell 383, obtained with mmt hectospec, to separate the galaxy andthe smooth dark halo (dh) lensing contributions. while lensing usuallyconstrains the overall, projected mass density, the innovative use of velocitydispersion measurements as a proxy for masses of individual cluster membersbreaks inherent degeneracies and allows us to (a) refine the constraints onsingle galaxy masses and on the galaxy mass-to-light scaling relation and, as aresult, (b) refine the constraints on the dm-only map, a high-end goal of lensmodelling. the knowledge of cluster member velocity dispersions improves thefit by 17% in terms of the image reproduction $\chi^2$, or 20% in terms of therms. the constraints on the mass parameters improve by ~10% for the dh, whilefor the galaxy component, they are refined correspondingly by ~50%, includingthe galaxy halo truncation radius. for an l$^*$ galaxy with m$^*_b$=-20.96, forexample, we obtain best fitting truncation radius r$^*_{tr}=20.5^{+9.6}_{-6.7}$kpc and velocity dispersion $\sigma^*=324\pm17 km/s$. moreover, by performingthe surface brightness reconstruction of the southern giant arc, we improve theconstraints on r$_{tr}$ of two nearby cluster members, which have measuredvelocity dispersions, by more than ~30%. we estimate the stripped mass forthese two galaxies, getting results that are consistent with numericalsimulations. in the future, we plan to apply this analysis to other galaxyclusters for which velocity dispersions of member galaxies are available.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1503.05607	clash-vlt: substructure in the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847 from  kinematics of galaxy populations	in the effort to understand the link between the structure of galaxy clustersand their galaxy populations, we focus on macsj1206.2-0847 at z~0.44 and probeits substructure in the projected phase space through the spectrophotometricproperties of a large number of galaxies from the clash-vlt survey. ouranalysis is mainly based on an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 445 membergalaxies, mostly acquired with vimos@vlt as part of our eso large programme,sampling the cluster out to a radius ~2r200 (4 mpc). we classify 412 galaxiesas passive, with strong hdelta absorption (red and blue galaxies, and withemission lines from weak to very strong. a number of tests for substructuredetection are applied to analyze the galaxy distribution in the velocity space,in 2d space, and in 3d projected phase-space. studied in its entirety, thecluster appears as a large-scale relaxed system with a few secondary, minoroverdensities in 2d distribution. we detect no velocity gradients or evidenceof deviations in local mean velocities. the main feature is the wnw-eseelongation. the analysis of galaxy populations per spectral class highlights amore complex scenario. the passive galaxies and red strong hdelta galaxiestrace the cluster center and the wnw-ese elongated structure. the red stronghdelta galaxies also mark a secondary, dense peak ~2 mpc at ese. the emissionline galaxies cluster in several loose structures, mostly outside r200. theobservational scenario agrees with macs j1206.2-0847 having wnw-ese as thedirection of the main cluster accretion, traced by passive galaxies and redstrong hdelta galaxies. the red strong hdelta galaxies, interpreted aspoststarburst galaxies, date a likely important event 1-2 gyr before the epochof observation. the emission line galaxies trace a secondary, ongoing infallwhere groups are accreted along several directions.

0705.2266	evolution of the frequency of luminous (\geq l_v*) close galaxy pairs at  z &lt; 1.2 in the cosmos field	we measure the fraction of luminous galaxies in pairs at projectedseparations of 5-20 kpc out to z=1.2 in the cosmos field using acs images andphotometric redshifts derived from an extensive multiwavelength dataset.analysis of a complete sample of 106,188 galaxies more luminous than m_v=-19.8(~ l_v*) in the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 yields 1,749 galaxy pairs. thesedata are supplemented by a local z=0-0.1 value for the galaxy pair fractionderived from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). after statisticallycorrecting the cosmos pair sample for chance line-of-sight superpositions, theevolution in the pair fraction is fit by a power law \propto (1+z)^{n=3.1 \pm0.1}. if this strongly evolving pair fraction continues out to higher redshift,~ 50% of all luminous galaxies at z ~ 2 are in close pairs. this clearlysignifies that galaxy mergers are a very significant and possibly dominantmechanism for galaxy evolution during the epoch of galaxy formation at z=1 to3.

1505.04977	a higher efficiency of converting gas to stars push galaxies at z ~ 1.6  well above the star-forming main sequence	local starbursts have a higher efficiency of converting gas into stars, ascompared to typical star-forming galaxies at a given stellar mass, possiblyindicative of different modes of star formation. with the peak epoch of galaxyformation occurring at z &gt; 1, it remains to be established whether such anefficient mode of star formation is occurring at high-redshift. to address thisissue, we measure the molecular gas content of seven high-redshift (z ~ 1.6)starburst galaxies with the atacama large (sub-)millimeter array andiram/plateau de bure interferometer. our targets are selected from the sampleof herschel far-infrared detected galaxies having star formation rates(~300-800 msolar/yr) elevated (&gt;4x) above the star-forming `main sequence', andincluded in the fmos-cosmos near-infrared spectroscopic survey of star-forminggalaxies at z ~ 1.6 with subaru. we detect co emission in all cases at highlevels of significance, indicative of high gas fractions (~30-50%). even morecompelling, we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection thatstarbursts, identified as main-sequence outliers, at high redshift generallyhave a lower ratio of co to total infrared luminosity as compared to typicalmain-sequence star-forming galaxies, although with a smaller offset thanexpected based on past studies of local starbursts. we put forward a hypothesisthat there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency withelevation from the main sequence with galaxy mergers as a possible physicaldriver. along with a heightened star formation efficiency, our high-redshiftsample is similar in other respects to local starbursts such as being metalrich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium.

1506.05475	the composite nature of dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) at z~2-3 in the  cosmos field: i. a far-infrared view	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are bright 24 um-selected sources with extremeobscuration at optical wavelengths. they are typically characterized by arising power-law continuum of hot dust (t_d ~ 200-1000k) in the near-irindicating that their mid-ir luminosity is dominated by an an active galacticnucleus (agn). dogs with a fainter 24 um flux display a stellar bump in thenear-ir and their mid-ir luminosity appears to be mainly powered by dusty starformation. alternatively, it may be that the mid-ir emission arising from agnactivity is dominant but the torus is sufficiently opaque to make the near-iremission from the agn negligible with respect to the emission from the hostcomponent. in an effort to characterize the astrophysical nature of theprocesses responsible for the ir emission in dogs, this paper exploits herscheldata (pacs + spire) on a sample of 95 dogs within the cosmos field. we derive awealth of far-ir properties (e.g., total ir luminosities; mid-to-far ir colors;dust temperatures and masses) based on sed fitting. of particular interest arethe 24 um-bright dogs (f_24um &gt; 1mjy). they present bluer far-ir/mid-ir colorsthan the rest of the sample, unveiling the potential presence of an agn. theagn contribution to the total 8-1000 um flux increases as a function of therest-frame 8 um-luminosity irrespective of the redshift. this confirms thatfaint dogs (l_8 um&lt; 10^12 l_sun) are dominated by star-formation while brighterdogs show a larger contribution from an agn.

1509.01101	the lyman continuum escape fraction of galaxies at z=3.3 in the  vuds-lbc/cosmos field	the lyman continuum (lyc) flux escaping from high-z galaxies into the igm isa fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in thereionization epoch. we have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies atz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of lyc photons escaping fromgalaxy halos. uv deep imaging in the cosmos field obtained with the prime focuscamera lbc at the lbt telescope was used together with a catalog ofspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds) to builda sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with l&gt;0.5l*. we obtained deep lbc images ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.40 both in the rand deep u bands. a sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escapefractions&gt;28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, withthe exception of two marginal detections (s/n~2) in the u band, all the other 8galaxies are most likely contaminated by the uv flux of low-z interloperslocated close to the high-z targets. the average escape fraction derived fromthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel&lt;2%. the impliedhi photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the igmionized at z~3, as observed in the lyman forest of high-z qso spectra or by theproximity effect. these results support a scenario where high redshift,relatively bright (l&gt;0.5l*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustainthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic igm at z~3. star-forminggalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (l&lt;&lt;l*) can be themajor contributors to the reionization of the universe only if their physicalproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. alternatively,ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the agnpopulation at high-z.

astro-ph;0112184	chandra deep field south: the 1msec catalog	in this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposureof the chandra deep field south (cdfs), using acis-i on the chandra x-rayobservatory. catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two differentmethods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the sextractoralgorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for chandraobservations. the detection threshold has been set in order to have less than10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. we subdivided thecatalog into four sections. the primary list consists of objects common to thetwo detection methods. two secondary lists contain sources which were detectedby: 1) the sextractor algorithm alone and 2) the wavelet technique alone. thefourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. the flux limitsat the aimpoint for the soft (0.5--2 kev) and hard (2--10 kev) bands are5.5e-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 4.5e-16 erg/s/cm^2 respectively. the total number ofsources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5--2 kev band, and 251in the 2--10 kev band.  we also present optical identifications for the catalogued sources. ourprimary optical data is r band imaging to a depth of r~26.5 (vega). we foundthat the r-band/chandra offsets are small, ~1 arcsec. coordinatecross-correlation finds 85% of the chandra sources covered in r to havecounterparts within the 3-sigma error box (&gt;~1.5 arcsec depending on off-axisangle and signal-to-noise). the unidentified fraction of sources, approximately~10--15 %, is close to the limit expected from the observed x-ray flux tor-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.

(2001) have shown that ingalaxies with radio luminosities greater than 1e23 w/hz the majority of theradio emission originates from a `monster' i.e., an agn. using the chandra2msec x-ray image centered on the goods-n field and a reprocessed vla hdfa-array data plus newly acquired vla b-array data (rms=5.3microjy), we findthat radio galaxies (with spectroscopic redshifts; all have z&gt;1) withl(1.4ghz)&gt;1e24 w/hz typically have an x-ray detection rate of 72% (60% emithard x-rays suggesting an agn origin for the radio emission) in contrast to 25%for radio galaxies with l &lt; 1e23 w/hz. the acs images of these l(1.4 ghz) &gt;1e24 w/hz galaxies typically show compact rather than extended galaxymorphology which is generally found for the less luminous radio emittinggalaxies but a few appear to be ongoing galaxy mergers. we also present sedfitting for these luminous radio galaxies including spitzer irac &amp; mips 24umphotometry and 60% show distinct power-law sed indicative of an agn. initialresults tell us that the x-ray emitting radio galaxy population are generallynot submm sources but the few (~10%) that are scuba sources appear to be thesmall agn population found by pope et al. and others.

astro-ph;0607242	aegis: the diversity of bright near-ir selected distant red galaxies	we use deep and wide near infrared (nir) imaging from the palomar telescopecombined with deep2 spectroscopy and hubble space telescope (hst) and chandraspace telescope imaging to investigate the nature of galaxies that are red innir colors. we locate these `distant red galaxies' (drgs) through the color cut(j-k)_{vega} &gt; 2.3 over 0.7 deg^{2}, where we find 1010 drg candidates down tok_s = 20.5. we combine 95 high quality spectroscopic redshifts with photometricredshifts from brijk photometry to determine the redshift and stellar massdistributions for these systems, and morphological/structural and x-rayproperties for 107 drgs in the extended groth strip. we find that many bright(j-k)_{vega}&gt;2.3 galaxies with k_s&lt;20.5 are at redshifts z&lt;2, with 64% between1&lt;z&lt;2. the stellar mass distributions for these galaxies is broad, ranging from10^{9}-10^{12} m_solar, but with most z&gt;2 systems massive with m_*&gt;10^{11}m_solar. hst imaging shows that the structural properties and morphologies ofdrgs are also diverse, with the majority elliptical/compact (57%), and theremainder edge-on spirals (7%), and peculiar galaxies (29%). the drgs at z &lt;1.4 with high quality spectroscopic redshifts are generally compact, with smallhalf light radii, and span a range in rest-frame optical properties. thespectral energy distributions for these objects differ from higher redshiftdrgs: they are bluer by one magnitude in observed (i-j) color. a pure ir colorselection of high redshift populations is not sufficient to identify uniquepopulations, and other colors, or spectroscopic redshifts are needed to producehomogeneous samples.

astro-ph;0611187	simulating the cosmos: the fraction of merging galaxies at high redshift	simulations of nearby (0.015 &lt; z &lt; 0.025) sdss galaxies have been used toreproduce as accurately as possible the appearance that they would have oncosmos acs images if they had been observed at z ~ 0.7 and z ~ 1.2. by addingthe sdss galaxies to random locations in the cosmos images, we simulate theeffects of chance superpositions of high redshift galaxies with unrelatedforeground or background objects. we have used these simulated images, togetherwith those of real cosmos galaxies at these same redshifts, to undertake a"blind" morphological classification of galaxies to identify those that appearto be undergoing mergers and thus to estimate the change in merger fractionwith redshift. we find that real mergers are harder to recognize at highredshift, and also that the chance superposition of unrelated galaxies oftenproduces the appearance of mergers where in reality none exists. in particular,we estimate that 1.5 - 2.0% of objects randomly added to acs images aremisclassified as mergers due to projection with unrelated objects, and as aresult, that 40% of the apparent mergers in cosmos at z=0.7 are likely to bespurious. we find that the fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers increases as(1+z)^3.8+/-1.2 to z ~ 0.7 and that this trend appears to continue to z = 1.2.merger candidates at z ~ 0.7 are bluer than the parent population, especiallywhen the statistical effects of the chance projections are accounted for.merger candidates are more asymmetric than the population as a whole, and areoften associated with irregular morphology. nevertheless, the majority (~60%)of the merger candidates appear to be associated with spiral galaxies althoughin this case we cannot correct for the effects of chance projections.

astro-ph;0611644	cosmos morphological classification with zest (the zurich estimator of  structural types) and the evolution since z=1 of the luminosity function of  early-, disk-, and irregular galaxies	(abridged) motivated by the desire to reliably and automatically classifystructure of thousands of cosmos galaxies, we present zest, the zurichestimator of structural types. to classify galaxy structure, zest uses: (i)five non-parametric diagnostics: asymmetry, concentration, gini coefficient,2nd-order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels, and ellipticity; and(ii) the exponent n of single--sersic fits to the 2d surface brightnessdistributions. to fully exploit the wealth of information while reducing theredundancy present in these diagnostics, zest performs a principal component(pc) analysis. we use a sample of ~56,000 i&lt;24 cosmos galaxies to show that thefirst three pcs fully describe the key aspects of the galaxy structure, i.e.,to calibrate a three-dimensional classification grid of axis pc_1, pc_2, andpc_3. we demonstrate the robustness of the zest grid on the z=0 sample of freiet al. (1996). the zest classification breaks most of the degeneracy betweendifferent galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications basedon only some of the diagnostics included in zest. as a first application, wepresent the evolution since z~1 of the luminosity functions of cosmos galaxiesof early, disk and irregular galaxies and, for disk galaxies, of differentbulge-to-disk ratios. overall, we find that the lf up to a redshift z=1 isconsistent with a pure-luminosity evolution (of about 0.95 magnitudes at z\~0.7). we highlight however two trends, that are in general agreement with adown-sizing scenario for galaxy formation: (1.) a deficit of a factor of abouttwo at z~0.7 of mb&gt;-20.5 structurally--classified early--type galaxies; and(2.) an excess of a factor of about three, at a similar redshift, of irregulargalaxies.

astro-ph;0701482	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): a large-scale structure at z=0.73  and the relation of galaxy morphologies to local environment	we have identified a large-scale structure at z~0.73 in the cosmos field,coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, anacs weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended x-ray sourcesin a mosaic of xmm observations. the main peak seen in these maps correspondsto a rich cluster with tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 kev and lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}erg/s ([0.1-2.4] kev band). we estimate an x-ray mass within $r500$corresponding to m500~1.6 x 10^{14} msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolatedby fitting a nfw profile) m(nfw)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 msun. we use an automatedmorphological classification of all galaxies brighter than i_ab=24 over thestructure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function oflocal projected density sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived fromground-based deep multi-band photometry. we recover a robust morphology-densityrelation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, asmaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. interestingly, thisdifference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe inintermediate environments. we also find, however, local "inversions'' of theobserved global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. inparticular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of diskgalaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the x-raytemperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. weinterpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation inexisting galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

astro-ph;0701746	the redshift evolution of early-type galaxies in cosmos: do massive  early-type galaxies form by dry mergers?	abridged: we study the evolution since z~1 of the rest-frame b luminosityfunction of the early-type galaxies (etgs) in ~0.7 deg^2 in the cosmos field.in order to identify all progenitors of local etgs we construct the sample ofhigh-z galaxies using two complementary criteria: (i) a morphological selectionbased on the zurich estimator of structural types, and (ii) a photometricselection based on the galaxy properties in the (u-v)-m_v color-magnitudediagram. we furthermore constrain both samples so as to ensure that theselected progenitors of etgs are compatible with evolving into systems whichobey the mu_b-r_{hl} kormendy relation. assuming the luminosity evolutionderived from studies of the fundamental plane for high-z etgs, our analysisshows no evidence for a decrease in the number density of the most massive etgsout to z~ 0.7: both the morphologically- and the photometrically-selectedsub-samples show no evolution in the number density of bright (~l&gt;2.5l*) etgs.allowing for different star formation histories, and cosmic variance, weestimate a maximum decrease in the number density of massive galaxies at thatredshift of ~30%. we observe, however, in both the photometrical andmorphological samples, a deficit of up to ~2-3 of fainter etgs over the samecosmic period. our results argue against a significant contribution of recentdissipationless ``dry'' mergers to the formation of the most massive etgs. wesuggest that the mass growth in low luminosity etgs can be explained with aconversion from z~0.7 to z=0 of blue, irregular and disk galaxies into low- andintermediate-mass ``red'' etgs, possibly also through gas rich mergers.

astro-ph;9902376	pks2250-41 and the role of jet-cloud interactions in powerful radio  galaxies (full paper)	we present high resolution, long-slit spectra of the jet-cloud interaction inthe powerful southern radio galaxy pks2250-41. we have resolved the emissionlines into two main kinematic components: a broad component (fwhm \geq 900km/s) and a narrow component (fwhm \leq 150 km/s). while the broad component ischaracterized by a low ionization level (with particular ly weakheii$\lambda$4686 emission) and is spatially associated with the radio lobe,the narrow component is characterized by a higher ionization level and extendswell beyond the radio lobe. crucially, we measure a higher electron temperaturefor the broad component (t \sim 30,000 k) than for the narrow component (t \sim15,000 k). the general line ratios and physical conditions of the twocomponents are consistent with a model in which the broad component r epresentsgas cooling behind the shock front driven by the radio jets, while the narrowcomponent represents the agn- or shock-photoionized precursor gas. however,uncertainties remain about the gas acceleration mechanism behind the shockfront: unless the radio components are expanding unusually fast in this source,it is likely that entrainment of the warm clouds in the hot post-shock wind orradio plasma is required.  the similarities between the kinematic properties of pks2250-41 and some highredshift radio galaxies suggest that the ambient and the shocked gas have alsobeen resolved in the more distant objects. given the evidence that the emissionline processes are affected by the interactions between the radio and theoptical structures, care must be taken when interpreting the uv spectra of highredshift radio galaxies.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.

0810.4838	on the contribution of large scale structure to strong gravitational  lensing	we study the correlation between the locations of galaxy-galaxy stronglensing candidates and tracers of large-scale structure from both weak lensingor x-ray emission. the cosmos survey is a unique data set, combining deep, highresolution and contiguous imaging in which strong lenses have been discovered,plus unparalleled multiwavelength coverage. to help interpret the cosmos data,we have also produced mock cosmos strong and weak lensing observations, basedon ray-tracing through the millenium simulation. in agreement with thesimulations, we find that strongly lensed images with the largest angularseparations are found in the densest regions of the cosmos field. this isexplained by a prevalence among the lens population in dense environments ofelliptical galaxies with high total-to-stellar mass ratios, which can deflectlight through larger angles. however, we also find that the overall fraction ofelliptical galaxies with strong gravitational lensing is independent of thelocal mass density; this observation is not true of the simulations, whichpredict an increasing fraction of strong lenses in dense environments. thediscrepancy may be a real effect, but could also be explained by variouslimitations of our analysis. for example, our visual search of strong lenssystems could be incomplete and suffer from selection bias; the luminosityfunction of elliptical galaxies may differ between our real and simulated data;or the simplifying assumptions and approximations used in our lensingsimulations may be inadequate. work is therefore ongoing. automated searchesfor strong lens systems will be particularly important in better constrainingthe selection function.
