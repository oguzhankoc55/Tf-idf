0911.3775	spectroscopic fingerprint of phase-incoherent superconductivity in the  cuprate pseudogap state	a possible explanation for the existence of the cuprate "pseudogap" state isthat it is a d-wave superconductor without quantum phase rigidity. transportand thermodynamic studies provide compelling evidence that supports thisproposal, but few spectroscopic explorations of it have been made. onespectroscopic signature of d-wave superconductivity is the particle-holesymmetric "octet" of dispersive bogoliubov quasiparticle interferencemodulations. here we report on this octet's evolution from low temperatures towell into the underdoped pseudogap regime. no pronounced changes occur in theoctet phenomenology at the superconductor's critical temperature tc, and itsurvives up to at least temperature t ~ 1.5tc. in the pseudogap regime, weobserve the detailed phenomenology that was theoretically predicted forquasiparticle interference in a phase-incoherent d-wave superconductor. thus,our results not only provide spectroscopic evidence to confirm and extend thetransport and thermodynamics studies, but they also open the way forspectroscopic explorations of phase fluctuation rates, their effects on thefermi arc, and the fundamental source of the phase fluctuations that suppresssuperconductivity in underdoped cuprates.

1007.3216	intra-unit-cell electronic nematicity of the high-tc copper-oxide  pseudogap states	in the high-transition-temperature (high-tc) superconductors the pseudogapphase becomes predominant when the density of doped holes is reduced1. withinthis phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken,what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and whichmicroscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. here we report thedetermination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cellnematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structurewithin cuo2 unit cell. we analyze spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelingmicroscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdopedbi2sr2cacu2o8+{\delta} and, using two independent evaluation techniques, findevidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy.moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronicdifferences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. if thecharacteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have thesame microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the osites that break 90o -rotational symmetry within every cuo2 unit cell.

0708.3728	quasi-particle interference and superconducting gap in a  high-temperature superconductor ca2-xnaxcuo2cl2	high-transition-temperature (high-tc) superconductivity is ubiquitous in thecuprates containing cuo2 planes but each cuprate has its own character. thestudy of the material dependence of the d-wave superconducting gap (sg) shouldprovide important insights into the mechanism of high-tc. however, because ofthe 'pseudogap' phenomenon, it is often unclear whether the energy gapsobserved by spectroscopic techniques really represent the sg. here, we reportspectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (si-stm) studies ofnearly-optimally-doped ca2-xnaxcuo2cl2 (na-ccoc) with tc = 25 ~ 28 k. theyenable us to observe the quasi-particle interference (qpi) effect in thismaterial, through which unambiguous new information on the sg is obtained. theanalysis of qpi in na-ccoc reveals that the sg dispersion near the gap node isalmost identical to that of bi2sr2cacu2oy (bi2212) at the same doping level,while tc of bi2212 is 3 times higher than that of na-ccoc. we also find that sgin na-ccoc is confined in narrower energy and momentum ranges than bi2212. thisexplains at least in part the remarkable material dependence of tc

0709.0632	bogoliubov angle and visualization of particle-hole mixture in  superconductors	superconducting excitations --bogoliubov quasiparticles -- are the quantummechanical mixture of negatively charged electron (-e) and positively chargedhole (+e). depending on the applied voltage bias in stm one can sample theparticle and hole content of such a superconducting excitation. recent scanningtunneling microscope (stm) experiments offer a unique insight into the innerworkings of the superconducting state of superconductors. we propose a newobservable quantity for stm studies that is the manifestation of theparticle-hole dualism of the quasiparticles. we call it a {\em bogoliubovangle}. this angle measures the relative weight of particle and hole amplitudein the superconducting (bogoliubov) quasiparticle. we argue that this quantitycan be measured locally by comparing the ratio of tunneling currents atpositive and negative biases. this bogoliubov angle allows one to measuredirectly the energy and position dependent particle-hole admixture andtherefore visualize robustness of superconducting state locally. it may alsoallow one to measure the particle-hole admixture of excitations in normal stateabove critical temperature and thus may be used to measure superconductingcorrelations in pseudogap state.

1104.0075	time-dependent searches for point sources of neutrinos with the  40-string and 22-string configurations of icecube	this paper presents searches for flaring sources of neutrinos using theicecube neutrino telescope. for the first time, a search is performed over theentire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrinoflares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources amongthe atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. searches which integrate overtime are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a largerbackground of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the timeconstraint. flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,soft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrinoemitters. we used mainly data taken between april 5, 2008 and may 20, 2009 by apartially completed configuration of icecube with 40 strings. for the presentedsearches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependentprior to test several different source hypotheses. an "untriggered" searchcovers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to anyother observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.moreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue ofsources that exhibit intense photon flares. searches triggered bymulti-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-rayrepeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by theprevious configuration of 22 strings in operation between may 31, 2007 andapril 5, 2008. flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring isavailable from fermi-lat and swift and flares detected by imaging cherenkovtelescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered. the results fromall searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background.

1108.0171	icecube sensitivity for low-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae	this paper describes the response of the icecube neutrino telescope locatedat the geographic south pole to outbursts of mev neutrinos from the corecollapse of nearby massive stars. icecube was completed in december 2010forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1cubic kilometer in the deep antarctic ice for particle induced photons. thetelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 gev.owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates areparticularly low. hence icecube can also detect large numbers of mev neutrinosby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the darknoise. with 2 ms timing resolution, icecube can detect subtle features in thetemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. for a supernova at thegalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-freemegaton-scale supernova search experiment. the sensitivity decreases to 20standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations atthe large magellanic cloud (50 kpc). icecube is sending triggers from potentialsupernovae to the supernova early warning system. the sensitivity to neutrinoproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as thepossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electronneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black holeas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrateicecube's capability for supernova detection.

1208.3430	an improved method for measuring muon energy using the truncated mean of  de/dx	the measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in largecherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separatingextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. muonenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss(de/dx) along the muon's path and relating the de/dx to the muon energy.because high-energy muons (e_mu &gt; 1 tev) lose energy randomly, the spread inde/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 inlog10(e_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the icecubedetector. in this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncatedmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. the muon track isdivided into separate segments with individual de/dx values. the elimination ofsegments with the highest de/dx results in an overall de/dx that is moreclosely correlated to the muon energy. this method results in an energyresolution of 0.22 in log10(e_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. thistechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially tolarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

1303.4416	imaging cooper pairing of heavy fermions in cecoin5	the cooper pairing mechanism of heavy-fermion superconductors, while longhypothesized as due to spin fluctuations, has not been determined. it is themomentum space (k-space) structure of the superconducting energy gap delta(k)that encodes specifics of this pairing mechanism. however, because the energyscales are so low, it has not been possible to directly measure delta(k) forany heavy-fermion superconductor. bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (qpi)imaging, a proven technique for measuring the energy gaps of high-tcsuperconductors, has recently been proposed as a new method to measure delta(k)in heavy-fermion superconductors, specifically cecoin5. by implementing thismethod, we immediately detect a superconducting energy gap whose nodes areoriented along k||(+-1, +-1)pi/a0 directions. moreover, we determine thecomplete k-space structure of the delta(k) of a heavy-fermion superconductor.for cecoin5, this novel information includes: the complex band structure andfermi surface of the hybridized heavy bands, the fact that highest magnitudedelta(k) opens on a high-k band so that gap nodes occur at quite unanticipatedk-space locations, and that the bogoliubov quasiparticle interference patternsare most consistent with dx2-y2 gap symmetry. the availability of suchquantitative heavy band- and gap-structure data will be critical in identifyingthe microscopic mechanism of heavy fermion superconductivity in this material,and perhaps in general.

0801.0087	evolution of the electronic excitation spectrum with strongly  diminishing hole-density in superconducting bi_{2}sr_{2}cacu_{2}o_{8+\delta}	a complete knowledge of its excitation spectrum could greatly benefit effortsto understand the unusual form of superconductivity occurring in the lightlyhole-doped copper-oxides. here we use tunnelling spectroscopy to measure thet\to 0 spectrum of electronic excitations n(e) over a wide range ofhole-density p in superconducting bi_{2}sr_{2}cacu_{2}o_{8+/delta}. weintroduce a parameterization for n(e) based upon an anisotropic energy-gap/delta (\vec k)=/delta_{1}(cos(k_{x})-cos(k_{y}))/2 plus an effectivescattering rate which varies linearly with energy /gamma_{2}(e) . wedemonstrate that this form of n(e) allows successful fitting of differentialtunnelling conductance spectra throughout much of thebi_{2}sr_{2}cacu_{2}o_{8+/delta} phase diagram. the resulting average/delta_{1} values rise with falling p along the familiar trajectory ofexcitations to the 'pseudogap' energy, while the key scattering rate/gamma_{2}^{*}=/gamma_{2}(e=/delta_{1}) increases from below ~1mev to a valueapproaching 25mev as the system is underdoped from p~16% to p&lt;10%. thus, asingle, particle-hole symmetric, anisotropic energy-gap, in combination with astrongly energy and doping dependent effective scattering rate, can describethe spectra without recourse to another ordered state. nevertheless we alsoobserve two distinct and diverging energy scales in the system: the energy-gapmaximum /delta_{1} and a lower energy scale /delta_{0} separating the spatiallyhomogeneous and heterogeneous electronic structures.

1308.5501	improvement in fast particle track reconstruction with robust statistics	the icecube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of deep naturalantarctic ice into a cherenkov detector. muon neutrinos are detected and theirdirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon trackinside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. reconstructing the muontrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering inthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muonsinside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. thismanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstructionproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover thetrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determinehow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. rather thansolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that areapplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment thedetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statisticaltechniques. these can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstructionand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. using the metric ofmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, weimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. we alsopresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: wecan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.

1311.7048	search for a diffuse flux of astrophysical muon neutrinos with the  icecube 59-string configuration	a search for high-energy neutrinos was performed using data collected by theicecube neutrino observatory from may 2009 to may 2010, when the array wasrunning in its 59-string configuration. the data sample was optimized tocontain muon neutrino induced events with a background contamination ofatmospheric muons of less than 1%. these data, which are dominated byatmospheric neutrinos, are analyzed with a global likelihood fit to search forpossible contributions of prompt atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos,neither of which have yet been identified. such signals are expected to followa harder energy spectrum than conventional atmospheric neutrinos. in addition,the zenith angle distribution differs for astrophysical and atmosphericsignals. a global fit of the reconstructed energies and directions of observedevents is performed, including possible neutrino flux contributions for anastrophysical signal and atmospheric backgrounds as well as systematicuncertainties of the experiment and theoretical predictions. the best fityields an astrophysical signal flux for $\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\mu $ of $e^2 \cdot\phi (e) = 0.25 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{gev} \textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{sr}^{-1}$, and a zero prompt component. although the sensitivity ofthis analysis for astrophysical neutrinos surpasses the waxman and bahcallupper bound, the experimental limit at 90% confidence level is a factor of 1.5above at a flux of $e^2 \cdot \phi (e) = 1.44 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{gev}\textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1} \textrm{sr}^{-1}$.

1406.6757	searches for extended and point-like neutrino sources with four years of  icecube data	we present results on searches for point-like sources of neutrinos using fouryears of icecube data, including the first year of data from the completed86-string detector. the total livetime of the combined dataset is 1,373 days.for an e$^{-2}$ spectrum the median sensitivity at 90\% c.l. is $\sim 10^{-12}$tev$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for energies between 1 tev$-$1 pev in the northernsky and $\sim 10^{-11}$ tev$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for energies between 100tev $-$ 100 pev in the southern sky. the sensitivity has improved from both theadditional year of data and the introduction of improved reconstructionscompared to previous publications. in addition, we present the first resultsfrom an all-sky search for extended sources of neutrinos. we update results ofsearches for neutrino emission from stacked catalogs of sources, and test fivenew catalogs; two of galactic supernova remnants and three of active galacticnuclei. in all cases, the data are compatible with the background-onlyhypothesis, and upper limits on the flux of muon neutrinos are reported for thesources considered.

1406.6868	multipole analysis of icecube data to search for dark matter accumulated  in the galactic halo	dark matter which is bound in the galactic halo might self-annihilate andproduce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.these neutrinos can be detected with icecube, a cubic-kilometer sized cherenkovdetector. given icecube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy ofthe additional neutrino flux is expected. in this paper we describe a multipolemethod to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in icecube data. this methoduses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrivaldirections and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansioncoefficient. we apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample fromthe northern hemisphere. the final result is compatible with thenull-hypothesis. as no signal was observed, we present limits on theself-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocitydistribution $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ down to $1.9\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of$700\,\mathrm{gev}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{gev}$ and direct annihilation into$\nu\bar{\nu}$. the resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limitsfrom $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer galactic halo, for highdark matter masses of a few tev and hard annihilation channels.

1408.0634	searches for small-scale anisotropies from neutrino point sources with  three years of icecube data	recently, icecube found evidence for a diffuse signal of astrophysicalneutrinos in an energy range of $60\,\mathrm{tev}$ to the $\mathrm{pev}$-scale.the origin of those events, being a key to understanding the origin of cosmicrays, is still an unsolved question. so far, analyses have not succeeded toresolve the diffuse signal into point-like sources. searches including amaximum-likelihood-ratio test, based on the reconstructed directions andenergies of the detected down- and up-going neutrino candidates, were alsoperformed on icecube data leading to the exclusion of bright point sources. inthis paper, we present two methods to search for faint neutrino point sourcesin three years of icecube data, taken between 2008 and 2011. the first methodis an autocorrelation test, applied separately to the northern and southernsky. the second method is a multipole analysis, which expands the measured datain the northern hemisphere into spherical harmonics and uses the resultingexpansion coefficients to separate signal from background. with both methods,the results are consistent with the background expectation with a slightly moresparse spatial distribution, corresponding to an underfluctuation. depending onthe assumed number of sources, the resulting upper limit on the flux per sourcein the northern hemisphere for an $e^{-2}$ energy spectrum ranges from $1.5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s})$, in the case of oneassumed source, to $4 \cdot 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s})$, in the case of $3500$ assumed sources.

1507.03991	a combined maximum-likelihood analysis of the high-energy astrophysical  neutrino flux measured with icecube	evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now beenfound in multiple searches with the icecube detector. the first solid evidencewas provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies$\gtrsim30$ tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. recentanalyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies andis also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the northernhemisphere. here, we combine the results from six different icecube searchesfor astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. the combinedevent sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-likeevents. the data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle andevent topology. assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and toconsist of equal flavors at earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrinoenergies between 25 tev and 2.8 pev is well described by an unbroken power lawwith best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 tev of$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavoredwith a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the bestfit. this significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead wecompare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponentialcut-off at high energies. allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate fromthe other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at earth.the sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic ofneutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

0808.3816	how cooper pairs vanish approaching the mott insulator in  bi2sr2cacu2o8+d	the antiferromagnetic ground state of copper oxide mott insulators isachieved by localizing an electron at each copper atom in real space (r-space).removing a small fraction of these electrons (hole doping) transforms thissystem into a superconducting fluid of delocalized cooper pairs in momentumspace (k-space). during this transformation, two distinctive classes ofelectronic excitations appear. at high energies, the enigmatic 'pseudogap'excitations are found, whereas, at lower energies, bogoliubov quasi-particles-- the excitations resulting from the breaking of cooper pairs -- should exist.to explore this transformation, and to identify the two excitation types, wehave imaged the electronic structure of bi2sr2cacu2o8+d in r-space and k-spacesimultaneously. we find that although the low energy excitations are indeedbogoliubov quasi-particles, they occupy only a restricted region of k-spacethat shrinks rapidly with diminishing hole density. concomitantly, spectralweight is transferred to higher energy r-space states that lack thecharacteristics of excitations from delocalized cooper pairs. instead, thesestates break translational and rotational symmetries locally at the atomicscale in an energy independent fashion. we demonstrate that these unusualr-space excitations are, in fact, the pseudogap states. thus, as the mottinsulating state is approached by decreasing the hole density, the delocalizedcooper pairs vanish from k-space, to be replaced by locally translational- androtational-symmetry-breaking pseudogap states in r-space.

0809.0583	imaging the impact on cuprate superconductivity of varying the  inter-atomic distances within individual crystal unit-cells	many theoretical models of high temperature superconductivity focus only onthe doping dependence of the cuo2 plane electronic structure. but such modelsare manifestly insufficient to explain the strong variations in superconductingcritical temperature tc among cuprates which have identical hole-density butare crystallographically different outside the cuo2 plane. a key challenge,therefore, has been to identify a predominant out-of-plane influencecontrolling the superconductivity - with much attention focusing on thedistance $d_a$ between the apical oxygen and the planar copper atom. here wereport direct determination of how variations of inter-atomic distances withinindividual crystalline unit cells, affect the superconducting energy-gapmaximum $\delta$ of bi2sr2cacu2o8. in this material, quasi-periodic variationsof unit cell geometry occur in the form of a bulk crystalline'supermodulation'. within each supermodulation period, we find a $\sim 9\pm1%$co-sinusoidal variation in local $\delta$ that is anti-correlated with theassociated $d_a$ variations. furthermore, we show that phenomenologicalconsistency would exist between these effects and the random $\delta$variations found near dopant atoms if the primary effect of the interstitialdopant atom is to displace the apical oxygen so as to diminish $d_a$ or tiltthe cuo5 pyramid. thus we reveal a strong non-random out-of-plane effect oncuprate superconductivity at atomic scale.

cond-mat;0104237	interplay of magnetism and high-tc superconductivity at individual ni  impurity atoms in bi2sr2cacu2o8+d	in conventional superconductors, magnetic interactions and magnetic impurityatoms are destructive to superconductivity. by contrast, in some unconventionalsystems, e.g. superfluid 3he and superconducting uge2, superconductivity orsuperfluidity is actually mediated by magnetic interactions. a magneticmechanism has also been proposed for high temperature superconductivity (htsc)in which an electron magnetically polarizes its environment resulting in anattractive pairing-interaction for oppositely polarized spins. since a magneticimpurity atom would apparently not disrupt such a pairing-interaction, it hasalso been proposed that the weaker influences on htsc of magnetic ni impurityatoms compared to those of non-magnetic zn are evidence for a magneticmechanism. here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (stm) to determinedirectly the influence of individual ni atoms on the electronic structure ofbi2sr2cacu2o8+d. two local d-wave impurity-states are observed at each ni.analysis of their energies surprisingly reveals that the primary quasiparticlescattering effects of ni atoms are due to non-magnetic interactions.nonetheless, we also demonstrate that a magnetic moment coexists withunimpaired superconductivity at each ni site. we discuss the implications ofthese phenomena, and those at zn, for the pairing-mechanism.

cond-mat;0107347	discovery of microscopic electronic inhomogeneity in the high-tc  superconductor bi2sr2cacu2o8+x	the parent compounds of the copper oxide high-tc superconductors are unusualinsulators. superconductivity arises when they are properly doped away fromstoichiometry1. in bi2sr2cacu2o8+x, superconductivity results from doping withexcess oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (holes) into thecuo2 planes, where superconductivity is believed to originate. the role ofthese oxygen dopants is not well understood, other than the fact that theyprovide charge carriers. however, it is not even clear how these chargesdistribute in the cuo2 planes. accordingly, many models of high-tcsuperconductors simply assume that the charge carriers introduced by dopingdistribute uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system, as inordinary metals. here we report the observation of an electronic inhomogeneityin the high-tc superconductor bi2sr2cacu2o8+x using scanning tunnellingmicroscopy/spectroscopy. this inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial variationsin both the local density of states spectrum and the superconducting energygap. these variations are correlated spatially and vary on a surprisingly shortlength scale of ~ 14 angs. analysis suggests that the inhomogeneity observed isa consequence of proximity to a mott insulator resulting in poor screening ofthe charge potentials associated with the oxygen ions left behind in the bioplane after doping. hence this experiment is a direct probe of the local natureof the superconducting state, which is not easily accessible by macroscopicmeasurements.

cond-mat;0112232	imaging the granular structure of high-tc superconductivity in  underdoped bi2sr2cacu2o8+x	granular superconductivity occurs when microscopic superconducting grains areseparated by non-superconducting regions through which they communicate byjosephson tunneling to establish the macroscopic superconducting state [1].although crystals of the cuprate high-tc superconductors are not granular in astructural sense, theory indicates that at low hole densities the holes canbecome concentrated at some locations resulting in hole-rich superconductingdomains [2-5]. granular superconductivity due to josephson tunneling through'undoped' regions between such domains would represent a new paradigm for theunderdoped cuprates. here we report studies of the spatial interrelationshipsbetween stm tunneling spectra in underdoped bi2sr2cacu2o8+x. they reveal anapparent spatial segregation of the electronic structure into ~3nm diameterdomains (with superconducting characteristics and local energy gap delta&lt;50mev) in an electronically distinct background. to explore whether thisrepresents nanoscale segregation of two distinct electronic phases, we employscattering-resonances at ni impurity atoms [6] as 'markers' for the localexistence of superconductivity [7-9]. no ni-resonances are detected in anyregions where delta&gt;50(2.5) mev. these observations suggest that underdopedbi2sr2cacu2o8+x is a mixture of two different short-range electronic orderswith the long-range characteristics of a granular superconductor.

cond-mat;0409102	a `checkerboard' electronic crystal state in lightly hole-doped  ca_{2-x}na_{x}cuo_{2}cl_{2}	the phase diagram of hole-doped copper oxides shows four different electronicphases existing at zero temperature. familiar among these are the mottinsulator, high-transition-temperature superconductor and metallic phases. afourth phase, ofunknown identity, occurs at light doping along thezero-temperature bound of the `pseudogap' regime. this regime is rich inpeculiar electronic phenomena, prompting numerous proposals that it containssome form of hidden electronic order. here we present low-temperatureelectronic structure imaging studies of a lightly hole-doped copper oxide:ca_{2-x}na_{x}cuo_{2}cl_{2}. tunnelling spectroscopy (at energies |e|&gt;100 mev)reveals electron extraction probabilities greatly exceeding those forinjection, as anticipated for a doped mott insulator. however, for |e|&lt;100 mev,the spectrum exhibits a v-shaped energy gap centred on e=0. states within thisgap undergo intense spatial modulations, with the spatial correlations of afour cuo_{2}-unit-cell square checkerboard, independent of energy. intricateatomic-scale electronic structure variations also exist within thecheckerboard. these data are consistent with an unanticipated crystallineelectronic state, possibly the hidden electronic order, existing in thezero-temperature pseudogap regime of ca_{2-x}na_{x}cuo_{2}cl_{2}.

cond-mat;0507610	fourier-transformed local density of states and tunneling into a  $d$-wave superconductor with bosonic modes	we analyze the effects of the electronic coupling to bosonic modes in ad-wave superconductor. the role of the scattering due to boson on the momentumtransfer between electronic states in the brilloine zone is addressed. weconsider specific examples of $b_{1g}$ phonon, breathing mode phonon and spinresonance at $(\pi,\pi)$. the fourier spectrum of the energy derivative localdensity of states (ldos) is calculated. to properly calibrate the effects ofdifferent modes we fix the quasipartilce renormalization at specific momentumpoints. it is found that the $b_{1g}$ mode with highly anisotropicmomentum-dependent coupling matrix element gives rise to well definded featuresin the fourier spectrum, at the energy of mode plus gap, with a momentumtransfer along the cu-o bond direction of cuprates. this result is in astriking contrast to the cases of the coupling to other modes and also to thecase of no mode coupling. the origin of this difference is explored in detail.a comparison with the recent stm experiments is briefly discussed.

cond-mat;0608149	interplay of electron-lattice interactions and superconductivity in  bi2sr2cacu2o8+d	formation of electron pairs is essential to superconductivity. forconventional superconductors, tunnelling spectroscopy has established thatpairing is mediated by bosonic modes (phonons); a peak in the second derivativeof tunnel current d2i/dv2 corresponds to each phonon mode . forhigh-transition-temperature (high-tc) superconductivity, however, no bosonmediating electron pairing has been identified. one explanation could be thatelectron pair formation and related electron-boson interactions areheterogeneous at the atomic scale and therefore challenging to characterize.however, with the latest advances in d2i/dv2 spectroscopy using scanningtunnelling microscopy, it has become possible to study bosonic modes directlyat the atomic scale . here we report d2i/dv2 imaging studies of the high-tcsuperconductor bi2sr2cacu2o8+d. we find intense disorder of electron-bosoninteraction energies at the nanometre scale, along with the expectedmodulations in d2i/dv2 (refs 9,10). changing the density of holes has minimaleffects on both the average mode energies and the modulations, indicating thatthe bosonic modes are unrelated to electronic or magnetic structure. instead,the modes appear to be local lattice vibrations, as substitution of 18o for 16othroughout the material reduces the average mode energy by approximately 6 percent - the expected effect of this isotope substitution on lattice vibrationfrequencies. significantly, the mode energies are always spatiallyanticorrelated with the superconducting pairing-gap energies, suggesting aninterplay between these lattice vibration modes and the superconductivity.

cond-mat;9909365	imaging the effects of individual zinc impurity atoms on  superconductivity in bi2sr2cacu2o8+delta	although their crystal structures are complex, all high temperaturesuperconductors contain some crystal planes consisting of only cu and o atomsin a square lattice. superconductivity is believed to originate from stronglyinteracting electrons in these cuo2 planes. substitution of a single impurityatom at a cu site creates a simple but powerful perturbation to theseinteractions. detailed knowledge of the effects of such an impurity atom on thesuperconducting order parameter and on the quasi-particle local density ofstates (ldos) could allow competing theories of high temperaturesuperconductivity (htsc) to be tested at the atomic scale. the fundamentalimplications of results from numerous bulk measurements on samples doped withimpurity atoms could also be clarified with such data. here we describescanning tunneling microscopy studies of the effects of individual zn impurityatoms located at the cu site in the high-tc superconductor bi2sr2cacu2o8+delta.tunneling spectroscopy shows intense quasi-particle scattering resonances atthe zn sites, coincident with strong suppression of superconductivity withinabout 1.5 nm. imaging of the quasi-particle ldos at these sites reveals thelong sought four-fold symmetric "quasi-particle cloud" aligned with the d-wavegap nodes. several unexpected phenomena, which can shed new light on theatomic-scale response of htsc to a probe impurity atom, are also observed.
