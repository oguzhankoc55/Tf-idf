0901.3934	transient low-mass x-ray binary populations in elliptical galaxies ngc  3379 and ngc 4278	we propose a physically motivated and self-consistent prescription for themodeling of transient neutron star (ns) low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)properties, such as duty cycle (dc), outburst duration and recurrence time. weapply this prescription to the population synthesis (ps) models of field lmxbspresented by fragos et al. (2008), and compare the transient lmxb population tothe chandra x-ray survey of the two elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 4278,which revealed several transient sources (brassington et al., 2008, 2009). weare able to exclude models with a constant dc for all transient systems, whilemodels with a variable dc based on the properties of each system are consistentwith the observed transient populations. we predict that the majority of theobserved transient sources in these two galaxies are lmxbs with red giantdonors. our comparison suggests that lmxbs formed through evolution ofprimordial field binaries are dominant in globular cluster (gc) poor ellipticalgalaxies, while they still have a significant contribution in gc rich ones.

0902.2343	comparing gc and field lmxbs in elliptical galaxies with deep chandra  and hubble data	(abridged) we present a statistical study of the low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)populations of three nearby, old elliptical galaxies: ngc 3379, ngc 4278, andngc 4697. with a cumulative ~1 ms chandra acis observing time, we detect 90-170lmxbs within the d25 ellipse of each galaxy. cross-correlating chandra x-raysources and hst optical sources, we identify 75 globular cluster (gc) lmxbs and112 field lmxbs. in the low luminosity range allowed by our deeper data (lx &lt; 5x 1037 erg s-1), we find a significant relative lack of gc-lmxbs, when comparedwith field sources. using the co-added sample from the three galaxies, we findthat the incompleteness-corrected x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) of gc andfield lmxbs differ at ~4# significance at lx &lt; 5 x 1037 erg s-1. as previouslyreported, these xlfs are consistent at higher luminosities. our observationsmay indicate a potential predominance of gc-lmxbs with donors evolved beyondthe main sequence, when compared to current models, but their efficientformation requires relatively high initial binary fractions in clusters. thefield lmxb xlf can be fitted with either a single power-law model plus alocalized excess at a luminosity of 5-6 x 1037 erg s-1, or a broken power-lawwith a similar low-luminosity break. this xlf may be explained withns-red-giant lmxbs, contributing to ~15% of total lmxbs population at ~5x1037erg s-1. the difference in the gc and field xlfs is consistent with differentorigins and/or evolutionary paths between the two lmxb populations, although afraction of the field sources are likely to have originated in gcs.

0907.3162	the optical structure of the starburst galaxy m82. ii. nebular  properties of the disk and inner-wind	(abridged) in this second paper of the series, we present the results fromoptical gemini-north gmos-ifu and wiyn densepak ifu spectroscopic observationsof the starburst and inner wind zones of m82, with a focus on the state of thet~10^4 k ionized interstellar medium. our electron density maps show peaks of afew 1000 cm-3, local small spatial-scale variations, and a fall-off in theminor axis direction. we discuss the implications of these results with regardsto the conditions/locations that may favour the escape of individual clusterwinds. our findings imply that the starburst environment is highly fragmentedinto a range of clouds from small/dense clumps with low filling factors (&lt;1pc,n_e&gt;10^4 cm-3) to larger filling factor, less dense gas. the near-constantstate of the ionization state of the ~10^4 k gas throughout the starburst canbe explained as a consequence of the small cloud sizes, which allow the gasconditions to respond quickly to any changes. we have examined in more detailboth the broad (fwhm 150-350 km/s) line component found in paper i that weassociated with emission from turbulent mixing layers on the gas clouds, andthe discrete outflow channel identified within the inner wind. the channelappears as a coherent, expanding cylindrical structure of length &gt;120 pc andand width 35-50 pc and the walls maintain an approximately constant (butsubsonic) expansion velocity of ~60 km/s. we use the channel to examine furtherthe relationship between the narrow and broad component emitting gas within theinner wind. within the starburst energy injection zone, we find that turbulentmotions (as traced by the broad component) appear to play an increasing rolewith height.

0908.3500	star formation history of the smc: six hst/acs	we observed six fields of the small magellanic cloud (smc) with the advancedcamera for survey on board the hubble space telescope in the f555w and f814wfilters. these fields sample regions characterized by very different star andgas densities, and, possibly, by different evolutionary histories. we find thatthe smc was already forming stars ~12 gyr ago, even if the lack of a clearhorizontal branch suggests that in the first few billion years the starformation activity was low. within the uncertainties of our two-bandphotometry, we find evidence of a radial variation in chemical enrichment, withthe smc outskirts characterized by lower metallicity than the central zones.  from our cmds we also infer that the smc formed stars over a long interval oftime until ~2-3 gyr ago. after a period of modest activity, star formationincreased again in the recent past, especially in the bar and the wing of thesmc, where we see an enhancement in the star-formation activity starting from~500 myr ago. the inhomogeneous distribution of stars younger than ~100 myrindicates that recent star formation has mainly developed locally.

0912.0545	turbulence and the formation of filaments, loops and shock fronts in ngc  1275 in the perseus galaxy cluster	ngc1275, the central galaxy in the perseus cluster, is the host of gigantichot bipolar bubbles inflated by agn jets observed in the radio as perseus a. itpresents a spectacular $h{\alpha}$-emitting nebulosity surrounding ngc1275,with loops and filaments of gas extending to over 50 kpc. the origin of thefilaments is still unknown, but probably correlates with the mechanismresponsible for the giant buoyant bubbles. we present 2.5 and 3-dimensional mhdsimulations of the central region of the cluster in which turbulent energy,possibly triggered by star formation and supernovae (sne) explosions isintroduced. the simulations reveal that the turbulence injected by massivestars could be responsible for the nearly isotropic distribution of filamentsand loops that drag magnetic fields upward as indicated by recent observations.weak shell-like shock fronts propagating into the icm with velocities of100-500 km/s are found, also resembling the observations. the isotropic outflowmomentum of the turbulence slows the infall of the intracluster medium, thuslimiting further starburst activity in ngc1275. as the turbulence is subsonicover most of the simulated volume, the turbulent kinetic energy is notefficiently converted into heat and additional heating is required to suppressthe cooling flow at the core of the cluster. simulations combining the mhdturbulence with the agn outflow can reproduce the temperature radial profileobserved around ngc1275. while the agn mechanism is the main heating source,the supernovae are crucial to isotropize the energy distribution.

1001.4442	pre-main sequence turn-on as a chronometer for young clusters: ngc346 as  a benchmark	we present a novel approach to derive the age of very young star clusters, byusing the turn-on (ton). the ton is the point in the color-magnitude diagram(cmd) where the pre-main sequence (pms) joins the main sequence (ms). in the msluminosity function (lf) of the cluster, the ton is identified as a peakfollowed by a dip. we propose that by combining the cmd analysis with themonitoring of the spatial distribution of ms stars it is possible to reliablyidentify the ton in extragalactic star forming regions. compared to alternativemethods, this technique is complementary to the turn-off dating and avoids thesystematic biases affecting the pms phase. we describe the method and itsuncertainties, and apply it to the star forming region ngc346, which has beenextensively imaged with the hubble space telescope (hst). this study extendsthe lf approach in crowded extragalactic regions and opens the way for futurestudies with hst/wfc3, jwst and from the ground with adaptive optics.

1010.0340	history and modes of star formation in the most active region of the  small magellanic cloud, ngc 346	we discuss the star formation history of the smc region ngc 346 based onhubble space telescope images. the region contains both field stars and clustermembers. using a classical synthetic cmd procedure applied to the field aroundngc 346 we find that there the star formation pace has been rising from a quitelow rate 13 gyr ago to \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8} mo yr^{-1}pc^{-2} in the last100 myr. this value is significantly higher than in other star forming regionsof the smc. for ngc 346 itself, we compare theoretical and observedcolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of several stellar sub-clusters identified inthe region, and we derive their basic evolution parameters. we find that ngc346 experienced different star formation regimes, including a dominant andfocused "high density mode", with the sub-clusters hosting both pre-mainsequence (pms) and upper main sequence (ums) stars, and a diffuse "low densitymode", as indicated by the presence of low-mass pms sub-clusters.quantitatively, the star formation in the oldest sub-clusters started about 6myr ago with remarkable synchronization, it continued at high rate (up to 2\times 10^{-5} mo yr^{-1} pc^{-2}) for about 3 myr and is now progressing at alower rate. interestingly, sub-clusters mainly composed by low mass pms starsseem to experience now the first episode of star formation, followingmulti-seeded spatial patterns instead of resulting from a coherent trigger. twospeculative scenarios are put forth to explain the deficiency of ums stars: thefirst invokes under-threshold conditions of the parent gas; the secondspeculates that the initial mass function (imf) is a function of time, with theyoungest sub-clusters not having had sufficient time to form more massivestars.

1102.4147	vlti observations of the dust geometry around r coronae borealis stars	we are investigating the formation and evolution of dust around thehydrogen-deficient supergiants known as r coronae borealis (rcb) stars. we aimto determine the connection between the probable merger past of these stars andtheir current dust-production activities. we carried out high-angularresolution interferometric observations of three rcb stars, namely ry sgr, vcra, and v854 cen with the mid-ir interferometer, midi on the vlti, using twotelescope pairs. the baselines ranged from 30 to 60 m, allowing us to probe thedusty environment at very small spatial scales (~ 50 mas or 400 stellar radii).the observations of the rcb star dust environments were interpreted using bothgeometrical models and one-dimensional radiative transfer codes. from ouranalysis we find that asymmetric circumstellar material is apparent in ry sgr,may also exist in v cra, and is possible for v854 cen. overall, we find thatour observations are consistent with dust forming in clumps ejected randomlyaround the rcb star so that over time they create a spherically symmetricdistribution of dust. however, we conclude that the determination of whetherthere is a preferred plane of dust ejection must wait until a time series ofobservations are obtained.

1106.0537	evidence for pre-existing dust in the bright type iin sn 2010jl	sn 2010jl was an extremely bright, type iin sne which showed a significant irexcess no later than 90 days after explosion. we have obtained spitzer 3.6 and4.5 \mum and jhk observations of sn 2010jl \sim90 days post explosion. littleto no reddening in the host galaxy indicated that the circumstellar materiallost from the progenitor must lie in a torus inclined out of the plane of thesky. the likely cause of the high mid-ir flux is the reprocessing of theinitial flash of the sn by pre-existing circumstellar dust. using a 3d montecarlo radiative transfer code, we have estimated that between 0.03-0.35 msun ofdust exists in a circumstellar torus around the sn located 6 \times 10 ^17 cmaway from the sn and inclined between 60-80\cdot to the plane of the sky. onday 90, we are only seeing the illumination of approximately 5% of this torus,and expect to see an elevated ir flux from this material up until day \sim 450.it is likely this dust was created in an lbv-like mass loss event of more than3 msun, which is large but consistent with other lbv progenitors such as {\eta}carinae.

1205.2387	a rare early-type star revealed in the wing of the small magellanic  cloud	sk 183 is the visually-brightest star in the n90 nebula, a young star-formingregion in the wing of the small magellanic cloud (smc). we present new opticalspectroscopy from the very large telescope which reveals sk 183 to be one ofthe most massive o-type stars in the smc. classified as an o3-type dwarf on thebasis of its nitrogen spectrum, the star also displays broadened he iabsorption which suggests a later type. we propose that sk 183 has a compositespectrum and that it is similar to another star in the smc, mpg 324. thisbrings the number of rare o2- and o3-type stars known in the whole of the smcto a mere four. we estimate physical parameters for sk 183 from analysis of itsspectrum. for a single-star model, we estimate an effective temperature of46+/-2 kk, a low mass-loss rate of ~10^-7 msun yr^-1, and a spectroscopic massof 46^+9_-8 msun (for an adopted distance modulus of 18.7 mag to the youngpopulation in the smc wing). an illustrative binary model requires a slightlyhotter temperature (~47.5 kk) for the primary component. in either scenario, sk183 is the earliest-type star known in n90 and will therefore be the dominantsource of hydrogen-ionising photons. this suggests sk 183 is the primaryinfluence on the star formation along the inner edge of the nebula.

1206.0733	star formation history in two fields of the small magellanic cloud bar	the bar is the most productive region of the small magellanic cloud in termsof star formation but also the least studied one. in this paper we investigatethe star formation history of two fields located in the sw and in the neportion of the bar using two independent and well tested procedures applied tothe color-magnitude diagrams of their stellar populations resolved by means ofdeep hst photometry. we find that the bar experienced a negligible starformation activity in the first few gyr, followed by a dramatic enhancementfrom 6 to 4 gyr ago and a nearly constant activity since then. the two examinedfields differ both in the rate of star formation and in the ratio of recentover past activity, but share the very low level of initial activity and itssudden increase around 5 gyr ago. the striking similarity between the timing ofthe enhancement and the timing of the major episode in the large magellaniccloud is suggestive of a close encounter triggering star formation.

1211.2804	deep chandra monitoring observations of ngc 4649: i. catalog of source  properties	we present the x-ray source catalog for the chandra monitoring observationsof the elliptical galaxy, ngc 4649. the galaxy has been observed with chandraacis-s3 in six separate pointings, reaching a total exposure of 299 ks. thereare 501 x-ray sources detected in the 0.3-8.0 kev band in the mergedobservation or in one of the six individual observations; 399 sources arelocated within the d_25 ellipse. the observed 0.3-8.0 kev luminosities of these501 sources range from 9.3x10^{36} erg/s to 5.4x10^{39} erg/s. the 90%detection completeness limit within the d_25 ellipse is 5.5x10^{37} erg/s.based on the surface density of background active galactic nuclei (agns) anddetection completeness, we expect ~45 background agns among the catalog sources(~15 within the d_25 ellipse). there are nine sources with luminosities greaterthan 10^{39} erg/s, which are candidates for ultraluminous x-ray sources. thenuclear source of ngc 4649 is a low-luminosity agn, with an intrinsic 2.0-8.0kev x-ray luminosity of 1.5x10^{38} erg/s. the x-ray colors suggest that themajority of the catalog sources are low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). we findthat 164 of the 501 x-ray sources show long-term variability, indicating thatthey are accreting compact objects. we discover four transient candidates andanother four potential transients. we also identify 173 x-ray sources (141within the d_25 ellipse) that are associated with globular clusters (gcs) basedon hubble space telescope and ground-based data; these lmxbs tend to be hostedby red gcs. although ngc 4649 has a much larger population of x-ray sourcesthan the structurally similar early-type galaxies, ngc 3379 and ngc 4278, yetthe x-ray source properties are comparable in all three systems.

1302.6598	the snapshot hubble u-band cluster survey (shucs). i. survey description  and first application to the mixed star cluster population of ngc 4041	we present the snapshot hubble u-band cluster survey (shucs), a project aimedat characterizing the star cluster populations of ten nearby galaxies (d&lt;23mpc, half within 12 mpc) through new f336w (u band equivalent) imaging fromwfc3, and archival bvi-equivalent data with hst. completing the ubvi baselinereduces the age-extinction degeneracy of optical colours, thus enabling themeasurement of reliable ages and masses for the thousands of clusters coveredby our survey. the sample consists chiefly of face-on spiral galaxies at lowinclination, in various degrees of isolation (isolated, in group, merging), andincludes two agn hosts. this first paper outlines the survey itself, theobservational datasets, the analysis methods, and presents a proof-of-conceptstudy of the large-scale properties and star cluster population of ngc 4041, amassive sabc galaxy at a distance of 23 mpc, and part of a small grouping ofsix giant members. we resolve two structural components with distinct stellarpopulations, a morphology more akin to merging and interacting systems. we alsofind strong evidence of a truncated, schechter-type mass function, and asimilarly segmented luminosity function. these results indicate that binningmust erase much of the substructure present in the mass and luminosityfunctions, and might account for the conflicting reports on the intrinsic shapeof these functions in the literature. we also note a tidal feature in theoutskirts of the galaxy in galex uv imaging, and follow it up with acomprehensive multi-wavelength study of ngc 4041 and its parent group. wededuce a minor merger as a likely cause of its segmented structure and theobserved pattern of a radially decreasing star formation rate. we propose thatcombining the study of star cluster populations with broad-band metrics is notonly advantageous, but often easily achievable through archival datasets.

0801.1111	an accurate age determination for the smc star cluster ngc121 with  hst/acs	as first paper of a series devoted to study the old stellar population inclusters and fields in the small magellanic cloud, we present deep observationsof ngc121 in the f555w and f814w filters, obtained with the advanced camera forsurveys on the hubble space telescope. the resulting color-magnitude diagramreaches ~3.5 mag below the main-sequence turn-off; deeper than any previousdata. we derive the age of ngc121 using both absolute and relative age-datingmethods. fitting isochrones in the acs photometric system to the observed ridgeline of ngc121, gives ages of 11.8 +- 0.5 gyr (teramo), 11.2 +- 0.5 gyr(padova) and 10.5 +- 0.5 gyr (dartmouth). the cluster ridge line is bestapproximated by the alpha-enhanced dartmouth isochrones. placing our relativeages on an absolute age scale, we find ages of 10.9 +- 0.5 gyr (from themagnitude difference between the main-sequence turn-off and the horizontalbranch) and 11.5 +- 0.5 gyr (from the absolute magnitude of the horizontalbranch), respectively. these five different age determinations are all lower by2 - 3 gyr than the ages of the oldest galactic globular clusters of comparablemetallicity. therefore we confirm the earlier finding that the oldest globularcluster in the small magellanic cloud, ngc121, is a few gyr younger than itsoldest counterparts in the milky way and in other nearby dwarf galaxies such asthe large magellanic cloud, fornax, and sagittarius. if it were accreted intothe galactic halo, ngc121 would resemble the ''young halo globulars'', althoughit is not as young as the youngest globular clusters associated with thesagittarius dwarf. the young age of ngc121 could result from delayed clusterformation in the small magellanic cloud or result from the random survival ofonly one example of an initially small number star clusters.

0801.1122	models for low-mass x-ray binaries in the elliptical galaxies ngc3379  and ngc4278: comparison with observations	we present theoretical models for the formation and evolution of populationsof low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxb) in the two elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 andngc 4278. the models are calculated with the recently updated startrack code(belczynski et al., 2006), assuming only a primordial galactic field lmxbpopulation. startrack is an advanced population synthesis code that has beentested and calibrated using detailed binary star calculations and incorporatesall the important physical processes of binary evolution. the simulations aretargeted to modeling and understanding the origin of the x-ray luminosityfunctions (xlf) of point sources in these galaxies. for the first time weexplore the population xlf down to luminosities of 3x10^36 erg/s, as probed bythe most recent observational results (kim et al., 2006). we consider modelsfor the formation and evolution of lmxbs in galactic fields with different ceefficiencies, stellar wind prescriptions, magnetic braking laws and initialmass functions. we identify models that produce an xlf in excellent agreementwith the observations both in shape and absolute normalization. we also findthat the treatment of the outburst luminosity of transient systems remains acrucial factor for the determination of the xlf since the modeled populationsare dominated by transient x-ray systems.

1308.1409	mean age gradient and asymmetry in the star formation history of the  small magellanic cloud	we derive the star formation history in four regions of the small magellaniccloud (smc) using the deepest vi color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) ever obtainedfor this galaxy. the images were obtained with the advanced camera for surveysonboard the hubble space telescope and are located at projected distances of0.5-2 degrees from the smc center, probing the main body and the wing of thegalaxy. we derived the star-formation histories (sfh) of the four fields usingtwo independent procedures to fit synthetic cmds to the data. we compare thesfhs derived here with our earlier results for the smc bar to create a deeppencil-beam survey of the global history of the central smc. we find in all thesix fields observed with hst a slow star formation pace from 13 to 5-7 gyr ago,followed by a ~ 2-3 times higher activity. this is remarkable because dynamicalmodels do not predict a strong influence of either the lmc or the milky way(mw) at that time. the level of the intermediate-age sfr enhancementsystematically increases towards the center, resulting in a gradient in themean age of the population, with the bar fields being systematically youngerthan the outer ones. star formation over the most recent 500 myr is stronglyconcentrated in the bar, the only exception being the area of the smc wing. thestrong current activity of the latter is likely driven by interaction with thelmc. at a given age, there is no significant difference in metallicity betweenthe inner and outer fields, implying that metals are well mixed throughout thesmc. the age-metallicity relations we infer from our best fitting models aremonotonically increasing with time, with no evidence of dips. this may argueagainst the major merger scenario proposed by tsujimoto and bekki 2009,although a minor merger cannot be ruled out.

0805.4360	supernovae in early-type galaxies: directly connecting age and  metallicity with type ia luminosity	we have obtained optical spectra of 29 early-type (e/s0) galaxies that hostedtype ia supernovae (sne ia). we have measured absorption-line strengths andcompared them to a grid of models to extract the relations between thesupernova properties and the luminosity-weighted age/composition of the hostgalaxies. the same analysis was applied to a large number of early-type fieldgalaxies selected from the sdss spectroscopic survey. we find no difference inthe age and abundance distributions between the field galaxies and the sn iahost galaxies. we do find a strong correlation suggesting that sne ia ingalaxies whose populations have a characteristic age greater than 5 gyr are ~ 1mag fainter at v(max) than those found in galaxies with younger populations.however, the data cannot discriminate between a smooth relation connecting ageand supernova luminosity or two populations of sn ia progenitors. we find thatsn ia distance residuals in the hubble diagram are correlated with host-galaxymetal abundance, consistent with the predictions of timmes, brown &amp; truran(2003). the data show that high iron abundance galaxies host less-luminoussupernovae. we thus conclude that the time since progenitor formation primarilydetermines the radioactive ni production while progenitor metal abundance has aweaker influence on peak luminosity, but one not fully corrected by light-curveshape and color fitters. assuming no selection effects in discovering sne ia inlocal early-type galaxies, we find a higher specific sn ia rate in e/s0galaxies with ages below 3 gyr than in older hosts. the higher rate andbrighter luminosities seen in the youngest e/s0 hosts may be a result of recentstar formation and represents a tail of the "prompt" sn ia progenitors.

astro-ph;0005015	on the nature of andromeda iv	lying at a projected distance of 40' or 9 kpc from the centre of m31,andromeda iv is an enigmatic object first discovered during van den bergh'ssearch for dwarf spheroidal companions to m31. being bluer, more compact andhigher surface brightness than other known dwarf spheroidals, it has beensuggested that and iv is either a relatively old `star cloud' in the outer diskof m31 or a background dwarf galaxy. we present deep hst wfpc2 observations ofand iv and the surrounding field which, along with ground-based long-slitspectroscopy and halpha imagery, are used to decipher the true nature of thispuzzling object. we find compelling evidence that and iv is a background galaxyseen through the disk of m31. the moderate surface brightness (sb(v)~24), veryblue colour (v-i&lt;~0.6), low current star formation rate (~0.001 solar mass/yr)and low metallicity (~10% solar) reported here are consistent with and iv beinga small dwarf irregular galaxy, perhaps similar to local group dwarfs such asic 1613 and sextans a. although the distance to and iv is not tightlyconstrained with the current dataset, various arguments suggest it lies in therange 5&lt;~d&lt;~8 mpc, placing it well outside the confines of the local group. itmay be associated with a loose group of galaxies, containing major members ugc64, ic 1727 and ngc 784. we report an updated position and radial velocity forand iv.

astro-ph;0009280	the star clusters in the starburst irregular galaxy ngc 1569	we examine star clusters in the irregular, starburst galaxy ngc 1569 from hstimages. in addition to the two known super star clusters, we identify 45 otherclusters that are compact but resolved. integrated uvi colors of the clustersspan a large range, and suggest that ages range from 3 myrs to 1 gyr. however,most of the clusters were formed at the tail end of the recent starburst.numerous clusters in addition to the know super star clusters are similar inluminosity to a small globular cluster. we examined the radial surfacebrightness of four of the clusters. their half-light radii and core radii arein the range observed in present-day globular clusters. therefore, conditionsthat produced the recent starburst have also been those necessary for producingcompact, bright star clusters.  we examine resolved stars in the outer parts of the two super star clusters.cluster a is dominated by bright blue stars with a small population of redsupergiants. sub-components a1 and a2 have similar colors and a two-dimensionalcolor map does not offer evidence that one component is dominated by redsupergiants and the other not. the contradiction of the presence of red super-giants with wolf-rayet stars may instead not be a contradiction at all sincethere coexistence in a coeval population is not inconsistent with the evolutionof massive stars. cluster b is dominated by red supergiants, and this isconfirmed by the presence of the stellar co absorption feature in an integratedspectrum. the various age indicators are consistent with a picture in whichcluster b is of order 10--20 myrs old, and cluster a is &gt;4-5 myrs old.

astro-ph;0107022	using the ca ii triplet to trace abundance variations in individual red  giant branch stars in three nearby galaxies	spectroscopic abundance determinations for stars spanning a hubble time inage are necessary in order to unambiguously determine the evolutionaryhistories of galaxies. using fors1 in multi-object spectroscopy mode on antu(ut1) at the eso-vlt on paranal we obtained near infrared spectra from which wemeasured the equivalent widths of the two strongest ca ii triplet lines todetermine metal abundances for a sample of red giant branch stars, selectedfrom eso-ntt optical (i, v-i) photometry of three nearby, local group,galaxies: the sculptor dwarf spheroidal, the fornax dwarf spheroidal and thedwarf irregular ngc 6822. the summed equivalent width of the two strongestlines in the ca ii triplet absorption line feature, centered at 8500a, can bereadily converted into an [fe/h] abundance using the previously establishedcalibrations by armandroff &amp; da costa (1991) and rutledge, hesser &amp; stetson(1997). we measured metallicities for 37 stars in sculptor, 32 stars in fornax,and 23 stars in ngc 6822, yielding more precise estimates of the metallicitydistribution functions for these galaxies than it is possible to obtainphotometrically. in the case of ngc 6822, this is the first direct measurementof the abundances of the intermediate-age and old stellar populations. we findmetallicity spreads in each galaxy which are broadly consistent with thephotometric width of the red giant branch, although the abundances ofindividual stars do not always appear to correspond to their colour. this isalmost certainly predominantly due to a highly variable star formation ratewith time in these galaxies, which results in a non-uniform,non-globular-cluster-like, evolution of the ca/fe ratio.

astro-ph;0110257	deep hst imaging of sextans a i. the spatially resolved recent star  formation history	we have measured stellar photometry from deep cycle 7 hubble spacetelescope/wfpc2 imaging of the dwarf irregular galaxy sextans a. the imagingwas taken in three filters: f555w ($v$; 8 orbits), f814w ($i$; 16 orbits), andf656n (h$\alpha$; 1 orbit). combining these data with cycle 5 wfpc2observations provides nearly complete coverage of the optically visible portionof the galaxy. the cycle 7 observations are nearly 2 magnitudes more sensitivethan the cycle 5 observations, which provides unambiguous separation of thefaint blue helium burning stars (bheb stars) from contaminant populations. thedepth of the photometry allows us to compare recent star formation historiesrecovered from both the main sequence (ms) stars and the bheb stars for thelast 300 myr. the excellent agreement between these independent star formationrate (sfr) calculations is a resounding confirmation for the legitimacy ofusing the bheb stars to calculate the recent sfr. using the bheb stars we havecalculated the global star formation history over the past 700 myr. the historycalculated from the cycle 7 data is remarkably identical to that calculatedfrom the cycle 5 data, implying that both halves of the galaxy formed stars inconcert. we have also calculated the spatially resolved star formation history,combining the fields from the cycle 5 and cycle 7 data. our interpretation ofthe pattern of star formation is that it is an orderly stochastic process.

astro-ph;0202381	variable stars in leo a: rr lyraes, short-period cepheids, and  implications on stellar content	we present the results of a search for short-period variable stars in leo a.we have found 92 candidate variables, including eight candidate rr lyrae stars.  from the rr lyraes, we measure a distance modulus of (m-m)_0 = 24.51 +/-0.12, or 0.80 +/- 0.04 mpc. this discovery of rr lyraes confirms, for the firsttime, the presence of an ancient (&gt; ~11 gyr) population in leo a accounting forat least 0.1% of the galaxy's v luminosity. we have also discovered a halo ofold (&gt; ~2 gyr) stars surrounding leo a, with a scale length roughly 50% largerthan that of the dominant young population.  we also report the discovery of a large population of cepheids in leo a. themedian absolute magnitude of our cepheid sample is m_v = -1.1, fainter than 96%of smc and 99% of lmc cepheids. their periods are also unusual, with threecepheids that are deduced to be pulsating in the fundamental mode havingperiods of under 1 day. upon examination, these characteristics of the leo acepheid population appear to be a natural extension of the classical cepheidperiod-luminosity relations to low metallicity, rather than being indicative ofa large population of ``anomalous'' cepheids. we demonstrate that the periodsand luminosities are consistent with the expected values of low-metallicityblue helium-burning stars (bhebs), which populate the instability strip atlower luminosities than do higher-metallicity bhebs.

astro-ph;0211486	deep hst imaging of sextans a. ii. cepheids and distance	we have identified 82 short-period variable stars in sextans a from deepwfpc2 observations. all of the periodic variables appear to be short-periodcepheids, with periods as small as 0.8 days for fundamental-mode cepheids and0.5 days for first-overtone cepheids. these objects have been used, along withmeasurements of the rgb tip and red clump, to measure a true distance modulusto sextans a of (m-m)_0 = 25.61 +/- 0.07, corresponding to a distance of d =1.32 +/- 0.04 mpc. comparing distances calculated by these techniques, we findthat short-period cepheids (p &lt; 2 days) are accurate distance indicators forobjects at or below the metallicity of the smc. as these objects are quitenumerous in low-metallicity star-forming galaxies, they have the potential forproviding extremely precise distances throughout the local group. we have alsocompared the relative distances produced by other distance indicators. weconclude that calibrations of rr lyraes, the rgb tip, and the red clump areself-consistent, but that there appears to be a small dependence of long-periodcepheid distances on metallicity. finally, we present relative distances ofsextans a, leo a, ic 1613, and the magellanic clouds.

astro-ph;0611106	star formation history and evolution of gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the  centaurus a group	we analyse the properties of three unusual dwarf galaxies in the centaurus agroup discovered with the hipass survey. from their optical morphology theyappear to be low surface brightness dwarf spheroidals, yet they are gas-rich(m_{hi}/l_{b} &gt; 1) with gas-mass-to-stellar light ratios larger than typicaldwarf irregular galaxies. therefore these systems appear different from anydwarfs of the local group. they should be favoured hosts for starburst, whereaswe find a faint star formation region in only one object. we have obtained21-cm data and hubble space telescope photometry in v and i bands, and haveconstructed colour magnitude diagrams (cmds) to investigate their stellarpopulations and to set a constraint on their age. from the comparison of theobserved and model cmds we infer that all three galaxies are at least olderthan 2 gyr (possibly even as old as 10 gyr) and remain gas-rich because theirstar formation rates (sfrs) have been very low (&lt; 10^{-3} m_{sun}/yr)throughout. in such systems, star formation (sf) appears to have been sporadicand local, though one object (hipass j1321--31) has a peculiar red plume in itscmd suggesting that many of its stars were formed in a "miniburst" 300 - 500myr ago. the question of why there are no similar dwarf galaxies in the localgroup remains open.

astro-ph;9602069	diffuse ionized gas in spiral galaxies: probing photon leakage from hii  regions?	as part of a large study to map the distribution of star formation acrossgalactic disks, we have obtained deep halpha images of the nearby sculptorgroup spirals ngc 247 and ngc 7793. these images are of sufficiently highquality that they allow identification and analysis of diffuse halpha emissionat surface brightness levels ranging from those of extremely low density hiiregions to those of the local galactic disk diffuse emission. this paperpresents a study of the large scale distribution and global energetics ofdiffuse ionized gas (dig) in these galaxies and investigates the associationbetween dig and discrete hii regions. our results support the hypothesis thatthe dig is photoionized by lyc photons which leak out of traditional hiiregions, and suggest that the local hi column density plays a role inregulating the amount of leakage which can occur. this interpretation hasprofound implications for the derivation of star-formation rates based onhalpha emission--line fluxes since hii region counts alone will lead tosignificant underestimates of the true rate. the contribution of the diffusehalpha component to the total halpha emission, ie. the diffuse fraction, inthese galaxies is found to be similar to values found in other disk galaxieswith differing hubble types and star formation rates. the constancy of thediffuse fraction is rather unexpected and implies that the overall fraction ofphotons which can leak out of hii regions and ionize the ism over large scalesis relatively invariant from one galaxy to another.

astro-ph;9609125	the spectacular ionized interstellar medium of ngc55	we present deep halpha+[nii], [sii] (6716,6731a) and [oii] (3726,3729a)images of the highly inclined, actively star--forming sbm galaxy ngc 55,located in the nearby sculptor group. due to its proximity, ngc 55 provides aunique opportunity to study the disk--halo interface in a late--type galaxywith unprecedented spatial resolution. our images reveal a spectacular varietyof ionized gas features, ranging from giant hii region complexes, to supergiantfilamentary and shell features, to patches of very faint diffuse emission. manyof these features protrude well above the plane of the galaxy, including a veryfaint fragmented shell of emission which is visible at 2.6 kpc above the disk.we identify candidate `chimneys' extending out of the disk, which could be theconduits into the halo for hot gas around disk star-forming regions, and couldalso provide low-density paths for the passage of uv photons from the disk tothe halo. several of the identified chimneys are `capped' with clumps ofionized gas, one of which, located at 1.5 kpc above the disk plane, appears tobe the site of recent star formation. emission--line ratios([oii]/halpha+[nii], [sii]/halpha+[nii]) constrain the ionization mechanism ofthe gas, and our images allow the first measurement of [oii]/halpha+[nii] inextra-planar diffuse ionized gas. the diffuse gas is characterized byemission--line ratios which are enhanced on average by a factor of two comparedto those of bright hii regions. each line ratio increases in value smoothlyfrom the cores of hii regions, through the haloes of hii regions, into thediffuse ionized gas. such a continuous trend is predicted by models in whichthe diffuse gas is ionized by photons produced by massive stars in hii regions.

astro-ph;9709259	hubble space telescope observations of the draco dwarf spheroidal	we present an f606w-f814w color-magnitude diagram for the draco dwarfspheroidal galaxy based on hubble space telescope wfpc2 images. the luminosityfunction is well-sampled to 3 magnitudes below the turn-off. we see no evidencefor multiple turnoffs and conclude that, at least over the field of the view ofthe wfpc2, star formation was primarily single-epoch. if the observed number ofblue stragglers is due to extended star formation, then roughly 6% (upperlimit) of the stars could be half as old as the bulk of the galaxy. the colordifference between the red giant branch and the turnoff is consistent with anold population and is very similar to that observed in the old, metal-poorgalactic globular clusters m68 and m92. despite its red horizontal branch,draco appears to be older than m68 and m92 by 1.6 +/- 2.5 gyrs, lending supportto the argument that the ``second parameter'' which governs horizontal branchmorphology must be something other than age. draco's observed luminosityfunction is very similar to that of m68, and the derived initial mass functionis consistent with that of the solar neighborhood.

astro-ph;9803301	ionization structure in the 30 doradus nebula as seen with hst/wfpc-2	using the hubble space telescope and wfpc2 we have imaged the central 20pc ofthe giant h ii region 30 doradus nebula in three different emission lines. theimages allow us to study the nebula with a physical resolution that is within afactor of two of that typical of ground based observations of galactic h iiregions. most of the emission within 30 dor is confined to a thin zone locatedbetween the hot interior of the nebula and surrounding dense molecularmaterial. this zone appears to be directly analogous to the photoionizedphotoevaporative flows that dominate emission from small, nearby h ii regions.the dynamical effects of the photoevaporative flow can be seen. the rampressure in the photoevaporative flow, derived from thermal pressure at thesurface of the ionization front, is found to balance with the pressure in theinterior of the nebula derived from previous x-ray observations. by analogywith the comparison of ground and hst images of m16 we infer that the samesharply stratified structure seen in hst images of m16 almost certainlyunderlies the observed structure in 30 dor. 30 doradus is a crucial casebecause it allows us to bridge the gap between nearby h ii regions and thegiant h ii regions seen in distant galaxies. the real significance of thisresult is that it demonstrates that the physical understanding gained fromdetailed study of photoevaporative interfaces in nearby h ii regions can beapplied directly to interpretation of giant h ii regions.

astro-ph;9805268	wfpc2 observations of leo a: a predominantly young galaxy within the  local group	the unprecedented detail of the wfpc2 colour-magnitude diagrams of theresolved stellar population of leo a presented here allows us to determine anew distance and an accurate star formation history for this extremelymetal-poor local group dwarf irregular galaxy. from the position of the redclump, the helium-burning blue loops and the tip of the red giant branch, weobtain a distance modulus, m-m=24.2+/-0.2, or 690 +/- 60 kpc, which places leoa firmly within the local group. our interpretation of these features in thewfpc2 cmds at this new distance based upon extremely low metallicity (z=0.0004)theoretical stellar evolution models suggests that this galaxy is predominantlyyoung, i.e. &lt;2 gyr old. a major episode of star formation 900 - 1500 gyr agocan explain the red clump luminosity and also fits in with our interpretationof the number of anomalous cepheid variable stars seen in this galaxy. wecannot rule out the presence of an older, underlying globular cluster agestellar population with these data. however, using the currently availablestellar evolution models, it would appear that such an older population islimited to no more than 10% of the total star formation to have occured in thisgalaxy. leo a provides a nearby laboratory for studying young metal poor starsand investigations of metal-poor galaxy evolution, such as is supposed to occurfor larger systems at intermediate and high redshifts.

astro-ph;9805284	a wfpc2 study of the resolved stellar population of the pegasus dwarf  irregular galaxy (ddo 216)	the stellar population of the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy is investigatedin images taken in the f439w (b), f555w (v), and f814w (i) bands with wfpc2.these and ground-based data are combined to produce color-magnitude diagramswhich show the complex nature of the stellar population in this small galaxy. ayoung (&lt; 0.5 gyr) main sequence stellar component is present and clustered intwo centrally-located clumps, while older stars form a more extended disk orhalo. the colors of the main sequence require a relatively large extinction ofa_v = 0.47 mag. the mean color of the well-populated red giant branch isrelatively blue, consistent with a moderate metallicity young, or older,metal-poor stellar population. the red giant branch also has significant widthin color, implying a range of stellar ages and/or metallicities. a small numberof extended asymptotic giant branch stars are found beyond the red giant branchtip. near the faint limits of our data is a populous red clump superimposed onthe red giant branch. efforts to fit self-consistent stellar population modelsbased on the geneva stellar evolution tracks yield a revised distance of 760kpc. quantitative fits to the stellar population are explored as a means toconstrain the star formation history. the numbers of main sequence and corehelium-burning blue loop stars require that the star formation rate was higherin the recent past, by a factor of 3-4 about 1 gyr ago. unique results cannotbe obtained for the star formation history over longer time baselines withoutbetter information on stellar metallicities and deeper photometry. the youngestmodel consistent with the data contains stars with constant metallicity of z =0.001 which mainly formed 2-4 gyr ago. even at its peak of star formingactivity, the pegasus dwarf most likely remained relatively dim with m_v ~ -14.

astro-ph;9806039	the exceptionally soft x-ray spectrum of the low-mass starburst galaxy  ngc 1705	ngc 1705 is one of the optically brightest and best studied dwarf galaxies.it appears to be in the late stage of a major starburst and contains a youngsuper star cluster. type ii supernovae are therefore likely to have been amajor effect in the recent evolution of this galaxy and are likely to haveproduced a superbubble whose affects on the low-density ambient interstellarmedium can be ideally studied. rosat pspc observations of this galaxy revealtwo striking blobs of x-ray emission embedded in \ha loops which can beinterpreted as both sides of the upper plumes of the same superbubble. thesesources are a surprise. they are much softer than those observed from otherstarburst dwarf galaxies, and are so soft that they should have been blocked ifthe observed galactic hi column density were uniformly distributed across ngc1705 or if the sources were embedded in the hi disk of ngc 1705. in addition,the total x-ray luminosity in the rosat energy band of 1.2x10^{38} erg s^{-1}is low in comparison to similar objects. we discuss possible models for the twox-ray peaks in ngc 1705 and find that the sources most likely originate fromrelatively cool gas of one single superbubble in ngc 1705. the implications ofthe exceptional softness of these sources are addressed in terms of intrinsicproperties of ngc 1705 and the nature of the foreground galactic absorption.

astro-ph;9810042	an exploration of the tully-fisher relation for extreme late-type spiral  galaxies	this paper explores the adherence of 47 extreme late-type galaxies to the b-and v-band tully-fisher relations defined by a sample of local calibrators. inboth bands we find the mean luminosity at a given line width for extremelate-type spirals to lie below that predicted by standard tully-fisherrelations. while many of the extreme late-type spirals do follow thetully-fisher relation to within our observational uncertainties, most of thesegalaxies lie below the normal, linear tully-fisher relation, and some areunderluminous by more than 2 sigma (i.e. &gt;1.16 magnitudes in v). this suggestsa possible downward curvature of the tully-fisher relation for some of thesmallest and faintest rotationally supported disk galaxies. this may be aconsequence of the increasing prevalence of dark matter in these systems. wefind the deviation from the tully-fisher relation to increase with decreasingluminosity and decreasing optical linear size in our sample, implying that thephysically smallest and faintest spirals may be a structurally andkinematically distinct class of objects.

astro-ph;9904428	the structure and morphology of the ionized gas in starburst galaxies:  ngc5253/5236	(abridged) we investigate the interplay between starbursts and host galaxiesby studying the structure and physical characteristics of the ionized gassurrounding the central starbursts in the two nearby galaxies ngc5253 andngc5236. the two systems represent very different galactic environments,ngc5253 being a metal-poor dwarf, and ngc5236 being a metal-rich, massivespiral. we present images of the starburst regions in these two galaxies in theline emission [oiii], h-alpha, and [sii], and in continuum u, v, r. forngc5253, line ratio maps [oiii]/h-beta and [sii]/h-alpha show that in the outerregions the diffuse ionized gas (dig) is partially excited by anon-photoionization process (`shocks'). the `shocked' gas is mostlyconcentrated south-west of the galaxy's center, in coincidence with theposition of h-alpha bubbles and with extended soft x-ray emission. the h-alphaemission from the shock-excited gas is ~1-2% of the total. about 80-90% of thedig is consistent with being photoionized, requiring that about 10% of theionizing photons escape from the starburst site. the starburst in ngc5253appears to be fed by gas infalling along the galaxy's optical minor axis, whilehot gas expanding from the starburst has a preferential direction along themajor axis. the results for ngc5236 are less clear than for ngc5253, as theimages are not as deep. the emission line ratio maps show very little or noevidence for presence of shock excitation and very little or no ionized gasappears expanding from the center of the galaxy outward along the disk plane.the starburst in ngc5236 is thus more strongly confined than that in ngc5253,probably due to the deeper gravitational potential well of the more massivegalaxy.

astro-ph;9910382	panchromatic study of nearby uv-bright starburst galaxies: implications  for massive star formation and high redshift galaxies	we present a panchromatic study of nearby starburst galaxies from theultraviolet to the visible, including narrow band h(alpha) using wiyn and hstdata, to determine how star formation processes affect the morphology andintegrated fluxes of nearby starbursts. we find the uv/h(alpha) morphology ofstarbursts tend to differ, although not in a standard or predictable manner.  from our sample of six nearby starbursts, three systems show a goodcorrelation between uv and h(alpha) fluxes, but we find differences in uv andh(alpha) morphology between the other three. occasionally we find systems withwell defined h ii regions without the corresponding brightness in the uv, andvice-versa. we discuss the likely mechanisms behind these differences whichinclude: starburst ages, dust absorption, stellar energy ejecta through sne andwinds, as well as leakage of uv photons from stellar clusters. we conclude thatthe large scale morphological features in starbursts are primarily due to bothage and absorption from a `picket fence' dust distribution.  we further demonstrate the similarity and differences between these nearbystarbursts and high redshift star forming galaxies. the overall morphology ofour sample of starbursts changes little between uv and visible wavelengths. ifhigh redshift galaxies are similar to these starbursts, their morphologiesshould change little between rest-frame uv and optical. we also show that firand uv spectral energy distributions and slopes can be used to determine largescale morphological features for extreme starbursts, with the steepest firslopes correlating with the most disturbed galaxies.

astro-ph;9912109	evolved super star clusters in m82	we present high-resolution optical and near-infrared hst observations of twoadjacent regions in the fossil starburst region in m82, b1 and b2. ageestimates date the cluster population in the fossil starburst between ~2 x 10^8and ~10 x 10^9 years, assuming solar metallicity. the star cluster populationin b2 is more heavily affected by internal extinction than that in b1. althoughour cluster size estimates indicate that they are gravitationally bound, andnot unlike galactic globular clusters, their luminosity distribution issignificantly fainter than both super star cluster luminosity functions (lfs)and the galactic globular cluster lf. this makes them unlikely proto-globularclusters, since their luminosities will fade further before they are of similarage as the galactic globular cluster population. if the compact h-alpha-brightsources in m82 b are type ii supernova remnants (snrs), they set an upper limitto the end of the starburst in region b2, about 500 pc from the galaxy's core,of ~50 myr. region b1, about 1000 pc from the core, lacks good snr candidatesand is evidently somewhat older. this suggests star formation in the galaxy haspropagated inward toward the present-day intense starburst core.
