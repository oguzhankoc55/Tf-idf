0906.4336	a multi-color optical survey of the orion nebula cluster. part i: the  catalog	we present u, b, v, i broad-band, 6200a tio medium-band and halpha photometryof the orion nebula cluster obtained with the wfi imager at the eso/mpi 2.2telescope. the nearly-simultaneous observations cover the entire onc in a fieldof about 34x34 arcmin. they enable us to determine stellar colors avoiding theadditional scatter in the photometry induced by stellar variability typical ofpre-main sequence stars. we identify 2,612 point-like sources in i band, 58%,43% and 17% of them detected also in v, b and u, respectively. 1040 sources areidentified in halpha band. in this paper we present the observations, thecalibration techniques, and the resulting catalog. we show the derived cmd ofthe population and discuss the completeness of our photometry. we define aspectro-photometric tio index from the fluxes in v, i, and tio-band. we find acorrelation between the index and the spectral type valid for m-type stars,that is accurate to better than 1 spectral sub-class for m3-m6 types and betterthan 2 spectral subclasses for m0-m2 types. this allows us to newly classify217 stars. we subtract from our halpha photometry the photospheric continuum atits wavelength, deriving calibrated line excess for the full sample. thisrepresents the largest halpha star catalog obtained to date on the onc. thisdata set enables a full re-analysis of the properties of the pre-main sequencepopulation in the orion nebula cluster to be presented, in an accompanyingpaper.

0908.0739	early-type galaxies in the pears survey: probing the stellar populations  at moderate redshift	using hst/acs slitless grism spectra from the pears program, we study thestellar populations of morphologically selected early-type galaxies in thegoods north and south fields. the sample - extracted from a visualclassification of the (v2.0) hst/acs images and restricted to redshifts z&gt;0.4 -comprises 228 galaxies (f775w&lt;24 abmag) out to z~1.3 over 320 arcmin2, with amedian redshift zm=0.75. this work significantly increases our previous samplefrom the grapes survey in the hudf (18 galaxies over ~11 arcmin2; pasquali etal. 2006b). the grism data allow us to separate the sample into `red' and`blue' spectra, with the latter comprising 15% of the total. three differentgrids of models parameterising the star formation history are used to fit thelow-resolution spectra. over the redshift range of the sample - correspondingto a cosmic age between 5 and 10 gyr - we find a strong correlation betweenstellar mass and average age, whereas the **spread** of ages (defined by therms of the distribution) is roughly ~1 gyr and independent of stellar mass. thebest-fit parameters suggest it is formation epoch and not formation timescale,that best correlates with mass in early-type galaxies. this result - along withthe recently observed lack of evolution of the number density of massivegalaxies - motivates the need for a channel of (massive) galaxy formationbypassing any phase in the blue cloud, as suggested by the simulations of dekelet al. (2009).

1002.4864	photometric determination of the mass accretion rates of pre-main  sequence stars. i. method and application to the sn1987a field	we have developed and successfully tested a new self-consistent method toreliably identify pre-main sequence (pms) objects actively undergoing massaccretion in a resolved stellar population, regardless of their age. the methoddoes not require spectroscopy and combines broad-band v and i photometry withnarrow-band halpha imaging to: (1) identify all stars with excess halphaemission; (2) derive their halpha luminosity l(halpha); (3) estimate the halphaemission equivalent width; (4) derive the accretion luminosity l_acc froml(halpha); and finally (5) obtain the mass accretion rate m_acc from l_acc andthe stellar parameters (mass and radius). by selecting stars with photometricaccuracy in halpha better than 15%, the statistical uncertainty on the derivedm_acc is typically &lt;17% and is dictated by the precision of the halphaphotometry. systematic uncertainties, of up to a factor of 3 on the value ofm_acc, are caused by our incomplete understanding of the physics of theaccretion process and affect all determinations of the mass accretion rate,including those based on a spectroscopic halpha line analysis.  as an application of our method, we study a field of 9.16 arcmin2 aroundsn1987a, using existing hst photometry. we identify as bona-fide pms stars atotal of 133 objects with a halpha excess above the 4 sigma level and a medianage of 13.5 myr. their median mass accretion rate of 2.6x10-8 msolar/yr is inexcellent agreement with previous determinations based on the u-band excess ofthe stars in this field, and with the value measured for g-type pms stars inthe milky way. their l_acc shows a strong dependence on their distance from agroup of hot massive stars in the field and suggests that the uv radiation ofthe latter is rapidly eroding the circumstellar discs around pms stars.

0708.1026	the radio evolution of sn 2001gd	we present the results of observations of the radio emission from supernova2001gd in ngc 5033 from 2002 february 8 through 2006 september 25. the datawere obtained using the very large array at wavelengths of 1.3 cm (22.4 ghz), 2cm (14.9 ghz), 3.6 cm (8.4 ghz), 6 cm (4.9 ghz), and 20 cm (1.5 ghz), with oneupper limit at 90 cm (0.3 ghz). in addition, one detection has been provided bythe giant metrewave radio telescope at 21 cm (1.4 ghz). sn 2001gd wasdiscovered in the optical well past maximum light, so that it was not possibleto obtain many of the early radio "turn-on" measurements which are importantfor estimating the local circumstellar medium (csm) properties. only at 20 cmwere turn-on data available. however, our analysis and fitting of the radiolight curves, and the assumption that the type iib sn 2001gd resembles the muchbetter studied type iib sn 1993j, enables us to describe the radio evolution asbeing very regular through day ~550 and consistent with a nonthermal-emittingmodel with a thermal absorbing csm. the presence of synchrotron-self absorption(ssa) at early times is implied by the data, but determination of the exactrelationship between the ssa component from the emitting region and thefree-free absorption component from the csm is not possible as there areinsufficient early measurements to distinguish between models. after day ~550,the radio emission exhibits a dramatically steeper decline rate which, assumingsimilarity to sn 1993j, can be described as an exponential decrease with ane-folding time of 500 days. we interpret this abrupt change in the radio fluxdensity decline rate as implying a transition of the shock front into a moretenuous region of circumstellar material. a similar change in radio evolutionhas been seen earlier in other sne such as sn 1988z, sn 1980k, and sn 1993j.

1008.1265	a multi-color optical survey of the orion nebula cluster. ii. the h-r  diagram	we present a new analysis of the stellar population of the orion nebulacluster (onc) based on multi-band optical photometry and spectroscopy. we studythe color-color diagrams in bvi, plus a narrow-band filter centered at 6200a,finding evidences that intrinsic color scales valid for main-sequence dwarfsare incompatible with the onc, while a better agreement is found employingsynthetic intrinsic colors obtained constraining the typical lower surfacegravity of young stars. we refine these model colors even further, empirically,by comparison with a sample of onc stars with no accretion and no extinction.we consider the stars with known spectral types from the literature, and add 65newly classified stars from slit spectroscopy and 182 m-type from narrow-bandphotometry; in this way we isolate a sample of about 1000 stars with knownspectral type. we introduce a new method to self-consistently derive reddeningand accretion excess from the location of each star in the bvi color-colordiagram. this enables us to accurately determine the extinction of the oncmembers. we adopt a lower distance for the onc than previously assumed, basedon recent parallax measurements. with a careful choice also of the spectraltype-temperature transformation, we produce the new h-r diagram of the oncpopulation, more populated than previous works. with respect to previous works,we find higher luminosity for late-type stars and a lower luminosity for earlytypes. we determine the age distribution of the population, peaking at 2-3 myr,a higher age than previously estimated. we study the distribution of themembers in the mass-age plane, and find that taking into account selectioneffects due to incompleteness removes an apparent correlation between mass andage. we derive the imf for low- and intermediate-mass members of the onc, whichturns out to be model-dependent, and shows a turn-over at ~&lt;0.2msun.

0709.1136	long term radio monitoring of sn 1993j	we present our observations of the radio emission from supernova (sn) 1993j,in m 81 (ngc 3031), made with the vla, from 90 to 0.7 cm, as well as numerousmeasurements from other telescopes. the combined data set constitutes probablythe most detailed set of measurements ever established for any sn outside ofthe local group in any wavelength range. only sn 1987a in the lmc has been thesubject of such an intensive observational program. the radio emission evolvesregularly in both time and frequency, and the usual interpretation in terms ofshock interaction with a circumstellar medium (csm) formed by a pre-sn stellarwind describes the observations rather well considering the complexity of thephenomenon. however: 1) the 85 - 110 ghz measurements at early times are notwell fitted by the parameterization, unlike the cm wavelength measurements. 2)at mid-cm wavelengths there is some deviation from the fitted radio lightcurves. 3) at a time ~3100 days after shock breakout, the decline rate of theradio emission steepens without change in the spectral index. this decline isbest described as an exponential decay starting at day 3100 with an e-foldingtime of ~1100 days. 4) the best overall fit to all of the data is a modelincluding both non-thermal synchrotron self-absorption (ssa) and a thermalfree-free absorbing (ffa) components at early times, evolving to a constantspectral index, optically thin decline rate, until the break in that declinerate. moreover, neither a purely ssa nor a purely ffa absorbing models canprovide a fit that simultaneously reproduces the light curves, the spectralindex evolution, and the brightness temperature evolution. 5) the radio andx-ray light curves exhibit similar behavior and suggest a sudden drop in the snprogenitor mass-loss rate at ~8000 years prior to shock breakout.

1101.4521	detection of brown dwarf-like objects in the core of ngc3603	we use near-infrared data obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on thehubble space telescope to identify objects having the colors of brown dwarfs(bds) in the field of the massive galactic cluster ngc 3603. these areidentified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filtersspanning the j and h bands, and which are particularly sensitive to thepresence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m h2o molecular band - unique to bds. we provide acalibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color forboth field stars and for bds. this photometric method provides effectivetemperatures for bds to an accuracy of {\pm}350k relative to spectroscopictechniques. this accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by eitherstellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. weidentify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 k,typical of bds, observed j-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that arestrongly clustered towards the luminous core of ngc 3603. however, if these arelocated at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normalbds. we argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts ofour dataset, normal field bds/m-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effectivetemperatures of bds but with luminosities of more massive stars. we explore theinteresting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that haverecently tidally ingested a hot jupiter, the remnants of which are providing ashort-lived extended photosphere to the central star. in this case, we wouldexpect them to show the signature of fast rotation.

1104.4494	photometric determination of the mass accretion rates of pre-main  sequence stars. ii. ngc346 in the small magellanic cloud	[abridged] we have studied the properties of the stellar populations in thefield of the ngc346 cluster in the small magellanic cloud, using a novelself-consistent method that allows us to reliably identify pre-main sequence(pms) objects actively undergoing mass accretion, regardless of their age. themethod does not require spectroscopy and combines broad-band v and i photometrywith narrow-band halpha imaging to identify all stars with excess halphaemission and derive the accretion luminosity lacc and mass accretion rate maccfor all of them. the application of this method to existing hst/acs photometryof the ngc346 field has allowed us to identify and study 680 bona-fide pmsstars with masses from ~0.4 to ~4 msolar and ages in the range from ~1 to ~30myr. this is the first study to reveal that, besides a young population of pmsstars (~ 1 myr old), in this field there is also an older population of pmsobjects with a median age of ~20 myr. we provide for all of them accuratephysical parameters. we study the evolution of the mass accretion rate as afunction of stellar parameters and find that logmacc ~ -0.6 log t + log m + c,where t is the age of the star, m its mass and c a quantity that is higher atlower metallicity. the high mass accretion rates that we find suggest that aconsiderable fraction of the stellar mass is accreted during the pms phase andthat pms evolutionary models that do not account for this effect willsystematically underestimate the true age when compared with the observations.

1106.1738	pre--main-sequence stellar populations across shapley constellation iii.  i. photometric analysis and identification	we present our investigation of pre--main-sequence (pms) stellar populationsin the large magellanic cloud (lmc) from imaging with hubble space telescopewfpc2 camera. our targets of interest are four star-forming regions located atthe periphery of the super-giant shell lmc 4 (shapley constellation iii). thepms stellar content of the regions is revealed through the differential hessdiagrams and the observed color-magnitude diagrams (cmds). further statisticalanalysis of stellar distributions along cross-sections of the faint part of thecmds allowed the quantitative assessment of the pms stars census, and theisolation of faint pms stars as the true low-mass stellar members of theregions. these distributions are found to be well represented by a doublegaussian function, the first component of which represents the main-sequencefield stars and the second the native pms stars of each region. based on thisresult, a cluster membership probability was assigned to each pms staraccording to its cmd position. the higher extinction in the region lh 88 didnot allow the unambiguous identification of its native stellar population. thecmd distributions of the pms stars with the highest membership probability inthe regions lh 60, lh 63 and lh 72 exhibit an extraordinary similarity amongthe regions, suggesting that these stars share common characteristics, as wellas common recent star formation history. considering that the regions arelocated at different areas of the edge of lmc 4, this finding suggests thatstar formation along the super-giant shell may have occurred almostsimultaneously.

1106.2801	star formation in 30 doradus	using observations obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board thehubble space telescope (hst), we have studied the properties of the stellarpopulations in the central regions of 30 dor, in the large magellanic cloud.the observations clearly reveal the presence of considerable differentialextinction across the field. we characterise and quantify this effect usingyoung massive main sequence stars to derive a statistical reddening correctionfor most objects in the field. we then search for pre-main sequence (pms) starsby looking for objects with a strong (&gt; 4 sigma) halpha excess emission andfind about 1150 of them over the entire field. comparison of their location inthe hertzsprung-russell diagram with theoretical pms evolutionary tracks forthe appropriate metallicity reveals that about one third of these objects areyounger than ~4myr, compatible with the age of the massive stars in the centralionising cluster r136, whereas the rest have ages up to ~30myr, with a medianage of ~12myr. this indicates that star formation has proceeded over anextended period of time, although we cannot discriminate between an extendedepisode and a series of short and frequent bursts that are not resolved intime. while the younger pms population preferentially occupies the centralregions of the cluster, older pms objects are more uniformly distributed acrossthe field and are remarkably few at the very centre of the cluster. weattribute this latter effect to photoevaporation of the older circumstellardiscs caused by the massive ionising members of r136.

1106.5780	clues to the star formation in ngc 346 across time and space	we have studied the properties of the stellar populations in the field of thengc 346 cluster in the small magellanic cloud, using the results of a novelself-consistent method that provides a reliable identification of pre-mainsequence (pms) objects actively undergoing mass accretion, regardless of theirage. the 680 identified bona-fide pms stars show a bimodal age distribution,with two roughly equally numerous populations peaked respectively at ~1 myr,and ~20 myr. we use the age and other physical properties of these pms stars tostudy how star formation has proceeded across time and space in ngc 346. wefind no correlation between the locations of young and old pms stars, nor do wefind a correspondence between the positions of young pms stars and those ofmassive ob stars of similar age. furthermore, the mass distribution of starswith similar age shows large variations throughout the region. we concludethat, while on a global scale it makes sense to talk about an initial massfunction, this concept is not meaningful for individual star-forming regions.an interesting implication of the separation between regions where massivestars and low-mass objects appear to form is that high-mass stars might not be"perfect" indicators of star formation and hence a large number of low-massstars formed elsewhere might have so far remained unnoticed. for certain lowsurface density galaxies this way of preferential low-mass star formation maybe the predominant mechanism, with the consequence that their total mass asderived from the luminosity may be severely underestimated and that theirevolution is not correctly understood.

1311.3659	probing interstellar extinction near the 30 doradus nebula with red  giant stars	we have studied the interstellar extinction in a field of 3' x 3' locatedabout 6' sw of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). hubble spacetelescope observations in the u, b, v, i and halpha bands reveal patchyextinction in this field. the colour-magnitude diagram (cmd) shows an elongatedstellar sequence, almost parallel to the main sequence (ms), which is inreality made up of stars of the red giant clump (rc) spread across the cmd bythe uneven levels of extinction in this region. since these objects are all atthe same distance from us and share very similar physical properties, we canderive quantitatively both the extinction law in the range 3000 - 8000 angstromand the absolute extinction towards about 100 objects, setting statisticallysignificant constraints on the dust grains properties in this area. we find anextinction curve considerably flatter than the standard galactic one and thanthose obtained before for the lmc. the derived value of rv = 5.6 +/- 0.3implies that in this region larger grains dominate. upper ms stars span anarrower range of e(b-v) values than rc objects, at variance with what has beenfound elsewhere in the lmc.

1408.4786	the extinction law inside the 30 doradus nebula	we have studied the interstellar extinction in a field of ~3' x 3' at thecore of the 30 doradus nebula, including the central r136 cluster, in the largemagellanic cloud. observations at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,obtained with the wfc3 camera on board the hubble space telescope, show thatthe stars belonging to the red giant clump are spread across thecolour-magnitude diagrams because of the considerable and uneven levels ofextinction in this region. since these stars share very similar physicalproperties and are all at the same distance, they allow us to derive theabsolute extinction in a straightforward and reliable way. thus we havemeasured the extinction towards about 180 objects and the extinction law in therange 0.3 - 1.6 micron. at optical wavelengths, the extinction curve is almostparallel to that of the diffuse galactic interstellar medium. taking the latteras a template, the value of rv = 4.5 +/- 0.2 that we measure indicates that inthe optical there is an extra grey component due to a larger fraction of largegrains. at wavelengths longer than ~1 micron, the contribution of thisadditional component tapers off as lambda^-1.5, like in the milky way,suggesting that the nature of the grains is otherwise similar to those in ourgalaxy, but with a ~2.2 times higher fraction of large grains. these resultsare consistent with the addition of "fresh" large grains by supernovaexplosions, as recently revealed by herschel and alma observations of sn 1987a.

1509.02906	do you know the extinction in your young massive cluster?	up to ages of ~100 myr, massive clusters are still swamped in large amountsof gas and dust, with considerable and uneven levels of extinction. at the sametime, large grains (ices?) produced by type ii supernovae profoundly alter theinterstellar medium (ism), thus resulting in extinction properties verydifferent from those of the diffuse ism. to obtain physically meaningfulparameters of stars, from basic luminosities and effective temperatures tomasses and ages, we must understand and measure the local extinction law. thisproblem affects all the massive young clusters discussed in his volume. we havedeveloped a powerful method to unambiguously determine the extinction law in anuniform way across a cluster field, using multi-band photometry of red giantstars belonging to the red clump (rc). in the large magellanic cloud, withabout 20 rc stars per arcmin^2, we can easily derive a solid andself-consistent absolute extinction curve over the entire wavelength range ofthe photometry. here, we present the extinction law of the tarantula nebula (30dor) based on thousands of stars observed as part of the hubble tarantulatreasury project.

astro-ph;0001476	young stellar populations around sn1987a	we present the results of a study of the stellar population in a region of 30pc radius around sn1987a, based on an analysis of multi-band hst-wfpc2 images.  the effective temperature, radius and, possibly, reddening of each star weredetermined for 21,955 stars by fitting the measured broad band magnitudes tothe ones calculated with model atmospheres. in addition, we have identified allstars with halpha equivalent widths in excess of 8 a, amounting to a total of492 stars.  an inspection to the hr diagram reveals the presence of several generationsof young stars, with ages between 1 and 150 myrs, superposed on a much olderfield population (0.6-6 gyrs). a substantial fraction of young stars have agesaround 12 myrs which is the stellar generation coeval to sn 1987a progenitor.the youngest stars in the field appear to be strong-line t tauri stars. thisconstitute the first positive detection of low mass (about 1-2 mo) pre mainsequence (pms) stars outside the milky way. their positions in the hr diagramappear to require that star formation in the lmc occurs with accretion ratesabout 10 times higher than in the milky way, i.e. ~10^{-4} mo/yr.  sn1987a appears to belong to a loose, young cluster 12+/-2 myrs old, in whichthe slope of the present mass function is almost identical to salpeter's formasses above 3 mo, but becomes much flatter for lower masses. on a large scale,we find that the spatial distribution of massive stars and low-mass pms starsare conclusively different. this results casts doubts on the validity of an imfconcept on a small scale (say, less than 10 pc). a preliminary analysis, donefor the whole field as a single entity, shows that the imf slope for the youngpopulation present over the entire region is steeper than gamma ~ -1.7.

astro-ph;0010614	preliminary spectral analysis of the type ii supernova 1999em	we have calculated fast direct spectral model fits to two early-time spectraof the type-ii plateau sn 1999em, using the synow synthetic spectrum code. thefirst is an extremely early blue optical spectrum and the second a combined hstand optical spectrum obtained one week later. spectroscopically this supernovaappears to be a normal type ii and these fits are in excellent agreement withthe observed spectra. our direct analysis suggests the presence of enhancednitrogen. we have further studied these spectra with the full nlte generalmodel atmosphere code phoenix. while we do not find confirmation for enhancednitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. an even moreintriguing possible line identification is complicated balmer and he i lines,which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallowdensity gradient. we also show that very early spectra such as those presentedhere combined with sophisticated spectral modeling allows an independentestimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum isvery blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot bereproduced by altering the ``temperature'' of the emitted radiation. theseresults are extremely encouraging since they imply that detailed modeling ofearly spectra can shed light on both the abundances and total extinction of sneii, the latter improving their utility and reliability as distance indicators.

astro-ph;0103471	chemical composition and origin of nebulae around luminous blue  variables	we use the analysis of the heavy element abundances (c, n, o, s) incircumstellar nebulae around luminous blue variables to infer the evolutionaryphase in which the material has been ejected.  (1) we discuss the different effects that may have changed the gascomposition of the nebula since it was ejected  (2) we calculate the expected abundance changes at the stellar surface due toenvelope convection in the red supergiant phase. if the observed lbv nebulaeare ejected during the rsg phase, the abundances of the lbv nebulae require asignificantly smaller amount of mass to be lost than assumed in evolutionarymodels.  (3) we calculate the changes in the surface composition during the mainsequence phase by rotation induced mixing. if the nebulae are ejected at theend of the ms-phase, the abundances in lbv nebulae are compatible with mixingtimes between 5 x 10^6 and 1 x 10^7 years. the existence of on stars supportsthis scenario.  (4) the predicted he/h ratio in the nebulae are significantly smaller thanthe current observed photospheric values of their central stars.  combining various arguments we show that the lbv nebulae are ejected duringthe blue sg phase and that the stars have not gone through a rsg phase. thechemical enhancements are due to rotation induced mixing, and the ejection ispossibly triggered by near-critical rotation. during the ejection, the outflowwas optically thick, which resulted in a large effective radius and a loweffective temperature. this also explains the observed properties of lbv dust.

astro-ph;0203346	modelling the hubble space telescope ultraviolet and optical spectrum of  spot 1 on the circumstellar ring of sn 1987a	we report and interpret hst/stis long-slit observations of the optical andultraviolet (1150 - 10270 angstrom) emission-line spectra of the rapidlybrightening spot 1 on the equatorial ring of sn 1987a between 1997 septemberand 1999 october (days 3869 -- 4606 after outburst). the emission is caused byradiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gasprotruding inward from the equatorial ring. we measure and tabulate lineidentifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. we computeflux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorptionof several emission lines. nebular analysis shows that optical emission linescome from a region of cool (t_e ~ 10^4 k) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas inthe compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. the observed linewidths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities v_s &lt; 250 km/s havebecome radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission musthave come from yet slower (v_s &lt; 135 k/ms) shocks. we are able to fit the uvfluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (v_s =135 and 250 km/s). the observed uv flux increase with time can be explained bythe increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of theprotrusion. the observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized uv lines aregreater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shockmodels and we discuss the possible causes. we also present models for theobserved h-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flowexists in the photoionized regions of these shocks. we discuss what can belearned with future observations of all the spots present on the equatorialring.

astro-ph;0205551	radio observations of grb afterglows	since 1997 the afterglow of gamma-ray bursting sources (grbs) hasoccasionally been detected in the radio, as well in other wavelengths bands. inparticular, the interesting and unusual gamma-ray burst grb980425, thought tobe related to the radio supernova sn1998bw, is a possible link between the twoclasses of objects. analyzing the extensive radio emission data avaliable forsn1998bw, one can describe its time evolution within the well establishedframework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae. thisthen allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical propertiesof the object. the radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of amildly relativistic shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind-establishedcircumstellar medium (csm) that is highly structured both azimuthally, inclumps or filaments, and radially, with observed density enhancements. becauseof its unusual characteristics for a type ib/c supernova, the relation ofsn1998bw to grb980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classesof grbs originate in supernova (sn) massive star explosions. thus, employingthe formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae (sne) andfollowing the link through sn1998bw/grb980425, it is possible to model thegross properties of the radio and optical/infrared (oir) emission from thehalf-dozen grbs with extensive radio observations. from this we conclude thatat least some members of the ``slow-soft'' class of grbs can be attributed tothe explosion of a massive star in a dense, highly structured csm that waspresumably established by the preexplosion stellar system.

astro-ph;0607632	the hubble ultra deep field	this paper presents the hubble ultra deep field (hudf), a one million secondexposure of an 11 square minute-of-arc region in the southern sky with thehubble space telescope. the exposure time was divided among four filters, f435w(b435), f606w (v606), f775w (i775), and f850lp (z850), to give approximatelyuniform limiting magnitudes mab~29 for point sources. the image contains atleast 10,000 objects presented here as a catalog. few if any galaxies atredshifts greater than ~4 resemble present day spiral or elliptical galaxies.using the lyman break dropout method, we find 504 b-dropouts, 204 v-dropouts,and 54 i-dropouts. using these samples that are at different redshifts butderived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in thecharacteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in theirnumber densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. the ultraviolet luminositydensity of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than thecharacteristic luminosity, and the hudf reveals considerably more luminositythan shallower surveys. the apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxiesappears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6. thehighest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at theearliest epochs that galaxies have been observed, less than one billion yearsafter the big bang.

0809.1682	stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from deep hst acs/wfc  photometry	we present stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from the sagittariuswindow eclipsing extrasolar search (sweeps) project using acs/wfc on hst.proper motions are extracted for more than 180,000 objects, with &gt;81,000measured to accuracy better than 0.3 mas/yr in both coordinates. we reportseveral results based on these measurements: 1. kinematic separation of bulgefrom disk allows a sample of &gt;15,000 bulge objects to be extracted based on&gt;6-sigma detections of proper motion, with &lt;0.2% contamination from the disk.this includes the first detection of a candidate bulge blue stragglerpopulation. 2. armed with a photometric distance modulus on a star by starbasis, and using the large number of stars with high-quality proper motionmeasurements to overcome intrinsic scatter, we dissect the kinematic propertiesof the bulge as a function of distance along the line of sight. this allows usto extract the stellar circular speed curve from proper motions alone, which wecompare with the circular speed curve obtained from radial velocities. 3. wetrace the variation of the {l,b} velocity ellipse as a function of depth. 4.finally, we use the density-weighted {l,b} proper motion ellipse produced fromthe tracer stars to assess the kinematic membership of the sixteen transitingplanet candidates discovered in the sagittarius window; the kinematicdistribution of the planet candidates is consistent with that of the disk andbulge stellar populations.

astro-ph;0610098	transiting extrasolar planetary candidates in the galactic bulge	more than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered around relativelynearby stars, primarily through the doppler line shifts owing to the reflexmotions of their host stars, and more recently through transits of some planetsacross the face of the host stars. the detection of planets with the shortestknown periods, 1.2 to 2.5 days, has mainly resulted from transit surveys whichhave generally targeted stars more massive than 0.75 m_sun. here we report theresults from a planetary transit search performed in a rich stellar fieldtowards the galactic bulge. we discovered 16 candidates with orbital periodsbetween 0.4 and 4.2 days, five of which orbit stars of 0.44 to 0.75 m_sun. intwo cases, radial-velocity measurements support the planetary nature of thecompanions. five candidates have orbital periods below 1.0 day, constituting anew class of ultra-short-period planets (uspps), which occur only around starsof less than 0.88 m_sun. this indicates that those orbiting very close to moreluminous stars might be evaporatively destroyed, or that jovian planets aroundlower-mass stars might migrate to smaller radii.

astro-ph;0701875	redshifts of emission line objects in the hubble ultra deep field	we present redshifts for 115 emission line objects in the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf) identified through the grism acs program for extragalactic science(grapes) project using the slitless grism spectroscopy mode of the acs cameraon the hubble space telescope (hst). the sample was selected by an emissionline search on all extracted 1-dimensional grapes spectra. we identify theemission lines using line wavelength ratios where multiple lines are detectedin the grism wavelength range (5800a &lt; lambda &lt; 9600a), and using photometricredshift information where multiple lines are unavailable. we then deriveredshifts using the identified lines. our redshifts are accurate to delta(z) =0.009, based on both statistical uncertainty estimates and comparison withpublished ground-based spectra. over 40% of our sample is fainter than typicalmagnitude limits for ground-based spectroscopy (with i_{ab}&gt;25 mag). suchemission lines would likely remain undiscovered without our deep survey. theemission line objects fall into 3 categories: 1) most are low to moderateredshift galaxies (0 &lt; z &lt; 2), including many actively star forming galaxieswith strong hii regions; 2) 9 are high redshift (4 &lt; z &lt; 7) lyman-alphaemitters; and 3) at least 3 are candidate agns.

astro-ph;0703409	type ia supernova rates near and far	(abridged) recently, three important observational results were established:(a) the evolution of the snia rate with redshift show that the rate rises up toz~0.8, when the universe was 6.5 gyr old, and decreases afterward. (b) the rateof supernova explosions of the different types as a function of the galaxy(b-k) and the galaxy mass shows a marked increase with the star formationactivity. (c) the rate of snia in radio-loud galaxies is much higher than therate measured in radio-quiet galaxies. on this basis we have discussed thedistribution of the delay time (dtd) between the formation of a snia progenitorstar and its explosion as a snia. our analysis finds: i) models with long delaytimes, say 3-4 gyr, cannot reproduce the dependence of the snia rate on thecolors and on the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies; ii) the dependenceof the snia rate on the parent galaxy colors requires models with a wide dtd,spanning the interval 100 myr to 10 gyr; iii) the dependence on the parentgalaxy radio-luminosity requires substantial production of snia at epochsearlier than 100 myr after the birth of a given stellar generation; iv) thecomparison between observed sn rates and a grid of theoretical"single-population" dtds shows that only a few of them are marginallyconsistent with all observations; v) the present data are best matched by abimodal dtd, in which about 50% of type ia sne ("prompt" snia) explode soonafter their stellar birth, in a time of the order of 100 myrs, while theremaining 50% ("tardy" snia) have a much wider distribution, well described byan exponential function with a decay time of about 3 gyr. we discuss thecosmological implications of this result and make simple predictions.

astro-ph;9602157	hubble space telescope spectroscopic observations of the ejecta of sn  1987a at 2000 days	we have used the faint object spectrograph on the hubble space telescope toobserve the spectra of sn 1987a over the wavelength range 2000 -- 8000\ \aa\ ondates 1862 and 2210 days after the supernova outburst. even these pre-costarobservations avoid much of the contamination from the bright stars nearby andprovide a very useful set of line strengths and shapes for analysis. thespectrum is formed in an unusual physical setting: cold gas which is excitedand ionized by energetic electrons from the radioactive debris of the supernovaexplosion. the spectra of sn 1987a at this phase are surprisingly similar tothose of the nova shells of cp puppis and t pyxidis decades after outburst. sn1987a and the novae are characterized by emission from material with electrontemperatures of only a few hundred degrees kelvin, and show narrow balmercontinuum emission and strong emission lines from o$^+$. the balmer continuumshape requires the electron temperature in the supernova ejecta to be as low as500 k on day 1862 and 400 k on day 2210 after outburst. the \oiiuv\ doublet issurprisingly strong and is plausibly powered by collisional ionization ofneutral oxygen to excited states of o$^+$.  the line intensity ratio of the \oid\ doublet obtained from gaussian fits ofthe line profiles is 1.8$\pm0.2$, contrary to the optically thin limit of 3.this ratio is {\it not} due to an optical depth effect, but rather is anartifact of assuming a gaussian profile to fit the \oid\ doublet profile.specifying the line ratio $r\, = \, f([{\rm oi}]6300)/f([{\rm oi}]6364)$ = 3 isconsistent with the data and allows a calculation of the decomposed lineprofile.  all the observed strong lines are found to be blueshifted by a similar amount

astro-ph;9802296	radio observations of sn 1980k: evidence for rapid presupernova  evolution	new observations of sn 1980k made with the vla at 20 and 6 cm from 1994 aprilthrough 1996 october show that the supernova (sn) has undergone a significantchange in its radio emission evolution, dropping by a factor of ~2 below theflux density s \propto t^{-0.73} power-law decline with time t observedearlier. however, although s at all observed frequencies has decreasedsignificantly, its current spectral index of \alpha= -0.42\pm0.15 (s \propto\nu^{+\alpha}) is consistent with the previous spectral index of\alpha=-0.60_{-0.07}^{+0.04}.  it is suggested that this decrease in emission may be due to the sn shockentering a new region of the circumstellar material which has a lower densitythan that expected for a constant speed (w), constant mass-loss rate (mdot)wind from the progenitor. if such an interpretation is correct, the differencein wind and shock speeds appears to indicate a significant evolution in themass-loss history of the sn progenitor ~10^4 years before explosion, with achange in circumstellar density (\propto mdot/w) occurring over a time span of\lesssim 4 kyr. such features could be explained in terms of a fast``blue-loop'' evolutionary phase of a relatively massive pre-sn progenitorstar. if so, we may, for the first time, provide a stringent constraint on themass of the sn progenitor based solely on the sn's radio emission.

astro-ph;9806001	the opacity of nearby galaxies from colors and counts of background  galaxies: i. the synthetic field method and its application to ngc 4536 and  ngc 3664	we describe a new, direct method for determining the opacity of foregroundgalaxies which does not require any a priori assumptions about the spatialdistribution or the reddening law of the obscuring material. the method is tomeasure the colors and counts of background galaxies which can be identifiedthrough the foreground system. the method is calibrated, and the effects ofconfusion and obscuration are decoupled by adding various versions of asuitable deep reference frame containing only field galaxies with knownproperties into the image of the foreground galaxy, and analyzing these``synthetic field'' images in the same way as the real images. we test themethod on hst wfpc2 archived images of two galaxies which are quite different:ngc 4536 is a large sc spiral, and ngc 3664 is a small magellanic irregular.the reference frames are taken from the hubble deep field.  from the background galaxy counts, ngc 4536 shows an extinction a_i ~ 1 magin the northwestern arm region, and lower than 0.5 mag in the correspondinginterarm region (no correction for inclination has been attempted). however,from the galaxy colors, the same reddening of e(v - i) ~ 0.2 is observed inboth the arm and the interarm regions. in the interarm region, the combinationof extinction and reddening can be explained by a diffuse component with agalactic reddening law (r_v ~ 3). in the spiral arm, however, the same diffuse,low opacity component seems to coexist with regions of much higher opacity.since the exposures are shorter the results for ngc 3664 are less clear, butalso appear to be consistent with a two component distribution.

astro-ph;9812240	detection of pre-shock dense circumstellar material of sn 1978k	the supernova sn 1978k has been noted for its lack of emission lines broaderthan a few thousand km/s since its discovery in 1990. modeling of the radiospectrum of the peculiar sn 1978k indicates the existence of hii absorptionalong the line of sight. to determine the nature of this absorbing region, wehave obtained a high-dispersion spectrum of sn 1978k at the wavelength range6530--6610 \aa. the spectrum shows not only the moderately broad h-alphaemission of the supernova ejecta but also narrow nebular h-alpha and [n ii]emission. the high [n ii]6583/h-alpha ratio, 0.8-1.3, suggests that this radioabsorbing region is a stellar ejecta nebula. the expansion velocity andemission measure of the nebula are consistent with those seen in ejecta nebulaeof luminous blue variables. previous low-dispersion spectra have detected astrong [n ii]5755 line, indicating an electron density of 3-12x10^5 cm^{-3}. weargue that this stellar ejecta nebula is probably part of the pre-shock densecircumstellar envelope of sn 1978k. we further suggest that sn 1997ab mayrepresent a young version of sn 1978k.

astro-ph;9908144	hst study of the stellar populations within 30 pc of sn 1987a	we have studied the stellar populations in a region of 30 pc around sn 1987ain the large magellanic cloud using multi-band hst-wfpc2 images.  the effective temperature, luminosity and reddening of each detected starwere determined by fitting the measured broad band magnitudes to the onescalculated with model atmospheres. the resulting hr diagram reveals thepresence of stars with ages between 1 and 150 myrs, superposed on a much olderfield population. the youngest stars in the field appear to be t tauri stars,characterized by strong halpha excesses.  the star formation rate has increased monotonically in the last 8 gyrs andthe star formation activity is still very high at present.  young stars of low and high mass have different spatial distributions. thelatter ones are strongly concentrated in the vicinities of the supernova,whereas the previous ones are more evenly distributed on the field. hence, themass function varies on a scale of a few parsecs. however, averaging over theentire area, one can define an initial mass function, well fitted by apower-law with a slope alpha&lt;-2.55. the uncertainty on the imf due toincompleteness in identifying t tauri stars is discussed.

astro-ph;9910082	hst observations of the lmc field around sn87a: distance determinations  with red clump and tip of the red giant branch stars	we have used hst-wfpc2 multiband observations of a field around sn 1987a inthe large magellanic cloud to measure its distance from the sun. theobservations allowed us to carefully determine the interstellar extinctionalong the line of sight to a large number of stars and to measure the lmcdistance by using two stellar distance indicators: the red clump and the tip ofthe red giant branch. from an application of the red clump method we obtain adistance modulus (m-m)o,rc(lmc)=18.59+-0.04+-0.08 mag (statistical plussystematic error), in good agreement with the distance derived by using the tipof the red giant branch stars, namely (m-m)o,trgb(lmc)=18.69+-0.25+-0.06 mag(statistical plus systematic error). both values agree well with the distanceto the sn 1987a as determined from a study of its inner ring fluorescent echo((m-m)(sn87a)=18.55+-0.05 mag, panagia 1998), thus excluding distance modulilower than 18.43 to a 99.7% significance level. differences with respect toprevious results obtained using the same distance indicators are discussed.

0812.0023	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: a first look at resolved  stellar population tools	[abridged] when wfc3 is installed on hst, the community will have powerfulnew tools for investigating resolved stellar populations. the wfc3 galacticbulge treasury program will obtain deep imaging on 4 low-extinction fields.these non-proprietary data will enable a variety of science investigations notpossible with previous data sets. to aid in planning for the use of these dataand for future proposals, we provide an introduction to the program, itsphotometric system, and the associated calibration effort.  the observing strategy is based upon a new 5-band photometric system spanningthe uv, optical, and near-infrared. with these broad bands, one can constructreddening-free indices of teff and [fe/h]. besides the 4 bulge fields, theprogram will target 6 fields in well-studied star clusters, spanning a widerange of [fe/h]. the cluster data serve to calibrate the indices, providepopulation templates, and correct the transformation of isochrones into thewfc3 photometric system. the bulge data will shed light on the bulge formationhistory, and will also serve as population templates for other studies. one ofthe fields includes 12 candidate hosts of extrasolar planets.  cmds are the most popular tool for analyzing resolved stellar populations.however, due to degeneracies among teff, [fe/h], and reddening in traditionalcmds, it can be difficult to draw robust conclusions from the data. the 5-bandsystem used for the bulge treasury observations will provide indices that areroughly orthogonal in teff and [fe/h], and we argue that model fitting in anindex-index diagram will make better use of the information than fittingseparate cmds. we provide simulations to show the expected data quality and thepotential for differentiating between different star-formation histories.
