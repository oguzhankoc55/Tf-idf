0901.4540	cosmological results from five years of 30 ghz cmb intensity  measurements with the cosmic background imager	we present final results on the angular power spectrum of total intensityanisotropies in the cmb from the cbi. our analysis includes all primordialanisotropy data collected between january 2000 and april 2005, and benefitssignificantly from an improved maximum likelihood analysis pipeline. it alsoincludes results from a 30 ghz foreground survey conducted with the green banktelescope (gbt) which places significant constraints on the possiblecontamination due to foreground point sources. we improve on previous cbiresults by about a factor of two in the damping tail. these data confirm, at~3-sigma, the existence of an excess of power over intrinsic cmb anisotropy onsmall angular scales (l &gt; 1800). using the gbt survey, we find currently knownradio source populations are not capable of generating the power; a newpopulation of faint sources with steeply rising spectral indices would berequired to explain the excess with sources... we also present a fullcosmological parameter analysis of the new cbi power spectrum... with cbialone, the full parameter analysis finds the excess is 1.6-sigma above thelevel expected for a sigma_8=0.8 universe. we find the addition of high-l cmbdata substantially improves constraints on cosmic string contributions to thett power spectrum as well as the running of the scalar spectral index... wealso present forecasts for what other experiments should see at differentfrequencies and angular resolutions given the excess power observed by cbi. wefind that the reported high-l bandpowers from current high resolution cmbbolometer experiments are consistent with each other and cbi if the excesspower is due to the sze at the cbi-level of 2.5 +/- 1 times the sigma_8=0.8standard sz template. &lt;abridged&gt;

0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0706.4330	molecular outflows and a mid-infrared census of the massive  star-formation region associated with iras 18507+0121	we have observed the central region of the ir-dark cloud filament associatedwith iras 18507+0121 at millimeter wavelengths in co(1-0), 13co(1-0), andc18o(1-0) line emission and with the spitzer space telescope at mid-irwavelengths. five massive outflows from two cloud cores were discovered. threeoutflows are centered on or near an ultracompact hii region (g34.4+0.23) whilethe remaining two outflows originate from the millimeter core g34.4+0.23 mm.modeling of the seds of the mid-ir sources identified 31 young stellar objectsin the filament with a combined stellar mass of ~127 +/- 27 msun. an additional22 sources were identified as probable cluster members based on the presence ofstrong 24 micron emission. the total star formation efficiency in the g34.4cloud filament is estimated to be ~7% while the massive and intermediate massstar formation efficiency in the entire cloud filament is estimated to beroughly 2%. a comparison of the gravitational binding energy with the outflowkinetic energy suggests that the compact core containing g34.4+0.23 mm is beingdestroyed by its molecular outflows whereas the outflows associated with moremassive core surrounding the g34.4 uc hii region are not likely to totallydisrupt the cloud. additionally, a qualitative evaluation of the region appearsto suggest that stars in this region may have formed in two stages: first lowermass stars formed and then, a few myrs later, the more massive stars began toform.

0910.1609	the science case for building a band 1 receiver suite for alma	we present a set of compelling science cases for the alma band 1 receiversuite. for these cases, we assume in tandem the updated nominal band 1frequency range of 35-50 ghz with a likely extension up to 52 ghz; togetherthese frequencies optimize the band 1 science return. the scope of the sciencecases ranges from nearby stars to the re-ionization edge of the universe. twocases provide additional leverage on the present alma level one science goalsand are seen as particularly powerful motivations for building the band 1receiver suite: (1) detailing the evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks,as a complement to the gas kinematics, requires continuum observations out to~35 ghz (~9mm); and (2) detecting co 3-2 line emission from galaxies like themilky way during the epoch of re-ionization, i.e., 6 &lt; z &lt; 10, also requiresband 1 receiver coverage. the range of band 1 science is wide, however, andincludes studies of very small dust grains in the ism, pulsar wind nebulae,radio supernovae, x-ray binaries, the galactic center (i.e., sgr a*), densecloud cores, complex carbon-chain molecules, masers, magnetic fields in thedense ism, jets and outflows from young stars, distant galaxies, and galaxyclusters (i.e., the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect). a comparison of alma and thejansky vla (jvla) at the same frequencies of band 1 finds similar sensitivityperformance at 40-50 ghz, with a slight edge for alma at higher frequencies(e.g., within a factor of 2 for continuum observations). with its larger numberof instantaneous baselines, however, alma band 1data will have greater fidelitythan those from the jvla at similar frequencies.

1006.3574	the molecular environment of the galactic star forming region  g19.61-0.23	we present single-dish (sub)millimeter observations of gas and dust in thegalactic high-mass star-forming region g19.61-0.23, with the aim of studyingthe large-scale properties and physical conditions of the molecular gas acrossthe region. the final aim is to compare the large-scale (about 100 pc)properties with the small-scale (about 3 pc) properties and to considerpossible implications for extragalactic studies. we have mapped coisotopologues in the j=1-0 transition using the fcrao-14m telescope and thej=2-1 transition using the iram-30m telescope. we have also used data from theatlasgal survey and from the bu-fcrao galactic ring survey, as well as thespitzer infrared galactic plane surveys glimpse and mipsgal to characterize thestar-formation activity within the molecular clouds. we reveal a population ofmolecular clumps in the 13co(1-0) emission. our analysis of the 13co suggeststhat the virial parameter (ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy) variesover an order of magnitude between clumps that are unbound and some that areapparently "unstable". this conclusion is independent of whether they showevidence of ongoing star formation. we find that the majority of atlasgalsources have mipsgal counterparts with luminosities in the range 10^4 - 5 10^4lsun and are presumably forming relatively massive stars. we compare ourresults with previous extragalactic studies of the nearby spiral galaxies m31and m33; and the blue compact dwarf galaxy henize2-10. we find that the maingiant molecular cloud surrounding g19.61-0.23 has physical properties typicalfor galactic gmcs and which are comparable to the gmcs in m31 and m33. however,the gmc studied here shows smaller surface densities and masses than the cloudsidentified in henize2-10 and associated with super star cluster formation.

1008.0926	a gallery of bubbles - the nature of the bubbles observed by spitzer and  what atlasgal tells us about the surrounding neutral material	we attempt to determine the nature of the bubbles observed by spitzer in thegalactic plane, mainly to establish if possible their association with massivestars. we take advantage of the very simple morphology of these objects tosearch for star formation triggered by hii regions, and to estimate theimportance of this mode of star formation. we consider a sample of 102 bubblesdetected by spitzer-glimpse, and catalogued by churchwell et al.(2006). we usemid-infrared and radio-continuum public data to discuss their nature. we usethe atlasgal survey at 870 micron to search for dense neutral materialcollected on their borders. results: we find that 86% of the bubbles containionized gas detected by means of its radio-continuum emission at 20-cm. thus,most of the bubbles observed at 8.0 micron enclose hii regions ionized by o-b2stars. ninety-eight percent of the bubbles exhibit 24 micron emission in theircentral regions. the ionized regions at the center of the 8.0 micron bubblesseem to be devoid of pahs but contain hot dust. among the 65 regions for whichthe angular resolution of the observations is high enough to resolve thespatial distribution of cold dust at 870 micron, we find that 40% aresurrounded by cold dust, and that another 28% contain interactingcondensations. the former are good candidates for the collect and collapseprocess, as they display an accumulation of dense material at their borders.the latter are good candidates for the compression of pre-existingcondensations by the ionized gas. eighteen bubbles exhibit associatedultracompact hii regions and/or methanol masers in the direction of dustcondensations adjacent to their ionization fronts. our results suggest thatmore than a quarter of the bubbles may have triggered the formation of massiveobjects.

1011.5419	sio outflows in high-mass star forming regions: a potential chemical  clock?	some theoretical models propose that o-b stars form via accretion, in asimilar fashion to low-mass stars. jet-driven molecular outflows play animportant role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand theprocess of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phasesinvolved. observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour anevolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with class 0 objectswhile more evolved class i/ii objects show less evidence of powerful jets. thepresent study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in thehigh-mass case. the iram 30-m telescope (spain) has been used to performsingle-pointing sio(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. continuum data atdifferent wavelengths, from mid-ir to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build thespectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometricluminosities. sio emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecularjets, is detected in 88% of our sources, a very high detection rate indicatingthat there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the sources of oursample. the sio(2-1) luminosity drops with l/m, which suggests that jetactivity declines as time evolves. this represents the first clear evidence ofa decrease of sio outflow luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample ofhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. the sio(3-2) tosio(2-1) integrated intensity ratio shows only minor changes with evolutionarystate.

(2011), and here we report the measurement of cmbpolarization power spectra using the 95-ghz data. this data set comprises 5337hours of observations recorded by an array of 84 polarized coherent receiverswith a total array sensitivity of 87 uk sqrt(s). four low-foreground fieldswere observed, covering a total of ~1000 square degrees with an effectiveangular resolution of 12.8', allowing for constraints on primordialgravitational waves and high-signal-to-noise measurements of the e-modes acrossthree acoustic peaks. the data reduction was performed using two independentanalysis pipelines, one based on a pseudo-cl (pcl) cross-correlation approach,and the other on a maximum-likelihood (ml) approach. all data selectioncriteria and filters were modified until a predefined set of null tests hadbeen satisfied before inspecting any non-null power spectrum. the resultsderived by the two pipelines are in good agreement. we characterize the ee, eband bb power spectra between l=25 and 975 and find that the ee spectrum isconsistent with lcdm, while the bb power spectrum is consistent with zero.based on these measurements, we constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio tor=1.1+0.9-0.8 (r&lt;2.8 at 95% c.l.) as derived by the ml pipeline, andr=1.2+0.9-0.8 (r&lt;2.7 at 95% c.l.) as derived by the pcl pipeline. in one of thefields, we find a correlation with the dust component of the planck sky model,though the corresponding excess power is small compared to statistical errors.finally, we derive limits on all known systematic errors, and demonstrate thatthese correspond to a tensor-to-scalar ratio smaller than r=0.01, the lowestlevel yet reported in the literature.

1208.4848	ammonia from cold high-mass clumps discovered in the inner galactic disk  by the atlasgal survey	the apex telescope large area survey: the galaxy (atlasgal) is an unbiasedcontinuum survey of the inner galactic disk at 870 \mu m. it covers +/- 60 degin galactic longitude and aims to find all massive clumps at various stages ofhigh-mass star formation in the inner galaxy, particularly the earliestevolutionary phases. we aim to determine properties such as the gas kinetictemperature and dynamics of new massive cold clumps found by atlasgal. mostimportantly, we derived their kinematical distances from the measured linevelocities. we observed the ammonia (j,k) = (1,1) to (3,3) inversiontransitions toward 862 clumps of a flux-limited sample of submm clumps detectedby atlasgal and extracted 13co (1-0) spectra from the galactic ring survey(grs). we determined distances for a subsample located at the tangential points(71 sources) and for 277 clumps whose near/far distance ambiguity is resolved.most atlasgal clumps are cold with rotational temperatures from 10-30 k. theyhave a wide range of nh3 linewidths, which by far exceeds the thermallinewidth, as well as a broad distribution of high column densities with an nh3abundance in the range of 5 to 30 * 10^{-8}. we found an enhancement of clumpsat galactocentric radii of 4.5 and 6 kpc. the high detection rate (87%)confirms ammonia as an excellent probe of the molecular content of the massive,cold clumps revealed by atlasgal. a clear trend of increasing rotationaltemperatures and linewidths with evolutionary stage is seen for source samplesranging from 24 \mu m dark clumps to clumps with embedded hii regions. thesurvey provides the largest ammonia sample of high-mass star forming clumps andthus presents an important repository for the characterization of statisticalproperties of the clumps and the selection of subsamples for detailed,high-resolution follow-up studies.

1209.1672	kinetic temperatures toward x1/x2 orbit interceptions regions and giant  molecular loops in the galactic center region	context: it is well known that the kinetic temperatures, tkin, of themolecular clouds in the galactic center region are higher than in typical diskclouds. however, the tkin of the molecular complexes found at higher latitudestowards the giant molecular loops in the central region of the galaxy is so farunknown. the gas of these high latitude molecular clouds (hereafter referred toas halo clouds) is located in a region where the gas in the disk may interactwith the gas in the halo in the galactic center region.  aims: to derive tkin in the molecular clouds at high latitude and understandthe physical process responsible for the heating of the molecular gas both inthe central molecular zone (the concentration of molecular gas in the inner 500pc) and in the giant molecular loops.  methods: we measured the metastable inversion transitions of nh3 from (1,1)to (6,6) toward six positions selected throughout the galactic central disk andhalo. we used rotational diagrams and large velocity gradient modeling toestimate the kinetic temperatures toward all the sources. we also observedother molecules like sio, hnco, cs, c34s, c18o, and 13co, to derive thedensities and to trace different physical processes (shocks, photodissociation,dense gas) expected to dominate the heating of the molecular gas.  results: we derive for the first time tkin of the high latitude cloudsinteracting with the disk in the galactic center region. we find highrotational temperatures in all the observed positions. we derive two kinetictemperature components (150 k and 40 k) for the positions in the centralmolecular zone, and only the warm kinetic temperature component for the cloudstoward the giant molecular loops. the fractional abundances derived from thedifferent molecules suggest that shocks provide the main heating mechanismthroughout the galactic center, also at high latitudes

1211.0741	atlasgal - compact source catalogue: 330 &lt; l &lt; 21 degrees	context. the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy (atlasgal) is thefirst systematic survey of the inner galactic plane in the sub-millimetre. theobservations were carried out with the large apex bolometer camera (laboca), anarray of 295 bolometers observing at 870 microns (345 ghz). aims. here wepresent a first version of the compact source catalogue extracted from thissurvey. this catalogue provides an unbiased database of dusty clumps in theinner galaxy. methods. the construction of this catalogue was made using thesource extraction routine sextractor. we have cross-associated the obtainedsources with the iras and msx catalogues, in order to constrain their nature.results. we have detected 6639 compact sources in the range from 330 &lt; l &lt; 21degrees and |b| &lt; 1.5 degrees. the catalogue has a 99% completeness for sourceswith a peak flux above 6 sigma, which corresponds to a flux density of ~0.4jy/beam. the parameters extracted for sources with peak fluxes below the 6sigma completeness threshold should be used with caution. tests on simulateddata find the uncertainty in the flux measurement to be ~12%, however, in morecomplex regions the flux values can be overestimated by a factor of 2 due tothe additional background emission. using a search radius of 30" we found that40% of atlasgal compact sources are associated with an iras or msx pointsource, but, ~50% are found to be associated with msx 21 microns fluxes abovethe local background level, which is probably a lower limit to the actualnumber of sources associated with star formation. conclusions. althoughinfrared emission is found towards the majority of the clumps detected, thiscatalogue is still likely to include a significant number of clumps that aredevoid of star formation activity and therefore excellent candidates forobjects in the coldest, earliest stages of (high-mass) star formation.

1302.2538	atlasgal --- environments of 6.7\,ghz methanol masers	using the 870-$\mu$m apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal), we have identified 577 submillimetre continuum sources with masersfrom the methanol multibeam (mmb) survey in the region $280\degr &lt; \ell &lt;20\degr$; $|\,b\,| &lt; 1.5\degr$. 94\,per\,cent of methanol masers in the regionare associated with sub-millimetre dust emission. we estimate masses for ~450maser-associated sources and find that methanol masers are preferentiallyassociated with massive clumps. these clumps are centrally condensed, withenvelope structures that appear to be scale-free, the mean maser position beingoffset from the peak column density by 0.0 \pm 4". assuming a kroupa initialmass function and a star-formation efficiency of ~30\,per\,cent, we find thatover two thirds of the clumps are likely to form clusters with masses&gt;20\,\msun. furthermore, almost all clumps satisfy the empirical mass-sizecriterion for massive star formation. bolometric luminosities taken from theliterature for ~100 clumps range between ~100 and 10$^6$\,\lsun. this confirmsthe link between methanol masers and massive young stars for 90\,per\,cent ofour sample. the galactic distribution of sources suggests that thestar-formation efficiency is significantly reduced in the galactic-centreregion, compared to the rest of the survey area, where it is broadly constant,and shows a significant drop in the massive star-formation rate density in theouter galaxy. we find no enhancement in source counts towards the southernscutum-centaurus arm tangent at $\ell ~ 315\degr$, which suggests that this armis not actively forming stars.

1302.6774	characterization of infrared dark clouds -- nh$_3$ observations of an  absorption-contrast selected irdc sample	despite increasing research in massive star formation, little is known aboutits earliest stages. infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold, dense and massiveenough to harbour the sites of future high-mass star formation. but up to now,mainly small samples have been observed and analysed. to understand thephysical conditions during the early stages of high-mass star formation, it isnecessary to learn more about the physical conditions and stability inrelatively unevolved irdcs. thus, for characterising irdcs studies of largesamples are needed. we investigate a complete sample of 218 northern hemispherehigh-contrast irdcs using the ammonia (1,1)- and (2,2)-inversion transitions.we detected ammonia (1,1)-inversion transition lines in 109 of our irdccandidates. using the data we were able to study the physical conditions withinthe star-forming regions statistically. we compared them with the conditions inmore evolved regions which have been observed in the same fashion as our samplesources. our results show that irdcs have, on average, rotation temperatures of15 k, are turbulent (with line width fwhms around 2 km s$^{-1}$), have ammoniacolumn densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and molecular hydrogencolumn densities on the order of $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. their virial masses arebetween 100 and a few 1000 m$_\odot$. the comparison of bulk kinetic andpotential energies indicate that the sources are close to virial equilibrium.irdcs are on average cooler and less turbulent than a comparison sample ofhigh-mass protostellar objects, and have lower ammonia column densities. virialparameters indicate that the majority of irdcs are currently stable, but areexpected to collapse in the future.

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

0802.1929	submillimeter line emission from lmc n159w: a dense, clumpy pdr in a low  metallicity environment	star formation at earlier cosmological times takes place in an interstellarmedium with low metallicity. the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is ideally suitedto study star formation in such an environment. the physical and chemical stateof the ism in a star forming environment can be constrained by observations ofsubmm and fir spectral lines of the main carbon carrying species, co, ci andcii, which originate in the surface layers of molecular clouds illuminated bythe uv radiation of the newly formed, young stars. we present high-angularresolution sub-millimeter observations in the n159w region in the lmc obtainedwith the nanten2 telescope of the 12co j = 4-3, j = 7-6, and 13co j = 4-3rotational and [ci] 3p1-3p0 and 3p2-3p1 fine-structure transitions. the 13co j=4-3 and [ci] 3p2-3p1 transitions are detected for the first time in the lmc.we derive the physical and chemical properties of the low-metallicity moleculargas using an escape probability code and a self-consistent solution of thechemistry and thermal balance of the gas in the framework of a clumpy cloud pdrmodel. the separate excitation analysis of the submm co lines and the carbonfine structure lines shows that the emitting gas in the n159w region hastemperatures of about 80 k and densities of about 10^4 cm^-3. the estimated cto co abundance ratio close to unity is substantially higher than in densemassive star-forming regions in the milky way. the analysis of all observedlines together, including the [cii] line intensity reported in the literature,in the context of a clumpy cloud pdr model constrains the uv intensity to about\chi ~220 and an average density of the clump ensemble of about 10^5 cm^-3,thus confirming the presence of high density material in the lmc n159w region.

1507.05808	infrared dark clouds on the far side of the galaxy	context: infrared dark clouds are the coldest and densest portions of giantmolecular clouds. the most massive ones represent some of the most likelybirthplaces for the next generation of massive stars in the milky way. becausea strong mid-ir background is needed to make them appear in absorption, theyare usually assumed to be nearby.  aims: we use thz absorption spectroscopy to solve the distance ambiguityassociated with kinematic distances for the ir-dark clouds in the top100atlasgal sample, a flux-limited selection of massive clumps in differentevolutionary phases of star formation.  methods: the para-h2o ground state transition at 1113.343 ghz, observed withherschel/hifi, was used to investigate the occurrence of foreground absorptionalong the line of sight directly towards infrared-dark clouds. additionalconsistency checks were performed using malt90 and higal archival data andtargeted mopra and apex spectroscopic observations.  results: we report the first discovery of five irdcs in the top100 lyingconclusively at the far kinematic distance, showing that the mere presence oflow-contrast mid-ir absorption is not sufficient to unequivocally resolve thenear/far ambiguity in favour of the former. all irdcs are massive and activelyforming high-mass stars; four of them also show infall signatures.  conclusions: we give a first estimate of the fraction of dark sources at thefar distance (~11% in the top100) and describe their appearance and properties.the assumption that all dark clouds lie at the near distance may lead, in somecases, to underestimating masses, sizes, and luminosities, possibly causingclouds to be missed that will form very massive stars and clusters.

1508.02778	the q/u imaging experiment: polarization measurements of the galactic  plane at 43 and 95 ghz	we present polarization observations of two galactic plane fields centered ongalactic coordinates (l,b)=(0 deg,0 deg) and (329 deg, 0 deg) at q- (43 ghz)and w-band (95 ghz), covering between 301 and 539 square degrees depending onfrequency and field. these measurements were made with the quiet instrumentbetween 2008 october and 2010 december, and include a total of 1263 hours ofobservations. the resulting maps represent the deepest large-area galacticpolarization observations published to date at the relevant frequencies withinstrumental rms noise varying between 1.8 and 2.8 uk deg, 2.3-6 times deeperthan corresponding wmap and planck maps. the angular resolution is 27.3' and12.8' fwhm at q- and w-band, respectively. we find excellent agreement betweenthe quiet and wmap maps over the entire fields, and no compelling evidence forsignificant residual instrumental systematic errors in either experiment,whereas the planck 44 ghz map deviates from these in a manner consistent withreported systematic uncertainties for this channel. we combine quiet and wmapdata to compute inverse-variance-weighted average maps, effectively retainingsmall angular scales from quiet and large angular scales from wmap. from thesecombined maps, we derive constraints on several important astrophysicalquantities, including a robust detection of polarized synchrotron spectralindex steepening of ~0.2 off the plane, as well as the faraday rotation measuretoward the galactic center (rm=-4000 +/- 200 rad m^-2), all of which areconsistent with previously published results. both the raw quiet and theco-added quiet+wmap maps are made publicly available together with allnecessary ancillary information.

1509.04920	ultra-pure digital sideband separation at sub-millimeter wavelengths	deep spectral-line surveys in the mm and sub-mm range can detect thousands oflines per band uncovering the rich chemistry of molecular clouds, star formingregions and circumstellar envelopes, among others objects. the ability to studythe faintest features of spectroscopic observation is, nevertheless, limited bya number of factors. the most important are the source complexity (linedensity), limited spectral resolution and insufficient sideband (image)rejection (srr). dual sideband (2sb) millimeter receivers separate upper andlower sideband rejecting the unwanted image by about 15 db, but they aredifficult to build and, until now, only feasible up to about 500 ghz(equivalent to alma band 8). for example alma bands 9 (602-720 ghz) and 10(787-950 ghz) are currently dsb receivers. aims: this article reports theimplementation of an alma band 9 2sb prototype receiver that makes use of a newtechnique called calibrated digital sideband separation. the new methodpromises to ease the manufacturing of 2sb receivers, dramatically increasesideband rejection and allow 2sb instruments at the high frequencies currentlycovered only by double sideband (dsb) or bolometric detectors. methods: we madeuse of a field programmable gate array (fpga) and fast analog to digitalconverters (adcs) to measure and calibrate the receiver's front end phase andamplitude imbalances to achieve sideband separation beyond the possibilities ofpurely analog receivers. the technique could in principle allow the operationof 2sb receivers even when only imbalanced front ends can be built,particularly at very high frequencies. results: this digital 2sb receiver showsan average sideband rejection of 45.9 db while small portions of the band dropbelow 40 db. the performance is 27 db (a factor of 500) better than the averageperformance of the proof-of-concept band 9 purely-analog 2sb prototypereceiver.

1511.07145	the atlasgal survey: distribution of cold dust in the galactic plane.  combination with planck data	sensitive ground-based submillimeter surveys, such as atlasgal, provide aglobal view on the distribution of cold dense gas in the galactic plane. herewe use the 353 ghz maps from the planck/hfi instrument to complement theground-based apex/laboca observations with information on larger angularscales. the resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the innergalaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. we find examples of elongatedstructures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. corresponding to &gt;30 pcstructures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are veryextended and show large aspect ratios. furthermore, we assess the fraction ofdense gas ($f_{\rm dg}$), and estimate 2-5% (above a$_{\rm{v}}&gt;$7 mag) onaverage in the galactic plane. pdfs of the column density reveal the typicallyobserved log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high columndensities. as a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sightintegrated n-pdf of the inner galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excessto the total column density of $\sim2.2$%, above $n_{\rm h_2} =2.92\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. taking the total flux density, we provide anindependent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner galaxy of$\sim1\times10^9\,m_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates usingco emission. from the mass and $f_{\rm dg}$ we estimate a galactic sfr of $\dotm = 1.3\,m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the distribution of diffuse gas ishomogenous in the inner galaxy, the cmz stands out with a higher dense gasfraction. the low star formation efficiency of the milky way is well explainedby the low $f_{\rm dg}$ in the galactic ism, while the high $f_{\rm dg}$towards the cmz, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, inthat particular region of our galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneckfor star formation.

astro-ph;0205384	the anisotropy of the microwave background to l = 3500: deep field  observations with the cosmic background imager	we report measurements of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation over the multipole range l ~ 200 - 3500 with the cosmic backgroundimager based on deep observations of three fields. these results confirm thedrop in power with increasing l first reported in earlier measurements withthis instrument, and extend the observations of this decline in power out to l\~ 2000. the decline in power is consistent with the predicted damping ofprimary anisotropies. at larger multipoles, l = 2000 - 3500, the power is 3.1sigma greater than standard models for intrinsic microwave backgroundanisotropy in this multipole range, and 3.5 sigma greater than zero. thisexcess power is not consistent with expected levels of residual radio sourcecontamination but, for sigma_8 &gt;~ 1, is consistent with predicted levels due toa secondary sunyaev-zeldovich anisotropy. further observations are necessary toconfirm the level of this excess and, if confirmed, determine its origin.

astro-ph;0312021	anomalous radio emission from dust in the helix	a byproduct of experiments designed to map the cmb is the recent detection ofa new component of foreground galactic emission. the anomalous foreground at ~10--30 ghz, unexplained by traditional emission mechanisms, correlates with100um dust emission. we report that in the helix the emission at 31 ghz and100um are well correlated, and exhibit similar features on sky images, whichare absent in h\beta. upper limits on the 250 ghz continuum emission in thehelix rule out cold grains as candidates for the 31 ghz emission, and providespectroscopic evidence for an excess at 31 ghz over bremsstrahlung. we estimatethat the 100um-correlated radio emission, presumably due to dust, accounts forat least 20% of the 31 ghz emission in the helix. this result strengthensprevious tentative interpretations of diffuse ism spectra involving a new dustemission mechanism at radio frequencies. very small grains have not beendetected in the helix, which hampers interpreting the new component in terms ofspinning dust. the observed iron depletion in the helix favors considering theidentity of this new component to be magnetic dipole emission from hotferromagnetic grains. the reduced level of free-free continuum we report alsoimplies an electronic temperature of te=4600\pm1200k for the free-free emittingmaterial, which is significantly lower than the temperature of 9500\pm500kinferred from collisionally-excited lines (abridged).

astro-ph;0405166	vela x at 31 ghz	we present observations of the vela x region at 31 ghz using the cosmicbackground imager (cbi). we find a strong compact radio source (5.9'x4.1',fwhm) about the vela pulsar, which we associate with the vela pulsar windnebula (pwn) recently discovered at lower radio-frequencies. the cbi's 4'resolution for a 45' field of view allows the pwn to be studied in thelarge-scale context of vela x. filamentary structure in vela x, which standsout in lower frequency maps, is very low-level at 31 ghz. by combining the 10cbi channels, which cover 26-36 ghz, and 8.4 ghz archive data, we study thespectral energy distribution (sed) of the pwn and the brightest filaments. ourresults show that the spectral index alpha (f_{nu} propto nu^alpha) of the pwnis flat, or even marginally positive, with a value ofalpha_{8.4}^{31}=0.10+-0.06, while the vela x filamentary structure has anegative spectral index of alpha_{8.4}^{31}=-0.28+-0.09. the sed inhomogeneityobserved in vela x suggests different excitation processes between the pwn andthe filaments. we investigate whether the pwn's flat spectrum is a consequenceof variability or truly reflects the sed of the object. the peak of the pwn at31 ghz is 80''+-20'' south-west of the peak at 8.4 ghz. this shift is confirmedby comparing the 31 ghz cbi image with higher resolution 5 ghz australiatelescope compact array observations, and is likely to be due to sed variationswithin the pwn. we also investigate the nature of the vela x filamentarystructure.

astro-ph;0702611	cbi limits on 31 ghz excess emission in southern hii regions	we have mapped four regions of the southern galactic plane at 31 ghz with thecosmic background imager. from the maps, we have extracted the flux densitiesfor six of the brightest \hii regions in the southern sky and compared themwith multi-frequency data from the literature. the fitted spectral index foreach source was found to be close to the theoretical value expected foroptically thin free-free emission, thus confirming that the majority of flux at31 ghz is due to free-free emission from ionised gas with an electrontemperature of $\approx 7000-8000$ k.  we also found that, for all six sources, the 31 ghz flux density was slightlyhigher than the predicted value from data in the literature. this excessemission could be due to spinning dust or another emission mechanism.comparisons with $100 \mu$m data indicate an average dust emissivity of$3.3\pm1.7 \mu$k (mjy/sr)$^{-1}$, or a 95 per cent confidence limit of $&lt;6.1\mu$k (mjy/sr)$^{-1}$. this is lower than that found in diffuse clouds at highgalactic latitudes by a factor of $\sim 3-4$. the most significant detection($3.3\sigma$) was found in $g284.3-0.3$ (rcw49) and may account for up to$\approx 30$ per cent of the total flux density observed at 31 ghz. here, thedust emissivity of the excess emission is $13.6\pm4.2 \mu$k (mjy/sr)$^{-1}$ andis within the range observed at high galactic latitudes.  low level polarised emission was observed in all six sources withpolarisation fractions in the range $0.3-0.6$ per cent. this is likely to bemainly due to instrumental leakage and is therefore upper an upper limit to thefree-free polarisation. it corresponds to an upper limit of $\sim1$ per centfor the polarisation of anomalous emission.
