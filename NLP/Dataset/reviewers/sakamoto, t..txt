0812.4780	jet breaks and energetics of swift grb x-ray afterglows	we present a systematic temporal and spectral study of all swift-xrtobservations of grb afterglows discovered between 2005 january and 2007december. after constructing and fitting all light curves and spectra topower-law models, we classify the components of each afterglow in terms of thecanonical x-ray afterglow and test them against the closure relations of theforward shock models for a variety of parameter combinations. the closurerelations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristicsincluding the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energyinjection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range ofparameters. with this technique, we survey the x-ray afterglows with strongevidence for jet breaks (~12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jetbreaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another ~30%),leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. those x-ray light curvesthat do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of thejet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. thedistribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with amedian of ~1 day, similar to what was found pre-swift. on average swift grbshave lower isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energies, which in turn results inlower collimation corrected gamma-ray energies than those of pre-swift grbs.finally, we explore the implications for grb jet geometry and energetics.

0901.3453	suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr 0501+4516 in  outburst	we present the first suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501+4516, performed on 2008 august 26, four days after the onset of burstingactivity of this new member of the magnetar family. the soft x-ray persistentemission was detected with the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) at a 0.5-10 kevflux of 3.8e-11 erg/s/cm2, with a spectrum well fitted by an absorbed blackbodyplus power-law model. the source pulsation was confirmed at a period of5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 x-ray bursts were detected by the xis, four ofwhich were also detected at higher energies by the hard x-ray detector (hxd).the strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (utc), was so bright that itcaused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 kev range, with a fluence of~2.1e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak intensity of about 89 crab. the entire burst fluenceis estimated to be ~50 times higher. the precursor spectrum was very hard, andwell modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. we discuss the burstingactivity and x/gamma-ray properties of this newly discovered soft gammarepeater in comparison with other members of the class.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0908.1335	testing the epeak - eiso relation for grbs detected by swift and  suzaku-wam	one of the most prominent, yet controversial associations derived from theensemble of prompt-phase observations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is theapparent correlation in the source frame between the peak energy epeak) of thenu-f(nu) spectrum and the isotropic radiated energy, eiso. since most gamma-raybursts (grbs) have epeak above the energy range (15-150 kev) of the burst alerttelescope (bat) on swift, determining accurate epeak values for large numbersof swift bursts has been difficult. however, by combining data from swift/batand the suzaku wide-band all-sky monitor (wam), which covers the energy rangefrom 50-5000 kev, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one canaccurately fit epeak and eiso and test the relationship between them for theswift sample. between the launch of suzaku in july 2005 and the end of april2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) which triggered both swift/bat andwam and an additional 48 bursts which triggered swift and were detected by wam,but did not trigger. a bat-wam team has cross-calibrated the two instrumentsusing grbs, and we are now able to perform joint fits on these bursts todetermine their spectral parameters. for those bursts with spectroscopicredshifts, we can also calculate the isotropic energy. here we present theresults of joint swift/bat-suzaku/wam spectral fits for 91 of the burstsdetected by the two instruments. we show that the distribution of spectral fitparameters is consistent with distributions from earlier missions and confirmthat swift bursts are consistent with earlier reported relationships betweenepeak and isotropic energy. we show through time-resolved spectroscopy thatindividual burst pulses are also consistent with this relationship.

0908.2370	spectral lags and the lag-luminosity relation: an investigation with  swift bat gamma-ray bursts	spectral lag, the time difference between the arrival of high-energy andlow-energy photons, is a common feature in gamma-ray bursts (grbs). norris etal. 2000 reported a correlation between the spectral lag and the isotropic peakluminosity of grbs based on a limited sample. more recently, a number ofauthors have provided further support for this correlation using arbitraryenergy bands of various instruments. in this paper we report on a systematicextraction of spectral lags based on the largest swift sample to date of 31grbs with measured redshifts. we extracted the spectral lags for allcombinations of the standard swift hard x-ray energy bands: 15-25 kev, 25-50kev, 50-100 kev and 100-200 kev and plotted the time dilation corrected lag asa function of isotropic peak luminosity. the mean value of the correlationcoefficient for various channel combinations is -0.68 with a chance probabilityof ~ 0.7 x 10^{-3}. in addition, the mean value of the power-law index is 1.4+/- 0.3. hence, our study lends support for the existence of a lag-luminositycorrelation, albeit with large scatter.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1003.3717	"dark" grb 080325 in a dusty massive galaxy at z ~ 2	we present optical and near infrared observations of grb 080325 classified asa "dark grb". near-infrared observations with subaru/moircs provided a cleardetection of afterglow in ks band, although no optical counterpart wasreported. the flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to x-ray bands of theafterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to theafterglow is av = 2.7 - 10 mag. this large extinction is probably the majorreason for optical faintness of grb 080325. the j - ks color of the hostgalaxy, (j - ks = 1.3 in ab magnitude), is significantly redder than those fortypical grb hosts previously identified. in addition to j and ks bands, opticalimages in b, rc, i', and z' bands with subaru/suprime-cam were obtained atabout one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host isestimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. the host luminosity is comparable to l^{*} atz \sim 2 in contrast to the sub-l^{*} property of typical grb hosts at lowerredshifts. the best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host showsthat a large dust extinction (av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of thehost and that the host galaxy is massive (m_{*} = 7.0 \times 10^{10} msun)which is one of the most massive grb hosts previously identified. by assumingthat the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \sim 2 isapplicable for the grb host, this large stellar mass suggests the highmetallicity environment around grb 080325, consistent with inferred largeextinction.

1011.1300	goddard robotic telescope - optical follow-up of grbs and coordinated  observations of agns -	since it is not possible to predict when a gamma-ray burst (grb) will occuror when active galactic nucleus (agn) flaring activity starts,follow-up/monitoring ground telescopes must be located as uniformly as possibleall over the world in order to collect data simultaneously with fermi and swiftdetections. however, there is a distinct gap in follow-up coverage oftelescopes in the eastern u.s. region based on the operations of swift.motivated by this fact, we have constructed a 14" fully automated opticalrobotic telescope, goddard robotic telescope (grt), at the goddard geophysicaland astronomical observatory. the aims of our robotic telescope are 1) tofollow-up swift/fermi grbs and 2) to perform the coordinated opticalobservations of fermi large area telescope (lat) agn. our telescope systemconsists of off-the-shelf hardware. with the focal reducer, we are able tomatch the field of view of swift narrow instruments (20' x 20'). we startedscientific observations in mid-november 2008 and grt has been fully remotelyoperated since august 2009. the 3 sigma upper limit in a 30-second exposure inthe r filter is ~15.4 mag; however, we can reach to ~18 mag in a 600-secondexposures. due to the weather condition at the telescope site, our observingefficiency is 30-40% on average.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1107.1876	panchromatic observations of sn 2011dh point to a compact progenitor  star	we report the discovery and detailed monitoring of x-ray emission associatedwith the type iib sn 2011dh using data from the swift and chandra satellites,placing it among the best studied x-ray supernovae to date. we further presentmillimeter and radio data obtained with the sma, carma, and evla during thefirst three weeks after explosion. combining these observations with earlyoptical photometry, we show that the panchromatic dataset is well-described bynon-thermal synchrotron emission (radio/mm) with inverse compton scattering(x-ray) of a thermal population of optical photons. in this scenario, the shockpartition fractions deviate from equipartition by a factor, (e_e/e_b) ~ 30. wederive the properties of the shockwave and the circumstellar environment andfind a shock velocity, v~0.1c, and a progenitor mass loss rate of ~6e-5m_sun/yr. these properties are consistent with the sub-class of type iib snecharacterized by compact progenitors (type ciib) and dissimilar from those withextended progenitors (type eiib). furthermore, we consider the early opticalemission in the context of a cooling envelope model to estimate a progenitorradius of ~1e+11 cm, in line with the expectations for a type ciib sn.together, these diagnostics are difficult to reconcile with the extended radiusof the putative yellow supergiant progenitor star identified in archival hstobservations, unless the stellar density profile is unusual. finally, wesearched for the high energy shock breakout pulse using x-ray and gamma-rayobservations obtained during the purported explosion date range. based on thecompact radius of the progenitor, we estimate that the breakout pulse wasdetectable with current instruments but likely missed due to their limitedtemporal/spatial coverage.

1108.4491	kinematics of red variables in the solar neighborhood i. basic data  obtained by an sio maser survey	in order to study the streaming motions of miras in the solar neighborhood,we newly surveyed 379 red variables in the sio maser lines at 42.821 and 43.122ghz with the nobeyama 45m radio telescope. accurate radial velocities wereobtained for 229 (220 new) detected stars. the sample is selected from opticalvariables found by new automated surveys: the northern sky variability surveyand the all sky automated survey. the new sample consists of the "bluer"objects compared with those observed in the previous sio surveys. the distancesto the objects are estimated using the period-luminosity relation, and they aremostly less than 3 kpc from the sun. the longitude-velocity diagram revealsthree prominent groups of stars deviant from the circular galactic rotationwith a flat rotation curve. in addition to the hercules group of stars whichwas studied before, we found two new deviant groups: one toward the perseus armand the other toward the sagittarius arm. these two groups both exhibitanomalous motions toward the galactic center, which seem to be consistent withthe noncircular motions of these spiral arms found in the recent vlbiproper-motion measurements for maser gas clumps.

1111.0283	panchromatic observations of the textbook grb 110205a: constraining  physical mechanisms of prompt emission and afterglow	we present a comprehensive analysis of a bright, long duration (t90 ~ 257 s)grb 110205a at redshift z= 2.22. the optical prompt emission was detected byswift/uvot, rotse-iiib and bootes telescopes when the grb was still radiatingin the gamma-ray band. nearly 200 s of observations were obtainedsimultaneously from optical, x-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of theexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. by fitting thetime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, aninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard grbsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. although the promptoptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit x/gamma-rayspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation tothe prompt high energy emission. the synchrotron + ssc scenario is disfavoredby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having twoemission regions can interpret the data well. shortly after prompt emission (~1100 s), a bright (r = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.it is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component hasbeen closely observed. the full optical and x-ray afterglow lightcurves can beinterpreted within the standard reverse shock (rs) + forward shock (fs) model.in general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us toapply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information aboutthe grb including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission r, initiallorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as thecollimation angle and the total energy budget.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1211.0276	discovery of x-ray emission in the old classical nova dk lacertae	we report the discovery of x-ray emission at the position of the oldclassical nova dk lacertae using the swift satellite. three observations wereconducted using the x-ray telescope 62 years after the discovery of the nova,yielding 46 source signals in an exposure time of 4.8 ks. abackground-subtracted count rate was 9+/-2x10^{-3} counts s^{-1}, correspondingto a detection significance level of 5-sigma. the x-ray spectrum wascharacterized by a continuum extending up to about 7 kev, which can be modeledby a power-law component with a photon index of 1.4--5.6, or by a thermalbremsstrahlung component with a temperature of 0.7--13.3 kev, convolved withinterstellar absorption with an equivalent hydrogen column density of0.3--2.4x10^{22} cm^{-2}. assuming a distance of 3900 pc to the source, theluminosity was 10^{32}--10^{34} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.3--10 kev energy band. theorigin of x-rays is considered to be either mass accretion on the white dwarfor adiabatic shocks in nova ejecta, with the former appearing much more likely.in either case, dk lacertae represents a rare addition to the exclusive club ofx-ray emitting old novae.

0801.4319	global properties of x-ray flashes and x-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts  observed by swift	we describe and discuss the spectral and temporal characteristics of theprompt emission and x-ray afterglow emission of x-ray flashes (xrfs) andx-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts (xrrs) detected and observed by swift betweendecember 2004 and september 2006. we compare these characteristics to a sampleof conventional classical gamma-ray bursts (c-grbs) observed during the sameperiod. we confirm the correlation between epeak_obs and fluence noted byothers and find further evidence that xrfs, xrrs and c-grbs form a continuum.we also confirm that our known redshift sample is consistent with thecorrelation between the peak energy in the grb rest frame (epeak_src) and theisotropic radiated energy (eiso), so called the epeak_src-eiso relation. thespectral properties of x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs are similar, but thetemporal properties of xrfs and c-grbs are quite different. we found that thelight curves of c-grb afterglows show a break to steeper indices(shallow-to-steep break) at much earlier times than do xrf afterglows.moreover, the overall luminosity of xrf x-ray afterglows is systematicallysmaller by a factor of two or more compared to that of c-grbs. these distinctdifferences between the x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs may be the key tounderstanding not only the mysterious shallow-to-steep break in x-ray afterglowlight curves, but also the unique nature of xrfs.

1310.1175	extraordinary luminous soft x-ray transient maxi j0158-744 as an  ignition of a nova on a very massive o-ne white dwarf	we present the observation of an extraordinary luminous soft x-ray transient,maxi j0158-744, by the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) on 2011 november11. this transient is characterized by a soft x-ray spectrum, a short duration(1.3 x 10^3 s &lt; \delta t_d &lt; 1.10 x 10^4 s), a very rapid rise (&lt; 5.5 x 10^3s), and a huge peak luminosity of 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1 in 0.7-7.0 kev band. withswift observations and optical spectroscopy from the small and moderateaperture research telescope system (smarts), we confirmed that the transient isa nova explosion, on a white dwarf in a binary with a be star, located near thesmall magellanic cloud. an extremely early turn-on of the super-soft x-raysource (sss) phase (&lt; 0.44 d), the short sss phase duration of about one month,and a 0.92 kev neon emission line found in the third maxi scan, 1296 s afterthe first detection, suggest that the explosion involves a small amount ofejecta and is produced on an unusually massive o-ne white dwarf close to, orpossibly over, the chandrasekhar limit. we propose that the huge luminositydetected with maxi was due to the fireball phase, a direct manifestation of theignition of the thermonuclear runaway process in a nova explosion.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

astro-ph;0309455	hete-2 observations of the extremely soft x-ray flash xrf 020903	we report hete-2 wxm/fregate observations of the x-ray flash, xrf 020903.this event was extremely soft: the ratio log(s_x/s_gamma) = 0.7, where s_x ands_gamma are the fluences in the 2-30 and 30-400 kev energy bands, is the mostextreme value observed so far by hete-2. in addition, the spectrum has anobserved peak energy e^{obs}_{peak} &lt; 5.0 kev (99.7 % probability upper limit)and no photons were detected above ~10 kev. the burst is shorter at higherenergies, which is similar to the behavior of long grbs. we consider thepossibility that the burst lies at very high redshift and that the low value ofe^{obs}_{peak} is due to the cosmological redshift, and show that this is veryunlikely. we find that the properties of xrf 020903 are consistent with therelation between the fluences s(7-30 kev) and s(30-400 kev) found by barraud etal. for grbs and x-ray-rich grbs, and are consistent with the extension by adecade of the hardness-intensity correlation (mallozzi et al. 1995) found bythe same authors. assuming that xrf 020903 lies at a redshift z = 0.25 asimplied by the host galaxy of the candidate optical and radio afterglows ofthis burst, we find that the properties of xrf 020903 are consistent with anextension by a factor ~300 of the relation between the isotropic-equivalentenergy e_iso and the peak e_peak of the nu f_nu spectrum (in the source frameof the burst) found by amati et al. for grbs. the results presented in thispaper therefore provide evidence that xrfs, x-ray-rich grbs, and grbs form acontinuum and are a single phenomenon. the results also impose strongconstraints on models of xrfs and x-ray-rich grbs.

0808.3391	correlations of prompt and afterglow emission in swift long and short  gamma ray bursts	correlation studies of prompt and afterglow emissions from gamma-ray bursts(grbs) between different spectral bands has been difficult to do in the pastbecause few bursts had comprehensive and intercomparable afterglowmeasurements. in this paper we present a large and uniform data set forcorrelation analysis based on bursts detected by the swift mission. for thefirst time, short and long bursts can be analyzed and compared. it is found forboth classes that the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray emissions are linearlycorrelated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger burststend to have brighter afterglows, and bursts with brighter x-ray afterglow tendto have brighter optical afterglow. short bursts are, on average, weaker inboth prompt and afterglow emissions. no short bursts are seen with extremelylow optical to x-ray ratio as occurs for "dark" long bursts. althoughstatistics are still poor for short bursts, there is no evidence yet for asubgroup of short bursts with high extinction as there is for long bursts. longbursts are detected in the dark category at the same fraction as for pre-swiftbursts. interesting cases are discovered of long bursts that are detected inthe optical, and yet have low enough optical to x-ray ratio to be classified asdark. for the prompt emission, short and long bursts have different averagetracks on flux vs fluence plots. in swift, grb detections tend to be fluencelimited for short bursts and flux limited for long events.

astro-ph;0312498	evidence from hete-2 for grb evolution with redshift	after taking into account threshold effects, we find that theisotropic-equivalent energies e_iso and luminosities l_iso of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) are correlated with redshift at the 5% and 0.9% signficance levels,respectively. our results are based on 10 bepposax grbs and 11 hete-2 grbs withknown redshifts. our results suggest that the isotropic-equivalent energies andluminosities of grbs increase with redshift. they strengthen earlier clues tothis effect from analyses of the batse catalog of grbs, using the variabilityof burst time histories as an estimator of burst luminosities (and thereforeredshifts), and from an analysis of bepposax bursts only. if theisotropic-equivalent energies and luminosities of grbs really do increase withredshift, it suggests that grb jets at high redshifts may be narrower and thusthe cores of grb progenitor stars at high redshifts may be rotating morerapidly. it also suggests that grbs at very high redshifts may be more luminous-- and therefore easier to detect -- than has been thought, which would makegrbs a more powerful probe of cosmology and the early universe than has beenthought.

(2002), a redshift of z=0.38+0.36/-0.18can be determined, in agreement with constraints determined from opticalobservations. we are able to fit the x-ray afterglow spectrum and to measureits temporal fade. although the best-fit fade is shallower than the concurrentfade in the optical, the spectral similarity between the two bands indicatesthat the x-ray fade may actually trace the optical fade. if this is the case,the late time rebrightening observed in the optical cannot be due to asupernova bump. we interpret the prompt and afterglow x-ray emission as arisingfrom a jetted grb observed off-axis and possibly viewed through a complexcircumburst medium due to a progenitor wind.

astro-ph;0503521	a link between prompt optical and prompt gamma-ray emission in gamma-ray  bursts	the prompt optical emission that arrives with gamma-rays from a cosmicgamma-ray burst (grb) is a signature of the engine powering the burst, theproperties of the ultra-relativistic ejecta of the explosion, and the ejecta'sinteractions with the surroundings. until now, only grb 990123 had beendetected at optical wavelengths during the burst phase. its prompt opticalemission was variable and uncorrelated with the prompt gamma-ray emission,suggesting that the optical emission was generated by a reverse shock arisingfrom the ejecta's collision with the surrounding material. here we reportprompt optical emission from grb 041219a. it is variable and correlated withthe prompt gamma-rays, indicating a common origin for the optical light and thegamma-rays. within the context of the standard fireball model of grbs, weattribute this new optical component to internal shocks driven into the burstejecta by variations of the inner engine. the correlated optical emission is adirect probe of the jet isolated from the medium. the timing of theuncorrelated optical emission is strongly dependent on the nature of themedium.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0602497	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments. indeed, swift-bat triggered on aprecursor ~570s before the main burst peak, and this allowed swift to repointthe narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350s before the main burstoccurred. grb 060124 also triggered konus-wind, which observed the promptemission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2mev). thanks to these exceptionalcircumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission canbe studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges. while the x-ray emission(0.2-10kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows adifferent pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset ofexternal shocks. the prompt grb spectrum shows significant spectral evolution,with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. as observed inseveral long grbs, significant lags are measured between the hard- andlow-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades inenergy. the grb peaks are also much broader at soft energies. this is relatedto the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assumingthat the electron spectral index softened with time. the burst energy(e_iso~5x10^{53} erg) and average peak energy (e_p~300kev) make grb 060124consistent with the amati relation. the x-ray afterglow is characterized by adecay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0605472	energy input and response from prompt and early optical afterglow  emission in gamma-ray bursts	the taxonomy of optical emission detected during the critical first fewminutes after the onset of a gamma-ray burst (grb) defines two broad classes:prompt optical emission correlated with prompt gamma-ray emission, and earlyoptical afterglow emission uncorrelated with the gamma-ray emission. thestandard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission to internalshocks in the ultra-relativistic outflow generated by the internal engine;early afterglow emission is attributed to shocks generated by interaction withthe surrounding medium. here we report on observations of a bright grb that,for the first time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relativestrength of the two optical components. the observations indicate that earlyafterglow emission can be understood as reverberation of the energy inputmeasured by prompt emission. measurements of the early afterglow reverberationstherefore probe the structure of the environment around the burst, whereas thesubsequent response to late-time impulsive energy releases reveals how earlierflaring episodes have altered the jet and environment parameters. many grbs aregenerated by the death of massive stars that were born and died before theuniverse was ten per cent of its current age, so grb afterglow reverberationsprovide clues about the environments around some of the first stars.

astro-ph;0605516	grb 060121: implications of a short/intermediate duration gamma-ray  burst at high redshift	since the discovery of the first short-hard gamma-ray burst afterglows in2005, the handful of observed events have been found to be embedded in nearby(z &lt; 1), bright underlying galaxies. we present multiwavelength observations ofthe short-duration burst grb 060121, which is the first observed to clearlyoutshine its host galaxy (by a factor &gt;10^2). a photometric redshift for thisevent places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a lessprobable scenario of z = 1.7. in either case, grb 060121 could be thefarthermost short-duration grb detected to date and implies anisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays comparable to that seen inlong-duration bursts. we discuss the implications of the released energy on thenature of the progenitor. these results suggest that grb 060121 may belong to afamily of energetic short-duration events, lying at z &gt; 1 and whose opticalafterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short-durationgrbs observed in 2005. the possibility of grb 060121 being an intermediateduration burst is also discussed.

astro-ph;0605570	hete-2 localizations and observations of four short gamma-ray bursts:  grbs 010326b, 040802, 051211 and 060121	here we report the localizations and properties of four short-duration grbslocalized by the high energy transient explorer 2 satellite (hete-2): grbs010326b, 040802, 051211 and 060121, all of which were detected by the frenchgamma telescope (fregate) and localized with the wide-field x-ray monitor (wxm)and/or soft x-ray camera (sxc) instruments. we discuss eight possible criteriafor determining whether these grbs are "short population bursts" (spbs) or"long population bursts" (lpbs). these criteria are (1) duration, (2) pulsewidths, (3) spectral hardness, (4) spectral lag, (5) energy egamma radiated ingamma rays (or equivalently, the kinetic energy e_ke of the grb jet), (6)existence of a long, soft bump following the burst, (7) location of the burstin the host galaxy, and (8) type of host galaxy. in particular, we havedeveloped a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst isan spb or a lpb on the basis of its t90 duration alone. a striking feature ofthe resulting probability distribution is that the t90 duration at which aburst has an equal probability of being a spb or a lpb is t90 = 5 s, not t90 =2 s, as is often used. all four short-duration bursts discussed in detail inthis paper have t90 durations in the fregate 30-400 kev energy band of 1.90,2.31, 4.25, and 1.97 sec, respectively, yielding probabilities p(s|t90) = 0.97,0.91, 0.60, and 0.95 that these bursts are spbs on the basis of their t90durations alone. all four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero.these results provide strong evidence that all four grbs are spbs (abstractcontinues).

astro-ph;0610157	x-ray flashes or soft gamma-ray bursts? the case of the likely distant  xrf 040912	in this work, we present a multi-wavelength study of xrf 040912, aimed atmeasuring its distance scale and the intrinsic burst properties. we performed adetailed spectral and temporal analysis of both the prompt and the afterglowemission and we estimated the distance scale of the likely host galaxy. we thenused the currently available sample of xrfs with known distance to discuss theconnection between xrfs and classical gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we found thatthe prompt emission properties unambiguously identify this burst as an xrf,with an observed peak energy of e_p=17+/-13 kev and a burst fluence ratios(2-30kev)/s(30-400kev)&gt;1. a non-fading optical source with r~24 mag and withan apparently extended morphology is spatially consistent with the x-rayafterglow, likely the host galaxy. xrf 040912 is a very dark burst since noafterglow optical counterpart is detected down to r&gt;25 mag (3 sigma limitingmagnitude) at 13.6 hours after the burst. the host galaxy spectrum detectedfrom 3800a to 10000a, shows a single emission line at 9552a. the lack of anyother strong emission lines blue-ward of the detected one and the absence ofthe ly alpha cut-off down to 3800a are consistent with the hypothesis of the[oii] line at redshift z=1.563+/-0.001. the intrinsic spectral properties rankthis xrf among the soft grbs in the e_peak-e_iso diagram. similar results wereobtained for most xrfs at known redshift. only xrf 060218 and xrf 020903represent a good example of instrinsic xrf(i-xrf) and are possibly associatedwith a different progenitor population. this scenario may calls for a newdefinition of xrfs.

astro-ph;0610570	swift observations of grb050904: the most distant cosmic explosion ever  observed	swift discovered the high redshift (z=6.29) grb050904 with the burst alerttelescope (bat) and began observing with its narrow field instruments 161 safter the burst onset. this gamma-ray burst is the most distant cosmicexplosion ever observed. because of its high redshift, the x-ray telescope(xrt) and bat simultaneous observations provide 4 orders of magnitude ofspectral coverage (0.2-150 kev; 1.4-1090 kev in the source rest frame) at avery early source-frame time (22 s). grb050904 was a long, multi-peaked, brightgrb with strong variability during its entire evolution. the light curveobserved by the xrt is characterized by the presence of a long flaring activitylasting up to 1-2 hours after the burst onset in the burst rest frame, with noevidence of a smooth power-law decay following the prompt emission as seen inother grbs. however, the bat tail extrapolated to the xrt band joins the xrtearly light curve and the overall behavior resembles that of a very long grbprompt. the spectral energy distribution softens with time, with the photonindex decreasing from -1.2 during the bat observation to -1.9 at the end of thexrt observation. the dips of the late x-ray flares may be consistent with anunderlying x-ray emission arising from the forward shock and with theproperties of the optical afterglow reported by tagliaferri et al. (2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.

astro-ph;0610635	swift detects a remarkable gamma-ray burst, grb 060614, that introduces  a new classification scheme	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are known to come in two duration classes, separatedat ~2 s. long bursts originate from star forming regions in galaxies, haveaccompanying supernovae (sne) when near enough to observe and are likely causedby massive-star collapsars. recent observations show that short burstsoriginate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation ratesconsistent with binary neutron star (ns) or ns - black hole (bh) mergers.moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no sne havebeen so far associated with short grbs. we report here on the bright, nearbygrb 060614 that does not fit in either class. its ~102 s duration groups itwith long grbs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely withinthe short grb subclass. moreover, very deep optical observations exclude anaccompanying supernova, similar to short grbs. this combination of a longduration event without accompanying sn poses a challenge to both a collapsarand merging ns interpretation and opens the door on a new grb classificationscheme that straddles both long and short bursts.

astro-ph;0611148	swift discovery of gamma-ray bursts without jet break feature in their  x-ray afterglows	we analyze swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and x-ray afterglows for three grbswith spectroscopic redshift determinations -- grb 050401, xrf 050416a, and grb050525a. we find that the relation between spectral peak energy and isotropicenergy of prompt emissions (the amati relation) is consistent with that for thebursts observed in pre-swift era. however, we find that the x-ray afterglowlightcurves, which extend up to 10-70 days, show no sign of the jet break thatis expected in the standard framework of collimated outflows. we do so byshowing that none of the x-ray afterglow lightcurves in our sample satisfiesthe relation between the spectral and temporal indices that is predicted forthe phase after jet break. the jet break time can be predicted by inverting thetight empirical relation between the peak energy of the spectrum and thecollimation-corrected energy of the prompt emission (the ghirlanda relation).we find that there are no temporal breaks within the predicted time intervalsin x-ray band. this requires either that the ghirlanda relation has a largerscatter than previously thought, that the temporal break in x-rays is masked bysome additional source of x-ray emission, or that it does not happen because ofsome unknown reason.

astro-ph;0611732	the circumburst environment of a fred grb: study of the prompt emission  and x-ray/optical afterglow of grb 051111	we report a multi-wavelength analysis of the prompt emission and earlyafterglow of grb051111 and discuss its properties in the context of currentfireball models. the detection of grb051111 by the burst alert telescopeon-board swift triggered early bvri' observations with the 2-m robotic faulkestelescope north in hawaii, as well as x-ray observations with the swift x-raytelescope. the prompt gamma-ray emission shows a classical fred profile. theoptical afterglow light curves are fitted with a broken power law, withalpha_1=0.35 to alpha_2=1.35 and a break time around 12 minutes after the grb.although contemporaneous x-ray observations were not taken, a power lawconnection between the gamma-ray tail of the fred temporal profile and the latexrt flux decay is feasible. alternatively, if the x-ray afterglow tracks theoptical decay, this would represent one of the first grbs for which thecanonical steep-shallow-normal decay typical of early x-ray afterglows has beenmonitored optically. we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsicextinction, elemental abundances and spectral energy distribution. from theabsorption measured in the low x-ray band we find possible evidence for anoverabundance of some alpha elements such as oxygen, [o/zn]=0.7+/-0.3, or,alternatively, for a significant presence of molecular gas. the ir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution measured at 80 minutes after the burst isconsistent with the cooling break lying between the optical and x-ray bands.extensive modelling of the intrinsic extinction suggests dust with big grainsor grey extinction profiles. the early optical break is due either to an energyinjection episode or, less probably, to a stratified wind environment for thecircumburst medium.

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.

0811.3401	epeak estimator for gamma-ray bursts observed by the swift burst alert  telescope	we report a correlation based on a spectral simulation study of the promptemission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the swift burst alerttelescope (bat). the correlation is between the epeak energy, which is the peakenergy in the \nu f_\nu spectrum, and the photon index (\gamma) derived from asimple power-law model. the epeak - \gamma relation, assuming the typicalsmoothly broken power-law spectrum of grbs, is \log epeak = 3.258 - 0.829\gamma(1.3 &lt; \gamma &lt; 2.3). we take into account not only a range of epeak energiesand fluences, but also distributions for both the low-energy photon index andthe high-energy photon index in the smoothly broken power-law model. thedistribution of burst durations in the bat grb sample is also included in thesimulation. our correlation is consistent with the index observed by bat andepeak measured by the bat, and by other grb instruments. since about 85% ofgrbs observed by the bat are acceptably fit with the simple power-law modelbecause of the relatively narrow energy range of the bat, this relationship canbe used to estimate epeak when it is located within the bat energy range.
