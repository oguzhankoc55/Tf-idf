0901.3372	cosmic evolution of radio selected active galactic nuclei in the cosmos  field	we explore the cosmic evolution of radio agn with low radio powers (l_1.4ghz&lt; 5\times10^25 w/hz) out to z=1.3 using to-date the largest sample of ~600 lowluminosity radio agn at intermediate redshift drawn from the vla-cosmos survey.we derive the radio luminosity function for these agn, and its evolution withcosmic time assuming two extreme cases: i) pure luminosity and ii) pure densityevolution. the former and latter yield l_*\propto(1+z)^(0.8+/-0.1), andphi*\propto (1+z)^(1.1+/-0.1), respectively, both implying a fairly modestchange in properties of low radio-power agn since z=1.3. we show that this isin stark contrast with the evolution of powerful (l_1.4ghz &gt; 5\times10^25 w/hz)radio agn over the same cosmic time interval, constrained using the 3crr, 6ce,and 7crs radio surveys by willott et al. (2001). we demonstrate that this canbe explained through differences in black hole fueling and triggeringmechanisms, and a dichotomy in host galaxy properties of weak and powerful agn.our findings suggest that high and low radio-power agn activity is triggered indifferent stages during the formation of massive red galaxies. we show thatweak radio agn occur in the most massive galaxies already at z~1, and they maysignificantly contribute to the heating of their surrounding medium and thusinhibit gas accretion onto their host galaxies, as recently suggested for the`radio mode' in cosmological models.

0902.0625	designing future dark energy space mission: i. building realistic galaxy  spectro-photometric catalogs and their first applications	future dark energy space missions such as jdem and euclid are being designedto survey the galaxy population to trace the geometry of the universe and thegrowth of structure, which both depend on the cosmological model. to reach thegoal of high precision cosmology they need to evaluate the capabilities ofdifferent instrument designs based on realistic mock catalog. the aim of thispaper is to construct realistic and flexible mock catalogs based on ourknowledge of galaxy population from current deep surveys. we explore twocategories of mock catalog : (i) based on luminosity functions fit ofobservations (goods, udf,cosmos,vvds) using the le phare software (ii) based onthe observed cosmos galaxy distribution which benefits from all the propertiesof the data-rich cosmos survey. for these two catalogs, we have producedsimulated number counts in several bands, color diagrams and redshiftdistribution for validation against real observational data. we also derivesome basic requirements to help designing future dark energy mission in termsof number of galaxies available for the weak-lensing analysis as a function ofthe psf size and depth of the survey. we also compute the spectroscopic successrate for future spectroscopic redshift surveys (i) aiming at measuring bao inthe case of the wide field spectroscopic redshift survey, and (ii) for thephotometric redshift calibration survey which is required to achieve weaklensing tomography with great accuracy. they will be publicly accessible athttp://lamwws.oamp.fr/cosmowiki/realisticspectrophotcat, or by request to thefirst author of this paper.

0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0905.1674	star formation and dust obscuration at z~2: galaxies at the dawn of  downsizing	we present first results of a study aimed to constrain the star formationrate and dust content of galaxies at z~2. we use a sample of bzk-selectedstar-forming galaxies, drawn from the cosmos survey, to perform a stackinganalysis of their 1.4 ghz radio continuum as a function of different stellarpopulation properties, after removing agn contaminants from the sample. dustunbiased star formation rates are derived from radio fluxes assuming the localradio-ir correlation. the main results of this work are: i) specific starformation rates are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to thehighest stellar mass probed; ii) the dust attenuation is a strong function ofgalaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lowermass objects; iii) a single value of the uv extinction applied to all galaxieswould lead to grossly underestimate the sfr in massive galaxies; iv) correctingthe observed uv luminosities for dust attenuation based on the calzetti recipeprovide results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones; v) the meanspecific star formation rate of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of ~4with decreasing redshift from z=2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of ~40 down the localuniverse.  these empirical sfrs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass ifmaintained all the way to low redshifts, we suggest that this does not happenbecause star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the mostmassive galaxies.

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0907.1656	dynamically driven evolution of the interstellar medium in m51	we report the highest-fidelity observations of the spiral galaxy m51 in coemission, revealing the evolution of giant molecular clouds (gmcs) vis-a-visthe large-scale galactic structure and dynamics. the most massive gmcs(so-called gmas) are first assembled and then broken up as the gas flow throughthe spiral arms. the gmas and their h2 molecules are not fully dissociated intoatomic gas as predicted in stellar feedback scenarios, but are fragmented intosmaller gmcs upon leaving the spiral arms. the remnants of gmas are detected asthe chains of gmcs that emerge from the spiral arms into interarm regions. thekinematic shear within the spiral arms is sufficient to unbind the gmas againstself-gravity. we conclude that the evolution of gmcs is driven by large-scalegalactic dynamics --their coagulation into gmas is due to spiral arm streamingmotions upon entering the arms, followed by fragmentation due to shear as theyleave the arms on the downstream side. in m51, the majority of the gas remainsmolecular from arm entry through the inter-arm region and into the next spiralarm passage.

0907.5416	zcosmos - 10k-bright spectroscopic sample. the bimodality in the galaxy  stellar mass function: exploring its evolution with redshift	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) up to z~1 from thezcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. we investigate the total mf and thecontribution of etgs and ltgs, defined by different criteria (sed, morphologyor star formation). we unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global mf, betterrepresented by 2 schechter functions dominated by etgs and ltgs, respectively.for the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number densityincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. we find that the mfevolution at intermediate-low values of mstar (logm&lt;10.6) is mostly explainedby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formationactivities. the low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger pergalaxy per gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). we find that etgs increasein number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing mstar, with a median"building redshift" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.for ltgs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remainsalmost constant from z~1. instead, the most extreme population of active starforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. we suggest atransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into bluequiescent and successively (1-2 gyr after) into red passive types. the completemorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scalesor follows after 1-2 gyr. a continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expectedby low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. we estimate that on average~25% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per gyr for logm&lt;11. we concludethat the build-up of galaxies and etgs follows the same downsizing trend withmass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted bycurrent sams. we expect a negligible evolution of the global galaxy baryonicmf.

0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0909.1968	k+a galaxies in the zcosmos survey: physical properties of systems in  their post-starburst phase	the identities of the main processes triggering and quenching star-formationin galaxies remain unclear. a key stage in evolution, however, appears to berepresented by post-starburst galaxies. to investigate their impact on galaxyevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectralfeatures in the cosmos field. we examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxiesat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zcosmos sample. k+a galaxies occupy thebrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. they are as massive as quiescentgalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (orstellar mass) distribution. a small percentage (&lt;8%) of these galaxies haveradio and/or x-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the sfr of~8msun/yr). over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxiesis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence ofbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. this distribution does not vary with thestrength of the hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a wayreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. although k+a galaxiesare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in asimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of~2-8mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratiosimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. with the current data set, we do notfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/massdensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the localvalues, or the spectral properties. those galaxies, which are affected by asudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellarmass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0910.5219	a weak lensing study of x-ray groups in the cosmos survey: form and  evolution of the mass-luminosity relation	measurements of x-ray scaling laws are critical for improving cosmologicalconstraints derived with the halo mass function and for understanding thephysical processes that govern the heating and cooling of the intraclustermedium. in this paper, we use a sample of 206 x-ray selected galaxy groups toinvestigate the scaling relation between x-ray luminosity (lx) and halo mass(m00) where m200 is derived via stacked weak gravitational lensing. this workdraws upon a broad array of multi-wavelength cosmos observations including 1.64square degrees of contiguous imaging with the advanced camera for surveys (acs)and deep xmm-newton/chandra imaging. the combined depth of these two data-setsallows us to probe the lensing signals of x-ray detected structures at bothhigher redshifts and lower masses than previously explored. weak lensingprofiles and halo masses are derived for nine sub-samples, narrowly binned inluminosity and redshift. the cosmos data alone are well fit by a power law,m200 ~ lx^a, with a slope of a=0.66+-0.14. these results significantly extendthe dynamic range for which the halo masses of x-ray selected structures havebeen measured with weak gravitational lensing. as a result, tight constraintsare obtained for the slope of the m-lx relation. the combination of our groupdata with previously published cluster data demonstrates that the m-lx relationis well described by a single power law, a=0.64+-0.03, over two decades inmass, 10^13.5-10^15.5 h72^-1 msun. these results are inconsistent at the 3.7level with the self-similar prediction of a=0.75. we examine the redshiftdependence of the m-lx relation and find little evidence for evolution beyondthe rate predicted by self-similarity from z ~ 0.25 to z ~ 0.8.

0910.5824	the optical spectra of spitzer 24 micron galaxies in the cosmos field:  ii. faint infrared sources in the zcosmos-bright 10k catalogue	we have used the zcosmos-bright 10k sample to identify 3244 spitzer/mips24-micron-selected galaxies with 0.06&lt; s(24um)&lt; 0.50 mjy and i(ab)&lt;22.5, over1.5 deg^2 of the cosmos field, and studied different spectral properties,depending on redshift. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3, we found that different reddening laws ofcommon use in the literature explain the dust extinction properties of around80% of our infrared (ir) sources, within the error bars. for up to 16% ofobjects, instead, the halpha/hbeta ratios are too high for their ir/uvattenuations, which is probably a consequence of inhomogenous dustdistributions. in only a few of our galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3 the ir emission couldbe mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. besides, theline ratios of ~22% of our galaxies suggest that they might bestar-formation/nuclear-activity composite systems. at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.7, we estimatedgalaxy metallicities for 301 galaxies: at least 12% of them are securely belowthe upper-branch mass-metallicity trend, which is consistent with the localrelation. finally, we performed a combined analysis of the hdeltaequivalent-width versus dn(4000) diagram for 1722 faint and bright 24umgalaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0, spanning two decades in mid-ir luminosity. we foundthat, while secondary bursts of star formation are necessary to explain theposition of the most luminous ir galaxies in that diagram, quiescent,exponentially-declining star formation histories can well reproduce thespectral properties of ~40% of the less luminous sources. our results suggest atransition in the possible modes of star formation at total ir luminositiesl(tir)=(3 +/-2)x10^11 lsun.

0911.0523	properties and environment of radio emitting galaxies in the vla-zcosmos  survey	we investigate the properties and the environment of radio sources withoptical counterpart from the combined vla-cosmos and zcosmos samples. theadvantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopicinformation, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.  by comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectralenergy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide theradio sources in three families, passive agn, non-passive agn and star forminggalaxies. these families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infraredcolor--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the correspondingcontrol samples.  only the passive agn have a significantly different environment distributionfrom their control sample. the fraction of radio-loud passive agn increasesfrom ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than10. this trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hostingthe radio sources. passive agn in overdensities tend to have higher radioluminosities than those in lower density environments. since the black holemass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for lowradio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fueldisponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determinedby the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

0911.1126	the build-up of the hubble sequence in the cosmos field	we use ~8,600 &gt;5e10 msol cosmos galaxies to study how the morphological mixof massive ellipticals, bulge-dominated disks, intermediate-bulge disks,bulge-less disks and irregular galaxies evolves from z=0.2 to z=1. themorphological evolution depends strongly on mass. at m&gt;3e11 msol, no evolutionis detected in the morphological mix: ellipticals dominate since z=1, and thehubble sequence has quantitatively settled down by this epoch. at the 1e11 msolmass scale, little evolution is detected, which can be entirely explained withmajor mergers. most of the morphological evolution from z=1 to z=0.2 takesplace at masses 5e10 - 1e11 msol, where: (i) the fraction of spiralssubstantially drops and the contribution of early-types increases. thisincrease is mostly produced by the growth of bulge-dominated disks, which varytheir contribution from ~10% at z=1 to &gt;30% at z=0.2 (cf. the ellipticalfraction grows from ~15% to ~20%). thus, at these masses, transformations fromlate- to early-types result in disk-less elliptical morphologies with astatistical frequency of only 30% - 40%. otherwise, the processes which areresponsible for the transformations either retain or produce a non-negligibledisk component. (ii) the bulge-less disk galaxies, which contribute ~15% to theintermediate-mass galaxy population at z=1, virtually disappear by z=0.2. themerger rate since z=1 is too low to account for the disappearance of thesemassive bulge-less disks, which most likely grow a bulge via secular evolution.

0912.1077	the rise and fall of passive disk galaxies: morphological evolution  along the red sequence revealed by cosmos	the increasing abundance of passive "red-sequence" galaxies since z=1-2 ismirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidalmorphologies. in this paper, however, we show that in detail the correspondencebetween galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into thephysical origin of this evolution. using the cosmos survey, we study asignificant population of red sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies.these passive disks typically have sa-sb morphological types with large bulges,but they are not confined to dense environments. they represent nearly one-halfof all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses (log mstar &lt; 10)where they are increasingly disk-dominated. as a function of time, theabundance of passive disks with log mstar &lt; 11 increases, but not as fast asred-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. at higher mass, the passivedisk population has declined since z~1, likely because they transform intospheroidals. we estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto thered sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. the origin of passive diskstherefore has broad implications for understanding how star formation shutsdown. because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than theirstar-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explaintheir origin. we explore several more sophisticated explanations, includingenvironmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth duringgas-rich mergers. while previous work has sought to explain color andmorphological transformations with a single process, these observations openthe way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution mayactually proceed through several separate stages.

1001.1736	bars in early- and late-type disks in cosmos	we investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of m&gt; 10^10.5 msun disk galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 in the cosmos field. the fractionof barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific starformation rate (ssfr). at intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun)the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by afactor ~2, than that in late-type disks. this trend is reversed at higherstellar mass (m &gt; 10^11 msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disksbecomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.the bar fractions for galaxies with low and high ssfrs closely follow those ofthe morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,respectively. this indicates a close correspondence between morphology and ssfrin disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. interestingly, the total bar fractionin 10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over theredshift interval explored, while for m &gt; 10^11 msun disks it remains roughlyconstant. this indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphologicaltransformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to thefamiliar hubble sequence that we observe in the local universe, while forintermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limitedsamples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. finally, theevolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on thelarge-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probedwith the available photometric redshifts).

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1004.2120	a z=1.82 analog of local ultra-massive elliptical galaxies	we present observations of a very massive galaxy at z=1.82 which show thatits morphology, size, velocity dispersion and stellar population propertiesthat are fully consistent with those expected for passively evolvingprogenitors of today's giant ellipticals. these findings are based on a deepoptical rest-frame spectrum obtained with the multi-object infrared camera andspectrograph (moircs) on the subaru telescope of a high-z passive galaxycandidate (pbzk) from the cosmos field, for which we accurately measure itsredshift of z=1.8230 and obtain an upper limit on its velocity dispersionsigma_star&lt;326 km/s. by detailed stellar population modeling of both the galaxybroad-band sed and the rest-frame optical spectrum we derive astar-formation-weighted age and formation redshift of t_sf~1-2 gyr andz_form~2.5-4, and a stellar mass of m_star~(3-4)x10^{11} m_sun. this is inagreement with a virial mass limit of m_vir&lt;7x10^{11}m_sun, derived from themeasured sigma_star value and stellar half-light radius, as well as with thedynamical mass limit based on the jeans equations. in contrast with previouslyreported super-dense passive galaxies at z~2, the present galaxy at z=1.82appears to have both size and velocity dispersion similar to early-typegalaxies in the local universe with similar stellar mass. this suggests thatz~2 massive and passive galaxies may exhibit a wide range of properties, thenpossibly following quite different evolutionary histories from z~2 to z=0.

1007.1933	obscured star-formation and environment in the cosmos field	we investigate the effects of the environment on star-formation in a sampleof massive luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs)with s(24 micron)&gt;80 ujy and i+&lt;24 in the cosmos field. we exploit the accuratephotometric redshifts in cosmos to characterize the galaxy environment andstudy the evolution of the fraction of lirgs and ulirgs in differentenvironments in the redshift range z=0.3-1.2 and in bins of stellar mass. wefind that the environment plays a role in the star formation processes andevolution of lirgs and ulirgs. we find an overall increase of the ulirg+lirgfraction in an optically-selected sample with increasing redshift, as expectedfrom the evolution of the star formation rate density. we find that theulirg+lirg fraction decreases with increasing density up to z~1, and that thedependence on density flattens with increasing redshift. we do not observe thereversal of the star-formation rate density relation up to z=1 in massive lirgsand ulirgs, suggesting that such reversal might occur at higher redshift inthis infrared luminosity range.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1009.1545	on the evolution of environmental and mass properties of strong lens  galaxies in cosmos	among the 100 strong lens candidates found in the cosmos field, 20 withredshifts in the range [0.34,1.13], feature multiple images of backgroundsources. using the multi-wavelength coverage of the field and its spectroscopicfollow-up, we characterize the evolution with redshift of the environment andof the dark-matter (dm) fraction of the lens galaxies. we present new redshiftof the strong lens candidates. the lens environment is characterized by theprojected 10 closest galaxies around each lens and by the number of galaxieswith a projected distance less than 1mpc at the lens galaxy redshift. in bothcases, we perform similar measurements on a control sample of twin non-lensearly type galaxies (etgs). in addition, we identify group members and fieldgalaxies in the x-ray and optical catalogs of galaxy groups. from thosecatalogs, we measure the external shear contribution at the lens galaxypositions. the systems are then modeled using a sie plus the external shear dueto the groups. we observe that the average stellar mass of lens galaxiesincreases with z and that the environment of lens galaxies is compatible withthat of the twins. during the lens modeling, we notice that, when let free, theexternal shear points in a direction which is the mean direction of theexternal shear due to groups and of the closest galaxy to the lens. we noticethat the dm fraction of the lens galaxies within the einstein radius decreasesas the redshift increases. given these, we conclude that, while the environmentof lens galaxies is compatible with that of non-lens etgs, their massproperties evolves significantly with redshift: it is still not clear whetherthis advocates in favor of a stronger lensing bias toward massive objects athigh redshift or is simply representative of the high proportion of massive andhigh stellar density galaxies at high redshift.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

1105.0890	aztec millimeter survey of the cosmos field - iii. source catalog over  0.72 sq. deg. and plausible boosting by large-scale structure	we present a 0.72 sq. deg. contiguous 1.1mm survey in the central area of thecosmos field carried out to a 1sigma ~ 1.26 mjy/beam depth with the azteccamera mounted on the 10m atacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). wehave uncovered 189 candidate sources at a signal-to-noise ratio s/n &gt;= 3.5, outof which 129, with s/n &gt;= 4, can be considered to have little chance of beingspurious (&lt; 2 per cent). we present the number counts derived with this survey,which show a significant excess of sources when compared to the number countsderived from the ~0.5 sq. deg. area sampled at similar depths in the scuba halfdegree extragalactic survey (shades, austermann et al. 2010). they are,however, consistent with those derived from fields that were considered toosmall to characterize the overall blank-field population. we identifydifferences to be more significant in the s &gt; 5 mjy regime, and demonstratethat these excesses in number counts are related to the areas where galaxies atredshifts z &lt; 1.1 are more densely clustered. the positions of optical-irgalaxies in the redshift interval 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.75 are the ones that show thestrongest correlation with the positions of the 1.1mm bright population (s &gt; 5mjy), a result which does not depend exclusively on the presence of richclusters within the survey sampled area. the most likely explanation for theobserved excess in number counts at 1.1mm is galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-grouplensing at moderate amplification levels, that increases in amplitude as onesamples larger and larger flux densities. this effect should also be detectablein other high redshift populations.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1106.0498	dust-obscured star formation and the contribution of galaxies escaping  uv/optical color selections at z~2	a substantial fraction of the stellar mass growth across cosmic time occurredwithin dust-enshrouded environments. yet, the exact amount of star-formingactivity that took place in high-redshift dusty galaxies currently missed byoptical surveys has been barely explored. using the spitzer observations ofcosmos we determined the fraction of luminous star-forming galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;3escaping the traditional color selection techniques because of dust extinction,as well as their contribution to the cosmic star formation density at highredshift. we find that the bzk criterion offers an almost complete (~90%)identification of the 24mic sources at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5, while the bm/bx criterionmiss 50% of the mips population. similarly the criterion based on the presenceof a stellar bump in massive sources (so-called "irac peakers") miss up to 40%of the ir luminosity density and only 25% of the ir energy density at z~2 isproduced by optically-faint ir-bright galaxies selected based on their extrememid-ir to optical flux ratios. we conclude that color selections of distantstar-forming galaxies must be used with lots of care given the substantial biasthey can suffer. in particular, the effect of dust extinction strongly impactsthe completeness of identifications at the bright end of the bolometricluminosity function, which implies large and uncertain extrapolations toaccount for the contribution of dusty galaxies missed by these selections. inthe context of forthcoming facilities that will operate at long wavelengths(e.g., $jwst$, alma, safari, evla, ska), this emphasizes the importance ofminimizing the extinction biases when probing the activity of star formation inthe early universe.

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1109.3693	galaxy pairs in cosmos -- merger rate evolution since z=1	we present results of a statistical study of the cosmic evolution of the massdependent major-merger rate since z=1. a stellar mass limited sample of closemajor-merger pairs (the cpair sample) was selected from the archive of thecosmos survey. pair fractions at different redshifts derived using the cpairsample and a local k-band selected pair sample show no significant variationswith stellar mass. the pair fraction exhibits moderately strong cosmicevolution, with the best-fitting evolutionary index m=2.2+-0.2. thebest-fitting function for the merger rate implies that galaxies with stellarmass between 1e+10 -- 3e+11 m_sun have undergone 0.5 -- 1.5 major-mergers sincez=1. our results show that, for massive galaxies at z&lt;1, major mergersinvolving star forming galaxies (i.e. wet and mixed mergers) can account forthe formation of both ellipticals and red quiescent galaxies (rqgs). on theother hand, major mergers cannot be responsible for the formation of most lowmass ellipticals and rqgs. our quantitative estimates indicate that majormergers have significant impact on the stellar mass assembly of the mostmassive galaxies, but for less massive galaxies the stellar mass assembly isdominated by the star formation. comparison with the mass dependent (u)lirgrates suggests that the frequency of major-merger events is comparable to orhigher than that of (u)lirgs.

1203.2609	the source counts of submillimetre galaxies detected at 1.1 mm	the source counts of galaxies discovered at sub-millimetre and millimetrewavelengths provide important information on the evolution of infrared-brightgalaxies. we combine the data from six blank-field surveys carried out at 1.1mm with aztec, totalling 1.6 square degrees in area with root-mean-squaredepths ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 mjy, and derive the strongest constraints todate on the 1.1 mm source counts at flux densities s(1100) = 1-12 mjy. usingadditional data from the aztec cluster environment survey to extend the countsto s(1100) ~ 20 mjy, we see tentative evidence for an enhancement relative tothe exponential drop in the counts at s(1100) ~ 13 mjy and a smooth connectionto the bright source counts at &gt;20 mjy measured by the south pole telescope;this excess may be due to strong lensing effects. we compare these counts topredictions from several semi-analytical and phenomenological models and findthat for most the agreement is quite good at flux densities &gt; 4 mjy; however,we find significant discrepancies (&gt;3sigma) between the models and the observed1.1 mm counts at lower flux densities, and none of them are consistent with theobserved turnover in the euclidean-normalised counts at s(1100) &lt; 2 mjy. ournew results therefore may require modifications to existing evolutionary modelsfor low luminosity galaxies. alternatively, the discrepancy between themeasured counts at the faint end and predictions from phenomenological modelscould arise from limited knowledge of the spectral energy distributions offaint galaxies in the local universe.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.1540	deep near-infrared spectroscopy of passively evolving galaxies at z&gt;1.4	[abridged] we present the results of new near-ir spectroscopic observationsof passive galaxies at z&gt;1.4 in a concentration of bzk-selected galaxies in thecosmos field. the observations have been conducted with subaru/moircs, and haveresulted in absorption lines and/or continuum detection for 18 out of 34objects. this allows us to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a sample almostcomplete to k(ab)=21. cosmos photometric redshifts are found in fair agreementoverall with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a standard deviation of ~0.05;however, ~30% of objects have photometric redshifts systematicallyunderestimated by up to ~25%. we show that these systematic offsets inphotometric redshifts can be removed by using these objects as a training set.all galaxies fall in four distinct redshift spikes at z=1.43, 1.53, 1.67 and1.82, with this latter one including 7 galaxies. sed fits to broad-band fluxesindicate stellar masses in the range of ~4-40x10^10msun and that star formationwas quenched ~1 gyr before the cosmic epoch at which they are observed. thespectra of several individual galaxies have allowed us to measure theirhdelta_f and dn4000 indices, which confirms their identification as passivegalaxies, as does a composite spectrum resulting from the coaddition of 17individual spectra. the effective radii of the galaxies have been measured onthe hst/acs f814w image, confirming the coexistence at these redshifts ofpassive galaxies which are substantially more compact than their localcounterparts with others that follow the local size-stellar mass relation. forthe galaxy with best s/n spectrum we were able to measure a velocity dispersionof 270+/-105 km/s, indicating that this galaxy lies closely on the virialrelation given its stellar mass and effective radius.

1209.1478	spectral energy distributions of type 1 agn in the cosmos survey i - the  xmm-cosmos sample	the "cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) enables the study of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of active galactic nuclei (agn) because of the deepcoverage and rich sampling of frequencies from x-ray to radio. here we presenta sed catalog of 413 x-ray (\xmm) selected type 1 (emission line fwhm$&gt;2000$ kms$^{-1}$) agn with magellan, sdss or vlt spectrum. the seds are corrected forthe galactic extinction, for broad emission line contributions, constrainedvariability, and for host galaxy contribution. we present the mean sed and thedispersion seds after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 ghz to 40kev, and show examples of the variety of seds encountered. in the near-infraredto optical (rest frame $\sim 8\mu m$-- 4000\aa), the photometry is complete forthe whole sample and the mean sed is derived from detections only. reddeningand host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of theobserved sed variety. the seds are all available on-line.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1210.2723	proto-groups at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3 in the zcosmos-deep sample	we identify 42 candidate groups lying between 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.0 from a sample of 3502galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the zcosmos-deep redshift surveywithin the same redshift interval. these systems contain three to fivespectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (inphysical space) and within 700km/s in velocity. based on extensive analysis ofmock catalogues that have been generated from the millennium simulation, weexamine the likely nature of these systems at the time of observation, and whatthey will evolve into down to the present epoch. although few of the "member"galaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, andalmost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the samehalo by the present epoch. most of the candidate groups can therefore bedescribed as "proto-groups". an estimate of the overdensities is alsoconsistent with the idea that these systems are being seen at the start of theassembly process. we also examine present-day haloes and ask whether theirprogenitors would have been seen amongst our candidate groups. for present-dayhaloes between 10^14-10^15msun/h, 35% should have appeared amongst ourcandidate groups, and this would have risen to 70% if our survey had beenfully-sampled, so we can conclude that our sample can be taken asrepresentative of a large fraction of such systems. there is a clear excess ofmassive galaxies above 10^10msun around the locations of the candidate groupsin a large independent cosmos photo-z sample, but we see no evidence in thislatter data for any colour differentiation with respect to the field. this ishowever consistent with the idea that such differentiation arises in satellitegalaxies, as indicated at z&lt;1, if the candidate groups are indeed only startingto be assembled.

1210.6349	physical conditions in molecular clouds in the arm and interarm regions  of m51	we report systematic variations in the co(2-1)/co(1-0) line ratio (r) in m51.the ratio shows clear evidence for the evolution of molecular gas from theupstream interarm regions, passage into the spiral arms and back into thedownstream interarm regions. in the interarm regions, r is typically low &lt;0.7(and often 0.4-0.6); this is similar to the ratios observed in galactic giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) with low far-ir luminosities. however, the ratio risesto &gt;0.7 (often 0.8-1.0) in the spiral arms, particularly at their leading(downstream) edge. r is also high, 0.8-1.0, in the central region. an lvgcalculation provides insight into the changes in the gas physical conditionsbetween the arm and interarm regions: cold and low density gas (~10k, ~300cm-3)is required for the interarm gmcs, but this gas must become warmer and/ordenser in the more active star forming spiral arms. r is higher in areas ofhigh 24micron brightness (an approximate tracer of star formation rate surfacedensity) and high co(1-0) integrated intensity (a well-calibrated tracer oftotal molecular gas surface density). the systematic enhancement of the co(2-1)line relative to co(1-0) in luminous star forming regions suggests that somecaution is needed when using co(2-1) as a tracer of bulk molecular gas mass.

1301.3157	mass assembly in quiescent and star-forming galaxies since z=4 from  ultravista	we estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density forstar-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2&lt;z&lt;4. we construct a deep k&lt;24sample of 220000 galaxies selected using the ultravista dr1 data release. ouranalysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. by comparing thesephotometric redshifts with 10800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmosbright and faint surveys, we find a precision of sigma(dz/(1+z))=0.008 ati&lt;22.5 and sigma(dz/(1+zs))=0.03 at 1.5&lt;z&lt;4. we derive the stellar massfunction and correct for the eddington bias. we find a mass-dependent evolutionof the global and star-forming populations. this mass-dependent evolution is adirect consequence of the star formation being quenched in galaxies moremassive than m&gt;10^10.7msun. for the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, wedo not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z&lt;1; however weobserve a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. from z~3 to z~1, the densityof quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. their comovingstellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z~3 and z~1 and by less than0.2dex at z&lt;1. we infer the star formation history from the mass densityevolution and we find an excellent agreement with instantaneous star formationrate measurements at z&lt;1.5, while we find differences of 0.2dex at z&gt;1.5consistent with the expected uncertainties. we also develop a new method toinfer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forminggalaxies. we find that the specific star formation rate of 10^10msun galaxiesincreases continuously in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;4. finally, we compare ourresults with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimatethe density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while thedensity of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.

1305.1308	spot the difference. impact of different selection criteria on observed  properties of passive galaxies in zcosmos 20-k sample	we present the analysis of photometric, spectroscopic, and morphologicalproperties for differently selected samples of passive galaxies up to z=1extracted from the zcosmos-20k spectroscopic survey. this analysis intends toexplore the dependence of galaxy properties on the selection criterion adopted,study the degree of contamination due to star-forming outliers, and provide acomparison between different commonly used selection criteria. we extractedfrom the zcosmos-20k catalog six different samples of passive galaxies, basedon morphology, optical colors, specific star-formation rate, a best fit to theobserved spectral energy distribution, and a criterion that combinesmorphological, spectroscopic, and photometric information. the morphologicalsample has the higher percentage of contamination in colors, specific starformation rate and presence of emission lines, while the red &amp; passive etgssample is the purest, with properties mostly compatible with no star formationactivity; however, it is also the less economic criterion in terms ofinformation used. the best performing among the other criteria are the red sedand the quiescent ones, providing a percentage of contamination only slightlyhigher than the red &amp; passive etgs criterion (on average of a factor of ~2) butwith absolute values of the properties of contaminants still compatible with ared, passively evolving population. we also provided two revised definitions ofearly type galaxies based on restframe color-color and color-mass criteria,that better reproduce the observed bimodalities. the analysis of the numberdensities shows evidences of mass-assembly downsizing, with galaxies at10.25&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.75 increasing their number by a factor ~2-4 from z=0.6 toz=0.2, by a factor ~2-3 from z=1 to z=0.2 at 10.75&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11, and by only~10-50% from z=1 to z=0.2 at 11&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5.

1309.4774	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1.6. i. h\alpha  -based star formation rates and dust extinction	we present the first results from a near-ir spectroscopic survey of thecosmos field, using the fiber multi-object spectrograph on the subarutelescope, designed to characterize the star-forming galaxy population at$1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the high-resolution mode is implemented to detect h$\alpha$ inemission between $1.6{\rm -}1.8 \mathrm{\mu m}$ with $f_{\rmh\alpha}\gtrsim4\times10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. here, we specificallyfocus on 271 sbzk-selected galaxies that yield a h$\alpha$ detection thusproviding a redshift and emission line luminosity to establish the relationbetween star formation rate and stellar mass. with further $j$-bandspectroscopy for 89 of these, the level of dust extinction is assessed bymeasuring the balmer decrement using co-added spectra. we find that theextinction ($0.6\lesssim a_\mathrm{h\alpha} \lesssim 2.5$) rises with stellarmass and is elevated at high masses compared to low-redshift galaxies. usingthis subset of the spectroscopic sample, we further find that the differentialextinction between stellar and nebular emission\hbox{$e_\mathrm{star}(b-v)/e_\mathrm{neb}(b-v)$} is 0.7--0.8, dissimilar tothat typically seen at low redshift. after correcting for extinction, we derivean h$\alpha$-based main sequence with a slope ($0.81\pm0.04$) and normalizationsimilar to previous studies at these redshifts.

1310.4950	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z~1.6 ii. the  mass-metallicity relation and the dependence on star formation rate and dust  extinction	we investigate the relationships between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygenabundance (metallicity), star formation rate, and dust content of star-forminggalaxies at z$\sim$1.6 using subaru/fmos spectroscopy in the cosmos field. themass-metallicity relation at $z\sim1.6$ is steeper than the relation observedin the local universe. the steeper mz relation at $z\sim1.6$ is mainly due toevolution in the stellar mass where the mz relation begins to turnover andflatten. this turnover mass is 1.2 dex larger at $z\sim1.6$. the most massivegalaxies at $z\sim1.6$ ($\sim 10^{11}m_\odot$) are enriched to the levelobserved in massive galaxies in the local universe. the mass-metallicityrelation we measure at $z\sim1.6$ supports the suggestion of an empirical uppermetallicity limit that does not significantly evolve with redshift. we find ananti-correlation between metallicity and star formation rate for galaxies at afixed stellar mass at $z\sim1.6$ which is similar to trends observed in thelocal universe. we do not find a relation between stellar mass, metallicity andstar formation rate that is independent of redshift; our data suggest thatthere is redshift evolution in this relation. we examine the relation betweenstellar mass, metallicity and dust extinction. we find that at a fixed stellarmass dustier galaxies tend to be more metal rich. from examination of thestellar masses, metallicities, sfrs and dust extinctions we conclude thatstellar mass is most closely related to dust extinction.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

0803.0997	a new method to separate star forming from agn galaxies at intermediate  redshift: the submillijansky radio population in the vla-cosmos survey	we explore the properties of the submillijansky radio population at 20 cm byapplying a newly developed optical color-based method to separate star forming(sf) from agn galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1.3). although opticalrest-frame colors are used, our separation method is shown to be efficient, andnot biased against dusty starburst galaxies. this classification method hasbeen calibrated and tested on a local radio selected optical sample. givenaccurate multi-band photometry and redshifts, it carries the potential to begenerally applicable to any galaxy sample where sf and agn galaxies are the twodominant populations.  in order to quantify the properties of the submillijansky radio population,we have analyzed ~2,400 radio sources, detected at 20 cm in the vla-cosmossurvey. 90% of these have submillijansky flux densities. we classify theobjects into 1) star candidates, 2) quasi stellar objects, 3) agn, 4) sf, and5) high redshift (z&gt;1.3) galaxies. we find, for the composition of thesubmillijansky radio population, that sf galaxies are not the dominantpopulation at submillijansky flux levels, as previously often assumed, but thatthey make up an approximately constant fraction of 30-40% in the flux densityrange of ~50 microjy to 0.7 mjy. in summary, based on the entire vla-cosmosradio population at 20 cm, we find that the radio population at these fluxdensities is a mixture of roughly 30-40% of sf and 50-60% of agn galaxies, witha minor contribution (~10%) of qsos.

1406.2327	late-stage galaxy mergers in cosmos to z~1	the role of major mergers in galaxy and black hole formation is not wellconstrained. to help address this, we develop an automated method to identifylate-stage galaxy mergers before coalescence of the galactic cores. theresulting sample of mergers is distinct from those obtained using pair-findingand morphological indicators. our method relies on median-filtering ofhigh-resolution images in order to distinguish two concentrated galaxy nucleiat small separations. using mock images, we derive statistical contaminationand incompleteness corrections for the fraction of late-stage mergers. we applyour new method to a magnitude-limited (i &lt; 23) sample of 44,164 galaxies fromthe cosmos hst/acs catalog. using a mass-complete sample with $\log m_*/m_\odot&gt; 10.6$ and $0.25 &lt; z \leq 1.00$, we find ~5% of systems are late-stage mergerswith separations between 2.2 and 8 kpc. correcting for incompleteness andcontamination, the fractional merger rate increases strongly with redshift as$(1+z)^{3.8\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matterhalo merger rates. separating the sample into star-forming and quiescentgalaxies shows that the merger rate for star-forming galaxies increasesstrongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescentgalaxies is consistent with no evolution, $(1+z)^{1.1\pm1.2}$. limiting oursample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos, we find that thestar formation rates and x-ray selected agn activity in likely late-stagemergers are enhanced by factors of ~2 relative to a control sample. combiningour sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\pm5\%$ of starformation and $20\pm8\%$ of agn activity is triggered by close encounters (&lt;143kpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the onlychannels for star formation and black hole growth.

1409.0447	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z~1.6 iii. survey  design, performance, and sample characteristics	we present a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the cosmos field using thefiber multi-object spectrograph (fmos), a near-infrared instrument on thesubaru telescope. our survey is specifically designed to detect the halphaemission line that falls within the h-band (1.6-1.8 um) spectroscopic windowfrom star-forming galaxies with 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 and m_stellar&gt;~10^10 msolar. withthe high multiplex capability of fmos, it is now feasible to construct samplesof over one thousand galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts at epochs thatwere previously challenging. the high-resolution mode (r~2600) effectivelyseparates halpha and [nii]6585 thus enabling studies of the gas-phasemetallicity and photoionization state of the interstellar medium. the primaryaim of our program is to establish how star formation depends on stellar massand environment, both recognized as drivers of galaxy evolution at lowerredshifts. in addition to the main galaxy sample, our target selection placespriority on those detected in the far-infrared by herschel/pacs to assess thelevel of obscured star formation and investigate, in detail, outliers from thestar formation rate - stellar mass relation. galaxies with halpha detectionsare followed up with fmos observations at shorter wavelengths using the j-long(1.11-1.35 um) grating to detect hbeta and [oiii]5008 that provides anassessment of extinction required to measure star formation rates not hamperedby dust, and an indication of embedded active galactic nuclei. with 460redshifts measured from 1153 spectra, we assess the performance of theinstrument with respect to achieving our goals, discuss inherent biases in thesample, and detail the emission-line properties. our higher-level dataproducts, including catalogs and spectra, are available to the community.

1410.4875	evolution of the specific star formation rate function at z&lt;1.4 -  dissecting the mass-sfr plane in cosmos and goods	the relation between the stellar mass and the star formation ratecharacterizes how the instantaneous star formation is determined by the galaxypast star formation history and by the growth of the dark matter structures. wedeconstruct the m-sfr plane by measuring the specific sfr functions in severalstellar mass bins from z=0.2 out to z=1.4. our analysis is primary based on amips 24$\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the cosmos and goods surveys. weestimate the sfr by combining mid- and far-infrared data for 20500 galaxies.the ssfr functions are derived in four stellar mass bins within the range9.5&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5. first, we demonstrate the importance of taking intoaccount selection effects when studying the m-sfr relation. secondly, we find amass-dependent evolution of the median ssfr with redshift varying as $ssfr\propto (1+z)^{b}$, with $b$ increasing from $b=2.88$ to $b=3.78$ between$m=10^{9.75}msun$ and $m=10^{11.1}msun$, respectively. at low masses, thisevolution is consistent with the cosmological accretion rate and predictionsfrom semi-analytical models (sam). this agreement breaks down for more massivegalaxies showing the need for a more comprehensive description of thestar-formation history in massive galaxies. third, we obtain that the shape ofthe ssfr function is invariant with time at z&lt;1.4 but depends on the mass. weobserve a broadening of the ssfr function ranging from 0.28 dex at$m=10^{9.75}msun$ to 0.46 dex at $m=10^{11.1}msun$. such increase in thescatter of the m-sfr relation suggests an increasing diversity of sfhs as thestellar mass increases. finally, we find a gradual decline of the ssfr withmass as $log(ssfr) \propto -0.17m$. we discuss the numerous physical processes,as gas exhaustion in hot gas halos or secular evolution, which can graduallyreduce the ssfr and increase the sfh diversity.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.1262	coldz: karl g. jansky very large array discovery of a gas-rich galaxy in  cosmos	the broad spectral bandwidth at mm and cm-wavelengths provided by the recentupgrades to the karl g. jansky very large array (vla) has made it possible toconduct unbiased searches for molecular co line emission at redshifts, z &gt;1.31. we present the discovery of a gas-rich, star-forming galaxy at z = 2.48,through the detection of co(1-0) line emission in the coldz survey, through asensitive, ka-band (31 to 39 ghz) vla survey of a 6.5 square arcminute regionof the cosmos field. we argue that the broad line (fwhm ~570 +/- 80 km/s) ismost likely to be co(1-0) at z=2.48, as the integrated emission is spatiallycoincident with an infrared-detected galaxy with a photometric redshiftestimate of z = 3.2 +/- 0.4. the co(1-0) line luminosity is l'_co = (2.2 +/-0.3) x 10^{10} k km/s pc^2, suggesting a cold molecular gas mass of m_gas ~ (2- 8)x10^{10}m_solar depending on the assumed value of the molecular gas mass toco luminosity ratio alpha_co. the estimated infrared luminosity from the(rest-frame) far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) is l_ir =2.5x10^{12} l_solar and the star-formation rate is ~250 m_solar/yr, with thesed shape indicating substantial dust obscuration of the stellar light. theinfrared to co line luminosity ratio is ~114+/-19 l_solar/(k km/s pc^2),similar to galaxies with similar sfrs selected at uv/optical to radiowavelengths. this discovery confirms the potential for molecular emission linesurveys as a route to study populations of gas-rich galaxies in the future.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1503.07596	the interstellar medium in galaxies seen a billion years after the big  bang	evolution in the measured rest frame ultraviolet spectral slope andultraviolet to optical flux ratios indicate a rapid evolution in the dustobscuration of galaxies during the first 3 billion years of cosmic time (z&gt;4).this evolution implies a change in the average interstellar medium properties,but the measurements are systematically uncertain due to untested assumptions,and the inability to measure heavily obscured regions of the galaxies. previousattempts to directly measure the interstellar medium in normal galaxies atthese redshifts have failed for a number of reasons with one notable exception.here we report measurements of the [cii] gas and dust emission in 9 typical(~1-4l*) star-forming galaxies ~1 billon years after the big bang (z~5-6). wefind these galaxies have &gt;12x less thermal emission compared with similarsystems ~2 billion years later, and enhanced [cii] emission relative to thefar-infrared continuum, confirming a strong evolution in the interstellarmedium properties in the early universe. the gas is distributed over scales of1-8 kpc, and shows diverse dynamics within the sample. these results areconsistent with early galaxies having significantly less dust than typicalgalaxies seen at z&lt;3 and being comparable to local low-metallicity systems.

1506.05475	the composite nature of dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) at z~2-3 in the  cosmos field: i. a far-infrared view	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are bright 24 um-selected sources with extremeobscuration at optical wavelengths. they are typically characterized by arising power-law continuum of hot dust (t_d ~ 200-1000k) in the near-irindicating that their mid-ir luminosity is dominated by an an active galacticnucleus (agn). dogs with a fainter 24 um flux display a stellar bump in thenear-ir and their mid-ir luminosity appears to be mainly powered by dusty starformation. alternatively, it may be that the mid-ir emission arising from agnactivity is dominant but the torus is sufficiently opaque to make the near-iremission from the agn negligible with respect to the emission from the hostcomponent. in an effort to characterize the astrophysical nature of theprocesses responsible for the ir emission in dogs, this paper exploits herscheldata (pacs + spire) on a sample of 95 dogs within the cosmos field. we derive awealth of far-ir properties (e.g., total ir luminosities; mid-to-far ir colors;dust temperatures and masses) based on sed fitting. of particular interest arethe 24 um-bright dogs (f_24um &gt; 1mjy). they present bluer far-ir/mid-ir colorsthan the rest of the sample, unveiling the potential presence of an agn. theagn contribution to the total 8-1000 um flux increases as a function of therest-frame 8 um-luminosity irrespective of the redshift. this confirms thatfaint dogs (l_8 um&lt; 10^12 l_sun) are dominated by star-formation while brighterdogs show a larger contribution from an agn.

1509.01101	the lyman continuum escape fraction of galaxies at z=3.3 in the  vuds-lbc/cosmos field	the lyman continuum (lyc) flux escaping from high-z galaxies into the igm isa fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in thereionization epoch. we have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies atz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of lyc photons escaping fromgalaxy halos. uv deep imaging in the cosmos field obtained with the prime focuscamera lbc at the lbt telescope was used together with a catalog ofspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds) to builda sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with l&gt;0.5l*. we obtained deep lbc images ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.40 both in the rand deep u bands. a sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escapefractions&gt;28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, withthe exception of two marginal detections (s/n~2) in the u band, all the other 8galaxies are most likely contaminated by the uv flux of low-z interloperslocated close to the high-z targets. the average escape fraction derived fromthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel&lt;2%. the impliedhi photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the igmionized at z~3, as observed in the lyman forest of high-z qso spectra or by theproximity effect. these results support a scenario where high redshift,relatively bright (l&gt;0.5l*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustainthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic igm at z~3. star-forminggalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (l&lt;&lt;l*) can be themajor contributors to the reionization of the universe only if their physicalproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. alternatively,ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the agnpopulation at high-z.

1511.03734	the splash survey: quiescent galaxies are more strongly clustered but  are not necessarily located in high-density environments	we use the stellar-mass-selected catalog from the spitzer large area surveywith hyper-suprime-cam (splash) in the cosmos field to study the environmentsof galaxies via galaxy density and clustering analyses up to $z \sim 2.5$. theclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forminggalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in moremassive halos. when using local density measurement, we find a clear positivequiescent fraction--density relation at $z &lt; 1$, consistent with earlierresults. however, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trendat intermediate redshifts ($1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$) with marginal significance(&lt;1.8$\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\sigma$). the lowerfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, ifconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formationcan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'high-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching. finally, at$z &gt; 1.5$, the quiescent fraction depends little on the local density, eventhough clustering shows that quiescent galaxies are in more massive halos. weargue that at high redshift the typical halo size falls below $10^{13}$$m_{\odot}$, where intrinsically the local density measurements are so variedthat they do not trace the halo mass. our results thus suggest that in thehigh-redshift universe, halo mass may be the key in quenching the starformation in galaxies, rather than the conventionally measured galaxy density.

astro-ph;0005208	high-resolution imaging of molecular gas and dust in the antennae (ngc  4038/39): super giant molecular complexes	we present new aperture synthesis co maps of the antennae (ngc 4038/39)obtained with the caltech millimeter array. these sensitive images showmolecular emission associated with the two nuclei and a partial ring of starformation to the west of ngc 4038, as well as revealing the large extent of theextra-nuclear region of star formation (the ``overlap region''), whichdominates the co emission from this system. the largest molecular complexeshave masses of 3-6x10^8 m_sun, typically an order of magnitude larger than thelargest structures seen to date in more quiescent galaxy disks. the extremelyred luminous star clusters identified previously with hst are well-correlatedwith the co emission, which supports the conclusion that they are highlyembedded young objects rather than old globular clusters. there is an excellentcorrelation between the co emission and the 15 micron emission seen with iso,particularly for the brightest regions. the most massive complexes in theoverlap region have similar [neiii]/[neii] ratios, which implies that all theseregions are forming many massive stars. however, only the brightestmid-infrared peak shows strong, rising continuum emission longward of 10microns, indicative of very small dust grains heated to high temperatures bytheir proximity to nearby luminous stars. since these grains are expected to beremoved rapidly from the immediate environment of the massive stars, it ispossible that this region contains very young (&lt; 1 myr) sites of starformation. alternatively, fresh dust grains could be driven into the sphere ofinfluence of the massive stars, perhaps by the bulk motions of two giantmolecular complexes. the kinematics and morphology of the co emission in thisregion provide some support for this second scenario.

astro-ph;0011098	the interaction between the ism and star formation in the dwarf  starburst galaxy ngc 4214	we present the first interferometric study of the molecular gas in themetal-poor dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 4214. our map of the 12co(1-0) emission,obtained at the ovro millimeter array, reveals an unexpected structural wealth.we detected three regions of molecular emission in the north-west (nw),south-east (se) and centre of ngc 4214 which are in very different and distinctevolutionary stages (total molecular mass: 5.1 x 10^6 m_sun). these differencesare apparent most dramatically when the co morphologies are compared to opticalground based and hst imaging: massive star formation has not started yet in thenw region; the well-known starburst in the centre is the most evolved and starformation in the se complex started more recently. we derive a star formationefficiency of 8% for the se complex. using high--resolution vla observations ofneutral hydrogen hi and our co data we generated a total gas column density mapfor ngc 4214 (hi + h_2). no clear correlation is seen between the peaks of hi,co and the sites of ongoing star formation. this emphasizes the irregularnature of dwarf galaxies. the hi and co velocities agree well, so do theh-alpha velocities. in total, we cataloged 14 molecular clumps in ngc 4214. ourresults from a virial mass analysis are compatible with a galactic co-to-h_2conversion factor for ngc 4214 (lower than what is usually found in metal-poordwarf galaxies).

astro-ph;0110588	the interacting dwarf galaxy ngc 3077: the interplay of atomic and  molecular gas with violent star formation	we present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the nearby interactingdwarf galaxy ngc3077 (member of the m81 triplet). high resolution vla hiobservations show that most of the atomic gas (~90%) around ngc3077 is situatedin a prominent tidal arm with a complex velocity structure. little hi (~5 x10^7 m_sun) is associated with ngc3077 itself. high resolution ovroobservations of the molecular component (co) reveal the presence of 16molecular complexes near the center of ngc3077 (total mass: ~1.6 x 10^6 m_sun).a virial mass analysis of the individual complexes yields a lower co-to-h_2conversion factor in ngc3077 than the galactic value - a surprising result fora dwarf galaxy. the total (atomic and molecular) gas content in the centre ofngc3077 is displaced from the stellar component of ngc3077 -- this implies thatnot only the gas at large galactocentric radii is affected by the interactionwithin the triplet but also the center. we speculate that the starburstactivity of ngc3077 was triggered by this redistribution of gas in the center.some of these supershells are surrounded by neutral hydrogen. in a few cases,the rims of the ionized supershells are associated with dust absorption. themost prominent star forming region in ngc3077 as probed by pa-alphaobservations is hidden behind a dust cloud which is traced by the molecularcomplexes. correcting for extinction we derive a star forming rate of 0.05m_sun year^-1, i.e. given the reservoir in atomic and molecular gas in ngc3077,star formation may proceed at a similar rate for a few 10^8 years. theefficiency to form stars out of molecular gas in ngc3077 is similar to that inm82.

0808.2391	star formation rates in lyman break galaxies: radio stacking of lbgs in  the cosmos field and the sub-$\mu$jy radio source population	we present an analysis of the radio properties of large samples of lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at $z \sim 3$, 4, and 5 from the cosmos field. the medianstacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the $z \sim 3$ lbgs (u-banddrop-outs), with a 1.4 ghz flux density of $0.90 \pm 0.21 \mu$jy. the stackedemission is unresolved, with a size $&lt; 1"$, or a physical size $&lt; 8$kpc. thetotal star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$$m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-fir correlation in low redshift starforming galaxies. the star formation rate derived from a similar analysis ofthe uv luminosities is 17 $m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for uvdust attenuation. the simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factoris 1.8 at uv wavelengths. however, this factor is considerably smaller than thestandard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for lbgs. we discusspotential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dustattenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. conversely,the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematicallylower at very high redshift. two possible causes for a suppressed radioluminosity are: (i) increased inverse compton cooling of the relativisticelectron population due to scattering off the increasing cmb at high redshift,or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. the radiodetections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud agn fractionof 0.3%. one source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a'submm galaxy').

astro-ph;0407322	using bars as signposts of galaxy evolution at high and low redshifts	an analysis of the nicmos deep field shows that there is no evidence of adecline in the bar fraction beyond z~0.7, as previously claimed; bothbandshifting and spatial resolution must be taken into account when evaluatingthe evolution of the bar fraction. two main caveats of this study were a lackof a proper comparison sample at low redshifts and a larger number of galaxiesat high redshifts. we address these caveats using two new studies. for a properlocal sample, we have analyzed 134 spirals in the near-infrared using 2mass(main results presented by menendez-delmestre in this volume) which serves asan ideal anchor for the low-redshift universe. in addition to measuring themean bar properties, we find that bar size is correlated with galaxy size andbrightness, but the bar ellipticity is not correlated with these galaxyproperties. the bar length is not correlated with the bar ellipticity. forlarger high redshift samples we analyze the bar fraction from the 2-squaredegree cosmos acs survey. we find that the bar fraction at z~0.7 is ~50%,consistent with our earlier finding of no decline in bar fraction at highredshifts.

0809.0309	agn host galaxy morphologies in cosmos	we use hst/acs images and a photometric catalog of the cosmos field toanalyze morphologies of the host galaxies of approximately 400 agn candidatesat redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. we compare the agn hosts with a sample ofnon-active galaxies drawn from the cosmos field to match the magnitude andredshift distribution of the agn hosts. we perform 2-d surface brightnessmodeling with galfit to yield host galaxy and nuclear point source magnitudes.x-ray selected agn host galaxy morphologies span a substantial range that peaksbetween those of early-type, bulge-dominated and late-type, disk-dominatedsystems. we also measure the asymmetry and concentration of the host galaxies.unaccounted for, the nuclear point source can significantly bias results ofthese measured structural parameters, so we subtract the best-fit point sourcecomponent to obtain images of the underlying host galaxies. our concentrationmeasurements reinforce the findings of our 2-d morphology fits, placing x-rayagn hosts between early- and late-type inactive galaxies. agn host asymmetrydistributions are consistent with those of control galaxies. combined with alack of excess companion galaxies around agn, the asymmetry distributionsindicate that strong interactions are no more prevalent among agn than normalgalaxies. in light of recent work, these results suggest that the host galaxiesof agn at these x-ray luminosities may be in a transition from disk-dominatedto bulge-dominated, but that this transition is not typically triggered bymajor mergers.

astro-ph;0609042	the evolution of the number density of large disk galaxies in cosmos	we study a sample of approximately 16,500 galaxies with i_ab &lt;= 22.5 in thecosmos field. structural information on the galaxies is derived by fittingsingle sersic models to their two-dimensional surface brightness distributions.we investigate the evolution of the number density of disk galaxies larger than5 kpc between redshift z~1 and the present epoch. to this end, we use themeasurements of the half-light radii to construct, as a function of redshift,the size function of both the total disk galaxy population and of disk galaxiessplit in four bins of bulge-to-disk ratio. furthermore, we use a selectedsample of roughly 1800 sdss galaxies to calibrate our results with respect tothe local universe. we find that: (i) the number density of disk galaxies withintermediate sizes (r_{1/2}~5-7 kpc) remains nearly constant from z~1 to today.(ii) the number density of the largest disks (r_{1/2}&gt;7 kpc) decreases by afactor of about two out to z~1. (iii) there is a constancy in the numberdensity of large bulgeless disks out to z~1; the deficit of large disks atearly epochs seems to arise from a smaller number of bulged disks. our resultsindicate that the bulk of the large disk galaxy population has completed itsgrowth by z~1, and support the hypothesis that secular evolution processesproduce - or at least add stellar mass to - the bulge components of diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0609044	the zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer (zebra) and its  first application: cosmos	we present zebra, the zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer. thecurrent version of zebra combines and extends several of the classicalapproaches to produce accurate photometric redshifts down to faint magnitudes.in particular, zebra uses the template-fitting approach to produce maximumlikelihood and bayesian redshift estimates based on: (1.) an automaticiterative technique to correct the original set of galaxy templates to bestrepresent the seds of real galaxies at different redshifts; (2.) a training setof spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of the photometric sample; and(3.) an iterative technique for bayesian redshift estimates, which extracts thefull two-dimensional redshift and template probability function for eachgalaxy. we demonstrate the performance of zebra by applying it to a sample of866 i_ab &lt;= 22.5 cosmos galaxies with available u*, b, v, g', r', i', z' andk_s photometry and zcosmos spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3.adopting a 5-sigma-clipping that excludes less than 10 galaxies, both themaximum likelihood and bayesian estimates for this sample have an accuracydz/1+z better than 0.03. similar accuracies are recovered using mock galaxies.

astro-ph;0610921	a wide angle tail radio galaxy in the cosmos field: evidence for cluster  formation	we have identified a complex galaxy cluster system in the cosmos field via awide angle tail (wat) radio galaxy consistent with the idea that wat galaxiescan be used as tracers of clusters. the wat galaxy, cwat-01, is coincident withan elliptical galaxy resolved in the hst-acs image. using the cosmosmultiwavelength data set, we derive the radio properties of cwat-01 and use theoptical and x-ray data to investigate its host environment. the cluster hostingcwat-01 is part of a larger assembly consisting of a minimum of four x-rayluminous clusters within ~2 mpc distance. we apply hydrodynamical models thatcombine ram pressure and buoyancy forces on cwat-01. these models explain theshape of the radio jets only if the galaxy's velocity relative to theintra-cluster medium (icm) is in the range of about 300-550 km/s which ishigher than expected for brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in relaxed systems.this indicates that the cwat-01 host cluster is not relaxed, but is possiblydynamically young. we argue that such a velocity could have been inducedthrough subcluster merger within the cwat-01 parent cluster and/orcluster-cluster interactions. our results strongly indicate that we arewitnessing the formation of a large cluster from an assembly of multipleclusters, consistent with the hierarchical scenario of structure formation. weestimate the total mass of the final cluster to be approximately 20% of themass of the coma cluster.

astro-ph;0611644	cosmos morphological classification with zest (the zurich estimator of  structural types) and the evolution since z=1 of the luminosity function of  early-, disk-, and irregular galaxies	(abridged) motivated by the desire to reliably and automatically classifystructure of thousands of cosmos galaxies, we present zest, the zurichestimator of structural types. to classify galaxy structure, zest uses: (i)five non-parametric diagnostics: asymmetry, concentration, gini coefficient,2nd-order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels, and ellipticity; and(ii) the exponent n of single--sersic fits to the 2d surface brightnessdistributions. to fully exploit the wealth of information while reducing theredundancy present in these diagnostics, zest performs a principal component(pc) analysis. we use a sample of ~56,000 i&lt;24 cosmos galaxies to show that thefirst three pcs fully describe the key aspects of the galaxy structure, i.e.,to calibrate a three-dimensional classification grid of axis pc_1, pc_2, andpc_3. we demonstrate the robustness of the zest grid on the z=0 sample of freiet al. (1996). the zest classification breaks most of the degeneracy betweendifferent galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications basedon only some of the diagnostics included in zest. as a first application, wepresent the evolution since z~1 of the luminosity functions of cosmos galaxiesof early, disk and irregular galaxies and, for disk galaxies, of differentbulge-to-disk ratios. overall, we find that the lf up to a redshift z=1 isconsistent with a pure-luminosity evolution (of about 0.95 magnitudes at z\~0.7). we highlight however two trends, that are in general agreement with adown-sizing scenario for galaxy formation: (1.) a deficit of a factor of abouttwo at z~0.7 of mb&gt;-20.5 structurally--classified early--type galaxies; and(2.) an excess of a factor of about three, at a similar redshift, of irregulargalaxies.

0809.2101	cosmos photometric redshifts with 30-bands for 2-deg2	we present accurate photometric redshifts in the 2-deg2 cosmos field. theredshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrow bands coveringthe uv (galex), visible-nir (subaru, cfht, ukirt and noao) and mid-ir(spitzer/irac). a chi2 template-fitting method (le phare) was used andcalibrated with large spectroscopic samples from vlt-vimos and keck-deimos. wedevelop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions fromemission lines (oii, hbeta, halpha and ly) to the spectral energy distributions(seds). the treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by afactor of 2.5. comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopicredshifts (i.e. delta z = zs - zp) indicates a dispersion of sigma_{deltaz/(1+zs)}=0.007 at i&lt;22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlierphoto-z in the cosmos, cfhtls and combo-17 survey fields. at fainter magnitudesi&lt;24 and z&lt;1.25, the accuracy is sigma_{delta z/(1+zs)}=0.012. the deep nir andirac coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z~2 albeit with a loweraccuracy (sigma_{delta z/(1+zs)}=0.06 at i~24). the redshift distribution oflarge magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found torange from z=0.66 at 22&lt;i&lt;22.5 to z=1.06 at 24.5&lt;i&lt;25. at i&lt;26.0, themulti-wavelength cosmos catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects. thecosmos-30 photo-z enable the full exploitation of this survey for studies ofgalaxy and large scale structure evolution at high redshift.

astro-ph;0702359	weak gravitational lensing with cosmos: galaxy selection and shape  measurements	with a primary goal of conducting precision weak lensing measurements fromspace, the cosmos survey has imaged the largest contiguous area observed by thehubble space telescope (hst) to date using the advanced camera for surveys(acs). this is the first paper in a series where we describe our strategy foraddressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak lensingmeasurements from the cosmos data. the cosmos acs catalog is constructed from575 acs/wfc tiles (1.64 deg^2) and contains a total 1.2x10^6 objects to alimiting magnitude of f814w=26.5. this catalog is made publicly available. theshapes of galaxies have been measured and corrected for the distortion inducedby the time varying acs point spread function and for charge transferefficiency effects. next, simulated images are used to derive the shearsusceptibility factors that are necessary in order to transform shapemeasurements into unbiased shear estimators. finally, for each galaxy, wederive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract theintrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. interestingly, our results indicatethat the intrinsic shape noise varies little with either size, magnitude orredshift. representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin^2, the finalcosmos weak lensing catalog contains 3.9x10^5 galaxies with accurate shapemeasurements. the properties of the cosmos weak lensing catalog describedthroughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation anddesign of next-generation wide field space missions.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.

0810.2245	the zcosmos redshift survey: the three-dimensional classification cube  and bimodality in galaxy physical properties	aims. we investigate the relationships between three main optical galaxyobservables (spectral properties, colours, and morphology), exploiting the dataset provided by the cosmos/zcosmos survey. the purpose of this paper is todefine a simple galaxy classification cube, using a carefully selected sampleof around 1000 galaxies. methods. using medium resolution spectra of the first1k zcosmos-bright sample, optical photometry from the subaru/cosmosobservations, and morphological measurements derived from acs imaging, weanalyze the properties of the galaxy population out to z~1. applying threestraightforward classification schemes (spectral, photometric, andmorphological), we identify two main galaxy types, which appear to be linked tothe bimodality of galaxy population. the three parametric classificationsconstitute the axes of a "classification cube". results. a very good agreementexists between the classification from spectral data (quiescent/star-forminggalaxies) and that based on colours (red/blue galaxies). the third parameter(morphology) is less well correlated with the first two: in fact a goodcorrelation between the spectral classification and that based on morphologicalanalysis (early-/late-type galaxies) is achieved only after partiallycomplementing the morphological classification with additional colourinformation. finally, analyzing the 3d-distribution of all galaxies in thesample, we find that about 85% of the galaxies show a fully concordantclassification, being either quiescent, red, bulge-dominated galaxies (~20%) orstar-forming, blue, disk-dominated galaxies (~65%). these results imply thatthe galaxy bimodality is a consistent behaviour both in morphology, colour anddominant stellar population, at least out to z~1.

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.

0810.4838	on the contribution of large scale structure to strong gravitational  lensing	we study the correlation between the locations of galaxy-galaxy stronglensing candidates and tracers of large-scale structure from both weak lensingor x-ray emission. the cosmos survey is a unique data set, combining deep, highresolution and contiguous imaging in which strong lenses have been discovered,plus unparalleled multiwavelength coverage. to help interpret the cosmos data,we have also produced mock cosmos strong and weak lensing observations, basedon ray-tracing through the millenium simulation. in agreement with thesimulations, we find that strongly lensed images with the largest angularseparations are found in the densest regions of the cosmos field. this isexplained by a prevalence among the lens population in dense environments ofelliptical galaxies with high total-to-stellar mass ratios, which can deflectlight through larger angles. however, we also find that the overall fraction ofelliptical galaxies with strong gravitational lensing is independent of thelocal mass density; this observation is not true of the simulations, whichpredict an increasing fraction of strong lenses in dense environments. thediscrepancy may be a real effect, but could also be explained by variouslimitations of our analysis. for example, our visual search of strong lenssystems could be incomplete and suffer from selection bias; the luminosityfunction of elliptical galaxies may differ between our real and simulated data;or the simplifying assumptions and approximations used in our lensingsimulations may be inadequate. work is therefore ongoing. automated searchesfor strong lens systems will be particularly important in better constrainingthe selection function.

0812.0814	aztec millimetre survey of the cosmos field - ii. source count  overdensity and correlations with large-scale structure	we report an over-density of bright sub-millimetre galaxies (smgs) in the0.15 sq. deg. aztec/cosmos survey and a spatial correlation between the smgsand the optical-ir galaxy density at z &lt;~ 1.1. this portion of the cosmos fieldshows a ~ 3-sigma over-density of robust smg detections when compared to abackground, or "blankfield", population model that is consistent with smgsurveys of fields with no extragalactic bias. the smg over-density is mostsignificant in the number of very bright detections (14 sources with measuredfluxes s(1.1mm) &gt; 6 mjy), which is entirely incompatible with sample variancewithin our adopted blank-field number densities and infers an over-densitysignificance of &gt;&gt; 4. we find that the over-density and spatial correlation tooptical-ir galaxy density are most consistent with lensing of a background smgpopulation by foreground mass structures along the line of sight, rather thanphysical association of the smgs with the z &lt;~ 1.1 galaxies/clusters. the smgpositions are only weakly correlated with weak-lensing maps, suggesting thatthe dominant sources of correlation are individual galaxies and the moretenuous structures in the region and not the massive and compact clusters.these results highlight the important roles cosmic variance and large-scalestructure can play in the study of smgs.
