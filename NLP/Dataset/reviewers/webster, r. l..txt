0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

1012.3480	differential microlensing measurements of quasar broad line kinematics  in q2237+0305	the detailed workings of the central engines of powerful quasars remain amystery. this is primarily due to the fact that, at their cosmologicaldistances, the inner regions of these quasars are spatially unresolvable.reverberation mapping is now beginning to unlock the physics of the broademission line region (belr) in nearby, low-luminosity quasars, however it isstill unknown whether this gas is dominated by virial motion, by outflows, orinfall. the challenge is greater for more distant, powerful sources due to thevery long response time of the belr to changes in the continuum. we present anew technique for probing the kinematic properties of the belr and accretiondisk of high-z quasars using differential microlensing, and show howsubstantial information can be gained through a single observation of astrongly-lensed quasar using integral field spectroscopy. we apply thistechnique to gmos ifu observations of the multiply-imaged quasar q2237+0305,and find that the observed microlensing signature in the ciii] broad emissionline favours gravitationally-dominated dynamics over an accelerating outflow.

1103.0353	a microlensing measurement of dark matter fractions in three lensing  galaxies	direct measurements of dark matter distributions in galaxies are currentlyonly possible through the use of gravitational lensing observations.combinations of lens modelling and stellar velocity dispersion measurementsprovide the best constraints on dark matter distributions in individualgalaxies, however they can be quite complex. in this paper, we use observationsand simulations of gravitational microlensing to measure the smooth (dark)matter mass fraction at the position of lensed images in three lens galaxies:mg 0414+0534, sdss j0924+0219 and q2237+0305. the first two systems consist ofearly-type lens galaxies, and both display a flux ratio anomaly in their closeimage pair. anomalies such as these suggest a high smooth matter percentage islikely, and indeed we prefer ~50 per cent smooth matter in mg 0414+0534, and~80 per cent in sdss j0924+0219 at the projected locations of the lensedimages. q2237+0305 differs somewhat in that its lensed images lie in thecentral kiloparsec of the barred spiral lens galaxy, where we expect stars todominate the mass distribution. in this system, we find a smooth matterpercentage that is consistent with zero.

1203.1293	a new layout optimization technique for interferometric arrays, applied  to the mwa	antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometersbecause it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (psf,or array beam). this is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21 cmepoch of reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtractiondepends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of thebaseline distribution. nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas canbe placed---even at the remote australian location of the mwa (murchisonwidefield array) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas,emergency runways and trees. these exclusion areas can introduce spatialstructure into the baseline distribution that enhance the psf sidelobes andreduce the angular dynamic range. in this paper we present a new method ofconstrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in thebaseline distribution. this method not only outperforms random placementalgorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms randomplacement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are thesmoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. we use our newalgorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned mwa, andpresent the antenna locations, baseline distribution, and snapshot psf for thisarray choice.

1211.1433	low frequency observations of the moon with the murchison widefield  array	a new generation of low frequency radio telescopes is seeking to observe theredshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (eor), requiringinnovative methods of calibration and imaging to overcome the difficulties ofwidefield low frequency radio interferometry. precise calibration will berequired to separate the small expected eor signal from the strong foregroundemission at the frequencies of interest between 80 and 300 mhz. the moon may beuseful as a calibration source for detection of the eor signature, as it shouldhave a smooth and predictable thermal spectrum across the frequency band ofinterest. initial observations of the moon with the murchison widefield array32 tile prototype show that the moon does exhibit a similar trend to thatexpected for a cool thermally emitting body in the observed frequency range,but that the spectrum is corrupted by reflected radio emission from earth. inparticular, there is an abrupt increase in the observed flux density of themoon within the internationally recognised frequency modulated (fm) radio band.the observations have implications for future low frequency surveys and eordetection experiments that will need to take this reflected emission from themoon into account. the results also allow us to estimate the equivalentisotropic power emitted by the earth in the fm band and to determine how brightthe earth might appear at metre wavelengths to an observer beyond our own solarsystem.

1308.2742	on the detection and tracking of space debris using the murchison  widefield array. i. simulations and test observations demonstrate feasibility	the murchison widefield array (mwa) is a new low frequency interferomericradio telescope. the mwa is the low frequency precursor to the square kilometrearray (ska) and is the first of three ska precursors to be operational,supporting a varied science mission ranging from the attempted detection of theepoch of reionisation to the monitoring of solar flares and space weather. weexplore the possibility that the mwa can be used for the purposes of spacesituational awareness (ssa). in particular we propose that the mwa can be usedas an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5- 108 mhz (the commercial fm broadcast band). in this scenario the mwa can beconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with fmbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. the fm broadcastspropagate into space, are reflected off debris in earth orbit, and are receivedat the mwa. the imaging capabilities of the mwa can be used to simultaneouslydetect multiple pieces of space debris, image their positions on the sky as afunction of time, and provide tracking data that can be used to determineorbital parameters. such a capability would be a valuable addition toaustralian and global ssa assets, in terms of southern and eastern hemisphericcoverage. we provide a feasibility assessment of this proposal, based on simplecalculations and electromagnetic simulations that shows the detection ofsub-metre size debris should be possible (debris radius of &gt;0.5 m to ~1000 kmaltitude). we also present a proof-of-concept set of observations thatdemonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, based on the detection andtracking of the international space station via reflected fm broadcast signalsoriginating in south-west western australia. these observations broadlyvalidate our calculations and simulations.

1506.06150	confirmation of wide-field signatures in redshifted 21 cm power spectra	we confirm our recent prediction of the "pitchfork" foreground signature inpower spectra of high-redshift 21 cm measurements where the interferometer issensitive to large-scale structure on all baselines. this is due to theinherent response of a wide-field instrument and is characterized by enhancedpower from foreground emission in fourier modes adjacent to those considered tobe the most sensitive to the cosmological h i signal. in our recent paper, manysignatures from the simulation that predicted this feature were validatedagainst murchison widefield array (mwa) data, but this key pitchfork signaturewas close to the noise level. in this paper, we improve the data sensitivitythrough the coherent averaging of 12 independent snapshots with identicalinstrument settings and provide the first confirmation of the prediction with asignal-to-noise ratio &gt; 10. this wide-field effect can be mitigated by carefulantenna designs that suppress sensitivity near the horizon. simple models forantenna apertures that have been proposed for future instruments such as thehydrogen epoch of reionization array and the square kilometre array indicatethey should suppress foreground leakage from the pitchfork by ~40 db relativeto the mwa and significantly increase the likelihood of cosmological signaldetection in these critical fourier modes in the three-dimensional powerspectrum.

1507.01184	ionospheric modelling using gps to calibrate the mwa. 1: comparison of  first order ionospheric effects between gps models and mwa observations	we compare first order (refractive) ionospheric effects seen by the murchisonwidefield array (mwa) with the ionosphere as inferred from global positioningsystem (gps) data. the first order ionosphere manifests itself as a bulkposition shift of the observed sources across an mwa field of view. theseeffects can be computed from global ionosphere maps provided by gps analysiscentres, namely the center for orbit determination in europe (code), using datafrom globally distributed gps receivers. however, for the more accurate localionosphere estimates required for precision radio astronomy applications, datafrom local gps networks needs to be incorporated into ionospheric modelling.for gps observations, the ionospheric parameters are biased by gps receiverinstrument delays, among other effects, also known as receiver differentialcode biases (dcbs). the receiver dcbs need to be estimated for any non-code gpsstation used for ionosphere modelling, a requirement for establishing dense gpsnetworks in arbitrary locations in the vicinity of the mwa. in this work,single gps station-based ionospheric modelling is performed at a timeresolution of 10 minutes. also the receiver dcbs are estimated for selectedgeoscience australia (ga) gps receivers, located at murchison radio observatory(mro1), yarragadee (yar3), mount magnet (mtma) and wiluna (wilu). theionospheric gradients estimated from gps are compared with the ionosphericgradients inferred from radio source position shifts observed with the mwa. theionospheric gradients at all the gps stations show a correlation with thegradients observed with the mwa. the ionosphere estimates obtained using gpsmeasurements show promise in terms of providing calibration information for themwa.

1507.04819	broadband spectral modeling of the extreme gigahertz-peaked spectrum  radio source pks b0008-421	we present broadband observations and spectral modeling of pks b0008-421, andidentify it as an extreme gigahertz-peaked spectrum (gps) source. pks b0008-421is characterized by the steepest known spectral slope below the turnover, closeto the theoretical limit of synchrotron self-absorption, and the smallest knownspectral width of any gps source. spectral coverage of the source spans from0.118 to 22 ghz, which includes data from the murchison widefield array and thewide bandpass receivers on the australia telescope compact array. we haveimplemented a bayesian inference model fitting routine to fit the data withvarious absorption models. we find that without the inclusion of ahigh-frequency exponential break the absorption models can not accurately fitthe data, with significant deviations above and below the peak in the radiospectrum. the addition of a high-frequency break provides acceptable spectralfits for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption and double-componentsynchrotron self-absorption models, with the inhomogeneous free-free absorptionmodel statistically favored. the requirement of a high-frequency spectral breakimplies that the source has ceased injecting fresh particles. additionalsupport for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption model as being responsiblefor the turnover in the spectrum is given by the consistency between thephysical parameters derived from the model fit and the implications of theexponential spectral break, such as the necessity of the source beingsurrounded by a dense ambient medium to maintain the peak frequency near thegigahertz region. the discovery of pks b0008-421 suggests that the nextgeneration of low radio frequency surveys could reveal a large population ofgps sources that have ceased activity, and that a portion of the ultra-steepspectrum source population could be composed of these gps sources in a relicphase.

1508.00965	quantifying ionospheric effects on time-domain astrophysics with the  murchison widefield array	refraction and diffraction of incoming radio waves by the ionosphere inducetime variability in the angular positions, peak amplitudes and shapes of radiosources, potentially complicating the automated cross-matching andidentification of transient and variable radio sources. in this work, weempirically assess the effects of the ionosphere on data taken by the murchisonwidefield array (mwa) radio telescope. we directly examine 51 hours of dataobserved over 10 nights under quiet geomagnetic conditions (global storm indexkp &lt; 2), analysing the behaviour of short-timescale angular position and peakflux density variations of around ten thousand unresolved sources. we find thatwhile much of the variation in angular position can be attributed toionospheric refraction, the characteristic displacements (10-20 arcsec) at 154mhz are small enough that search radii of 1-2 arcmin should be sufficient forcross-matching under typical conditions. by examining bulk trends in amplitudevariability, we place upper limits on the modulation index associated withionospheric scintillation of 1-3% for the various nights. for sources fainterthan ~1 jy, this variation is below the image noise at typical mwasensitivities. our results demonstrate that the ionosphere is not a significantimpediment to the goals of time-domain science with the mwa at 154 mhz.

astro-ph;0001307	interpretation of the ogle q2237+0305 microlensing light-curve	the four bright images of the gravitationally lensed quasar q2237+0305 arebeing monitored from the ground (eg. ogle collaboration, apache pointobservatory) in the hope of observing a high magnification event (hme). overthe past three seasons (1997-1999) the ogle collaboration has producedmicrolensing light-curves with unprecedented coverage. these demonstratesmooth, independent (therefore microlensing) variability between the images(wozniak et al. 2000a,b; ogle web page). we have retrospectively comparedprobability functions for high-magnification event parameters with severalobserved light-curve features. we conclude that the 1999 image c peak was dueto the source having passed outside of a cusp rather than to a causticcrossing. in addition, we find that the image c light-curve shows evidence fora caustic crossing between the 1997 and 1998 observing seasons involving theappearance of new critical images. our models predict that the next image cevent is most likely to arrive 500 days following the 1999 peak, but with alarge uncertainty (100-2000 days). finally, given the image a light-curvederivative at the end of the 1999 observing season, our modelling suggests thata caustic crossing will occur between the 1999 and 2000 observing seasons,implying a minimum for the image a light-curve ~1-1.5 magnitudes fainter thanthe november 1999 level.

astro-ph;0004270	hidden galaxies in the fornax cluster	we are using the multibeam 21cm receiver on the parkes telescope combinedwith the optical two degree field spectrograph (2df) of the anglo-australiantelescope to obtain the first complete spectroscopic sample of the fornaxcluster. in the optical the survey is unique in that all objects (both``stars'' and ``galaxies'') within our magnitude limits (bj=16.5 to 19.7) aremeasured, producing the most complete survey of cluster members irrespective ofsurface brightness. we have detected two new classes of high surface brightnessdwarf galaxy in the cluster. with 2df we have discovered a population of verylow luminosity (mb approx -12) objects which are unresolved from the ground andmay be the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies; they are unlike any knowngalaxies. in a survey of the brighter (bj=16.5 to 18) galaxies with theflair-ii spectrograph we have found a number of new high surface brightnessdwarf galaxies and show that the fraction of star-forming dwarf galaxies in thecluster is about 30 per cent, about twice that implied by earlier morphologicalclassifications. our radio observations have greatly improved upon thesensitivity of the standard multibeam survey by using a new ``basket weave''scanning pattern. our initial analysis shows that we are detecting new clustermembers with hi masses of order 10-to-the-8 msun and hi mass-to-light ratios of1-2 msun/lsun.

astro-ph;0005267	an extragalactic hi cloud with no optical counterpart?	we report the discovery, from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass), of anisolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic. the himass of the cloud (hipass j1712-64) is very low, 1.7 x 10^7 msun, using anestimated distance of ~3.2 mpc. most significantly, we have found no opticalcompanion to this object to very faint limits (mu(b)~ 27 mag arcsec^-2). hipassj1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,hi 1225+01 (the virgo hi cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. the meanvelocity dispersion, measured with the australia telescope compact array(atca), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak ornon-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (t&lt;2000 k)rather than bulk motion or turbulence. the peak column density for hipassj1712-64, from the combined parkes and atca data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for starformation. apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties ofhipass j1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact highvelocity clouds. we therefore consider the evidence for a local group orgalactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712-64was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud/galaxy system atperigalacticon ~ 2 x 10^8 yr ago.

astro-ph;0302440	the 1000 brightest hipass galaxies: hi mass function and omega_hi	we present a new accurate measurement of the hi mass function of galaxiesfrom the hipass bright galaxy catalog, a sample of 1000 galaxies with thehighest hi peak flux densities in the southern hemisphere (koribalski et al.2003). this sample spans nearly four orders of magnitude in hi mass (from logm_hi/m_sun=6.8 to 10.6, h0=75) and is the largest sample of hi selectedgalaxies to date. we develop a bivariate maximum likelihood technique tomeasure the space density of galaxies, and show that this is a robust method,insensitive to the effects of large scale structure. the resulting hi massfunction can be fitted satisfactorily with a schechter function with faint-endslope alpha=-1.30. this slope is found to be dependent on morphological type,with later type galaxies giving steeper slopes. we extensively test variouseffects that potentially bias the determination of the hi mass function,including peculiar motions of galaxies, large scale structure, selection bias,and inclination effects, and quantify these biases. the large sample ofgalaxies enables an accurate measurement of the cosmological mass density ofneutral gas: omega_hi=(3.8 +/- 0.6) x 10^{-4}. low surface brightness galaxiescontribute only 15% to this value, consistent with previous findings.

astro-ph;0604442	the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies- ii. the star  formation rate density of the local universe	we derive observed halpha and r band luminosity densities of an hi-selectedsample of nearby galaxies using the singg sample to be l_halpha' = (9.4 +/-1.8)e38 h_70 erg s^-1 mpc^-3 for halpha and l_r' = (4.4 +/- 0.7)e37 h_70 ergs^-1 a^-1 mpc^-3 in the r band. this r band luminosity density is approximately70% of that found by the sloan digital sky survey. this leads to a local starformation rate density of log(sfrd) = -1.80 +0.13/-0.07(random) +/-0.03(systematic) + log(h_70) after applying a mean internal extinctioncorrection of 0.82 magnitudes. the gas cycling time of this sample is found tobe t_gas = 7.5 +1.3/-2.1 gyr, and the volume-averaged equivalent width of thesingg galaxies is ew(halpha) = 28.8 +7.2/-4.7 a (21.2 +4.2/-3.5 a withoutinternal dust correction). as with similar surveys, these results imply thatsfrd(z) decreases drastically from z ~ 1.5 to the present. a comparison of thedynamical masses of the singg galaxies evaluated at their optical limits withtheir stellar and hi masses shows significant evidence of downsizing: the mostmassive galaxies have a larger fraction of their mass locked up in starscompared with hi, while the opposite is true for less massive galaxies. we showthat the application of the kennicutt star formation law to a galaxy having themedian orbital time at the optical limit of this sample results in a starformation rate decay with cosmic time similar to that given by the sfrd(z)evolution. this implies that the sfrd(z) evolution is primarily due to thesecular evolution of galaxies, rather than interactions or mergers. this isconsistent with the morphologies predominantly seen in the singg sample.

astro-ph;9808023	the disruption of nearby galaxies by the milky way	interactions between galaxies are common and are an important factor indetermining their physical properties such as position along the hubblesequence and star-formation rate. there are many possible galaxy interactionmechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression,gravitational interaction and cluster tides. the relative importance of thesemechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly knownparameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halosthat surround galaxies. a nearby example of a galaxy interaction where themechanism is controversial is that between our own galaxy and two of itsneighbours -- the large and small magellanic clouds. here we present the firstresults of a new hi survey which provides a spectacular view of thisinteraction. in addition to the previously known magellanic stream, whichtrails 100 degrees behind the clouds, the new data reveal a counter-streamwhich lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the clouds. thisresult supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streamsare tidally torn from the body of the magellanic clouds.

astro-ph;9808065	x-ray properties of the parkes sample of flat-spectrum radio sources:  dust in radio-loud quasars?	we investigate the x-ray properties of the parkes sample of flat-spectrumradio sources using data from the rosat all-sky survey and archival pointedpspc observations. in total, 163 of the 323 sources are detected. for theremaining 160 sources 2 sigma upper limits to the x-ray flux are derived. wepresent power-law photon indices for 115 sources, which were either determinedwith a hardness ratio technique or from direct fits to pointed pspc data. forquasars, the soft x-ray photon index is correlated with redshift and with radiospectral index. webster et al. (1995) discovered many sources with unusuallyred optical continua among the quasars of this sample and interpreted thisresult in terms of extinction by dust. although the x-ray spectra in general donot show excess absorption, we find that low-redshift optically red quasarshave significantly lower soft x-ray luminosities on average than objects withblue optical continua. the difference disappears for higher redshifts, as isexpected for intrinsic absorption by cold gas associated with the dust.alternative explanations are briefly discussed. we conclude, however, that dustdoes play an important role in some of the radio-loud quasars with red opticalcontinua.

astro-ph;9901339	the distribution of microlensed light curve derivatives: the  relationship between stellar proper motions and transverse velocity	we present a method for computing the probability distribution of microlensedlight curve derivatives both in the case of a static lens with a transversevelocity, and in the case of microlensing that is produced through stellarproper motions. the distributions are closely related in form, and can beconsidered equivalent after appropriate scaling of the input transversevelocity. the comparison of the distributions in this manner provides aconsistent way to consider the relative contribution to microlensing (bothlarge and small fluctuations) of the two classes of motion, a problem that isotherwise an extremely expensive computational exercise. we find that therelative contribution of stellar proper motions to the microlensing rate isindependent of the mass function assumed for the microlenses, but is a functionof optical depth and shear. we find that stellar proper motions produce ahigher overall microlensing rate than a transverse velocity of the samemagnitude. this effect becomes more pronounced at higher optical depth. withthe introduction of shear, the relative rates of microlensing become dependenton the direction of the transverse velocity. this may have importantconsequences in the case of quadruply lensed quasars such as q2237+0305, wherethe alignment of the shear vector with the source trajectory varies betweenimages.

astro-ph;9904359	limits on the microlens mass function of q2237+0305	gravitational microlensing at cosmological distances is potentially apowerful tool for probing the mass functions of stars and compact objects inother galaxies. in the case of multiply-imaged quasars, microlensing data hasbeen used to determine the average microlens mass. however the measurementshave relied on an assumed transverse velocity for the lensing galaxy. since themeasured mass scales with the square of the transverse velocity, published masslimits are quite uncertain. in the case of q2237+0305 we have properlyconstrained this uncertainty. the distribution of light curve derivativesallows quantitative treatment of the relative rates of microlensing due toproper motions of microlenses, the orbital stream motion of microlenses and thebulk galactic transverse velocity. by demanding that the microlensing rate dueto the motions of microlenses is the minimum that should be observed wedetermine lower limits for the average mass of stars and compact objects in thebulge of q2237+0305. if microlenses are assumed to move in an orbital streamthe lower limit ranges between 0.005 and 0.023 solar masses where the thesystematic dependence is due to the fraction of smooth matter and the size ofphotometric error assumed for published monitoring data. however, if themicrolenses are assumed to move according to an isotropic velocity dispersionthen a larger lower limit of 0.019-0.11 solar masses is obtained. a significantcontribution of jupiter mass compact objects to the mass distribution of thegalactic bulge of q2237+0305 is therefore unambiguously ruled out.

astro-ph;9904361	a gravitational microlensing determination of continuum source size in  q2237+0305	following the detection of a gravitational microlensing high magnificationevent (hme) in q2237+0305a attempts have been made to place limits on thedimensions of the quasar continuum source. the analyses have studied either theobserved event magnitude or the event duration. the latter approach has beenhampered by lack of knowledge about the transverse velocity of the lensinggalaxy. we obtain both upper and lower statistical limits on the size of thecontinuum source from the observed hme using determinations of transversevelocity obtained from the published monitoring data. our calculations takeaccount of the caustic orientation as well as the component of the causticvelocity that results from stellar proper motions. our determination of sourcesize relies on an estimated duration of 52 days for the hme, and so will berefined when more hmes are observed. we find that the upper and lower limits onthe magnified region of the r-band continuum source are 6 times 10^15 and 2times 10^13 cm respectively (99% confidence). through consideration of thejoint probability for source size and mean microlens mass we find that the meanmass lies between ~0.01 solar masses and ~1 solar mass (95% confidence).

astro-ph;9908120	the rate of caustic crossing microlensing events for q2237+0305	spectrophotometric observation of the gravitationally microlensed quasarq2237+0305 during a high magnification event (hme) is potentially a verypowerful tool for probing the structure of the quasars accretion disc on scalesof less than 10^-8 arc seconds. how often we can expect to observe a hme isdependent on the lens system parameters of galactic transverse velocity, meanmicrolens mass and the size of the magnified continuum source. we havepreviously used published microlensed light-curves to obtain expressions forthe likely-hood of the values for these parameters (wyithe, webster &amp; turner1999b,2000; wyithe, webster, turner &amp; mortlock 2000). here we use thisinformation to investigate the expected rate of shmes. we find the average rateof shmes as well as the number that we can expect to observe over periods of adecade and of a single observing season. we find that the average shme ratesummed over all images in q2237+0305 is 1.5\pm0.6 - 6.3\pm1.3 events perdecade. during the period following a caustic crossing we find that the eventrate in the corresponding image is enhanced by 50-100%, and therefore that theoverall event rate may be higher during these periods.  from the distribution of events expected during a 6 month period we find thatthere is 1 chance in 4-10 of observing a shme per observing season. thesystematic dependence in these values arises from the different assumptions forsmooth matter content, orientation of the galactic transverse velocity and thesize of photometric error in the monitoring data. the results support continuedmonitoring of q2237+0305 with the aim of obtaining detailed spectroscopic andphotometric observations of a shme.

astro-ph;9911245	a small source in q2237+0305 ?	microlensing in q2237+0305 between 1985 and 1995 (eg. irwin et al. 1989;corrigan et al. 1991; ostensen et al. 1996) has been interpreted in twodifferent ways; as microlensing by stellar mass objects of a continuum sourcehaving dimensions significantly smaller than the microlens einstein radius (er)(eg. wambsganss, paczynski &amp; schneider 1990; rauch &amp; blandford 1991), and asmicrolensing by very low mass objects of a source as large as 5 er (refsdal &amp;stabell 1993; haugan 1996). in this paper we present evidence in favour of asmall source. limits on the source size (in units of er) are obtained from thecombination of limits on the number of microlens einstein radii crossed by thesource during the monitoring period with two separate light-curve features.firstly, recently published monitoring data (wozniak et al. 2000; ogle webpage) show large variations (~0.8-1.5 magnitudes) between image brightnessesover a period of 700 days or ~15% of the monitoring period. secondly, the 1988peak in the image a light-curve had a duration that is a small fraction (&lt;0.02)of the monitoring period. such rapid microlensing rises and short microlensingpeaks only occur for small sources. we find that the observed large-rapidvariation limits the source size to be &lt;0.2 er (95% confidence). the width ofthe light-curve peak provides a stronger constraint of &lt;0.02 er (99%confidence). the einstein radius (projected into the source plane) of theaverage microlens mass (m) in q2237+0305 is er ~ 10^{17}\sqrt{m} cm. theinterpretation that stars are responsible for microlensing in q2237+0305therefore results in limits on the continuum source size that are consistentwith current accretion disc theory.

0810.1092	a microlensing study of the accretion disc in the quasar mg 0414+0534	observations of gravitational microlensing in multiply imaged quasarscurrently provide the only direct probe of quasar emission region structure onsub-microarcsecond scales. analyses of microlensing variability areobservationally expensive, requiring long-term monitoring of lensed systems.here we demonstrate a technique for constraining the size of the quasarcontinuum emission region as a function of wavelength using single-epochmulti-band imaging. we have obtained images of the lensed quasar mg 0414+0534in five wavelength bands using the magellan 6.5-metre baade telescope at lascampanas observatory, chile. these data, in combination with two existingepochs of hubble space telescope data, are used to model the size of thecontinuum emission region $\sigma$ as a power-law in wavelength,$\sigma\propto\lambda^\nu$. we place an upper limit on the gaussian width ofthe $r^\prime$-band emission region of $1.80 \times 10^{16} h_{70}^{-1/2}(&lt;m&gt;/\rmn{m}_{\odot})^{1/2}$cm, and constrain the power-law index to$0.77\leq\nu\leq2.67$ (95 per cent confidence range). these results can be usedto constrain models of quasar accretion discs. as a example, we find that theaccretion disc in mg 0414+0534 is statistically consistent with ashakura-sunyaev thin disc model.

0812.0748	stars and dark matter in the spiral gravitational lens 2237+0305	we construct a mass model for the spiral lens galaxy 2237+0305, at redshiftz_l=0.04, based on gravitational-lensing constraints, hi rotation, and newstellar-kinematic information, based on data taken with the esi spectrograph onthe 10m keck-ii telescope. high resolution rotation curves and velocitydispersion profiles along two perpendicular directions, close to the major andminor axes of the lens galaxy, were obtained by fitting the mgb-fe absorptionline region. the stellar rotation curve rises slowly and flattens at r~1.5"(~1.1 kpc). the velocity dispersion profile is approximately flat. acombination of photometric, kinematic and lensing information is used toconstruct a mass model for the four major mass components of the system -- thedark matter halo, disc, bulge, and bar. the best-fitting solution has a darkmatter halo with a logarithmic inner density slope of gamma=0.9+/-0.3 forrho_dm propto r^-gamma, a bulge with m/l_b=6.6+/-0.3 upsilon_odot, and a discwith m/l_b =1.2+/-0.3 upsilon_odot, in agreement with measurements of late-typespirals. the bulge dominates support in the inner regions where the multipleimages are located and is therefore tightly constrained by the observations.the disc is sub-maximal and contributes 45+/-11 per cent of the rotationalsupport of the galaxy at 2.2r_d. the halo mass is (2.0+/-0.6) x 10^12 m_odot,and the stellar to virial mass ratio is 7.0+/-2.3 per cent, consistent withtypical galaxies of the same mass.
