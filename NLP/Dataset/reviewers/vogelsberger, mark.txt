quant-ph;0607221	nonadiabatic transitions for a decaying two-level-system: geometrical  and dynamical contributions	we study the landau-zener problem for a decaying two-level-system describedby a non-hermitean hamiltonian, depending analytically on time. use of asuper-adiabatic basis allows to calculate the non-adiabatic transitionprobability p in the slow-sweep limit, without specifying the hamiltonianexplicitly. it is found that p consists of a ``dynamical'' and a``geometrical'' factors. the former is determined by the complex adiabaticeigenvalues e_(t), only, whereas the latter solely requires the knowledge of\alpha_(+-)(t), the ratio of the components of each of the adiabaticeigenstates. both factors can be split into a universal one, depending only onthe complex level crossing points, and a nonuniversal one, involving the fulltime dependence of e_(+-)(t). this general result is applied to theakulin-schleich model where the initial upper level is damped with dampingconstant $\gamma$. for analytic power-law sweeps we find that stueckelbergoscillations of p exist for gamma smaller than a critical value gamma_c anddisappear for gamma &gt; gamma_c. a physical interpretation of this behavior willbe presented by use of a damped harmonic oscillator.

0906.4341	caustics in growing cold dark matter haloes	we simulate the growth of isolated dark matter haloes from self-similar andspherically symmetric initial conditions. our n-body code integrates thegeodesic deviation equation in order to track the streams and causticsassociated with individual simulation particles. the radial orbit instabilitycauses our haloes to develop major-to-minor axis ratios approaching 10 to 1 intheir inner regions. they grow similarly in time and have similar densityprofiles to the spherical similarity solution, but their detailed structure isvery different. the higher dimensionality of the orbits causes their stream andcaustic densities to drop much more rapidly than in the similarity solution.this results in a corresponding increase in the number of streams at eachpoint. at 1% of the turnaround radius (corresponding roughly to the sun'sposition in the milky way) we find of order 10^6 streams in our simulations, ascompared to 10^2 in the similarity solution. the number of caustics in theinner halo increases by a factor of several, because a typical orbit has sixturning points rather than one, but caustic densities drop by a much largerfactor. this reduces the caustic contribution to the annihilation radiation.for the region between 1% and 50% of the turnaround radius, this is 4% of thetotal in our simulated haloes, as compared to 6.5% in the similarity solution.caustics contribute much less at smaller radii. these numbers assume a 100 gevc^-2 neutralino with present-day velocity dispersion 0.03 cm s^-1, but reducingthe dispersion by ten orders of magnitude only doubles the caustic luminosity.we conclude that caustics will be unobservable in the inner parts of haloes.only the outermost caustic might potentially be detectable.

1001.2310	secondary infall and the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of cold  dark matter halos	we use n-body simulations to investigate the radial dependence of the densityand velocity dispersion in cold dark matter (cdm) halos. in particular, weexplore how closely q rho/sigma^3, a surrogate measure of the phase-spacedensity, follows a power-law in radius. our study extends earlier work byconsidering, in addition to spherically-averaged profiles, local q-estimatesfor individual particles, q_i; profiles based on the ellipsoidal radiusdictated by the triaxial structure of the halo, q_i(r'); and by carefullyremoving substructures in order to focus on the profile of the smooth halo,q^s. the resulting q_i^s(r') profiles follow closely a power law near thecenter, but show a clear upturn from this trend near the virial radius,r_{200}. the location and magnitude of the deviations are in excellentagreement with the predictions from bertschinger's spherical secondary-infallsimilarity solution. in this model, q \propto r^{-1.875} in the inner,virialized regions, but departures from a power-law occur near r_{200} becauseof the proximity of this radius to the location of the first shell crossing -the shock radius in the case of a collisional fluid. particles there have notyet fully virialized, and so q departs from the inner power-law profile. ourresults imply that the power-law nature of $q$ profiles only applies to theinner regions and cannot be used to predict accurately the structure of cdmhalos beyond their characteristic scale radius.

1002.3162	streams and caustics: the fine-grained structure of lcdm haloes	we present the first and so far the only simulations to follow thefine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic lcdminitial conditions. we integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem withthe n-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numericallyconverged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams andtheir associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. our effectiveresolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achievedby conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. we apply thesemethods to the six milky way-mass haloes of the aquarius project. at 8 kpc fromhalo centre a typical point intersects about 10^14 streams with a very broadrange of individual densities; the ~10^6 most massive streams contribute abouthalf of the local dark matter density. as a result, the velocity distributionof dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most massivefine-grained stream contributing about 0.1% of the total signal. dark matterparticles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the big bang.the peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all liewell below the mean local dark matter density. as a result caustics provide anegligible boost (&lt;0.1%) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate.the effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10%.thus fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on thedetectability of dark matter, either directly in earth-bound laboratories, orindirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonantcavity experiments searching for axions may see the most massive localfine-grained streams because of their extreme localisation in energy/momentumspace.

1007.4195	nonspherical similarity solutions for dark halo formation	we carry out fully 3-dimensional simulations of evolution from self-similar,spherically symmetric linear perturbations of a cold dark matter dominatedeinstein-de sitter universe. as a result of the radial orbit instability, thehaloes which grow from such initial conditions are triaxial with major-to-minoraxis ratios of order 3:1. they nevertheless grow approximately self-similarlyin time. in all cases they have power-law density profiles and near-constantvelocity anisotropy in their inner regions. both the power-law index and thevalue of the velocity anisotropy depend on the similarity index of the initialconditions, the former as expected from simple scaling arguments. halostructure is thus not "universal" but remembers the initial conditions. onlarger scales the density and anisotropy profiles show two characteristicscales, corresponding to particles at first pericentre and at first apocentreafter infall. they are well approximated by the nfw model only for one value ofthe similarity index. in contrast, at all radii within the outer caustic thepseudo phase-space density can be fit by a single power law with an index whichdepends only very weakly on the similarity index of the initial conditions.this behaviour is very similar to that found for haloes formed from lcdminitial conditions and so can be considered approximately universal.

1011.3082	consistent scenarios for cosmic-ray excesses from sommerfeld-enhanced  dark matter annihilation	anomalies in direct and indirect detection have motivated models of darkmatter consisting of a multiplet of nearly-degenerate states, coupled by a newgev-scale interaction. we perform a careful analysis of the thermal freezeoutof dark matter annihilation in such a scenario. we compute the range of "boostfactors" arising from sommerfeld enhancement in the local halo for models whichproduce the correct relic density, and show the effect of including constraintson the saturated enhancement from the cosmic microwave background (cmb). wefind that boost factors from sommerfeld enhancement of up to ~800 are possiblein the local halo. when the cmb bounds on the saturated enhancement areapplied, the maximal boost factor is reduced to ~400 for 1-2 tev dark matterand sub-gev force carriers, but remains large enough to explain the observedfermi and pamela electronic signals. we describe regions in the dm mass-boostfactor plane where the cosmic ray data is well fit for a range of final states,and show that sommerfeld enhancement alone is enough to provide the largeannihilation cross sections required to fit the data, although for lightmediator masses (less than ~200 mev) there is tension with the cmb constraintsin the absence of astrophysical boost factors from substructure. additionally,we consider the circumstances under which wimponium formation is relevant andfind for heavy wimps (greater than ~2 tev) and soft-spectrum annihilationchannels it can be an important consideration; we find regions with dark mattermass greater than 2.8 tev that are consistent with the cmb bounds and have~600-700 present-day boost factors.

1103.0776	the cosmic x-ray and gamma-ray background from dark matter annihilation	(abridged) the extragalactic background light (ebl) observed at multiplewavelengths is a promising tool to probe the nature of dark matter since itmight contain a significant contribution from gamma-rays produced promptly bydark matter annihilation. additionally, the electrons and positrons produced inthe annihilation give energy to the cmb photons to populate the ebl with x-raysand gamma-rays. we here create full-sky maps of the radiation from both ofthese contributions using the high-resolution millennium-ii simulation. we useupper limits on the contributions of unknown sources to the ebl to constrainthe intrinsic properties of dark matter using a model-independent approach thatcan be employed as a template to test different particle physics models(including those with a sommerfeld enhancement). these upper limits are basedon observations spanning eight orders of magnitude in energy (from soft x-raysmeasured by chandra to gamma-rays measured by fermi), and on expectations forthe contributions from blazars and star forming galaxies. to exemplify thisapproach, we analyze a set of benchmark sommerfeld-enhanced models that givethe correct dark matter abundance, satisfy cmb constraints, and fit the cosmicray spectra measured by pamela and fermi without any contribution from localsubhalos. we find that these models are in conflict with the ebl constraintsunless the contribution of unresolved subhalos is small and the annihilationsignal dominates the ebl. we conclude that provided the collisionless cold darkmatter paradigm is accurate, even for conservative estimates of thecontribution from unresolved subhalos and astrophysical backgrounds, the ebl isat least as sensitive a probe of these types of scenarios as the cmb. ourresults disfavor an explanation of the positron excess measured by pamela basedonly on dark matter annihilation in the smooth galactic halo.

1104.1566	the shape of dark matter haloes in the aquarius simulations: evolution  and memory	we use the high resolution cosmological n-body simulations from the aquariusproject to investigate in detail the mechanisms that determine the shape ofmilky way-type dark matter haloes. we find that, when measured at theinstantaneous virial radius, the shape of individual haloes changes with time,evolving from a typically prolate configuration at early stages to a moretriaxial/oblate geometry at the present day. this evolution in halo shapecorrelates well with the distribution of the infalling material: prolateconfigurations arise when haloes are fed through narrow filaments, whichcharacterizes the early epochs of halo assembly, whereas triaxial/oblateconfigurations result as the accretion turns more isotropic at later times.interestingly, at redshift z=0, clear imprints of the past history of each haloare recorded in their shapes at different radii, which also exhibit a variationfrom prolate in the inner regions to triaxial/oblate in the outskirts. providedthat the aquarius haloes are fair representatives of milky way-like 10^12 msunobjects, we conclude that the shape of such dark matter haloes is a complex,time-dependent property, with each radial shell retaining memory of theconditions at the time of collapse.

1105.2293	the effects of patchy reionization on satellite galaxies of the milky  way	we combine the high-resolution aquarius simulations with three-dimensionalmodels of reionization based on the initial density field of the aquariusparent simulation, millennium-ii, to study the impact of patchy reionization onthe faint satellite population of milky way halos. because the aquarius suiteconsists of zoom-in simulations of halos in the millennium-ii volume, we followthe formation of substructure and the growth of reionization bubbles due to thelarger environment simultaneously, and thereby determine the reionizationredshifts of satellite candidates. we do this for four different reionizationmodels, and also compare results to instantaneous reionization. using a simpleprocedure for selecting satellites and assigning luminosities in thesimulations, we compare the resulting satellite populations. we find that theoverall number of satellites depends sensitively on the reionization model,with a factor of 3-4 variation between the four models for a given host halo,although the difference is entirely in the population of faint satellites (m_v&gt; -10). in addition, we find that for a given reionization model the totalnumber of satellites differs by 10%-20% between the patchy and homogeneousscenarios, provided that the redshift is chosen appropriately for theinstantaneous case. however, the halo-halo scatter from the six aquarius halosis large, up to a factor of 2-3, and so is comparable to the difference betweenreionization scenarios. in order to use the population of faint dwarf galaxiesaround the milky way as a probe of the local reionization history, then, it isnecessary to first better understand the general distribution of substructurearound milky way-mass halos.

1106.2543	neutrino signatures on the high transmission regions of the lyman-alpha  forest	we quantify the impact of massive neutrinos on the statistics of low densityregions in the intergalactic medium (igm) as probed by the lyman-alpha forestat redshifts z=2.2--4. based on mock but realistic quasar (qso) spectraextracted from hydrodynamic simulations with cold dark matter, baryons andneutrinos, we find that the probability distribution of weak lyman-alphaabsorption features, as sampled by lyman-alpha flux regions at hightransmissivity, is strongly affected by the presence of massive neutrinos. weshow that systematic errors affecting the lyman-alpha forest reduce but do noterase the neutrino signal. using the fisher matrix formalism, we conclude thatthe sum of the neutrino masses can be measured, using the method proposed inthis paper, with a precision smaller than 0.4 ev using a catalog of 200 highresolution (s/n~100) qso spectra. this number reduces to 0.27 ev by making useof reasonable priors in the other parameters that also affect the statistics ofthe high transitivity regions of the lyman-alpha forest. the constraintsobtained with this method can be combined with independent bounds from the cmb,large scale structures and measurements of the matter power spectrum from thelyman-alpha forest to produce tighter upper limits on the sum of the masses ofthe neutrinos.

1109.1281	moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics	we present the first hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation usingthe new moving mesh code arepo and compare the results with gadget simulationsbased on a traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) technique. the twocodes share the same tree-pm gravity solver and include identicalsub-resolution physics, but employ different methods to solve the equations ofhydrodynamics. this allows us to assess the impact of hydro-solveruncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. wefocus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic starformation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numericalmethods. properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by keres etal. (2011), while a third paper by sijacki et al. (2011) uses idealisedsimulations to analyse the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. wefind that the global baryon statistics differ significantly between the twosimulation approaches. arepo shows higher star formation rates at late times,lower mean temperatures, and different gas mass fractions in characteristicphases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas.although both codes use the same implementation of cooling, more gas cools outof haloes in arepo compared with gadget towards low redshifts. we show thatthis is caused by a higher heating rate with sph in the outer parts of haloes,owing to viscous dissipation of sph's inherent sonic velocity noise and sph'sefficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region,and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in arepo. as a result ofsuch differences, arepo leads also to more disk-like morphologies compared togadget. our results indicate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can leadto comparatively large systematic differences.

1109.3468	moving mesh cosmology: the hydrodynamics of galaxy formation	we present a detailed comparison between the well-known sph code gadget andthe new moving-mesh code arepo on a number of hydrodynamical test problems.through a variety of numerical experiments we establish a clear link betweentest problems and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulationsof galaxy formation. our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the sph method inseveral sectors. these accuracy problems not only manifest themselves inidealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulationsetups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting gas properties in the fullcosmological framework, as highlighted in papers by vogelsberger et al. (2011)and keres et al. (2011). we find that an inadequate treatment of fluidinstabilities in gadget suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimatesvorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping frominfalling substructures. in idealized tests of inside-out disk formation, theconvergence rate of gas disk sizes is much slower in gadget due to spuriousangular momentum transport. in simulations where we follow the interactionbetween a forming central disk and orbiting substructures in a halo, the finaldisk morphology is strikingly different. in arepo, gas from infallingsubstructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host haloatmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disk. conversely,gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in gadget simulations, morphologicallytransforming the disk as they impact it. the numerical artefacts of the sphsolver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitablyaffect cosmological simulations due to their hierarchical nature. our numericalexperiments clearly demonstrate that arepo delivers a physically more reliablesolution.

1109.4638	moving mesh cosmology: characteristics of galaxies and haloes	we discuss cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formationperformed with the new moving-mesh code arepo, which promises higher accuracycompared with the traditional sph technique that has been widely employed forthis problem. we use an identical set of physics in corresponding simulationscarried out with the well-tested sph code gadget, adopting also the samehigh-resolution gravity solver. we are thus able to compare both simulationsets on an object-by-object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact ofdifferent hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. in accompanyingpapers, we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted bythe simulation codes, (vogelsberger et al. 2011) and complementary idealizedsimulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes(sijacki et al. 2011). here we investigate their influence on the baryonicproperties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. we find thatarepo leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies inmassive haloes and to more extended gaseous disks in galaxies, which alsofeature a thinner and smoother morphology than their gadget counterparts.consequently, galaxies formed in arepo have larger sizes and higher specificangular momentum than their sph correspondents. the more efficient coolingflows in arepo yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centers (andthe opposite trend in halo outskirts) leading to higher star formation rates ofmassive galaxies. while both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number ofbaryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results clearly demonstrate thatgalaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accuratehydrodynamical techniques such as arepo.

1110.0324	dark matter implications of the fermi-lat measurement of anisotropies in  the diffuse gamma-ray background: status report	for the first time, the fermi-lat measured the angular power spectrum (aps)of anisotropies in the diffuse gamma-ray background. the data is found to bebroadly compatible with a model with contributions from the point sources inthe 1-year catalog, the galactic diffuse background, and the extragalacticisotropic emission; however deviations are present at both large and smallangular scales. in this study, we complement the model with a contribution fromdark matter (dm) whose distribution is modeled exploiting the results of themost recent n-body simulations, considering the contribution of extragalactichalos and subhalos (from millennium-ii) and of galactic substructures (fromaquarius). with the use of the fermi science tools, these simulations serve astemplates to produce mock gamma-ray count maps for dm gamma-ray emission, bothin the case of an annihilating and a decaying dm candidate. the aps will thenbe computed and compared with the fermi-lat results to derive constraints onthe dm particle physics properties. the possible systematic due to an imperfectmodel of the galactic foreground is also studied and taken into accountproperly. the present paper reports on the status of the project.

1110.5635	moving mesh cosmology: properties of gas disks	we compare the structural properties of galaxies formed in cosmologicalsimulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) code gadget withthose using the moving-mesh code arepo. both codes employ identical gravitysolvers and the same sub-resolution physics but use very different methods totrack the hydrodynamic evolution of gas. this permits us to isolate the effectsof the hydro solver on the formation and evolution of galactic gas disks ingadget and arepo haloes with comparable numerical resolution. in a matchingsample of gadget and arepo haloes we fit simulated gas disks with exponentialprofiles. we find that the cold gas disks formed using the moving mesh approachhave systematically larger disk scale lengths and higher specific angularmomenta than their gadget counterparts across a wide range in halo masses. forlow mass galaxies differences between the properties of the simulated galaxydisks are caused by an insufficient number of resolution elements which lead tothe artificial angular momentum transfer in our sph calculation. we howeverfind that galactic disks formed in massive halos, resolved with 10^6particles/cells, are still systematically smaller in the gadget run by a factorof ~2. the reasons for this are: 1) the excessive heating of haloes close tothe cooling radius due to spurious dissipation of the subsonic turbulence ingadget; and 2) the efficient delivery of low angular momentum gaseous blobs tothe bottom of the potential well. while this large population of gaseous blobsin gadget originates from the filaments which are pressure confined andfragment due to the sph surface tension while infalling into hot haloatmospheres, it is essentially absent in the moving mesh calculation, clearlyindicating numerical rather than physical origin of the blob material.

1201.5892	subhaloes in self-interacting galactic dark matter haloes	we present n-body simulations of a new class of self-interacting dark mattermodels, which do not violate any astrophysical constraints due to anon-power-law velocity dependence of the transfer cross section which ismotivated by a yukawa-like new gauge boson interaction. specifically, we focuson the formation of a milky way-like dark matter halo taken from the aquariusproject and re-simulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowedparameter space of this new model. we find that for these cases, the main haloonly develops a small core (~1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical tothat of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. neitherthe subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes arealtered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner densitystructure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. as aconsequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloesdiffer significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstratethat they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest milky waydsphs in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario.specifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloesthat are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of themilky way dsphs. we conclude that these models offer an interesting alternativeto the cold dark matter model that can reduce the recently reported tensionbetween the brightest milky way satellites and the dense subhaloes found incold dark matter simulations.

1203.1037	multi-dimensional, compressible viscous flow on a moving voronoi mesh	numerous formulations of finite volume schemes for the euler andnavier-stokes equations exist, but in the majority of cases they have beendeveloped for structured and stationary meshes. in many applications, moreflexible mesh geometries that can dynamically adjust to the problem at hand andmove with the flow in a (quasi) lagrangian fashion would, however, be highlydesirable, as this can allow a significant reduction of advection errors and anaccurate realization of curved and moving boundary conditions. here we describea novel formulation of viscous continuum hydrodynamics that solves theequations of motion on a voronoi mesh created by a set of mesh-generatingpoints. the points can move in an arbitrary manner, but the most natural motionis that given by the fluid velocity itself, such that the mesh dynamicallyadjusts to the flow. owing to the mathematical properties of the voronoitessellation, pathological mesh-twisting effects are avoided. ourimplementation considers the full navier-stokes equations and has been realizedin the arepo code both in 2d and 3d. we propose a new approach to computeaccurate viscous fluxes for a dynamic voronoi mesh, and use this to formulate afinite volume solver of the navier-stokes equations. through a number of testproblems, including circular couette flow and flow past a cylindrical obstacle,we show that our new scheme combines good accuracy with geometric flexibility,and hence promises to be competitive with other highly refined eulerianmethods. this will in particular allow astrophysical applications of the arepocode where physical viscosity is important, such as in the hot plasma in galaxyclusters, or for viscous accretion disk models.

0711.1105	the fine-grained phase-space structure of cold dark matter halos	we present a new and completely general technique for calculating thefine-grained phase-space structure of dark matter throughout the galactic halo.our goal is to understand this structure on the scales relevant for direct andindirect detection experiments. our method is based on evaluating the geodesicdeviation equation along the trajectories of individual dm particles. itrequires no assumptions about the symmetry or stationarity of the haloformation process. in this paper we study general static potentials whichexhibit more complex behaviour than the separable potentials studiedpreviously. for ellipsoidal logarithmic potentials with a core, phase mixing issensitive to the resonance structure, as indicated by the number of independentorbital frequencies. regions of chaotic mixing can be identified by the veryrapid decrease in the real space density of the associated dark matter streams.we also study the evolution of stream density in ellipsoidal nfw halos withradially varying isopotential shape, showing that if such a model is applied tothe galactic halo, at least $10^5$ streams are expected near the sun. the mostnovel aspect of our approach is that general non-static systems can be studiedthrough implementation in a cosmological n-body code. such an implementationallows a robust and accurate evaluation of the enhancements in annihilationradiation due to fine-scale structure such as caustics. we embed the scheme inthe current state-of-the-art code gadget-3 and present tests which demonstratethat n-body discreteness effects can be kept under control in realisticconfigurations.

1209.2118	moving mesh cosmology: properties of neutral hydrogen in absorption	we examine the distribution of neutral hydrogen in cosmological simulationscarried out with the new moving-mesh code arepo and compare it with thecorresponding gadget simulations based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics(sph) technique. the two codes use identical gravity solvers and baryonicphysics implementations, but very different methods for solving the eulerequations, allowing us to assess how numerical effects associated with thehydro-solver impact the results of simulations. here we focus on an analysis ofthe neutral gas, as detected in quasar absorption lines. we find that the highcolumn density regime probed by damped lyman-alpha (dla) and lyman limitsystems (lls) exhibits significant differences between the codes. gadgetproduces spurious artefacts in large halos in the form of gaseous clumps,boosting the lls cross-section. furthermore, it forms halos with denser centralbaryonic cores than arepo, which leads to a substantially greater dlacross-section from smaller halos. arepo thus produces a significantly lowercumulative abundance of dlas, which is intriguingly in much closer agreementwith observations. the column density function, however, is not altered enoughto significantly reduce the discrepancy with the observed value. for the lowcolumn density gas probed by the lyman-alpha forest, the codes differ only atthe level of a few percent, suggesting that this regime is quite well describedby both methods, a fact that is reassuring for the many lyman-alpha studiescarried out with sph thus far. while the residual differences are smaller thanthe errors on current lyman-alpha forest data, we note that this will likelychange for future precision experiments.

1211.1377	direct detection of self-interacting dark matter	self-interacting dark matter offers an interesting alternative tocollisionless dark matter because of its ability to preserve the large-scalesuccess of the cold dark matter model, while seemingly solving its challengeson small scales. we present here the first study of the expected dark matterdetection signal taking into account different self-scattering models. wedemonstrate that models with constant and velocity dependent cross sections,which are consistent with observational constraints, lead to distinctsignatures in the velocity distribution, because non-thermalised features foundin the cold dark matter distribution are thermalised through particlescattering. depending on the model, self-interaction can lead to a 10%reduction of the recoil rates at high energies, corresponding to a minimumspeed that can cause recoil larger than 300 km/s, compared to the cold darkmatter case. at lower energies these differences are smaller than 5% for allmodels. the amplitude of the annual modulation signal can increase by up to25%, and the day of maximum amplitude can shift by about two weeks with respectto the cold dark matter expectation. furthermore, the exact day of phasereversal of the modulation signal can also differ by about a week between thedifferent models. in general, models with velocity dependent cross sectionspeaking at the typical velocities of dwarf galaxies lead only to minor changesin the detection signals, whereas allowed constant cross section models lead tosignificant changes. we conclude that different self-interacting dark matterscenarios might be distinguished from each other through the details of directdetection signals. furthermore, detailed constraints on the intrinsicproperties of dark matter based on null detections, should take into accountthe possibility of self-scattering and the resulting effects on the detectorsignal.

1211.6426	constraining self-interacting dark matter with the milky way's dwarf  spheroidals	self-interacting dark matter is an attractive alternative to the cold darkmatter paradigm only if it is able to substantially reduce the centraldensities of dwarf-size haloes while keeping the densities and shapes ofcluster-size haloes within current constraints. given the seemingly stringentnature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a decade that sidm would beviable only if the cross section for self-scattering was stronglyvelocity-dependent. however, it has recently been suggested that a constantcross section per unit mass of sigma_t/m~0.1cm^2/g is sufficient to accomplishthe desired effect. we explicitly investigate this claim using high resolutioncosmological simulations of a milky-way size halo and find that, similarly tothe cold dark matter case, such cross section produces a population of massivesubhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the classical dwarfspheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of the mass profiles offornax and sculptor. this problem is resolved if sigma_t/m~1cm^2/g at the dwarfspheroidal scales. since this value is likely inconsistent with the halo shapesof several clusters, our results leave only a small window open for avelocity-independent self-interacting dark matter model to work as a distinctalternative to cold dark matter.

1212.0541	hot x-ray coronae around massive spiral galaxies: a unique probe of  structure formation models	luminous x-ray gas coronae in the dark matter halos of massive spiralgalaxies are a fundamental prediction of structure formation models, yet only afew such coronae have been detected so far. in this paper, we study the hotx-ray coronae beyond the optical disks of two normal massive spirals, ngc1961and ngc6753. based on xmm-newton x-ray observations, hot gaseous emission isdetected to ~60 kpc - well beyond their optical radii. the hot gas has abest-fit temperature of kt~0.6 kev and an abundance of ~0.1 solar, and exhibitsa fairly uniform distribution, suggesting that the quasi-static gas resides inhydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxies. the bolometricluminosity of the gas in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region (r_200 is the virialradius) is ~6e40 erg/s for both galaxies. the baryon mass fractions of ngc1961and ngc6753 are f_b~0.1, which fall short of the cosmic baryon fraction. thehot coronae around ngc1961 and ngc6753 offer an excellent basis to probestructure formation simulations. to this end, the observations are confrontedwith the moving mesh code arepo and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics codegadget. although neither model gives a perfect description, the observedluminosities, gas masses, and abundances favor the arepo code. moreover, theshape and the normalization of the observed density profiles are betterreproduced by arepo within ~0.5r_200. however, neither model incorporatesefficient feedback from supermassive black holes or supernovae, which couldalter the simulated properties of the x-ray coronae. with the further advanceof numerical models, the present observations will be essential in constrainingthe feedback effects in structure formation simulations.

1301.6753	moving mesh cosmology: tracing cosmological gas accretion	we investigate the nature of gas accretion onto haloes and galaxies at z=2using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh codearepo. implementing a monte carlo tracer particle scheme to determine theorigin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitativecomparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) code gadget-3. contrasting these two numerical approaches,we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history ofaccreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. in agreement with previouswork, gadget simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies formingin massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heatsto an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. the samegalaxies in arepo show a much lower cold fraction, &lt;20% in haloes above 10^11solar masses. this results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this samehalo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with gadget, while the coldaccretion rate is also lower. these discrepancies increase for more massivesystems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standardformulation of sph. we also observe that the relatively sharp transition fromcold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is aconsequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold valueindependent of virial temperature. examining the spatial distribution ofaccreting gas, we find that gas filaments in gadget tend to remain collimatedand flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a largenumber of purely numerical "blobs". similar gas streams in arepo show increasedheating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gasaccretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.

1305.2195	following the flow: tracer particles in astrophysical fluid simulations	we present two numerical schemes for passive tracer particles in thehydrodynamical moving-mesh code arepo, and compare their performance forvarious problems, from simple setups to cosmological simulations. the purposeof tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed in a lagrangian way,tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamicalhistory of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. we find that thecommonly-used `velocity field tracers', which are advected using the fluidvelocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explainwhy this is the case. this method can result in orders-of-magnitude biases insimulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering thevelocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. we then discussa novel implementation of `monte carlo tracers', which are moved along withfluid cells, and are exchanged probabilistically between them following themass flux. this method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly.the main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than thefluid itself. nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliablethan what has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriatefor following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. the monte carlo tracerscan also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types ofparticles, such as stellar particles, so that the mass flow in cosmologicalsimulations can be followed in its entirety.

1305.2913	a model for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation physics	we present a new comprehensive model of the physics of galaxy formationdesigned for large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of structure formationusing the moving mesh code arepo. our model includes primordial and metal linecooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution and feedbackprocesses, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, a novel subgrid model for themetal loading of outflows, black hole (bh) seeding, bh growth and mergingprocedures, quasar- and radio-mode feedback, and a prescription for radiativeelectro-magnetic (em) feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn). the metalmass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind massloading. this is required to simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass contentof low mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. radiative em agn feedbackis implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and aluminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. this form of feedbacksuppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-modefeedback alone, but is less efficient than mechanical radio-mode feedback inregulating star formation in massive haloes. we contrast simulation predictionsfor different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations. ourbest match model reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formationhistory, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass - halo mass relation, g-,r-, i-, z-band sdss galaxy luminosity functions, and the tully-fisher relation.we can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar andagn feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low andhigh mass systems. in particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs tobe increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficientcooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.

1305.4931	a physical model for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation:  multi-epoch validation	we present a multi-epoch analysis of the galaxy populations formed within thecosmological hydrodynamical simulations presented in vogelsberger et al.(2013). these simulations explore the performance of a recently implementedfeedback model which includes primordial and metal line radiative cooling withself-shielding corrections; stellar evolution with associated mass loss andchemical enrichment; feedback by stellar winds; black hole seeding, growth andmerging; and agn quasar- and radio-mode heating with a phenomenologicalprescription for agn electro-magnetic feedback. we illustrate the impact of themodel parameter choices on the resulting simulated galaxy population propertiesat high and intermediate redshifts. we demonstrate that our scheme is capableof producing galaxy populations that broadly reproduce the observed galaxystellar mass function extending from redshift z=0 to z=3. we also characterisethe evolving galactic b-band luminosity function, stellar mass to halo massratio, star formation main sequence, tully-fisher relation, and gas-phasemass-metallicity relation and confront them against recent observationalestimates. this detailed comparison allows us to validate elements of ourfeedback model, while also identifying areas of tension that will be addressedin future work.

1305.5536	a discontinuous galerkin method for solving the fluid and mhd equations  in astrophysical simulations	a discontinuous galerkin (dg) method suitable for large-scale astrophysicalsimulations on cartesian meshes as well as arbitrary static and moving voronoimeshes is presented. most major astrophysical fluid dynamics codes use a finitevolume (fv) approach. we demonstrate that the dg technique offers distinctadvantages over fv formulations on both static and moving meshes. the dg methodis also easily generalized to higher than second-order accuracy withoutrequiring the use of extended stencils to estimate derivatives (thereby makingthe scheme highly parallelizable). we implement the technique in the arepo codefor solving the fluid and the magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) equations. by examiningvarious test problems, we show that our new formulation provides improvedaccuracy over fv approaches of the same order, and reduces post-shockoscillations and artificial diffusion of angular momentum. in addition, the dgmethod makes it possible to represent magnetic fields in a locallydivergence-free way, improving the stability of mhd simulations and moderatingglobal divergence errors, and is a viable alternative for solving the mhdequations on meshes where constrained-transport (ct) cannot be applied. we findthat the dg procedure on a moving mesh is more sensitive to the choice of slopelimiter than is its fv method counterpart. therefore, future work to improvethe performance of the dg scheme even further will likely involve the design ofoptimal slope limiters. as presently constructed, our technique offers thepotential of improved accuracy in astrophysical simulations using the movingmesh arepo code as well as those employing adaptive mesh refinement (amr).

1309.2942	galaxy mergers on a moving mesh: a comparison with smoothed-particle  hydrodynamics	galaxy mergers have been investigated for decades using smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph), but recent work highlighting inaccuracies inherent in thetraditional sph technique calls into question the reliability of previousstudies. we explore this issue by comparing a suite of gadget-3 sph simulationsof idealised (i.e., non-cosmological) isolated discs and galaxy mergers withotherwise identical calculations performed using the moving-mesh code arepo.when black hole (bh) accretion and active galactic nucleus (agn) feedback arenot included, the star formation histories (sfhs) obtained from the two codesagree well. when bhs are included, the code- and resolution-dependentvariations in the sfhs are more significant, but the agreement is still good,and the stellar mass formed over the course of a simulation is robust tovariations in the numerical method. during a merger, the gas morphology andphase structure are initially similar prior to the starburst phase. however,once a hot gaseous halo has formed from shock heating and agn feedback (whenincluded), the agreement is less good. in particular, during the post-starburstphase, the sph simulations feature more prominent hot gaseous haloes andspurious clumps, whereas with arepo, gas clumps and filaments are less apparentand the hot halo gas can cool more efficiently. we discuss the origin of thesedifferences and explain why the sph technique yields trustworthy results forsome applications (such as the idealised isolated disc and galaxy mergersimulations presented here) but not others (e.g., gas flows onto galaxies incosmological hydrodynamical simulations).

1402.5963	a constrained transport scheme for mhd on unstructured static and moving  meshes	magnetic fields play an important role in many astrophysical systems and adetailed understanding of their impact on the gas dynamics requires robustnumerical simulations. here we present a new method to evolve the idealmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) equations on unstructured static and moving meshesthat preserves the magnetic field divergence-free constraint to machineprecision. the method overcomes the major problems of using a cleaning schemeon the magnetic fields instead, which is non-conservative, not fully galileaninvariant, does not eliminate divergence errors completely, and may produceincorrect jumps across shocks. our new method is a generalization of theconstrained transport (ct) algorithm used to enforce the $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{b}=0$ condition on fixed cartesian grids. preserving $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{b}=0$ at the discretized level is necessary to maintain theorthogonality between the lorentz force and $\mathbf{b}$. the possibility ofperforming ct on a moving mesh provides several advantages over static meshmethods due to the quasi-lagrangian nature of the former (i.e., the meshgenerating points move with the flow), such as making the simulationautomatically adaptive and significantly reducing advection errors. our methodpreserves magnetic fields and fluid quantities in pure advection exactly.

1402.6398	complexity phenomena and roma of the magnetospheric cusp, hydrodynamic  turbulence, and the cosmic web	dynamic complexity is a phenomenon exhibited by a nonlinearly interactingsystem within which multitudes of different sizes of large scale coherentstructures emerge, resulting in a globally nonlinear stochastic behavior vastlydifferent from that could be surmised from the underlying equations ofinteraction. the hallmark of such nonlinear, complex phenomena is theappearance of intermittent fluctuating events with the mixing and distributionsof correlated structures at all scales. we briefly review here a relativelyrecent method, roma (rank-ordered multifractal analysis), explicitlyconstructed to analyze the intricate details of the distribution and scaling ofsuch types of intermittent structures. this method is then applied to theanalyses of selected examples related to the dynamical plasmas of the cuspregion of the magnetosphere, velocity fluctuations of classical hydrodynamicturbulence, and the distribution of the structures of the cosmic gas obtainedthrough large scale, moving mesh simulations. differences and similarities ofthe analyzed results among these complex systems will be contrasted andhighlighted. the first two examples have direct relevance to the geospaceenvironment and are summaries of previously reported findings. the thirdexample on the cosmic gas, though involving phenomena much larger inspatiotemporal scales, with its highly compressible turbulent behavior and theunique simulation technique employed in generating the data, provides directmotivations of applying such analysis to studies of similar multifractalprocesses in various extreme environments. these new results are both excitingand intriguing.

1403.6828	the effects of varying cosmological parameters on halo substructure	we investigate how different cosmological parameters, such as those deliveredby the wmap and planck missions, affect the nature and evolution of dark matterhalo substructure. we use a series of flat $\lambda$ cold dark matter($\lambda$cdm) cosmological $n$-body simulations of structure formation, eachwith a different power spectrum but the same initial white noise field. ourfiducial simulation is based on parameters from the wmap 7th year cosmology. wethen systematically vary the spectral index, $n_s$, matter density, $\omega_m$,and normalization of the power spectrum, $\sigma_8$, for 7 unique simulations.across these, we study variations in the subhalo mass function, mass fraction,maximum circular velocity function, spatial distribution, concentration,formation times, accretion times, and peak mass. we eliminate dependence ofsubhalo properties on host halo mass and average over many hosts to reducevariance. while the "same" subhalos from identical initial overdensity peaks inhigher $\sigma_8, n_s$, and $\omega_m$ simulations accrete earlier and end upless massive and closer to the halo center at $z=0$, the process of continuoussubhalo accretion and destruction leads to a steady state distribution of theseproperties across all subhalos in a given host. this steady state mechanismeliminates cosmological dependence on all properties listed above exceptsubhalo concentration and $v_{max}$, which remain greater for higher $\sigma_8,n_s$ and $\omega_m$ simulations, and subhalo formation time, which remainsearlier. we also find that the numerical technique for computing scale radiusand the halo finder used can significantly affect the concentration-massrelationship computed for a simulation.

1405.2075	scattering, damping, and acoustic oscillations: simulating the structure  of dark matter halos with relativistic force carriers	we demonstrate that self-interacting dark matter models with interactionsmediated by light particles can have significant deviations in the matterpower-spectrum and detailed structure of galactic halos when compared to astandard cold dark matter scenario. while these deviations can take the form ofsuppression of small scale structure that are in some ways similar to that ofwarm dark matter, the self-interacting models have a much wider range ofpossible phenomenology. a long-range force in the dark matter can introducemultiple scales to the initial power spectrum, in the form of dark acousticoscillations and an exponential cut-off in the power spectrum. usingsimulations we show that the impact of these scales can remain observationallyrelevant up to the present day. furthermore, the self-interaction can continueto modify the small-scale structure of the dark matter halos, reducing theircentral densities and creating a dark matter core. the resulting phenomenologyis unique to this type of models.

1405.5216	dwarf galaxies in cdm and sidm with baryons: observational probes of the  nature of dark matter	we present the first cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies, whichinclude dark matter self-interactions and baryons. we study two dwarf galaxieswithin cold dark matter, and four different elastic self-interacting scenarioswith constant and velocity-dependent cross sections, motivated by a new forcein the hidden dark matter sector. our highest resolution simulation has abaryonic mass resolution of $1.8\times 10^2\,{\rm m}_\odot$ and a gravitationalsoftening length of $34\,{\rm pc}$ at $z=0$. in this first study we focus onthe regime of mostly isolated dwarf galaxies with halo masses$\sim10^{10}\,{\rm m}_\odot$ where dark matter dynamically dominates even atsub-kpc scales. we find that while the global properties of galaxies of thisscale are minimally affected by allowed self-interactions, their internalstructures change significantly if the cross section is large enough within theinner sub-kpc region. in these dark-matter-dominated systems, self-scatteringties the shape of the stellar distribution to that of the dark matterdistribution. in particular, we find that the stellar core radius is closelyrelated to the dark matter core radius generated by self-interactions. darkmatter collisions lead to dwarf galaxies with larger stellar cores and smallerstellar central densities compared to the cold dark matter case. the centralmetallicity within $1\,{\rm kpc}$ is also larger by up to $\sim 15\%$ in theformer case. we conclude that the mass distribution, and characteristics of thecentral stars in dwarf galaxies can potentially be used to probe theself-interacting nature of dark matter.

1406.1170	on the density profile of dark matter substructure in gravitational lens  galaxies	we consider three extensions of the navarro, frenk and white (nfw) profileand investigate the intrinsic degeneracies among the density profile parameterson the gravitational lensing effect of satellite galaxies on highly magnifiedeinstein rings. in particular, we find that the gravitational imaging techniquecan be used to exclude specific regions of the considered parameter space, andtherefore, models that predict a large number of satellites in those regions.by comparing the lensing degeneracy with the intrinsic density profiledegeneracies, we show that theoretical predictions based on fits that aredominated by the density profile at larger radii may significantly over- orunderestimate the number of satellites that are detectable with gravitationallensing. finally, using the previously reported detection of a satellite in thegravitational lens system jvas b1938+666 as an example, we derive for thisdetected satellite values of r_max and v_max that are, for each consideredprofile, consistent within 1sigma with the parameters found for the luminousdwarf satellites of the milky way and with a mass density slope gamma &lt; 1.6. wealso find that the mass of the satellite within the einstein radius as measuredusing gravitational lensing is stable against assumptions on the substructureprofile. in the future thanks to the increased angular resolution of very longbaseline interferometry at radio wavelengths and of the e-elt in the optical wewill be able to set tighter constraints on the number of allowed substructureprofiles.

1406.1174	halo mass and assembly history exposed in the faint outskirts: the  stellar and dark matter haloes of illustris galaxies	we use the illustris simulations to gain insight into the build-up of theouter, low-surface brightness regions which surround galaxies. we characterizethe stellar haloes by means of the logarithmic slope of thespherically-averaged stellar density profiles, alphastars at z=0, and we relatethese slopes to the properties of the underlying dark-matter (dm) haloes, theircentral galaxies, and their assembly histories. we analyze a sample of ~5,000galaxies resolved with more than 5x10^4 particles each, and spanning a varietyof morphologies and halo masses (3x10^11 &lt; mvir &lt; 10^14 msun). we find a strongtrend between stellar halo slope and total halo mass, where more massiveobjects have shallower stellar haloes than the less massive ones (-5.5 \pm 0.5&lt; alphastars &lt;-3.5 \pm 0.2 in the studied mass range). at fixed halo mass, weshow that disk-like, blue, young, and more massive galaxies are surrounded bysignificantly steeper stellar haloes than elliptical, red, older, and lessmassive galaxies. overall, the stellar density profiles fall off much moresteeply than the underlying dm, and no clear trend holds between stellar slopeand dm halo concentration. however, dm haloes which formed more recently, orwhich accreted larger fractions of stellar mass from infalling satellites,exhibit shallower stellar haloes than their older analogs with similar masses,by up to delta(alphastars) ~ 0.5-0.7. our findings, combined with the mostrecent measurements of the strikingly different stellar power-law indexes form31 and the milky way, appear to favour a massive m31, and a milky waycharacterized by a much quieter accretion history over the past 10 gyrs thanits companion.

1408.6842	the illustris simulation: the evolving population of black holes across  cosmic time	we study the properties of black holes and their host galaxies across cosmictime in the illustris simulation. illustris is a large scale cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 mpc)^3 volume with more than12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical modelsrelevant for galaxy formation. we find that the black hole mass density forredshifts z = 0 - 5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted byillustris are in very good agreement with the most recent observationalconstraints. we show that the bolometric and hard x-ray luminosity functions ofagn at z = 0 and 1 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamicrange probed. unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated,this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon_r &lt;= 0.1,noting however that in our model radiative efficiencies are degenerate withblack hole feedback efficiencies. cosmic downsizing of the agn population is inbroad agreement with the findings from x-ray surveys, but we predict a largernumber density of faint agn at high redshifts than currently inferred. we alsostudy black hole -- host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxymorphology, colour and specific star formation rate. we find that black holesand galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue andstar-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their centralblack hole masses or the nuclear agn activity.

1409.0009	the star formation main sequence and stellar mass assembly of galaxies  in the illustris simulation	understanding the physical processes that drive star formation is a keychallenge for galaxy formation models. in this article we study the tightcorrelation between the star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass of galaxiesat a given redshift, how halo growth influences star formation, and starformation histories of individual galaxies. we study these topics usingillustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxyformation. illustris reproduces the observed relation (the star formation mainsequence; sfms) between sfr and stellar mass at redshifts z=0 and z=4, but atintermediate redshifts of z~2, the simulated sfms has a significantly lowernormalisation than reported by observations. the scatter in the relation isconsistent with the observed scatter. however, the fraction of outliers abovethe sfr-stellar mass relation in illustris is less than that observed. galaxieswith halo masses of ~10^{12} solar masses dominate the sfr density of theuniverse, in agreement with the results of abundance matching. furthermore,more-massive galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars at high redshift,which indicates that `downsizing' occurs in illustris. we also studied the starformation histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principalcomponent analysis decomposition. we find that for fixed stellar mass, galaxiesthat form earlier have more-massive black holes at z=0, indicating that starformation and black hole growth are tightly linked processes in illustris.while many of the properties of normal star-forming galaxies arewell-reproduced in the illustris simulation, forming a realistic population ofstarbursts will likely require higher resolution and probably a moresophisticated treatment of star formation and feedback from stars and blackholes.

1410.4561	stellar orbit evolution in close circumstellar disc encounters	the formation and early evolution of circumstellar discs often occurs withindense, newborn stellar clusters. for the first time, we apply the moving-meshcode arepo, to circumstellar discs in 3-d, focusing on disc-disc interactionsthat result from stellar fly-bys. although a small fraction of stars areexpected to undergo close approaches, the outcomes of the most violentencounters might leave an imprint on the discs and host stars that willinfluence both their orbits and their ability to form planets. we firstconstruct well-behaved 3-d models of self-gravitating discs, and then create asuite of numerical experiments of parabolic encounters, exploring the effectsof pericenter separation r_p, disc orientation and disc-star mass ratio(m_d/m_*) on the orbital evolution of the host stars. close encounters (2r_p&lt;~disc radius) can truncate discs on very short time scales. if discs aremassive, close encounters facilitate enough orbital angular momentum extractionto induce stellar capture. we find that for realistic primordial disc massesm_d&lt;~0.1m_*, non-colliding encounters induce minor orbital changes, which isconsistent with analytic calculations of encounters in the linear regime. thesame disc masses produce entirely different results for grazing/collidingencounters. in the latter case, rapidly cooling discs lose orbital energy byradiating away the energy excess of the shock-heated gas, thus causing captureof the host stars into a bound orbit. in rare cases, a tight binary with acircumbinary disc forms as a result of this encounter.

1410.5425	the impact of feedback on cosmological gas accretion	we investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time incosmological hydrodynamic simulations is modified by a comprehensive physicalmodel for baryonic feedback processes. to do so, we compare two simulations --with and without feedback -- both evolved with the moving mesh code arepo. thefeedback runs implement the full physics model of the illustris simulationproject, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedbackfrom supermassive blackholes. we explore: (a) the accretion rate of materialcontributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from theintergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, aswell as the net, inflow of this "smooth mode" gas at all redshifts, regardlessof the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) at the virial radius thetemperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z=2.however, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvirdecreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the ratesof both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across thisboundary. (c) the fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the totalaccretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor oftwo across all redshifts. moreover, the smooth component of gas with a coldtemperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z&lt;1. (d) theamount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy --the "halo transit time" -- increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of~2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. we discuss the possibleimplications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.

1410.7400	the colors of satellite galaxies in the illustris simulation	observationally, the fraction of blue satellite galaxies decreases steeplywith host halo mass, and their radial distribution around central galaxies issignificantly shallower in massive (m_* &gt;10e11m_sun) than in milky way likesystems. theoretical models, based primarily on semi-analytical techniques,have had a long-standing problem with reproducing these trends, insteadpredicting too few blue satellites in general but also estimating a radialdistribution that is too shallow, regardless of primary mass. in this letter,we use the illustris cosmological simulation to study the properties ofsatellite galaxies around isolated primaries. for the first time, we find goodagreement between theory and observations. we identify the main source of thissuccess relative to earlier work to be a consequence of the large gas contentsof satellites at infall, a factor ~5-10 times larger than in semi-analyticalmodels. because of their relatively large gas reservoirs, satellites cancontinue to form stars long after infall, with a typical timescale forstar-formation to be quenched ~2 gyr in groups but more than ~5 gyr forsatellites around milky way like primaries. the gas contents we infer areconsistent with z=0 observations of hi gas in galaxies, although we find largediscrepancies among reported values in the literature. a testable prediction ofour model is that the gas-to-stellar mass ratio of satellite progenitors shouldvary only weakly with cosmic time.

1411.0667	the formation of massive, compact galaxies at z=2 in the illustris  simulation	massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshift have been found to beconsiderably more compact than galaxies of similar mass in the local universe.how these compact galaxies formed has yet to be determined, though severalprogenitor populations have been proposed. here we investigate the formationprocesses and quantify the assembly histories of such galaxies in illustris, asuite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations encompassing a sufficientlylarge volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously resolving theinternal structure of galaxies. we select massive (~10^11 solar masses) andcompact (stellar half-mass radius &lt; 2 kpc) galaxies from the simulation at z=2.within the illustris suite, we find that these quantities are not perfectlyconverged, but are reasonably reliable for our purposes. the resultingpopulation is composed primarily of quiescent galaxies, but we also findseveral star-forming compact galaxies. the simulated compact galaxies aresimilar to observed galaxies in star formation activity and appearance. wefollow their evolution at high redshift in the simulation and find that thereare multiple pathways to form these compact galaxies, dominated by twomechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally triggeredby gas-rich major mergers between z~2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radiiby a factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times whenthe universe was much denser; the galaxies formed compact and remained so untilz~2.

1411.3717	synthetic galaxy images and spectra from the illustris simulation	we present our methods for generating a catalog of 7,000 synthetic images and40,000 integrated spectra of redshift z = 0 galaxies from the illustrissimulation. the mock data products are produced by using stellar populationsynthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions (sed) to each starparticle in the galaxies. the resulting synthetic images and integrated sedstherefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicitydistribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. from the syntheticdata products it is possible to produce monochromatic or color-compositeimages, perform sed fitting, classify morphology, determine galaxy structuralproperties, and evaluate the impacts of galaxy viewing angle. the maincontribution of this paper is to describe the production, format, andcomposition of the image catalog that makes up the illustris simulationobsevatory. as a demonstration of this resource, we derive galactic stellarmass estimates by applying the sed fitting code fast to the synthetic galaxyproducts, and compare the derived stellar masses against the true stellarmasses from the simulation. we find from this idealized experiment thatsystematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values thatcan be reduced by using a fixed metallicity in conjunction with a minimumgalaxy age restriction.

1501.02267	the impact of galactic feedback on the circumgalactic medium	galactic feedback strongly affects the way galactic environments areenriched. we examine this connection by performing a suite of cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations, exploring a range of parameters based on the galaxyformation model developed in vogelsberger et al. 2013 (henceforth v13). weexamine the effects of agn feedback, wind mass loading, wind specific energy,and wind metal-loading on the properties of the circumgalactic medium (cgm) ofgalaxies with $m_\text{halo} &gt; 10^{11} m_\odot$. note that while the v13 modelwas tuned to match observations including the stellar mass function, noexplicit tuning was done for the cgm. the wind energy per unit outflow mass hasthe most significant effect on the cgm enrichment. high energy winds launchmetals far beyond the virial radius. agn feedback also has a significanteffect, but only at $z &lt; 3$. we compare to high redshift hi and civobservations. all our simulations produce the observed number of dampedlyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. at lower column density, several of our simulationsproduce enough lyman limit systems (lls) $100$ kpc from the galaxy, but in allcases the lls abundance falls off with distance faster than observations, withtoo few lls at $200$ kpc. further, in all models the civ abundance drops offtoo sharply with distance, with too little civ $100$-$200$ kpc from the galaxy.higher energy wind models produce more extended civ but also produce lessstars, in tension with star-formation rate density observations. thishighlights the fact that circumgalactic observations are a strong constraint ongalactic feedback models.

1502.01339	the merger rate of galaxies in the illustris simulation: a comparison  with observations and semi-empirical models	we have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the illustris simulation bydirectly tracking the baryonic content of subhalos. these merger trees are usedto calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellarmass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. we demonstrate that the mostappropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists intaking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reachesits maximum stellar mass. additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned'galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding adescendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall'moment. adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions forthe galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which arequalitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: astrong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\sim (1+z)^{2.4-2.8}$, apower law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence ondescendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellarmasses greater than $\sim 2 \times 10^{11} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$. these trendsare consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies($m_{\ast} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$), but in tension with somerecent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies ($m_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{11} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$), which report a nearly constant ordecreasing evolution with redshift. finally, we provide a fitting function forthe galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellarmasses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.

1502.07747	galaxy morphology and star formation in the illustris simulation at z=0	we study how optical galaxy morphology depends on mass and star formationrate (sfr) in the illustris simulation. to do so, we measure automated galaxystructures in 10808 simulated galaxies at z=0 with stellar masses 10^9.7 &lt;m_*/m_sun &lt; 10^12.3. we add observational realism to idealized synthetic imagesand measure non-parametric statistics in rest-frame optical and near-ir imagesfrom four directions. we find that illustris creates a morphologically diversegalaxy population, occupying the observed bulge strength locus and reproducingmedian morphology trends versus stellar mass, sfr, and compactness. morphologycorrelates realistically with rotation, following classification schemes putforth by kinematic surveys. type fractions as a function of environment agreeroughly with data. these results imply that connections among mass, starformation, and galaxy structure arise naturally from models matching globalstar formation and halo occupation functions when simulated with accuratemethods. this raises a question of how to construct experiments on galaxysurveys to better distinguish between models. we predict that at fixed halomass near 10^12 m_sun, disc-dominated galaxies have higher stellar mass thanbulge-dominated ones, a possible consequence of the illustris feedback model.while illustris galaxies at m_* ~ 10^11 m_sun have a reasonable sizedistribution, those at m_* ~ 10^10 m_sun have half-light radii larger thanobserved by a factor of two. furthermore, at m_* ~ 10^10.5-10^11 m_sun, arelevant fraction of illustris galaxies have distinct "ring-like" features,such that the bright pixels have an unusually wide spatial extent.

1503.00734	hydrogen reionization in the illustris universe	hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation such as the illustrissimulations have progressed to a state where they approximately reproduce theobserved stellar mass function from high to low redshift. this in principleallows self-consistent models of reionization that exploit the accuraterepresentation of the diffuse gas distribution together with the realisticgrowth of galaxies provided by these simulations, within a representativecosmological volume. in this work, we apply and compare two radiative transferalgorithms implemented in a gpu-accelerated code to the $106.5\,{\rm mpc}$ widevolume of illustris in postprocessing in order to investigate the reionizationtransition predicted by this model. we find that the first generation ofgalaxies formed by illustris is just about able to reionize the universe byredshift $z\sim 7$, provided quite optimistic assumptions about the escapefraction and the resolution limitations are made. our most optimistic modelfinds an optical depth of $\tau\simeq 0.065$, which is in very good agreementwith recent planck 2015 determinations. furthermore, we show that moment-basedapproaches for radiative transfer with the m1 closure give broadly consistentresults with our angular-resolved radiative transfer scheme. in our favouredfiducial model, 20\% of the hydrogen is reionized by redshift $z=9.20$, andthis rapidly climbs to 80\% by redshift $z=6.92$. it then takes until $z=6.24$before 99\% of the hydrogen is ionized. on average, reionization proceeds`inside-out' in our models, with a size distribution of reionized bubbles thatprogressively features regions of ever larger size while the abundance of smallbubbles stays fairly constant.

1503.01107	hot gaseous coronae around spiral galaxies: probing the illustris  simulation	the presence of hot gaseous coronae around present-day massive spiralgalaxies is a fundamental prediction of galaxy formation models. however, ourobservational knowledge remains scarce, since to date only four gaseous coronaewere detected around spirals with massive stellar bodies($\gtrsim2\times10^{11} \ \rm{m_{\odot}}$). to explore the hot coronae aroundlower mass spiral galaxies, we utilized chandra x-ray observations of a sampleof eight normal spiral galaxies with stellar masses of $(0.7-2.0)\times10^{11}\ \rm{m_{\odot}}$. although statistically significant diffuse x-ray emission isnot detected beyond the optical radii ($\sim20$ kpc) of the galaxies, we derive$3\sigma$ limits on the characteristics of the coronae. these limits,complemented with previous detections of ngc 1961 and ngc 6753, are used toprobe the illustris simulation. the observed $3\sigma$ upper limits on thex-ray luminosities and gas masses exceed or are at the upper end of the modelpredictions. for ngc 1961 and ngc 6753 the observed gas temperatures, metalabundances, and electron density profiles broadly agree with those predicted byillustris. these results hint that the physics modules of illustris are broadlyconsistent with the observed properties of hot coronae around spiral galaxies.however, a shortcoming of illustris is that massive black holes, mostlyresiding in giant ellipticals, give rise to powerful radio-mode agn feedback,which results in under luminous coronae for ellipticals.

1503.01117	galactic angular momentum in the illustris simulation: feedback and the  hubble sequence	we study the stellar angular momentum of thousands of galaxies in theillustris cosmological simulation, which captures gravitational and gasdynamics within galaxies, as well as feedback from stars and black holes. wefind that the angular momentum of the simulated galaxies matches observationswell, and in particular two distinct relations are found for late-type versusearly-type galaxies. the relation for late-type galaxies corresponds to thevalue expected from full conservation of the specific angular momentumgenerated by cosmological tidal torques. the relation for early-type galaxiescorresponds to retention of only ~30% of that, but we find that thoseearly-type galaxies with low angular momentum at z=0 nevertheless reside athigh redshift on the late-type relation. some of them abruptly lose angularmomentum during major mergers. to gain further insight, we explore the scalingrelations in simulations where the galaxy formation physics is modified withrespect to the fiducial model. we find that galactic winds with highmass-loading factors are essential for obtaining the high angular momentumrelation typical for late-type galaxies, while agn feedback largely operates inthe opposite direction. hence, feedback controls the stellar angular momentumof galaxies, and appears to be instrumental for establishing the hubblesequence.

1503.02665	zooming in on accretion - i. the structure of halo gas	we study the properties of gas in and around 10^12 solar mass halos at z=2using a suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic 'zoom' simulations.we quantify the thermal and dynamical structure of these gaseous reservoirs interms of their mean radial distributions and angular variability alongdifferent sightlines. with each halo simulated at three levels of increasingresolution, the highest reaching a baryon mass resolution of ~10,000 solarmasses, we study the interaction of filamentary inflow and the quasi-static hothalo atmosphere. we highlight the discrepancy between the spatial resolutionavailable in the halo gas as opposed to within the galaxy itself, and find thatstream morphologies become increasingly complex at higher resolution, withlarge coherent flows revealing density and temperature structure atprogressively smaller scales. moreover, multiple gas components co-exist at thesame radius within the halo, making radially averaged analyses misleading. thisis particularly true where the hot, quasi-static, high entropy halo atmosphereinteracts with cold, rapidly inflowing, low entropy accretion. we investigatethe process of gas virialization and identify different regimes for the heatingof gas as it accretes from the intergalactic medium. haloes at this mass have awell-defined virial shock, associated with a sharp jump in temperature andentropy at ~1.25 r_vir. the presence, radius, and radial width of this boundaryfeature, however, vary not only from halo to halo, but also as a function ofangular direction, covering roughly ~85% of the 4pi sphere. our findings arerelevant for the proper interpretation of observations pertaining to thecircumgalactic medium, including evidence for large amounts of cold gassurrounding massive haloes at intermediate redshifts.

1505.06202	galaxy formation with local photoionization feedback -ii. effect of  x-ray emission from binaries and hot gas	we study how x-rays from stellar binary systems and the hot intraclustermedium (icm) affect the radiative cooling rates of gas in galaxies. our studyuses a novel implementation of gas cooling in the moving-mesh hydrodynamicscode \textsc{arepo}. x-rays from stellar binaries do not affect cooling at allas their emission spectrum is too hard to effectively couple with galactic gas.in contrast, x-rays from the icm couple well with gas in the temperature range$10^4 - 10^6$ k. idealised simulations show that the hot halo radiation fieldhas minimal impact on the dynamics of cooling flows in clusters because of thehigh virial temperature ($&gt; 10^7$k), making the interaction between the gas andincident photons very ineffective. satellite galaxies in cluster environments,on the other hand, experience a high radiation flux due to the emission fromthe host halo. low mass satellites ($&lt; 10^{12}\rm{m_\odot}$) in particular havevirial temperatures that are exactly in the regime where the effect of theradiation field is maximal. idealised simulations of satellite galaxiesincluding only the effect of host halo radiation (no ram pressure stripping ortidal effects) fields show a drastic reduction in the amount of cool gas formed($\sim 40\%$) on a short timescale of about $0.5$ gyrs. a galaxy mergersimulation including all the other environmental quenching mechanisms, showsabout $20\%$ reduction in the stellar mass of the satellite and about $\sim30\%$ reduction in star formation rate after $1$ gyr due to the host hot haloradiation field. these results indicate that the hot halo radiation fieldspotentially play an important role in quenching galaxies in clusterenvironments.

1506.00005	the large-scale properties of simulated cosmological magnetic fields	we perform uniformly sampled large-scale cosmological simulations includingmagnetic fields with the moving mesh code arepo. we run two sets of mhdsimulations: one including adiabatic gas physics only; the other featuring thefiducial feedback model of the illustris simulation. in the adiabatic case, themagnetic field amplification follows the $b \propto \rho^{2/3}$ scaling derivedfrom `flux-freezing' arguments, with the seed field strength providing anoverall normalization factor. at high baryon overdensities the amplification isenhanced by shear flows and turbulence. feedback physics and the inclusion ofradiative cooling change this picture dramatically. in haloes, gas collapses tomuch larger densities and the magnetic field is amplified strongly and to thesame maximum intensity irrespective of the initial seed field of which anymemory is lost. at lower densities a dependence on the seed field strength andorientation, which in principle can be used to constrain models of cosmicmagnetogenesis, is still present. inside the most massive haloes magneticfields reach values of $\sim 10-100\,\,{\rm \mu g}$, in agreement with galaxycluster observations. the topology of the field is tangled and gives rise torotation measure signals in reasonable agreement with the observations.however, the rotation measure signal declines too rapidly towards larger radiias compared to observational data.

1507.01942	an analysis of the evolving comoving number density of galaxies in  hydrodynamical simulations	the cumulative comoving number-density of galaxies as a function of stellarmass or central velocity dispersion is commonly used to link galaxy populationsacross different epochs. by assuming that galaxies preserve theirnumber-density in time, one can infer the evolution of their properties, suchas masses, sizes, and morphologies. however, this assumption does not hold inthe presence of galaxy mergers or when rank ordering is broken owing tovariable stellar growth rates. we present an analysis of the evolving comovingnumber density of galaxy populations found in the illustris cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulation focused on the redshift range $0\leq z \leq 3$. ourprimary results are as follows: 1) the inferred average stellar mass evolutionobtained via a constant comoving number density assumption is systematicallybiased compared to the merger tree results at the factor of $\sim$2(4) levelwhen tracking galaxies from redshift $z=0$ out to redshift $z=2(3)$; 2) themedian number density evolution for galaxy populations tracked forward in timeis shallower than for galaxy populations tracked backward in time; 3) a similarevolution in the median number density of tracked galaxy populations is foundregardless of whether number density is assigned via stellar mass, stellarvelocity dispersion, or dark matter halo mass; 4) explicit tracking reveals alarge diversity in galaxies' assembly histories that cannot be captured byconstant number-density analyses; 5) the significant scatter in galaxy linkingmethods is only marginally reduced by considering a number of additionalphysical and observable galaxy properties as realized in our simulation. weprovide fits for the forward and backward median evolution in stellar mass andnumber density and discuss implications of our analysis for interpretingmulti-epoch galaxy property observations.

1507.02291	the diverse evolutionary paths of simulated high-z massive, compact  galaxies to z=0	massive quiescent galaxies have much smaller physical sizes at high redshiftthan today. the strong evolution of galaxy size may be caused by progenitorbias, major and minor mergers, adiabatic expansion, and/or renewed starformation, but it is difficult to test these theories observationally. herein,we select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies ($m_* = 1-3 \times 10^{11}$m$_\odot$, $m_*/r^{1.5} &gt; 10^{10.5}$ m$_\odot$/kpc$^{1.5}$) at $z=2$ in thecosmological hydrodynamical simulation illustris and trace them forward to$z=0$ to uncover their evolution and identify their descendants. by $z=0$, theoriginal factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. thedark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. thegalaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex-situenvelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third surviveundisturbed and gain very little mass, 15% are consumed in a merger with a moremassive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers.the galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only $\sim$10% remain compact by$z=0$. the majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex-situmass. the most massive galaxies at $z=0$ are the most likely to have compactprogenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes adirect linkage to compact galaxies at $z=2$. the compact galaxies' merger ratesare influenced by their $z=2$ environments, so that isolated or satellitecompact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely tosurvive to the present day.

1507.07937	lens galaxies in the illustris simulation: power-law models and the bias  of the hubble constant from time-delays	the combination of dynamical and strong gravitational lensing studies ofmassive galaxies shows that their total density profile in the central region(i.e. up to a few half-light radius) can be described by a power law,$\rho(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$. therefore, such a power-law model is employed fora large number of strong-lensing applications, including the so-calledtime-delay technique used to infer the hubble constant $h_0$. however, sincethe radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed (i.e., theeinstein radius) corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonicmatter to dark matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow apower law in density. the assumption of a power law artificially breaks themass-sheet degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitationallensing which affects the product of hubble constant and time delay and cantherefore cause a bias in the determination of $h_0$ from the time-delaytechnique. in this paper, we use the illustris hydrodynamical simulations toestimate the amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related toobservational properties of galaxies. investigating a large sample of illustrisgalaxies that have velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm sie} \geqslant 160$ km/s atredshifts below $z=1$, we find that the bias on $h_0$ introduced by thepower-law assumption can reach 20%-50%, with a scatter of 10%-30% (rms).however, we find that by selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law modelslope close to isothermal, it is possible to reduce the bias on $h_0$ to &lt;5%,and the scatter to &lt;10%. this could potentially be used to form less biasedstatistical samples for $h_0$ measurements in the upcoming large survey era.

1508.01524	recoiling black holes: prospects for detection and implications of spin  alignment	supermassive black hole (bh) mergers produce powerful gravitational wave (gw)emission. asymmetry in this emission imparts a recoil kick to the merged bh,which can eject the bh from its host galaxy altogether. recoiling bhs could beobserved as offset active galactic nuclei (agn). several candidates have beenidentified, but systematic searches have been hampered by large uncertaintiesregarding their observability. by extracting merging bhs and host galaxyproperties from the illustris cosmological simulations, we have developed acomprehensive model for recoiling agn. here, for the first time, we model theeffects of bh spin alignment and recoil dynamics based on the gas-richness ofhost galaxies. we predict that if bh spins are not highly aligned,seeing-limited observations could resolve offset agn, making them promisingtargets for all-sky surveys. for randomly-oriented spins, less than about 10spatially-offset agn may be detectable in hst-cosmos, and &gt; 10^3 could be foundwith pan-starrs, lsst, euclid, and wfirst. nearly a thousand velocity-offsetagn are predicted within the sdss footprint; the rarity of large broad-lineoffsets among sdss quasars is likely due in part to selection effects butsuggests that spin alignment plays a role in suppressing recoils. nonetheless,in our most physically motivated model where alignment occurs only in gas-richmergers, hundreds of offset agn should be found in all-sky surveys. ourfindings strongly motivate a dedicated search for recoiling agn.

1508.05393	modeling galactic conformity with the color-halo age relation in the  illustris simulation	comparisons between observational surveys and galaxy formation models findthat the mass of dark matter haloes can largely explain galaxies' stellar mass.however, it remains uncertain whether additional environmental variables,generally referred to as assembly bias, are necessary to explain other galaxyproperties. we use the illustris simulation to investigate the role of assemblybias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18,000 galaxies with$m_{stellar}$ &gt; $2 \times 10^9$ $m_{\odot}$. we find a significant signal ofgalactic conformity: out to distances of about 10 mpc, the mean red fraction ofgalaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixedstellar mass. dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, inwhich the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higheraround old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. a plausibleinterpretation of galactic conformity can be given as a combination of the haloconformity signal with the galaxy color-halo age relation: at fixed stellarmass, particularly toward the low-mass end, illustris' galaxy colors correlatewith halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) beingpreferentially found in the oldest haloes. in fact, we can explain the galacticconformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, by assigning stellar massbased on halo mass (abundance matching) and by assigning galaxy color based onhalo age (age matching). we investigate other interpretations for the galacticconformity, particularly its dependence on the isolation criterion and on thecentral-satellite information. regarding comparison to observations, weconclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, andstacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude ofthe conformity signal.

1509.00030	on the assembly of dwarf galaxies in clusters and their efficient  formation of globular clusters	galaxy clusters contain a large population of low mass dwarf ellipticalgalaxies whose exact origin is unclear: their colors, structural properties andkinematics differ substantially from those of dwarf irregulars in the field. weuse the illustris cosmological simulation to study differences in the assemblypaths of dwarf galaxies (3e8 &lt; m_*/m_sun &lt; 1e10) according to theirenvironment. we find that cluster dwarfs achieve their maximum total andstellar mass on average ~ 8 and ~ 4.5 gyr ago (or redshifts z = 1.0 and z =0.4, respectively), around the time of infall into the clusters. in contrast,field dwarfs not subjected to environmental stripping, reach their maximum massat redshift z = 0. this different assembly history naturally produces a colorbimodality, with blue isolated dwarfs and redder cluster dwarfs exhibitingnegligible star-formation today. the cessation of star formation happens overmedian times 3.5-5 gyr depending on stellar mass, and shows a large scatter (~1-8 gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events that occur atinfall through the virial radius or pericentric passages. we argue that suchstarbursts together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide anatural explanation for the higher specific frequency of globular clusters(gcs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. we present a simple modelfor the formation and stripping of gcs that supports this interpretation. theorigin of dwarf ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with anenvironmentally-driven evolution of field dwarf irregulars. however the z = 0field analogs of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a factor ~3 larger --a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation incluster dwarfs.

1511.00687	on the ovi abundance in the circumgalactic medium of low-redshift  galaxies	we analyze the mass, temperature, metal enrichment, and ovi abundance of thecircumgalactic medium (cgm) around $z\sim 0.2$ galaxies of mass $10^9 m_\odot&lt;m_\bigstar &lt; 10^{11.5} m_\odot$ in the illustris simulation. amongstar-forming galaxies, the mass, temperature, and metallicity of the cgmincrease with stellar mass, driving an increase in the ovi column densityprofile of $\sim 0.5$ dex with each $0.5$ dex increase in stellar mass.observed ovi column density profiles exhibit a weaker mass dependence thanpredicted: the simulated ovi abundance profiles are consistent with thoseobserved for star-forming galaxies of mass $m_\bigstar = 10^{10.5-11.5}m_\odot$, but underpredict the observed ovi abundances by $\gtrsim 0.8$ dex forlower-mass galaxies. we suggest that this discrepancy may be alleviated withadditional heating of the abundant cool gas in low-mass halos, or withincreased numerical resolution capturing turbulent/conductive mixing layersbetween cgm phases. quenched galaxies of mass $m_\bigstar = 10^{10.5-11.5}m_\odot$ are found to have 0.3-0.8 dex lower ovi column density profiles thanstar-forming galaxies of the same mass, in qualitative agreement with theobserved ovi abundance bimodality. this offset is driven by agn feedback, whichquenches galaxies by heating the cgm and ejecting significant amounts of gasfrom the halo. finally, we find that the inclusion of the central galaxy'sradiation field may enhance the photoionization of the cgm within $\sim 50$kpc, further increasing the predicted ovi abundance around star-forminggalaxies.

1511.08804	the stellar mass assembly of galaxies in the illustris simulation:  growth by mergers and the spatial distribution of accreted stars	we use the illustris simulation to study the relative contributions of insitu star formation and stellar accretion to the build-up of galaxies over anunprecedentedly wide range of masses ($m_{\ast} = 10^9-10^{12} \, {\rmm_{\odot}}$), galaxy types, environments, and assembly histories. we find thatthe `two-phase' picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a goodapproximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation -- namely,the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times $10^{11} \, {\rmm_{\odot}}$ is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts, whilegalaxies above this mass at $z \lesssim 1$ grow primarily by accretion of starsvia mergers. the fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at $z=0$contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass,ranging from about 10% for milky way-sized galaxies to over 80% for $m_{\ast}\approx 10^{12} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$ objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxyvariation. at a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at thecentres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars thandisc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. on average, $\sim$50% ofthe ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\mu &gt;1/4$), $\sim$20% from minor mergers ($1/10 &lt; \mu &lt; 1/4$), $\sim$20% from veryminor mergers ($\mu &lt; 1/10$), and $\sim$10% from stars that were stripped fromsurviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing mergers). these components arespatially segregated, with in situ stars dominating the innermost regions ofgalaxies, and ex situ stars being deposited at larger galactocentric distancesin order of decreasing merger mass ratio. the `transition' radius where ex situstars begin to dominate over the in situ class decreases for more massivegalaxies and correlates strongly with the total ex situ fraction.

1512.03053	accurately simulating anisotropic thermal conduction on a moving mesh	we present a novel implementation of an extremum preserving anisotropicdiffusion solver for thermal conduction on the unstructured moving voronoi meshof the arepo code. the method relies on splitting the one-sided facet fluxesinto normal and oblique components, with the oblique fluxes being limited suchthat the total flux is both locally conservative and extremum preserving. theapproach makes use of harmonic averaging points and a simple, robustinterpolation scheme that works well for strong heterogeneous and anisotropicdiffusion problems. moreover, the required discretisation stencil is small.efficient fully implicit and semi-implicit time integration schemes are alsoimplemented. we perform several numerical tests that evaluate the stability andaccuracy of the scheme, including applications such as point explosions withheat conduction and calculations of convective instabilities in conductingplasmas. the new implementation is suitable for studying importantastrophysical phenomena, such as the conductive heat transport in galaxyclusters, the evolution of supernova remnants, or the distribution of heat fromblackhole-driven jets into the intracluster medium.

1512.06862	gas rich and gas poor structures through the stream velocity effect	using adiabatic high-resolution numerical simulations we quantify the effectof the streaming motion of baryons with respect to dark matter at the time ofrecombination on structure formation and evolution. formally a second ordereffect, the baryonic stream velocity has proven to have significant impact ondark matter halo abundance, as well as on the gas content and morphology ofsmall galaxy clusters. in this work, we study the impact of stream velocity onthe formation and gas content of haloes with masses up to $10^9 m_{\odot}$, anorder of magnitude larger than previous studies. we find that the non-zerostream velocity has a sizable impact on the number density of haloes withmasses $\lesssim$ few $\times 10^7 m_{\odot}$ up to $z=10$, the final redshiftof our simulations. furthermore, the gas stream velocity induces a suppressionof the gas fraction in haloes, which at z=10 is $\sim 10 \%$ for objects with$m\sim10^7m_{\odot}$, as well as a flattening of the gas density profiles inthe inner regions of haloes. we further identify and study the formation, inthe context of a non-zero stream velocity, of moderately long lived gasdominated structures at intermediate redshifts $10 &lt; z &lt; 20$, which naoz andnarayan have recently proposed as potential progenitors of globular clusters.

0809.0894	a blueprint for detecting supersymmetric dark matter in the galactic  halo	dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the universe, but its nature isunknown. it is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightestsupersymmetric partner of known particle species. in this case, annihilation ofdark matter in the halo of the milky way should produce gamma-rays at a levelwhich may soon be observable. previous work has argued that the annihilationsignal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps (perhaps smallereven than the earth) which would be most easily detected where they clustertogether in the dark matter halos of dwarf satellite galaxies. here we show,using the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, thatsuch small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on darkmatter detectability. rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectablesignal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the milkyway. if the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumpsshould also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a keyprediction of the cold dark matter (cdm) model.

0809.0898	the aquarius project: the subhalos of galactic halos	we have performed the largest ever particle simulation of a milky way-sizeddark matter halo, and present the most comprehensive convergence study for anindividual dark matter halo carried out thus far. we have also simulated asample of 6 ultra-highly resolved milky-way sized halos, allowing us toestimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. in our largestsimulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within thevirialized region of the halo. simulations of the same object differing in massresolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos withthe same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield goodconvergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark mattersubstructures. we detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos,but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than inthe main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. the overallsubstructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo.extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an earth mass, wepredict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3% within 100 kpc,and to be below 0.1% within the solar circle. the inner density profiles ofsubhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are wellfit by gently curving profiles of einasto form. the mean concentrations ofisolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of neto et al.down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5orders of magnitude in mass. however, at equal maximum circular velocity,subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic densitythat is typically ~2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.

0810.1522	the diversity and similarity of simulated cold dark matter halos	we study the mass, velocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles of$\lambda$cdm halos using a suite of n-body simulations of unprecedentednumerical resolution (the {\it aquarius project}). our analysis confirms anumber of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues whereconflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. thespherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwardsand, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is $\gamma \equiv-$d$\ln\rho/$d$\ln r \simlt 1$. asymptotic inner slopes as steep as therecently claimed $\rho \propto r^{-1.2}$ are clearly ruled out. the radialdependence of $\gamma$ is well approximated by a power-law, $\gamma \proptor^{\alpha}$ (the einasto profile). the shape parameter, $\alpha$, variesslightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profilesof $\lambda$cdm halos are not strictly universal: different halos cannot, ingeneral, be rescaled to look identical. departures from similarity are alsoseen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in densityprofiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averagedpseudo-phase-space density, $\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-1.875}$. our conclusionsare reliable down to radii below 0.4% of the virial radius, providingwell-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects areneglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which themodifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can bejudged.

0812.0362	phase-space structure in the local dark matter distribution and its  signature in direct detection experiments	we study predictions for dark matter phase-space structure near the sun basedon high-resolution simulations of six galaxy halos taken from the aquariusproject. the local dm density distribution is predicted to be remarkablysmooth; the density at the sun differs from the mean over a best-fitellipsoidal equidensity contour by less than 15% at the 99.9% confidence level.the local velocity distribution is also very smooth, but it differssystematically from a (multivariate) gaussian distribution. this is not due tothe presence of individual clumps or streams, but to broad features in thevelocity modulus and energy distributions that are stable both in space andtime and reflect the detailed assembly history of each halo. these featureshave a significant impact on the signals predicted for wimp and axion searches.for example, wimp recoil rates can deviate by ~10% from those expected from thebest-fit multivariate gaussian models. the axion spectra in our simulationstypically peak at lower frequencies than in the case of multivariate gaussianvelocity distributions. also in this case, the spectra show significantimprints of the formation of the halo. this implies that once direct dmdetection has become routine, features in the detector signal will allow us tostudy the dark matter assembly history of the milky way. a new field, "darkmatter astronomy", will then emerge.
