0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0905.1674	star formation and dust obscuration at z~2: galaxies at the dawn of  downsizing	we present first results of a study aimed to constrain the star formationrate and dust content of galaxies at z~2. we use a sample of bzk-selectedstar-forming galaxies, drawn from the cosmos survey, to perform a stackinganalysis of their 1.4 ghz radio continuum as a function of different stellarpopulation properties, after removing agn contaminants from the sample. dustunbiased star formation rates are derived from radio fluxes assuming the localradio-ir correlation. the main results of this work are: i) specific starformation rates are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to thehighest stellar mass probed; ii) the dust attenuation is a strong function ofgalaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lowermass objects; iii) a single value of the uv extinction applied to all galaxieswould lead to grossly underestimate the sfr in massive galaxies; iv) correctingthe observed uv luminosities for dust attenuation based on the calzetti recipeprovide results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones; v) the meanspecific star formation rate of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of ~4with decreasing redshift from z=2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of ~40 down the localuniverse.  these empirical sfrs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass ifmaintained all the way to low redshifts, we suggest that this does not happenbecause star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the mostmassive galaxies.

0910.0444	spectroscopy of luminous z&gt;7 galaxy candidates and sources of  contamination in z&gt;7 galaxy searches	we present three bright z+ dropout candidates selected from deepnear-infrared (nir) imaging of the cosmos 2 square degree field. all threeobjects match the 0.8-8um colors of other published z&gt;7 candidates but arethree magnitudes brighter, facilitating further study. deep spectroscopy of twoof the candidates covering 0.64-1.02um with keck-deimos and all three covering0.94-1.10um and 1.52-1.80um with keck-nirspec detects weak spectral featurestentatively identified as ly-alpha at z=6.95 and z=7.69 in two of the objects.the third object is placed at z~1.6 based on a 24um and weak optical detection.a comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z&lt;7 galaxies,including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and largesystematic uncertainties in the photometry yields no objects with similarcolors. however, the lambda&gt;1um properties of all three objects can be matchedto optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z~1.8, so thenon-detection in the i+ and z+ bands are the primary factors which favors a z&gt;7solution. if any of these objects are at z~7 the bright end of the luminosityfunction is significantly higher at z&gt;7 than suggested by previous studies, butconsistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halodistribution. if these objects are at low redshift, the lyman-break selectionmust be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low redshift objectswith very strong breaks in their broad band spectral energy distributions andblue nir colors. the implications of this result on luminosity functionevolution at high redshift is discussed. we show that the primary limitation ofz&gt;7 galaxy searches with broad filters is the depth of the available opticaldata.

0910.1007	black hole growth and starburst activity at z = 0.6-4 in the chandra  deep field south. host galaxies properties of obscured agn	the co-evolution of host galaxies and the active black holes which reside intheir centre is one of the most important topics in modern observationalcosmology. here we present a study of the properties of obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn) detected in the cdfs 1ms observation and their hostgalaxies. we limited the analysis to the music area, for which deep k-bandobservations obtained with isaac@vlt are available, ensuring accurateidentifications of the counterparts of the x-ray sources as well as reliabledetermination of photometric redshifts and galaxy parameters, such as stellarmasses and star formation rates. in particular, we: 1) refined thex-ray/infrared/optical association of 179 sources in the music area detected inthe chandra observation; 2) studied the host galaxies observed and rest framecolors and properties. we found that x-ray selected (l_x&gt;10^{42} erg s^{-1})agn show spitzer colors consistent with both agn and starburst dominatedinfrared continuum; the latter would not have been selected as agn frominfrared diagnostics. the host galaxies of x-ray selected obscured agn are allmassive (m_*&gt;10^{10} m_sun) and, in 50% of the cases, are also actively formingstars (1/ssfr&lt;t_{hubble}) in dusty environments. the median l/ledd value of theactive nucleus is between 2% and 10% depending on the assumed m_{bh}/m_{*}ratio. finally, we found that the x-ray selected agn fraction increases withthe stellar mass up to a value of ~30% at z&gt;1 and m_*&gt;3x10^{11} m_sun, afraction significantly higher than in the local universe for agn of similarluminosities.

0910.2617	the chandra survey of the cosmos field ii: source detection and  photometry	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra program,that covers the central contiguous ~0.92 deg^2 of the cosmos field. c-cosmos isthe result of a complex tiling, with every position being observed in up to sixoverlapping pointings (four overlapping pointings in most of the central ~0.45deg^2 area with the best exposure, and two overlapping pointings in most of thesurrounding area, covering an additional ~0.47 deg^2). therefore, the fullexploitation of the c-cosmos data requires a dedicated and accurate analysisfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the psfchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1arcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)obtaining the best source localization and count rate. we present here ourtreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,photometry, and survey sensitivity. our final procedure consists of a two stepprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) amaximum likelihood point spread function fitting algorithm to evaluate thesource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is afluctuation of the background. we discuss the main characteristics of thisprocedure, that was the result of detailed comparisons between differentdetection algorithms and photometry tools, calibrated with extensive anddedicated simulations.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

1002.4299	ultraluminous x-ray sources out to z~0.3 in the cosmos field	using chandra observations we have identified a sample of seven off-nuclearx-ray sources, in the redshift range z=0.072-0.283, located within opticallybright galaxies in the cosmos survey. using the multi-wavelength coverageavailable in the cosmos field, we study the properties of the host galaxies ofthese ulxs. in detail, we derived their star formation rate from h_alphameasurements and their stellar masses using sed fitting techniques with the aimto compute the probability to have an off-nuclear source based on the hostgalaxy properties. we divide the host galaxies in different morphologicalclasses using the available acs/hst imaging. we find that our ulxs candidatesare located in regions of the sfr versus m$_star$ plane where one or moreoff-nuclear detectable sources are expected. from a morphological analysis ofthe acs imaging and the use of rest-frame colours, we find that our ulxs arehosted both in late and early type galaxies. finally, we find that the fractionof galaxies hosting a ulx ranges from ~0.5% to ~0.2% going from l[0.5-2 kev]=3x 10^39 erg s^-1 to l[0.5-2 kev]= 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1003.4264	the physical scale of the far-infrared emission in the most luminous  submillimetre galaxies ii: evidence for merger-driven star formation	we present high-resolution 345 ghz interferometric observations of twoextreme luminous (l_{ir}&gt;10^{13} l_sun), submillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs)in the cosmos field with the submillimeter array (sma). both targets werepreviously detected as unresolved point-sources by the sma in its compactconfiguration, also at 345 ghz. these new data, which provide a factor of ~3improvement in resolution, allow us to measure the physical scale of thefar-infrared in the submillimetre directly. the visibility functions of bothtargets show significant evidence for structure on 0.5-1 arcsec scales, whichat z=1.5 translates into a physical scale of 5-8 kpc. our results areconsistent with the angular and physical scales of two comparably luminousobjects with high-resolution sma followup, as well as radio continuum and cosizes. these relatively compact sizes (&lt;5-10 kpc) argue strongly formerger-driven starbursts, rather than extended gas-rich disks, as the preferredchannel for forming smgs. for the most luminous objects, the derived sizes mayalso have important physical consequences; under a series of simplifyingassumptions, we find that these two objects in particular are forming starsclose to or at the eddington limit for a starburst.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

0710.1811	the hellas2xmm survey: xi. unveiling the nature of x-ray bright  optically normal galaxies	x-ray bright optically normal galaxies (xbongs) constitute a small but notnegligible fraction of hard x-ray selected sources in recent chandra andxmm-newton surveys. even though several possibilities were proposed to explainwhy a relatively luminous hard x-ray source does not leave any significantsignature of its presence in terms of optical emission lines, the nature ofxbongs is still subject of debate. we aim to a better understanding of theirnature by means of a multiwavelength and morphological analysis of a smallsample of these sources. good-quality photometric near-infrared data(isaac/vlt) of four low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) xbongs, selected from thehellas2xmm survey, have been used to search for the presence of the putativenucleus, applying the surface-brightness decomposition technique through theleast-squares fitting program galfit. the surface brightness decompositionallows us to reveal a nuclear point-like source, likely to be responsible ofthe x-ray emission, in two out of the four sources. the results indicate thatmoderate amounts of gas and dust, covering a large solid angle (possibly 4pi)at the nuclear source, combined with the low nuclear activity, may explain thelack of optical emission lines. the third xbong is associated with an x-rayextended source and no nuclear excess is detected in the near infrared at thelimits of our observations. the last source is associated to a close (d&lt; 1arcsec) double system and the fitting procedure cannot achieve a firmconclusion.

1201.3899	identifying luminous agn in deep surveys: revised irac selection  criteria	spitzer irac selection is a powerful tool for identifying luminous agn. fordeep irac data, however, the agn selection wedges currently in use are heavilycontaminated by star-forming galaxies, especially at high redshift. using thelarge samples of luminous agn and high-redshift star-forming galaxies incosmos, we redefine the agn selection criteria for use in deep irac surveys.the new irac criteria are designed to be both highly complete and reliable, andincorporate the best aspects of the current agn selection wedges and ofinfrared power-law selection while excluding high redshift star-forminggalaxies selected via the bzk, drg, lbg, and smg criteria. at qso-luminositiesof log l(2-10 kev) (ergs/s) &gt; 44, the new irac criteria recover 75% of the hardx-ray and irac-detected xmm-cosmos sample, yet only 38% of the irac agncandidates have x-ray counterparts, a fraction that rises to 52% in regionswith chandra exposures of 50-160 ks. x-ray stacking of the individually x-raynon-detected agn candidates leads to a hard x-ray signal indicative of heavilyobscured to mildly compton-thick obscuration (log n_h (cm^-2) = 23.5 +/- 0.4).while irac selection recovers a substantial fraction of luminous unobscured andobscured agn, it is incomplete to low-luminosity and host-dominated agn.

1204.4485	x-ray properties of radio-selected star forming galaxies in the  chandra-cosmos survey	x-ray surveys contain sizable numbers of star forming galaxies, beyond theagn which usually make the majority of detections. many methods to separate thetwo populations are used in the literature, based on x-ray and multiwavelengthproperties. we aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and tostudy the x-ray properties of the resulting samples. we build on a sample ofgalaxies selected at 1.4 ghz in the vla-cosmos survey, classified by smolcic etal. (2008) according to their optical colours and observed with chandra. asimilarly selected control sample of agn is also used for comparison. we reviewsome x-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the samplecomposition. the efficiency of the classification scheme devised by smolcic etal. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expectedbecause of the higher x-ray brightness of agn with respect to galaxies. thelatter fraction is actually 50% in the x-ray detected sources, while it isexpected to be much lower among x-ray undetected sources. indeed, the analysisof the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, stronglydifferent properties between the agn and galaxy samples. x-ray based selectioncriteria are then used to refine both samples. the radio/x-ray luminositycorrelation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the samex-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. some evolution of the ratio may bepossible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likelyexplained by a bias arising from the radio selection. finally, we discuss thex-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the vla- and c-cosmos surveysaccording to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similardetermination from the chandra deep fields. the classification scheme proposedhere may find application in future works and surveys.

(2010).two scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of cid-42: a gwrecoiling smbh and a double type 1/ type 2 agn system, where one of the two isrecoiling because of slingshot effect. in both scenario, one of the opticalnuclei hosts an unobscured agn, while the other one, either an obscured agn ora star forming compact region. the x-ray chandra data allow to unambiguouslyresolve the x-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sourcesin cid-42. we find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for thewhole x-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the fluxof the second optical nucleus is measured. the upper limit on the x-rayluminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energydistribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second sourcerather than an obscured smbh, thus favoring the gw recoil scenario. however thepresence of a very obscured smbh cannot be fully ruled-out. a new x-rayfeature, in a sw direction with respect to the main source, is discovered anddiscussed.

1206.2642	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei in the xmm-cosmos survey	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of both x-ray selectedbroad-line (type-1) and narrow-line (type-2) agn from the xmm-newton survey inthe cosmos field are presented. the sample is composed by 929 agn (382 type-1agn and 547 type-2 agn) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, x-rayluminosities and absorbing column densities. about 65% of the sources arespectroscopically identified as either type-1 or type-2 agn (83% and 52%respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the restof the sample. the study of such a large sample of x-ray selected agn with ahigh quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with theinclusion of herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron) to the optical-uvallows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections and eddington ratios. the kbol-lbol relations derived in thepresent work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable agn sample,and rely on observed redshifts, x-ray luminosities and column densitydistributions. we find that kbol is significantly lower at high lbol withrespect to previous estimates by marconi et al. (2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1207.1515	constraints on the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~5 in  the cosmos field	we present the result of our low-luminosity quasar survey in the redshiftrange of 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.5 in the cosmos field. using the cosmos photometriccatalog, we selected 15 quasar candidates with 22 &lt; i' &lt; 24 at z~5, that are ~3 mag fainter than the sdss quasars in the same redshift range. we obtainedoptical spectra for 14 of the 15 candidates using focas on the subaru telescopeand did not identify any low-luminosity type-1 quasars at z~5 while alow-luminosity type-2 quasar at z~5.07 was discovered. in order to constrainthe faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~5, we calculated the1sigma confidence upper limits of the space density of type-1 quasars. as aresult, the 1sigma confidence upper limits on the quasar space density are phi&lt;1.33*10^{-7} mpc^{-3} mag^{-1} for -24.52 &lt; m_{1450} &lt; -23.52 and phi&lt;2.88*10^{-7} mpc^{-3} mag^{-1} for -23.52 &lt; m_{1450} &lt; -22.52. the inferred1sigma confidence upper limits of the space density are then used to provideconstrains on the faint-end slope and the break absolute magnitude of thequasar luminosity function at z~5. we find that the quasar space densitydecreases gradually as a function of redshift at low luminosity (m_{1450} ~-23), being similar to the trend found for quasars with high luminosity(m_{1450}&lt;-26). this result is consistent with the so-called downsizingevolution of quasars seen at lower redshifts.

1209.1478	spectral energy distributions of type 1 agn in the cosmos survey i - the  xmm-cosmos sample	the "cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) enables the study of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of active galactic nuclei (agn) because of the deepcoverage and rich sampling of frequencies from x-ray to radio. here we presenta sed catalog of 413 x-ray (\xmm) selected type 1 (emission line fwhm$&gt;2000$ kms$^{-1}$) agn with magellan, sdss or vlt spectrum. the seds are corrected forthe galactic extinction, for broad emission line contributions, constrainedvariability, and for host galaxy contribution. we present the mean sed and thedispersion seds after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 ghz to 40kev, and show examples of the variety of seds encountered. in the near-infraredto optical (rest frame $\sim 8\mu m$-- 4000\aa), the photometry is complete forthe whole sample and the mean sed is derived from detections only. reddeningand host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of theobserved sed variety. the seds are all available on-line.

1209.1640	accreting smbhs in the cosmos field and the connection to their host  galaxies	using the wide multi-band photometry available in the cosmos field we explorethe host galaxy properties of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (agn)obtained by combining x-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. based on acareful study of their spectral energy distribution (sed), which has beenparametrized using a 2-component (agn+galaxy) model fit, we deriveddust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formationrates (sfrs). we find that agn hosts span a large range of stellar masses andsfrs. no color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the agn hosts, which arefound to be mainly massive, red galaxies. once accounting for the color-massdegeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginalenhancement of agn incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific starformation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of ourability to properly account for agn light contamination and dust extinction.interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black holegrowing at any given "specific accretion rate" (i.e. the ratio of x-rayluminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxymass, while it decreases as a power-law with lx/m. by analyzing thenormalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence ofagn increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance withthe overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxypopulation. although agn activity and star formation in galaxies do appear tohave a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within thecosmos sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signalingpowerful agn influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.

1405.7039	early-type galaxies in the chandra cosmos survey	we study a sample of 69 x-ray detected early type galaxies (etgs), selectedfrom the chandra cosmos survey, to explore the relation between the x-rayluminosity of hot gaseous halos (l_x, gas) and the integrated stellarluminosity (l_k) of the galaxies, in a range of redshift extending out toz=1.5. in the local universe a tight steep relationship has been stablishedbetween these two quantities (l_x,gas~ l_k^4.5) suggesting the presence oflargely virialized halos in x-ray luminous systems. we use well establishedrelations from the study of local universe etgs, together with the expectedevolution of the x-ray emission, to subtract the contribution of low mass x-raybinary populations (lmxbs) from the x-ray luminosity of our sample. ourselection minimizes the presence of active galactic nuclei (agn), yielding asample representative of normal passive cosmos etgs; therefore the resultingluminosity should be representative of gaseous halos, although we cannotexclude other sources such as obscured agn, or enhanced x-ray emissionconnected with embedded star formation in the higher z galaxies. we find thatmost of the galaxies with estimated l_x&lt;10^42 erg/s and z&lt;0.55 follow thel_x,gas- l_k relation of local universe etgs. for these galaxies, thegravitational mass can be estimated with a certain degree of confidence fromthe local virial relation. however, the more luminous (10^42&lt;l_x&lt;10^43.5 erg/s)and distant galaxies present significantly larger scatter; these galaxies alsotend to have younger stellar ages. the divergence from the local l_x,gas - l_krelation in these galaxies implies significantly enhanced x-ray emission, up toa factor of 100 larger than predicted from the local relation. we discuss theimplications of this result for the presence of hidden agn, and the evolutionof hot halos, in the presence of nuclear and star formation feedback.

1406.2327	late-stage galaxy mergers in cosmos to z~1	the role of major mergers in galaxy and black hole formation is not wellconstrained. to help address this, we develop an automated method to identifylate-stage galaxy mergers before coalescence of the galactic cores. theresulting sample of mergers is distinct from those obtained using pair-findingand morphological indicators. our method relies on median-filtering ofhigh-resolution images in order to distinguish two concentrated galaxy nucleiat small separations. using mock images, we derive statistical contaminationand incompleteness corrections for the fraction of late-stage mergers. we applyour new method to a magnitude-limited (i &lt; 23) sample of 44,164 galaxies fromthe cosmos hst/acs catalog. using a mass-complete sample with $\log m_*/m_\odot&gt; 10.6$ and $0.25 &lt; z \leq 1.00$, we find ~5% of systems are late-stage mergerswith separations between 2.2 and 8 kpc. correcting for incompleteness andcontamination, the fractional merger rate increases strongly with redshift as$(1+z)^{3.8\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matterhalo merger rates. separating the sample into star-forming and quiescentgalaxies shows that the merger rate for star-forming galaxies increasesstrongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescentgalaxies is consistent with no evolution, $(1+z)^{1.1\pm1.2}$. limiting oursample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos, we find that thestar formation rates and x-ray selected agn activity in likely late-stagemergers are enhanced by factors of ~2 relative to a control sample. combiningour sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\pm5\%$ of starformation and $20\pm8\%$ of agn activity is triggered by close encounters (&lt;143kpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the onlychannels for star formation and black hole growth.

1408.6280	the largest x-ray selected sample of z&gt;3 agns: c-cosmos &amp; champ	we present results from an analysis of the largest high-redshift (z &gt; 3)x-ray-selected active galactic nucleus (agn) sample to date, combining thechandra c-cosmos and champ surveys and doubling the previous samples. thesample comprises 209 x-ray-detected agn, over a wide range of rest frame 2-10kev luminosities logl_{x}=43.3 - 46.0 erg s^{-1}. x-ray hardness rates showthat ~39% of the sources are highly obscured, n_{h}&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2}, inagreement with the ~37% of type-2 agn found in our sample based on theiroptical classification. for ~26% of objects have mismatched optical and x-rayclassifications. using the 1/v_{max} method, we confirm that the comoving spacedensity of all luminosity ranges of agns decreases with redshift above z &gt; 3and up to z ~ 7. with a significant sample of agn (n=27) at z &gt; 4, it is foundthat both source number counts in the 0.5 -2 kev band and comoving spacedensity are consistent with the expectation of a luminosity dependent densityevolution (ldde) model at all redshifts, while they exclude the luminosity anddensity evolution (lade) model. the measured comoving space density of type-1and type-2 agn shows a constant ratio between the two types at z &gt; 3. ourresults for both agn types at these redshifts are consistent with theexpectations of ldde model.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1409.7693	clustering properties of moderate luminosity x-ray selected type 1 and  type 2 agn at z~3	we investigate, for the first time at z~3, the clustering properties of 189type 1 and 157 type 2 x-ray active galactic nuclei (agn) of moderate luminosity(log&lt;lbol&gt; = 45.3 erg/s), with photometric or spectroscopic redshifts in therange 2.2&lt;z&lt;6.8. these samples are based on chandra and xmm-newton data incosmos. we find that type 1 and type 2 cosmos agn at z=3 inhabit dmhs withtypical mass of logmh = 12.84+0.10/-0.11 and 11.73+0.39/-0.45 msun/h,respectively. this result requires a drop in the halo masses of type 1 and 2cosmos agn at z~3 compared to z&lt;2 xmm cosmos agn with similar luminosities.additionally, we infer that unobscured cosmos agn at z~3 reside in 10 timesmore massive halos compared to obscured cosmos agn, at 2.6sigma level. thisresult extends to z~3 that found in cosmos at z&lt;2, and rules out the picture inwhich obscuration is purely an orientation effect. a model which assumes thatthe agn activity is triggered by major mergers is quite successful inpredicting both the low halo mass of cosmos agn and the typical mass ofluminous sdss quasars at z~3, with the latter inhabiting more massive halosrespect to moderate luminosity agn. alternatively we can argue, at least fortype 1 cosmos agn, that they are possibly representative of an early phase offast (i.e. eddington limited) bh growth induced by cosmic cold flows or diskinstabilities. given the moderate luminosity, these new fast growing bhs havemasses of e7-8 msun at z~3 which might evolve into e8.5-9 msun mass bhs at z=0.following our clustering measurements, we argue that this fast bh growth at z~3in agn with moderate luminosity occurs in dmhs with typical mass of 6 times e12msun/h.

1410.5817	the dark matter halos of moderate luminosity x-ray agn as determined  from weak gravitational lensing and host stellar masses	understanding the relationship between galaxies hosting active galacticnuclei (agn) and the dark matter halos in which they reside is key toconstraining how black-hole fueling is triggered and regulated. previousefforts have relied on simple halo mass estimates inferred from clustering,weak gravitational lensing, or halo occupation distribution modeling. inpractice, these approaches remain uncertain because agn, no matter how they areidentified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupationfunction whose general shape and normalization are poorly known. in this work,we show that better constraints can be achieved through a rigorous comparisonof the clustering, lensing, and cross-correlation signals of agn hosts to afiducial stellar-to-halo mass relation (shmr) derived for all galaxies. ourtechnique exploits the fact that the global shmr can be measured with muchhigher accuracy than any statistic derived from agn samples alone. using 382moderate luminosity x-ray agn at z&lt;1 from the cosmos field, we report the firstmeasurements of weak gravitational lensing from an x-ray selected sample.comparing this signal to predictions from the global shmr, we find that,contrary to previous results, most x-ray agn do not live in medium size groups---nearly half reside in relatively low mass halos with mh~10^12.5 msun. theagn occupation function is well described by the same form derived for allgalaxies but with a lower normalization---the fraction of halos with agn in oursample is a few percent. by highlighting the relatively "normal" way in whichmoderate luminosity x-ray agn hosts occupy halos, our results suggest that theenvironmental signature of distinct fueling modes for luminous qsos compared tomoderate luminosity x-ray agn is less obvious than previously claimed.

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1412.3799	physical properties of z&gt;4 submillimeter galaxies in the cosmos field	we study the physical properties of a sample of 6 smgs in the cosmos field,spectroscopically confirmed to lie at z&gt;4. we use new gmrt 325 mhz and 3 ghzjvla data to probe the rest-frame 1.4 ghz emission at z=4, and to estimate thesizes of the star-forming (sf) regions of these sources, resp. combining oursize estimates with those available in the literature for aztec1 and aztec3 weinfer a median radio-emitting size for our z&gt;4 smgs of(0.63"+/-0.12")x(0.35"+/-0.05") or 4.1x2.3 kpc^2 (major times minor axis;assuming z=4.5) or lower if we take the two marginally resolved smgs asunresolved. this is consistent with the sizes of sf regions in lower-redshiftsmgs, and local normal galaxies, yet higher than the sizes of sf regions oflocal ulirgs. our smg sample consists of a fair mix of compact and more clumpysystems with multiple, perhaps merging, components. with an average formationtime of ~280 myr, derived through modeling of the uv-ir seds, the studied smgsare young systems. the average stellar mass, dust temperature, and irluminosity we derive are m*~1.4x10^11 m_sun, t_dust~43 k, andl_ir~1.3x10^13l_sun, resp. the average l_ir is up to an order of magnitudehigher than for smgs at lower redshifts. our smgs follow the correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity as derived for herschel-selected0.1&lt;z&lt;2 galaxies. we study the ir-radio correlation for our sources and find adeviation from that derived for z&lt;3 ulirgs (&lt;q_ir&gt;=1.95+/-0.26 for our sample,compared to q~2.6 for ir luminous galaxies at z&lt;2). in summary, we find thatthe physical properties derived for our z&gt;4 smgs put them at the high end ofthe l_ir-t_dust distribution of smgs, and that our smgs form a morphologicallyheterogeneous sample. thus, further in-depth analyses of large, statisticalsamples of high-redshift smgs are needed to fully understand their role ingalaxy formation and evolution.

1506.05120	nustar reveals extreme absorption in z &lt; 0.5 type 2 quasars	the intrinsic column density (nh) distribution of quasars is poorly known. atthe high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z&lt;1, thex-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurementswhich extend to energies above 10 kev. using the hard x-ray observatory nustar,along with archival chandra and xmm-newton data, we study the broad-band x-rayspectra of nine optically selected (from the sdss), candidate compton-thick (nh&gt; 1.5e24 cm^-2) type 2 quasars (ctqso2s); five new nustar observations arereported herein, and four have been previously published. the candidate ctqso2slie at z&lt;0.5, have observed [oiii] luminosities in the range 8.4 &lt; log(l_[oiii]/l_solar) &lt; 9.6, and show evidence for extreme, compton-thickabsorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. amongst thenine candidate ctqso2s, five are detected by nustar in the high energy (8-24kev) band: two are weakly detected at the ~ 3 sigma confidence level and threeare strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (&gt;~ 90 netsource counts at 8-24 kev). for these nustar-detected sources direct (i.e.,x-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic agn properties are feasible, andwe measure column densities ~2.5-1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed)x-ray luminosities ~10-70 times higher than pre-nustar constraints from chandraand xmm-newton. assuming the nustar-detected type 2 quasars are representativeof other compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the nh distributionfor optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by chandra and xmm-newton for39 objects. with this approach, we predict a compton-thick fraction of f_ct =36^{+14}_{-12} %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible ifindirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.

1511.04183	the nustar extragalactic surveys: the number counts of active galactic  nuclei and the resolved fraction of the cosmic x-ray background	we present the 3-8 kev and 8-24 kev number counts of active galactic nuclei(agn) identified in the nustar extragalactic surveys. nustar has now resolvedapproximately 35% of the x-ray background in the 8-24 kev band, directlyidentifying agn with obscuring columns up to 1e25 / cm2. in the softer 3-8 kevband the number counts are in general agreement with those measured byxmm-newton and chandra over the flux range 5e-15 &lt; s(3 - 8 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt;1e-12 probed by nustar. in the hard 8-24 kev band nustar probes fluxes over therange 2e-14 &lt; s(8-24 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt; 1e-12, a factor of approximately 100fainter than previous measurements covering this energy range. the slope of the8-24 kev number counts closely matches predictions from agn populationsynthesis models that account for the shape and intensity of the diffuse cosmicx-ray background. this directly confirms the existence of a population ofobscured and/or hard x-ray sources inferred from the shape of the integrateddiffuse cosmic x-ray background. the measured nustar counts lie significantlyabove simple extrapolations of the swift/bat 15-55 kev number counts measuredat higher fluxes, s(15-55 kev) &gt; 1e-11 erg/cm2/s, for any realistic agnspectral model. the most natural explanation for the difference is an evolutionin the agn poulation between the very local objects seen by bat and the moredistant (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1) nustar sample that is not accounted for in the currentmodels.

astro-ph;0701178	hidden activity in high-redshift spheroidal galaxies from mid-infrared  and x-ray observations in the goods-north field	we exploit very deep mid-ir (mir) and x-ray observations by spitzer andchandra in the goods north to identify signs of hidden (either starburst oragn) activity in spheroidal galaxies between z~0.3 and 1. our reference is acomplete sample of 168 morphologically classified spheroidal galaxies withz[ab]&lt;22.5 selected from goods acs imaging. nineteen of these have 24 microndetections in the goods catalogue, half of which have an x-ray counterpart inthe 2 ms chandra catalogue, while about 25% have 1.4 ghz fluxes larger than 40microjy. traces of hidden activity in the spheroidal population are alsosearched for in the deep x-ray images and 14 additional galaxies are detectedin x-rays only. the nature of the observed mir emissions is investigated bymodelling their seds based on the available multi-wavelength photometry,including x-ray, uv, optical, near-ir, mir and radio fluxes, and opticalspectroscopy. the amount of dust derived from the ir emission observed byspitzer appears in excess of that expected by mass loss from evolved stars. ouranalysis of the x-ray and mir properties leads us to conclude that at least 8of the 19 24-um bright sources should hide an obscured agn, while the x-rayundetected sources are more likely dominated by star formation. [abridged] weconclude that ~30 objects (~20%) of the original flux-limited sample of 168spheroidal galaxies in the goods-north are detected during phases of prominentactivity, of both stellar and quasar origin. due to the short expectedlifetimes of the ir and x-ray emissions, this fraction might imply asignificant level of activity in this class of galaxies during the relativelyrecent cosmic epochs, z~0.3 to z~1, under investigation.

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

0809.2513	high redshift quasars in the cosmos survey: the space density of z&gt;3  x-ray selected qsos	we present a new measurement of the space density of high redshift(3.0&lt;z&lt;4.5), x-ray selected qsos obtained by exploiting the deep and uniformmultiwavelength coverage of the cosmos survey. we have assembled astatistically large (40 objects), x-ray selected (f_{0.5-2 kev} &gt;10^{-15} cgs),homogeneous sample of z&gt;3 qsos for which spectroscopic (22) or photometric (18)redshifts are available. we present the optical (color-color diagrams) andx-ray properties, the number counts and space densities of the z&gt;3 x-rayselected quasars population and compare our findings with previous works andmodel predictions. we find that the optical properties of x-ray selectedquasars are not significantly different from those of optically selectedsamples. there is evidence for substantial x-ray absorption (logn_h&gt;23 cm^{-2})in about 20% of the sources in the sample. the comoving space density ofluminous (l_x &gt;10^{44} erg s^-1) qsos declines exponentially (by an e--foldingper unit redshift) in the z=3.0-4.5 range, with a behavior similar to thatobserved for optically bright unobscured qsos selected in large area opticalsurveys. prospects for future, large and deep x-ray surveys are also discussed.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
