0907.0101	pulsar simulations for the fermi large area telescope	pulsars are among the prime targets for the large area telescope (lat) aboardthe recently launched fermi observatory. the lat will study the gamma-rayuniverse between 20 mev and 300 gev with unprecedented detail. increasingnumbers of gamma-ray pulsars are being firmly identified, yet their emissionmechanisms are far from being understood. to better investigate and exploit thelat capabilities for pulsar science, a set of new detailed pulsar simulationtools have been developed within the lat collaboration. the structure of thepulsar simulator package pulsarspectrum is presented here. starting from photondistributions in energy and phase obtained from theoretical calculations orphenomenological considerations, gamma rays are generated and their arrivaltimes at the spacecraft are determined by taking into account effects such asbarycentric effects and timing noise. pulsars in binary systems also can besimulated given orbital parameters. we present how simulations can be used forgenerating a realistic set of gamma rays as observed by the lat, focusing onsome case studies that show the performance of the lat for pulsar observations.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1004.2352	gamma-ray spectral evolution of ngc1275 observed with fermi-lat	we report on a detailed investigation of the high-energy gamma-ray emissionfrom ngc\,1275, a well-known radio galaxy hosted by a giant elliptical locatedat the center of the nearby perseus cluster. with the increased photonstatistics, the center of the gamma-ray emitting region is now measured to beseparated by only 0.46' from the nucleus of ngc1275, well within the 95%confidence error circle with radius ~1.5'. early fermi-lat observationsrevealed a significant decade-timescale brightening of ngc1275 at gev photonenergies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by theupper limit from previous egret observations. with the accumulation of one-yearof fermi-lat all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectralvariations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. theaverage &gt;100 mev gamma-ray spectrum of ngc1275 shows a possible deviation froma simple power-law shape, indicating a spectral cut-off around an observedphoton energy of e = 42.2+-19.6 gev, with an average flux of f = (2.31+-0.13) x10^{-7} ph/cm^2/s and a power-law photon index, gamma = 2.13+-0.02. the largestgamma-ray flaring event was observed in april--may 2009 and was accompanied bysignificant spectral variability above e &gt; 1-2 gev. the gamma-ray activity ofngc1275 during this flare can be described by a hysteresis behavior in the fluxversus photon index plane. the highest energy photon associated with thegamma-ray source was detected at the very end of the observation, with theobserved energy of e = 67.4gev and an angular separation of about 2.4' from thenucleus. in this paper we present the details of the fermi-lat data analysis,and briefly discuss the implications of the observed gamma-ray spectralevolution of ngc1275 in the context of gamma-ray blazar sources in general.

1006.2134	eight gamma-ray pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of fermi  lat data	we report the discovery of eight gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequencysearches using the lat, onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. five ofthe eight pulsars are young (tau_c&lt;100 kyr), energetic (edot&gt;10^36 erg/s), andlocated within the galactic plane (|b|&lt;3 deg). the remaining three are older,less energetic, and located off the plane. five pulsars are associated withsources included in the lat bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, psrj1413-6205, is clearly associated with an egret source. psr j1023-5746 has thesmallest characteristic age (tau_c=4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic(edot=1.1e37 erg/s) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blindsearches. psrs j1957+5033 and j2055+25 have the largest characteristic ages(tau_c~1 myr) and are the least energetic (edot~5e33 erg/s) of thenewly-discovered pulsars. we present the timing models, light curves, anddetailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. we used recent xmmobservations to identify the counterpart of psr j2055+25 as xmmuj205549.4+253959. in addition, publicly available archival chandra x-ray dataallowed us to identify the likely counterpart of psr j1023-5746 as a faint,highly absorbed source, cxou j102302.8-574606. the large x-ray absorptionindicates that this could be among the most distant gamma-ray pulsars detectedso far. psr j1023-5746 is positionally coincident with the tev source hessj1023-575, located near the young stellar cluster westerlund 2, while psrj1954+2836 is coincident with a 4.3 sigma excess reported by milagro at amedian energy of 35 tev. deep radio follow-up observations of the eight pulsarsresulted in no detections of pulsations and upper limits comparable to thefaintest known radio pulsars, indicating that these can be included among thegrowing population of radio-quiet pulsars in our galaxy being uncovered by thelat, and currently numbering more than 20.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1010.4230	psrs j0248+6021 and j2240+5832: young pulsars in the northern galactic  plane. discovery, timing, and gamma-ray observations	pulsars psr j0248+6021 (rotation period p=217 ms and spin-down power edot =2.13e35 erg/s) and psr j2240+5832 (p=140 ms, edot = 2.12e35 erg/s) werediscovered in 1997 with the nancay radio telescope during a northern galacticplane survey, using the navy-berkeley pulsar processor (nbpp) filter bank. gevgamma-ray pulsations from both were discovered using the fermi large areatelescope. twelve years of radio and polarization data allow detailedinvestigations. the two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and ingamma-ray data. both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset farfrom the radio peak. the high dispersion measure for psr j0248+6021 (dm = 370pc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant hii region w5in the perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the galaxy asobtained from models of average electron distributions. its high transversevelocity and the low magnetic field along the line-of-sight favor this smalldistance. neither gamma-ray, x-ray, nor optical data yield evidence for apulsar wind nebula surrounding psr j0248+6021. the gamma-ray luminosity for psrj0248+6021 is l_ gamma = (1.4 \pm 0.3)\times 10^34 erg/s. for psr j2240+5832,we find either l_gamma = (7.9 \pm 5.2) \times 10^34 erg/s if the pulsar is inthe outer arm, or l_gamma = (2.2 \pm 1.7) \times 10^34 erg/s for the perseusarm. these luminosities are consistent with an l_gamma ~ sqrt(edot) rule.comparison of the gamma-ray pulse profiles with model predictions, includingthe constraints obtained from radio polarization data, favor emission in thefar magnetosphere. these two pulsars differ mainly in their inclination anglesand acceleration gap widths, which in turn explains the observed differences inthe gamma-ray peak widths.

1101.5339	fermi large area telescope detection of bright gamma-ray outbursts from  a peculiar quasar 4c +21.35	in this paper we report on the two-year-long fermi-lat observation of thepeculiar blazar 4c +21.35 (pks 1222+216). this source was in a quiescent statefrom the start of science operations of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope in2008 august until 2009 september, and then became more active, with graduallyincreasing flux and some moderately-bright flares. in 2010 april and june, 4c+21.35 underwent a very strong gev outburst composed of several major flarescharacterized by rise and decay timescales of the order of a day. during theoutburst, the gev spectra of 4c +21.35 displayed a broken power-law form withspectral breaks observed near 1-3 gev photon energies. we demonstrate that, atleast during the major flares, the jet in 4c +21.35 carried a total kineticluminosity comparable to the total accretion power available to feed theoutflow. we also discuss the origin of the break observed in the flaringspectra of 4c +21.35. we show that, in principle, a model involvingannihilation of the gev photons on the he ii lyman recombination continuum andline emission of "broad line region" clouds may account for such. however, wealso discuss the additional constraint provided by the detection of 4c +21.35at 0.07-0.4 tev energies by the magic telescope, which coincided with one ofthe gev flares of the source. we argue that there are reasons to believe thatthe $lesssim$,tev emission of 4c +21.35 (as well as the gev emission of thesource, if co-spatial), is not likely to be produced inside the broad lineregion zone of highest ionization ($sim 10^{17}$,cm from the nucleus), butinstead originates further away from the active center, namely around thecharacteristic scale of the hot dusty torus surrounding the 4c +21.35 nucleus($sim 10^{19}$,cm).

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1108.0501	the radio/gamma-ray connection in active galactic nuclei in the era of  the fermi large area telescope	we present a detailed statistical analysis of the correlation between radioand gamma-ray emission of the active galactic nuclei (agn) detected by fermiduring its first year of operation, with the largest datasets ever used forthis purpose. we use both archival interferometric 8.4 ghz data (from the vlaand atca, for the full sample of 599 sources) and concurrent single-dish 15 ghzmeasurements from the owens valley radio observatory (ovro, for a sub sample of199 objects). our unprecedentedly large sample permits us to assess with highaccuracy the statistical significance of the correlation, using asurrogate-data method designed to simultaneously account for common-distancebias and the effect of a limited dynamical range in the observed quantities. wefind that the statistical significance of a positive correlation between the cmradio and the broad band (e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray energy flux is very high for thewhole agn sample, with a probability &lt;1e-7 for the correlation appearing bychance. using the ovro data, we find that concurrent data improve thesignificance of the correlation from 1.6e-6 to 9.0e-8. our large sample sizeallows us to study the dependence of correlation strength and significance onspecific source types and gamma-ray energy band. we find that the correlationis very significant (chance probability &lt;1e-7) for both fsrqs and bl lacsseparately; a dependence of the correlation strength on the consideredgamma-ray energy band is also present, but additional data will be necessary toconstrain its significance.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1205.3089	radio searches of fermi lat sources and blind search pulsars: the fermi  pulsar search consortium	we present a summary of the fermi pulsar search consortium (psc), aninternational collaboration of radio astronomers and members of the large areatelescope (lat) collaboration, whose goal is to organize radio follow-upobservations of fermi pulsars and pulsar candidates among the lat gamma-raysource population. the psc includes pulsar observers with expertise using theworld's largest radio telescopes that together cover the full sky. we haveperformed very deep observations of all 35 pulsars discovered in blindfrequency searches of the lat data, resulting in the discovery of radiopulsations from four of them. we have also searched over 300 lat gamma-raysources that do not have strong associations with known gamma-ray emittingsource classes and have pulsar-like spectra and variability characteristics.these searches have led to the discovery of a total of 43 new radio millisecondpulsars (msps) and four normal pulsars. these discoveries greatly increase theknown population of msps in the galactic disk, more than double the knownpopulation of so-called `black widow' pulsars, and contain many promisingcandidates for inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1308.0595	fermi large area telescope detection of two very-high-energy (e&gt;100 gev)  gamma-ray photons from the z = 1.1 blazar pks 0426-380	we report the fermi large area telescope (lat) detection of twovery-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray photons from the directionalvicinity of the distant (redshift, z = 1.1) blazar pks 0426-380. the nullhypothesis that both the 134 and 122 gev photons originate from unrelatedsources can be rejected at the 5.5 sigma confidence level. we therefore claimthat at least one of the two vhe photons is securely associated with theblazar, making pks 0426-380 the most distant vhe emitter known to date. theresults are in agreement with the most recent fermi-lat constraints on theextragalactic background light (ebl) intensity, which imply a $z \simeq 1$horizon for $\simeq$ 100 gev photons. the lat detection of the two vhegamma-rays coincided roughly with flaring states of the source, although we didnot find an exact correspondence between the vhe photon arrival times and theflux maxima at lower gamma-ray energies. modeling the gamma-ray continuum ofpks 0426-380 with daily bins revealed a significant spectral hardening aroundthe time of detection of the first vhe event (lat photon index \gamma\ $\simeq$1.4) but on the other hand no pronounced spectral changes near the detectiontime of the second one. this combination implies a rather complex variabilitypattern of the source in gamma rays during the flaring epochs. an additionalflat component is possibly present above several tens of gev in theebl-corrected fermi-lat spectrum accumulated over the ~8-month high state.

1401.0548	fermi-lat detection of gravitational lens delayed gamma-ray flares from  blazar b0218+357	using data from the fermi large area telescope (lat), we report the firstclear gamma-ray measurement of a delay between flares from the gravitationallylensed images of a blazar. the delay was detected in b0218+357, a knowndouble-image lensed system, during a period of enhanced gamma-ray activity withpeak fluxes consistently observed to reach &gt;20-50 times its previous averageflux. an auto-correlation function analysis identified a delay in the gamma-raydata of 11.46 +/- 0.16 days (1 sigma) that is ~1 day greater than previousradio measurements. considering that it is beyond the capabilities of the latto spatially resolve the two images, we nevertheless decomposed individualsequences of superposing gamma-ray flares/delayed emissions. in three such~8-10 day-long sequences within a ~4-month span, considering confusion due tooverlapping flaring emission and flux measurement uncertainties, we found fluxratios consistent with ~1, thus systematically smaller than those from radioobservations. during the first, best-defined flare, the delayed emission wasdetailed with a fermi pointing, and we observed flux doubling timescales of~3-6 hrs implying as well extremely compact gamma-ray emitting regions.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1510.07660	the extragalactic gamma-ray sky in the fermi era	the universe is largely transparent to $\gamma$ rays in the gev energy range,making these high-energy photons valuable for exploring energetic processes inthe cosmos. after seven years of operation, the fermi {\it gamma-ray spacetelescope} has produced a wealth of information about the high-energy sky. thisreview focuses on extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources: what has been learnedabout the sources themselves and about how they can be used as cosmologicalprobes. active galactic nuclei (blazars, radio galaxies, seyfert galaxies) andstar-forming galaxies populate the extragalactic high-energy sky. fermiobservations have demonstrated that these powerful non-thermal sources displaysubstantial diversity in energy spectra and temporal behavior. coupled withcontemporaneous multifrequency observations, the fermi results are enablingdetailed, time-dependent modeling of the energetic particle acceleration andinteraction processes that produce the $\gamma$ rays, as well as providingindirect measurements of the extragalactic background light and intergalacticmagnetic fields. population studies of the $\gamma$-ray source classes comparedto the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background place constraints on some modelsof dark matter. ongoing searches for the nature of the large number of$\gamma$-ray sources without obvious counterparts at other wavelengths remainsan important challenge.

astro-ph;0112518	high-energy gamma rays from neutron stars in supernova remnants: from  egret to glast	at least three pulsars in supernova remnants were detected at e &gt; 100 mev byegret on the compton gamma ray observatory. efforts to search for additionalpulsars in the egret data have been unsuccessful due to limited statistics. anexample is the recently-discovered radio pulsar j2229+6114, where efforts tosearch the egret data using several different methods failed to findsignificant evidence of pulsation. the glast large area telescope (lat) willhave a much greater effective area and a narrower point-spread function thanegret. in addition, the field of view will be more than 4 times larger thanegret's, and the lat will scan to avoid occultation by the earth, increasing bya large factor the total number of photons detected. the greater rates ofphotons from pulsar candidates and better discrimination of diffuseinterstellar emission will enhance the sensitivity of pulsation searches. theseimprovements also offer the prospect of resolving point sources from extendedemission in some snr to define the nature of the associations of egret sourceswith snr. further, work with the glast lat will benefit from ongoingmultiwavelength studies (e.g., for rx 1836.2+5925) that provide specificcandidate targets for gamma-ray studies.

astro-ph;0112568	an agn identification for 3eg j2006-2321	we present a multiwavelength analysis of the high-energy gamma-ray source 3egj2006-2321. the flux of this source above 100 mev is shown to be variable ontime scales of days and months. optical observations and careful examination ofarchived radio data indicate that its radio counterpart is pmn j2005-2310, aflat-spectrum radio quasar with a 5-ghz flux density of 260 mjy. study of the$v=18.7$ optical counterpart indicates a redshift of 0.833 and variable linearpolarization. no x-ray source has been detected near the position of pmnj2005-2310, but an x-ray upper limit is derived from rosat data. this upperlimit provides for a spectral energy distribution with global characteristicssimilar to those of known gamma-ray blazars. taken together, these dataindicate that 3eg j2006-2321, listed as unidentified in the 3rd egret catalog,is a member of the blazar class of agn. the 5-ghz radio flux density of thisblazar is the lowest of the 68 egret-detected agn. the fact that egret hasdetected such a source has implications for unidentified egret sources,particularly those at high latitudes ($|b|&gt;30^{\circ}$), many of which may beblazars.

astro-ph;0207355	broad-band continuum and line emission of the gamma-ray blazar pks  0537-441	pks 0537-441, a bright gamma-ray emitting blazar, was observed at radio,optical, uv and x-ray frequencies during various egret pointings, oftenquasi-simultaneously. in 1995 the object was found in an intense emission stateat all wavelengths. bepposax observations made in 1998, non-simultaneously withexposures at other frequencies, allow us to characterize precisely the spectralshape of the high energy blazar component, which we attribute to inversecompton scattering. the optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distributions atthe different epochs show that the gamma-ray luminosity dominates thebolometric output. this, together with the presence of optical and uv lineemission, suggests that, besides the synchrotron self-compton mechanism, thecompton upscattering of photons external to the jet (e.g., in the broad lineregion) may have a significant role for high energy radiation. themultiwavelength variability can be reproduced by changes of the plasma bulklorentz factor. the spectrum secured by iue in 1995 appears to be partiallyabsorbed shortward of ~1700 a. however, this signature is not detected in thehst spectrum taken during a lower state of the source. the presence ofintervening absorbers is not supported by optical imaging and spectroscopy ofthe field.

astro-ph;0405634	spitzer 24micron observations of optical/near-ir selected extremely red  galaxies: evidence for assembly of massive galaxies at z~1-2 ?	we carried out the direct measurement of the fraction of dusty sources in asample of extremely red galaxies with (r - ks) &gt; 5.3mag and ks &lt; 20.2mag, using24um data from the spitzer space telescope. combining deep 24um, ks- and r-banddata over an area of 64sq.arcmin in elais n1, we find that 50%+-6% of our erosample have measurable 24um flux above the 3sigma flux limit of 40ujy. thisflux limit corresponds to a sfr of 12msun/yr at z~1. the 24um-detected eroshave 24-to-2.2 and 24-to-0.7um flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous,dusty sources at z&gt;1, and an order of magnitude too red to be explained by aninfrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift.keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected eros in the flsfield suggests that most of the eros in elais n1 are probably at z~1. the mean24um flux (167ujy) of the 24um-detected ero sample roughly corresponds to thetotal infrared luminosity of (3-10)x10^(11)lsun at z=1-1.5, which is similar tothat of local lirgs and uligs. the corresponding sfr is ~(50-170)msun/yr. ifthe time scale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 10^8yr as inferredfor the local lirgs and uligs, the lower limit on the masses of these24um-detected eros is (5-20)x10^9msun. it is plausible that some of thestarburst eros are in the midst of violent transformation to become massiveearly type galaxies at the epoch of z ~ 1-2.

astro-ph;0609042	the evolution of the number density of large disk galaxies in cosmos	we study a sample of approximately 16,500 galaxies with i_ab &lt;= 22.5 in thecosmos field. structural information on the galaxies is derived by fittingsingle sersic models to their two-dimensional surface brightness distributions.we investigate the evolution of the number density of disk galaxies larger than5 kpc between redshift z~1 and the present epoch. to this end, we use themeasurements of the half-light radii to construct, as a function of redshift,the size function of both the total disk galaxy population and of disk galaxiessplit in four bins of bulge-to-disk ratio. furthermore, we use a selectedsample of roughly 1800 sdss galaxies to calibrate our results with respect tothe local universe. we find that: (i) the number density of disk galaxies withintermediate sizes (r_{1/2}~5-7 kpc) remains nearly constant from z~1 to today.(ii) the number density of the largest disks (r_{1/2}&gt;7 kpc) decreases by afactor of about two out to z~1. (iii) there is a constancy in the numberdensity of large bulgeless disks out to z~1; the deficit of large disks atearly epochs seems to arise from a smaller number of bulged disks. our resultsindicate that the bulk of the large disk galaxy population has completed itsgrowth by z~1, and support the hypothesis that secular evolution processesproduce - or at least add stellar mass to - the bulge components of diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0612344	photometric redshifts of galaxies in cosmos	we measure photometric redshifts and spectral types for galaxies in thecosmos survey. we use template fitting technique combined with luminosityfunction priors and with the option to simultaneously estimate dust extinction(i.e. e(b-v)) for each galaxy.our estimated redshifts are accurate to i&lt;25 andz~1.2.  using simulations with sampling and noise characteristics similar to those incosmos, the accuracy and reliability is estimated for the photometric redshiftsas a function of the magnitude limits of the sample, s/n ratios and the numberof bands used. from the simulations we find that the ratio of derived 95%confidence interval in the redshift probability distribution to the estimatedphotometric redshift (d95) can be used to identify and exclude the catastrophicfailures in the photometric redshift estimates.  we compare the derived redshifts with high-reliability spectroscopicredshifts for a sample of 868 normal galaxies with z &lt; 1.2 from zcosmos.considering different scenarios, depending on using prior, no prior and/orextinction, we compare the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for thissample. this corresponds to an rms scatter of 0.031, with a small number ofoutliers (&lt;2.5%). we also find good agreement (rms=0.10) between photometricand spectroscopic redshifts for type ii agns.  we compare results from our photometric redshift procedure with three otherindependent codes and find them in excellent agreement. we show preliminaryresults, based on photometric redshifts for the entire cosmos sample (to i &lt; 25mag.).

astro-ph;0701155	discovery of a probable physical triple quasar	we report the discovery of the first known probable case of a physical triplequasar (not a gravitational lens). a previously known double system, qq1429-008 at z = 2.076, is shown to contain a third, fainter qso component atthe same redshift within the measurement errors. deep optical and ir imaging atthe keck and vlt telescopes has failed to reveal a plausible lensing galaxygroup or a cluster, and moreover, we are unable to construct any viable lensingmodel which could lead to the observed distribution of source positions andrelative intensities of the three qso image components. furthermore, there arehints of differences in broad-band spectral energy distributions of differentcomponents, which are more naturally understood if they are physically distinctagn. therefore, we conclude that this system is most likely a physical triplequasar, the first such close qso grouping known at any redshift. the projectedcomponent separations in the restframe are ~ 30 - 50 kpc for the standardconcordance cosmology, typical of interacting galaxy systems. the existence ofthis highly unusual system supports the standard picture in which galaxyinteractions lead to the onset of qso activity.
