0902.0625	designing future dark energy space mission: i. building realistic galaxy  spectro-photometric catalogs and their first applications	future dark energy space missions such as jdem and euclid are being designedto survey the galaxy population to trace the geometry of the universe and thegrowth of structure, which both depend on the cosmological model. to reach thegoal of high precision cosmology they need to evaluate the capabilities ofdifferent instrument designs based on realistic mock catalog. the aim of thispaper is to construct realistic and flexible mock catalogs based on ourknowledge of galaxy population from current deep surveys. we explore twocategories of mock catalog : (i) based on luminosity functions fit ofobservations (goods, udf,cosmos,vvds) using the le phare software (ii) based onthe observed cosmos galaxy distribution which benefits from all the propertiesof the data-rich cosmos survey. for these two catalogs, we have producedsimulated number counts in several bands, color diagrams and redshiftdistribution for validation against real observational data. we also derivesome basic requirements to help designing future dark energy mission in termsof number of galaxies available for the weak-lensing analysis as a function ofthe psf size and depth of the survey. we also compute the spectroscopic successrate for future spectroscopic redshift surveys (i) aiming at measuring bao inthe case of the wide field spectroscopic redshift survey, and (ii) for thephotometric redshift calibration survey which is required to achieve weaklensing tomography with great accuracy. they will be publicly accessible athttp://lamwws.oamp.fr/cosmowiki/realisticspectrophotcat, or by request to thefirst author of this paper.

0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0907.0087	a multiwavelength study of swift grb 060111b constraining the origin of  its prompt optical emission	in this work, we present the results obtained from a multi-wavelengthcampaign, as well as from the public swift/bat, xrt, and uvot data of grb060111b for which a bright optical emission was measured with good temporalresolution during the prompt phase. we identified the host galaxy at r~25 mag;its featureless spectral continuum and brightness, as well as the non-detectionof any associated supernova 16 days after the trigger and other independentredshift estimates, converge to z~1-2. from the analysis of the early afterglowsed, we find that non-negligible host galaxy dust extinction, in addition tothe galactic one, affects the observed flux in the optical regime. theextinction-corrected optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distribution duringthe prompt emission shows a flux density ratio $f_{\gamma}/f_{opt}$=0.01-0.0001with spectral index $\beta_{\gamma,opt}&gt; \beta_{\gamma}$, strongly suggesting aseparate origin of the optical and gamma-ray components. this result issupported by the lack of correlated behavior in the prompt emission lightcurves observed in the two energy domains. the properties of the prompt opticalemission observed during grb 060111b favor interpretation of this optical lightas radiation from the reverse shock in a thick shell limit and in the slowcooling regime. the expected peak flux is consistent with the observed onecorrected for the host extinction, likely indicating that the starting time ofthe tarot observations is very near to or coincident with the peak time. theestimated fireball initial lorentz factor is &gt;260-360 at z=1-2, similar to thelorentz factors obtained from other grbs. grb 060111b is a rare, good test caseof the reverse shock emission mechanism in both the x-ray and optical energyranges.

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0910.5649	mid- and far-infrared luminosity functions and galaxy evolution from  multiwavelength spitzer observations up to z~2.5	[abridged]we exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistentpicture of ir emission based on the time-dependent 24, 15, 12 and 8micronmonochromatic and bolometric ir luminosity functions (lf) over the 0&lt;z&lt;2.5redshift range. our analysis is based on the combination of data from deepspitzer surveys in the vvds-swire and goods areas. to our limiting flux ofs(24)=400microjy our derived sample in vvds-swire includes 1494 sources, and666 and 904 sources brighter than s(24)=80microjy are catalogued in goods-s andgoods-n, respectively, for a total area of ~0.9 square degs. we obtain reliableoptical identifications and redshifts, providing us a rich and robust datasetfor our luminosity function determination. based on the multi-wavelengthinformation available, we constrain the lfs at 8, 12, 15 and 24micron. we alsoextrapolate total ir luminosities from our best-fit to the observed seds ofeach source, and use this to derive the bolometric lf and comoving volumeemissivity up to z~2.5. in the 0&lt;z&lt;1 interval, the bolometric ir luminositydensity evolves as (1+z)^3.8+/-0.4. although more uncertain at higher-z, ourresults show a flattening of the ir luminosity density at z&gt;1. the meanredshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: thebrighest ir galaxies appear to be forming stars earlier in cosmic time (z&gt;1.5),while the less luminous ones keep doing it at more recent epochs (z~1 forl(ir)&lt;10^11l_sun). our results suggest a rapid increase of the galaxy ircomoving volume emissivity back to z~1 and a constant average emissivity atz&gt;1. we also seem to find a difference in the evolution rate of the sourcenumber densities as a function of luminosity, a downsizing evolutionary patternsimilar to that reported from other samples of cosmic sources.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1003.4294	designing future dark energy space missions: ii. photometric redshift of  space weak lensing optimized survey	accurate weak-lensing analysis requires not only accurate measurement ofgalaxy shapes but also precise and unbiased measurement of galaxy redshifts.the photometric redshift technique appears as the only possibility to determinethe redshift of the background galaxies used in the weak-lensing analysis.using the photometric redshift quality, simple shape measurement requirements,and a proper sky model, we explore what could be an optimal weak-lensing darkenergy mission based on fom calculation. we found that photometric redshiftsreach their best accuracy for the bulk of the faint galaxy population whenfilters have a resolution r~3.2. we show that an optimal mission would surveythe sky through 8 filters using 2 cameras (visible and near infrared). assuminga 5-year mission duration, a mirror size of 1.5m, a 0.5deg2 fov with a visiblepixel scale of 0.15", we found that a homogeneous survey reaching iab=25.6(10sigma) with a sky coverage of ~11000deg2 maximizes the weak lensing fom. theeffective number density of galaxies then used for wl is ~45gal/arcmin2, atleast a factor of two better than ground based survey. this work demonstratesthat a full account of the observational strategy is required to properlyoptimize the instrument parameters to maximize the fom of the futureweak-lensing space dark energy mission.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1008.0658	phat: photo-z accuracy testing	here we introduce phat, the photo-z accuracy testing programme, aninternational initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-zestimation. two different test environments are set up, one (phat0) based onsimulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, andanother one (phat1) based on data from the goods survey. the accuracy of thedifferent methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter,and outlier rates. most methods agree well on phat0 but produce photo-zscatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case.a larger spread in accuracy is found for phat1. few methods benefit from theaddition of mid-ir photometry. remaining biases and systematic effects can beexplained by shortcomings in the different template sets and the use of priorson the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. scatters of4-8% in delta_z/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. however,somewhat larger outlier rates (&gt;7.5% with delta_z/(1+z)&gt;0.15; &gt;4.5% aftercleaning) are found for all codes. there is a general trend that empiricalcodes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. the systematic,quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshotof the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard forthe assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. the rather large outlierrates reported here for phat1 on real data should be investigated further sincethey are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many otherstudies. the test data sets are publicly available and can be used to comparenew methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z methoddevelopment.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

1109.0850	galaxy cluster searches based on photometric redshifts in the four  cfhtls wide fields	we have developed a method for detecting clusters in large imaging surveys,based on the detection of structures in galaxy density maps made in slices ofphotometric redshifts. this method was first applied to the canada francehawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) deep 1 field by mazure et al. (2007),then to all the deep and wide cfhtls fields available in the t0004 data releaseby adami et al. (2010). the validity of the cluster detection rate wasestimated by applying the same procedure to galaxies from the millenniumsimulation. here we analyse with the same method the full cfhtls wide survey,based on the t0006 data release. in a total area of 154 deg2, we have detected4061 candidate clusters at 3sigma or above (6802 at 2sigma and above), in theredshift range 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=1.15, with estimated mean masses between 1.3 10^14 and12.6 10^14 m_solar. this catalogue of candidate clusters will be availableonline via vizier. we compare our detections with those made in various cfhtlsanalyses with other methods. by stacking a subsample of clusters, we show thatthis subsample has typical cluster characteristics (colour-magnitude relation,galaxy luminosity function). we also confirm that the cluster-clustercorrelation function is comparable to that obtained for other cluster surveysand analyze large scale filamentary galaxy distributions. we have increased thenumber of known optical high redshift cluster candidates by a large factor, animportant step towards obtaining reliable cluster counts to measurecosmological parameters. the clusters that we detect behave as expected for asample of clusters fed by filaments at the intersection of which they arelocated.

0711.4204	clustering properties of a type-selected volume-limited sample of  galaxies in the cfhtls	(abridged) we present an investigation of the clustering of i'ab&lt;24.5galaxies in the redshift interval 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2. using 100,000 precise photometricredshifts in the four ultra-deep fields of the canada-france legacy survey, weconstruct a set of volume-limited galaxy catalogues. we study the dependence ofthe amplitude and slope of the galaxy correlation function on absolute b-bandrest-frame luminosity, redshift and best-fitting spectral type. we find: 1. thecomoving correlation length for all galaxies decreases steadily from z~0.3 toz~1. 2. at all redshifts and luminosities, galaxies with redder rest-framecolours have clustering amplitudes between two and three times higher thanbluer ones. 3. for bright red and blue galaxies, the clustering amplitude isinvariant with redshift. 4. at z~0.5, less luminous galaxies have higherclustering amplitudes of around 6 h-1 mpc. 5. the relative bias betweengalaxies with red and blue rest-frame colours increases gradually towardsfainter absolute magnitudes. one of the principal implications of these resultsis that although the full galaxy population traces the underlying dark matterdistribution quite well (and is therefore quite weakly biased), redder, oldergalaxies have clustering lengths which are almost invariant with redshift, andby z~1 are quite strongly biased.

1301.3157	mass assembly in quiescent and star-forming galaxies since z=4 from  ultravista	we estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density forstar-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2&lt;z&lt;4. we construct a deep k&lt;24sample of 220000 galaxies selected using the ultravista dr1 data release. ouranalysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. by comparing thesephotometric redshifts with 10800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmosbright and faint surveys, we find a precision of sigma(dz/(1+z))=0.008 ati&lt;22.5 and sigma(dz/(1+zs))=0.03 at 1.5&lt;z&lt;4. we derive the stellar massfunction and correct for the eddington bias. we find a mass-dependent evolutionof the global and star-forming populations. this mass-dependent evolution is adirect consequence of the star formation being quenched in galaxies moremassive than m&gt;10^10.7msun. for the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, wedo not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z&lt;1; however weobserve a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. from z~3 to z~1, the densityof quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. their comovingstellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z~3 and z~1 and by less than0.2dex at z&lt;1. we infer the star formation history from the mass densityevolution and we find an excellent agreement with instantaneous star formationrate measurements at z&lt;1.5, while we find differences of 0.2dex at z&gt;1.5consistent with the expected uncertainties. we also develop a new method toinfer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forminggalaxies. we find that the specific star formation rate of 10^10msun galaxiesincreases continuously in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;4. finally, we compare ourresults with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimatethe density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while thedensity of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.

1303.2621	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). a support  vector machine classification of galaxies, stars and agns	the aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive method for classifyingsources in large sky surveys and we apply the techniques to the vimos publicextragalactic redshift survey (vipers). using the optical (u*, g', r', i') andnir data (z', ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, foridentifying stars, agns and galaxies improving the purity of the vipers sample.support vector machine (svm) supervised learning algorithms allow the automaticclassification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensionalparameter space. in this work, we tailored the svm for classifying stars, agnsand galaxies, and applied this classification to the vipers data. we train thesvm using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the vipers and vvds surveys.we tested two svm classifiers and concluded that including nir data cansignificantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. the self-check of thebest optical + nir classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification ofgalaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for agns in the 5-dimensional colour space. inthe test on vipers sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier givesan accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for agns. themethod was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify theirclassification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4900 objects. we conclude that the svm algorithm trained on a carefully selectedsample of galaxies, agns, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selectionmethods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification methodparticularly suitable for modern large surveys.

1310.3380	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): $\omega_{\rm  m_0}$ from the galaxy clustering ratio measured at $z \sim 1$	we use a sample of about 22,000 galaxies at $0.65&lt;z&lt;1.2$ from the viperspdr-1 catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement ofthe galaxy {\it clustering ratio} $\eta_{g,r}$. this statistic has favourableproperties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing thesmoothed density field in spheres of given radius $r$: the value of itscorrelation function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nr)$, and its variance$\sigma^2(r)$. for sufficiently large values of $r$, this is a universalnumber, capturing 2-point clustering information independently of the linearbias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. inthis paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,r}$to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selectioneffects which are typical of redshift surveys as vipers. we verify the accuracyand efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the surveyselection process. these results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,r}$ tonon-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its verydefinition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected.  we measure $\omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. in addition to the greatprecision achieved on our estimation of $\omega_m$ using vipers pdr-1, thisresult is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recentestimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained applying the same technique to the sdss-lrgcatalogue. it, therefore, suports the robustness of the present analysis.moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and othercosmological probes such as baos, cmb and supernovae.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1410.4875	evolution of the specific star formation rate function at z&lt;1.4 -  dissecting the mass-sfr plane in cosmos and goods	the relation between the stellar mass and the star formation ratecharacterizes how the instantaneous star formation is determined by the galaxypast star formation history and by the growth of the dark matter structures. wedeconstruct the m-sfr plane by measuring the specific sfr functions in severalstellar mass bins from z=0.2 out to z=1.4. our analysis is primary based on amips 24$\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the cosmos and goods surveys. weestimate the sfr by combining mid- and far-infrared data for 20500 galaxies.the ssfr functions are derived in four stellar mass bins within the range9.5&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5. first, we demonstrate the importance of taking intoaccount selection effects when studying the m-sfr relation. secondly, we find amass-dependent evolution of the median ssfr with redshift varying as $ssfr\propto (1+z)^{b}$, with $b$ increasing from $b=2.88$ to $b=3.78$ between$m=10^{9.75}msun$ and $m=10^{11.1}msun$, respectively. at low masses, thisevolution is consistent with the cosmological accretion rate and predictionsfrom semi-analytical models (sam). this agreement breaks down for more massivegalaxies showing the need for a more comprehensive description of thestar-formation history in massive galaxies. third, we obtain that the shape ofthe ssfr function is invariant with time at z&lt;1.4 but depends on the mass. weobserve a broadening of the ssfr function ranging from 0.28 dex at$m=10^{9.75}msun$ to 0.46 dex at $m=10^{11.1}msun$. such increase in thescatter of the m-sfr relation suggests an increasing diversity of sfhs as thestellar mass increases. finally, we find a gradual decline of the ssfr withmass as $log(ssfr) \propto -0.17m$. we discuss the numerous physical processes,as gas exhaustion in hot gas halos or secular evolution, which can graduallyreduce the ssfr and increase the sfh diversity.

1505.00442	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): on the correct  recovery of the count-in-cell probability distribution function	we compare three methods to measure the count-in-cell probability densityfunction of galaxies in a spectroscopic redshift survey. from this comparisonwe found that when the sampling is low (the average number of object per cellis around unity) it is necessary to use a parametric method to model the galaxydistribution. we used a set of mock catalogues of vipers, in order to verify ifwe were able to reconstruct the cell-count probability distribution once theobservational strategy is applied. we find that in the simulated catalogues,the probability distribution of galaxies is better represented by a gammaexpansion than a skewed log-normal. finally, we correct the cell-countprobability distribution function from the angular selection effect of thevimos instrument and study the redshift and absolute magnitude dependency ofthe underlying galaxy density function in vipers from redshift $0.5$ to $1.1$.we found very weak evolution of the probability density distribution functionand that it is well approximated, independently from the chosen tracers, by agamma distribution.

1505.05347	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). hierarchical  scaling and biasing	we investigate the higher-order correlation properties of the vimos publicextragalactic redshift survey (vipers) to test the hierarchical scalinghypothesis at z~1 and the dependence on galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, andredshift. we also aim to assess deviations from the linearity of galaxy biasindependently from a previously performed analysis of our survey (di porto etal. 2014). we have measured the count probability distribution function incells of radii 3 &lt; r &lt; 10 mpc/h, deriving $\sigma_{8g}$, the volume-averagedtwo-,three-,and four-point correlation functions and the normalized skewness$s_{3g}$ and kurtosis $s_{4g}$ for volume-limited subsamples covering theranges $-19.5 \le m_b(z=1.1)-5log(h) \le -21.0$, $9.0 &lt; log(m*/m_{\odot}h^{-2}) \le 11.0$, $0.5 \le z &lt; 1.1$. we have thus performed the firstmeasurement of high-order correlations at z~1 in a spectroscopic redshiftsurvey. our main results are the following. 1) the hierarchical scaling holdsthroughout the whole range of scale and z. 2) we do not find a significantdependence of $s_{3g}$ on luminosity (below z=0.9 $s_{3g}$ decreases withluminosity but only at 1{\sigma}-level). 3) we do not detect a significantdependence of $s_{3g}$ and $s_{4g}$ on scale, except beyond z~0.9, where thedependence can be explained as a consequence of sample variance. 4) we do notdetect an evolution of $s_{3g}$ and $s_{4g}$ with z. 5) the linear bias factor$b=\sigma_{8g}/\sigma_{8m}$ increases with z, in agreement with previousresults. 6) we quantify deviations from the linear bias by means of the taylorexpansion parameter $b_2$. our results are compatible with a null non-linearbias term, but taking into account other available data we argue that there isevidence for a small non-linear bias term.

0705.2438	the swire-vvds-cfhtls surveys: stellar mass assembly over the last 10  gyears. evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1	(abridged abstract) we present an analysis of the stellar mass growth overthe last 10 gyrs using a large 3.6$\mu$ selected sample. we split our sampleinto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. our measurements of the k-lfsand ld evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is alreadyassembled at $z\sim 1.2$. based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellarmass-to-light ratio (in k-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive thestellar mass density for the entire sample. we find that the global evolutionof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation ratederived from uv dust corrected measurements. over the last 8gyrs, we observethat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximatelyconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over thesame timescale. as a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in thequiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in activegalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. from $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, weobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by afactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch whenan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity andstart to build up the red sequence.

1511.01145	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). environmental  effects shaping the galaxy stellar mass function	we exploit the first public data release of vipers to investigateenvironmental effects in galaxy evolution between $z\sim0.5$ and $0.9$. thelarge number of spectroscopic redshifts over an area of about$10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. theaccurate redshift measurements, with $\sigma_z = 0.00047(1+z_\mathrm{spec})$,allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest- and highest-densityenvironments, as defined in terms of spatial 3d density contrast. we estimatethe stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies residing in these two environments,and constrain its high-mass end with unprecedented precision. we find that thegalaxy smf in the densest regions has a different shape than that measured atlow densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter(less negative) slope at $z&lt;0.8$. we normalise each smf to the comoving volumeoccupied by the corresponding environment, and relate estimates from differentredshift bins. we observe an evolution of the smf of vipers galaxies in highdensities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. we compare theseresults to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures.we discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellitegalaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic andenvironmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, and thereforedifficult to disentangle. the evolution of our low-density regions is welldescribed by the formalism introduced by peng et al.~(2010), and is consistentwith the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internalphysical processes. the same formalism could also describe the evolution of thesmf in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution fromdry mergers is considered.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

(2000) in the hdf-s and williams et al. (1996) inthe hdf-n, while the corresponding counts in the hdf-n provided byfernandez-soto et al. (1999) are systematically lower by a factor 1.5 beyondi_ab=26. after correcting for the incompleteness of the source counts, theobject surface density at i_ab&lt;27.5 is estimated to be 220 per square arcmin,providing an estimate of the extragalactic background light in the i bandconsistent with the work of madau &amp; pozzetti(2000). the comparison between themedian v-i color in the hdf-north and south shows a significant differencearound i_ab~26, possibly due to the presence of large scale structure at z~1 inthe hdf-n. high-z galaxy candidates (90 u dropout and 17 b dropout) wereselected by means of color diagrams, down to a magnitude i_ab=27, with asurface density of (21+-1) and (3.9+-0.9) per square arcmin, respectively. 11eros (with (i-k)_ab&gt;2.7) were selected down to k_ab=24, plus 3 objects whoseupper limit to the ks flux is still compatible with the selection criterion.the corresponding surface density of eros is (2.5+-0.8) per sq.arcmin((3.2+-0.9) per sq.arcmin if we include the three ks upper limits). they show aremarkably non-uniform spatial distribution and are classified with roughlyequal fractions in the categories of elliptical and starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0109453	measuring the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble deep field  south	we present an analysis of the evolution of galaxy clustering in the redshiftinterval 0&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hdf-s. the hst optical data are combined with infraredisaac/vlt observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxiesbrighter than i_ab&lt;27.5. the clustering signal is obtained in differentredshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses thebest redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes intoaccount the redshift probability function of each object. this second methodmakes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals wherecontamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. with bothmethods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the hdf-s isconsistent with the previous results in the hdf-n. while at redshift lower thanz~1 the hdf galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b&lt;1) with respect to theunderlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,depending on the cosmological model. these results support previous claimsthat, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. the impact of cosmicerrors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in theclustering measurements in the hdf surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noisein most regimes. future observations with instruments like the acs on hst willimprove the s/n by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of theerrors will be required. in fact, pure shot-noise will give a smallercontribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volumeeffects or non-poissonian discreteness effects.

astro-ph;0310131	high-z massive galaxies in the hdf-south	[abr] we report the analysis of three galaxies selected in the hubble deepfield south at ks&lt;22 on the basis of their unusually red near-ir color j-k&gt;3.we have used population synthesis models to constrain their redshifts and theirstellar masses. one galaxy is at redshift z_p~2.4 while the other two are atz_p~2.9-3.0. all three galaxies have already assembled a stellar mass of about10^{11} m_sun at the observed redshift placing the possible merging event oftheir formation at z&gt;3.5. the inferred mass weighted age of their stellarpopulations implies that the bulk of the stars formed at z_f&gt;3.5. the resultingco-moving density of m_{stars}&gt;10^{11} m_sun galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~2.7 isrho=1.2(+-0.7)x10^{-4} mpc^{-3}, about a factor two higher than the predictionsof hierarchical models. the comparison with the local density of galaxiesimplies that the three galaxies must have already formed most of their stellarmass and that they cannot follow an evolution significantly different from apassive aging.the comparison with the density of local l&gt;l* early types(passively evolved galaxies) suggests that their co-moving density cannotdecrease by more than a factor 2.5-3 from z=0 to z~3 and that up to 40% of thestellar mass content of bright (l&gt;l*) local early type galaxies was already inplace at z&gt;2.5.

astro-ph;0312064	photometric redshifts with the multilayer perceptron neural network:  application to the hdf-s and sdss	we present a technique for the estimation of photometric redshifts based onfeed-forward neural networks. the multilayer perceptron (mlp) artificial neuralnetwork is used to predict photometric redshifts in the hdf-s from an ultradeep multicolor catalog. various possible approaches for the training of theneural network are explored, including the deepest and most completespectroscopic redshift catalog currently available (the hubble deep field northdataset) and models of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies availablein the literature. the mlp can be trained on observed data, theoretical dataand mixed samples. the prediction of the method is tested on the spectroscopicsample in the hdf-s (44 galaxies). over the entire redshift range, $0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5$,the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf-sis good: the training on mixed data produces sigma_z(test) ~ 0.11, showing thatmodel libraries together with observed data provide a sufficiently completedescription of the galaxy population. the neural system capability is alsotested in a low redshift regime, 0&lt;z&lt;0.4, using the sloan digital sky surveydata release one (dr1) spectroscopic sample. the resulting accuracy on 88108galaxies is sigma_z(test) ~ 0.022. inputs other than galaxy colors - such asmorphology, angular size and surface brightness - may be easily incorporated inthe neural network technique. an important feature, in view of the applicationof the technique to large databases, is the computational speed: in theevaluation phase, redshifts of 10^5 galaxies are estimated in few seconds.

astro-ph;0402202	bias in the estimation of global luminosity functions	we discuss a bias present in the calculation of the global luminosityfunction  (lf) which occurs when analysing faint galaxy samples. this effect existsbecause of the different spectral energy distributions of galaxies, which arein turn quantified by the k-corrections. we demonstrate that this bias occursbecause not all galaxy types are visible in the same absolute magnitude rangeat a given redshift and it mainly arises at high redshift since it is relatedto large k-corrections. we use realistic simulations with observed lfs toinvestigate the amplitude of the bias. we also compare our results to theglobal lfs derived from hubble deep field-north and -south (hdf) surveys. weconclude that, as expected, there is no bias in the global lf measured in theabsolute magnitude range where all galaxy types are observable. beyond thisrange the faint-end slope of the global lf can be over/under-estimateddepending on the adopted lf estimator. the effect is larger when the referencefilter in which the global lf is measured, is far from the rest-frame filter inwhich galaxies are selected. the fact that lf estimators are differentlyaffected by this bias implies that the bias is minimal when the different lfestimators give measurements consistent with one another at the faint-end. forinstance, we show that the estimators are discrepant in the same way both inthe simulated and hdf lfs. this suggests that the hdf lfs are affected by thepresently studied bias. the best solution to avoid this bias is to derive theglobal lf in the reference filter closest to the rest-frame selection filter.

astro-ph;0411424	the galex-vvds measurement of the evolution of the far-ultraviolet  luminosity density and the cosmic star formation rate	in a companion paper (arnouts et al. 2004) we presented new measurements ofthe galaxy luminosity function at 1500 angstroms out to z~1 using galex-vvdsobservations (1039 galaxies with nuv&lt;24.5 and z&gt;0.2) and at higher z usingexisting data sets. in this paper we use the same sample to study evolution ofthe fuv luminosity density. we detect evolution consistent with a(1+z)^{2.5+/-0.7} rise to z~1 and (1+z)^{0.5+/-0.4} for z&gt;1. the luminositydensity from the most uv-luminous galaxies (uvlg) is undergoing dramaticevolution (x30) between 0&lt;z&lt;1. uvlgs are responsible for a significant fraction(&gt;25%) of the total fuv luminosity density at z&lt;1. we measure dust attenuationand star formation rates of our sample galaxies and determine the starformation rate density as a function of redshift, both uncorrected andcorrected for dust. we find good agreement with other measures of the sfrdensity in the rest ultraviolet and halpha given the still significantuncertainties in the attenuation correction.

astro-ph;0506690	the vvds-vla deep field ii. optical and near infrared identifications of  vla s(1.4ghz)&gt;80 microjy sources in the vimos vlt deep survey vvds-02h field	in this paper we present the optical and near-infrared identifications of the1054 radio sources detected in the 20cm deep radio survey down to a 5sigma fluxlimit of about 80 microjy obtained with the vla in the vimos vlt deep surveyvvds-02h deep field. using u,b,v,r,i and k data, we identified 718 radiosources (~74% of the whole sample). the photometric redshift analysis showsthat, in each magnitude bin, the radio sample has a higher median photometricredshift than the whole optical sample, while the median (v-i) color of theradio sources is redder than the median color of the whole optical sample.these results suggest that radio detection is preferentially selecting galaxieswith higher intrinsic optical luminosity. from the analysis of the opticalproperties of the radio sources as function of the radio flux, we found thatwhile about 35% of the radio sources are optically unidentified in the higherradio flux bin (s&gt; 1.0 mjy), the percentage of unidentified sources decreasesto about 25% in the faintest bins (s&lt; 0.5 mjy). the median i magnitude for thetotal sample of radio sources,i.e. including also the unidentified ones, isbrighter in the faintest radio bins than in the bin with higher radio flux.this suggests that most of the faintest radio sources are likely to beassociated to relatively lower radio luminosity objects at relatively modestredshift, rather than radio-powerful, agn type objects at high redshift.

astro-ph;0509628	a large population of galaxies 9 to 12 billion years back in the history  of the universe	to understand the evolution of galaxies, we need to know as accurately aspossible how many galaxies were present in the universe at different epochs.galaxies in the young universe have hitherto mainly been identified using theirexpected optical colours, but this leaves open the possibility that asignificant population remains undetected because their colours are the resultof a complex mix of stars, gas, dust or active galactic nuclei. here we reportthe results of a flux-limited i-band survey of galaxies at look-back times of 9to 12 billion years. we find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between1.4 and 5. this population is 1.6 to 6.2 times larger than previous estimates,with the difference increasing towards brighter magnitudes. strong ultravioletcontinua (in the rest frame of the galaxies) indicate vigorous star formationrates of more than 10 to 100 solar masses per year. as a consequence, thecosmic star formation rate is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3to 4.

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

astro-ph;0702430	structure detection in the d1 cfhtls deep field using accurate  photometric redshifts: a benchmark	we investigate structures in the d1 cfhtls deep field in order to test themethod that will be applied to generate homogeneous samples of clusters andgroups of galaxies in order to constrain cosmology and detailed physics ofgroups and clusters. adaptive kernel technique is applied on galaxy catalogues.this technique needs none of the usual a-priori assumptions (luminosityfunction, density profile, colour of galaxies) made with other methods. itsmain drawback (decrease of efficiency with increasing background) is overcameby the use of narrow slices in photometric redshift space. there are two mainconcerns in structure detection. one is false detection and the second, theevaluation of the selection function in particular if one wants "complete"samples. we deal here with the first concern using random distributions. forthe second, comparison with detailed simulations is foreseen but we use here apragmatic approach with comparing our results to galics simulations to checkthat our detection number is not totally at odds compared to cosmologicalsimulations. we use xmm-lss survey and secured vvds redshifts up to z~1 tocheck individual detections. we show that our detection method is basicallycapable to recover (in the regions in common) 100% of the c1 xmm-lss x-raydetections in the correct redshift range plus several other candidates.moreover when spectroscopic data are available, we confirm our detections, eventhose without x-ray data.

astro-ph;9806077	early-type galaxies in the hubble deep field: the star formation history	we have investigated the properties of a complete k-band selected sample of35 elliptical and s0 galaxies brighter than k=20.15 in the hubble deep field,as representative of the field galaxy population. this sample has been derivedfrom deep k-band image by the kpno-irim camera, by applying a rigorousmorphological classification scheme based on quantitative analyses of thesurface brightness profiles. the broad-band spectra of the sample galaxiesallow us to date their dominant stellar populations. the majority of brightearly-types in this field are found at redshifts z&lt;1.3 to display colorsindicative of a fairly wide range of ages (typically 1.5 to 3 gyrs). we findthat the major episodes of star-formation building up typical m_star galaxieshave taken place during a wide redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;4 for q_0=0.5, whichbecomes 1&lt;z&lt;3 for q_0=0.15. our estimated galactic masses, for a salpeter imf,are found in the range from a few billion to a few 10^{11} solar masses alreadyat z=1. so the bright end of the e/s0 population is mostly in place by thatcosmic epoch, with space densities, masses and luminosities consistent withthose of the local field e/s0 population. what distinguishes the present sampleis a remarkable absence of objects at z&gt;1.3, which should be detectable duringthe luminous star-formation phase expected to happen at these redshifts.obvious solutions are a) that the merging events imply perturbed morphologieswhich prevent selecting them by our morphological classification filter, or b)that a dust-polluted ism obscures the (either continuous or episodic) events ofstar-formation. we conclude that the likely solution is a combination thereof,i.e. a set of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts occurring during thefirst few gyrs of the galaxy's lifetime.

0810.2172	eddington ratios of faint agn at intermediate redshift: evidence for a  population of half-starved black holes	we use one of the deepest spectroscopic samples of broad line active galacticnuclei (agn) currently available, extracted from the vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), to compute mgii and civ virial masses estimate of 120 super-massiveblack holes in the redshift range 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.9 and 2.6&lt;z&lt;4.3. we find that themass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low agnluminosities (log l_bol ~ 45). at these luminosities, there is a substantialfraction of black holes accreting far below their eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd&lt; 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for agn of higherluminosities. we speculate that these may be agn on the decaying branch oftheir light-curves, well past their peak activity. this would agree with recenttheoretical predictions of agn evolution.  in the electronic appendix of this paper we publish an update of the vvdstype-1 agn sample, including the first and most of the second epochobservations. this sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

0811.2053	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z~0.9	we derive the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies up to$z\sim0.9$, using data from the vimos vlt deep survey. automatic measurement ofemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the fullspectroscopic sample. this sample is divided into two sub-samples depending onthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;22.5$) and deep$i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;24$). these two samples span two different ranges of stellarmasses. emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxiesand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. for the star-forminggalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phaseoxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to giveconsistent results at low and high redshifts. the stellar masses have beenestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set ofstellar population synthesis models. we assume at first order that the shape ofthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. then we find astronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deepsample. we thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter athigher redshift. the observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation athigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.
