0905.0588	deep 1.4 ghz follow up of the steep spectrum radio halo in abell 521	in a recent paper we reported on the discovery of a radio halo with verysteep spectrum in the merging galaxy cluster abell 521 through observationswith the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt). we showed that the steepspectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons and supports a turbulent acceleration scenario. at thattime, due to the steep spectrum, the available observations at 1.4 ghz(archival nrao - very large array - vla cnb-configuration data) were notadequate to accurately determine the flux density associated with the radiohalo. in this paper we report the detection at 1.4 ghz of the radio halo inabell 521 using deep vla observations in the d-configuration. we use these newdata to confirm the steep-spectrum of the object. we consider abell 521 theprototype of a population of very-steep spectrum halos. this population ispredicted assuming that turbulence plays an important role in the accelerationof relativistic particles in galaxy clusters, and we expect it will be unveiledby future surveys at low frequencies with the lofar and lwa radio telescopes.

0911.1723	the last breath of the young gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio source pks  1518+047	we present the results from multi-frequency vlba observations from 327 mhz to8.4 ghz of the gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio source pks 1518+047 (4c 04.51)aimed at studying the spectral index distribution across the source. furthermulti-frequency archival vla data were analysed to constrain the spectral shapeof the whole source. the pc-scale resolution provided by the vlba data allowsus to resolve the source structure in several sub-components. the analysis oftheir synchrotron spectra showed that the source components have steep spectralindices, suggesting that no supply/re-acceleration of fresh particles iscurrently taking place in any region of the source. by assuming theequipartition magnetic field of 4 mg, we found that only electrons with$\gamma$ &lt; 600, are still contributing to the radio spectrum, while electronswith higher energies have been almost completed depleted. the source radiativelifetime we derived is 2700+/-600 years. considering the best fit to theoverall spectrum, we find that the time in which the nucleus has not beenactive represents almost 20% of the whole source lifetime, indicating that thesource was 2150+/-500 years old when the radio emission switched off.

1003.2910	proper motion and apparent contraction in j0650+6001	we present a multi-epoch and multi-frequency vlbi study of the compact radiosource j0650+6001. in vlbi images the source is resolved into three components.the central component shows a flat spectrum, suggesting the presence of thecore, while the two outer regions, with a steeper spectral index, display ahighly asymmetric flux density. the time baseline of the observationsconsidered to derive the source expansion covers about 15 years. during thistime interval, the distance between the two outer components has increased by0.28+/-0.13 mas, that corresponds to an apparent separation velocity of0.39c+/-0.18c and a kinematic age of 360+/-170 years. on the other hand, amulti-epoch monitoring of the separation between the central and the southerncomponents points out an apparent contraction of about 0.29+/-0.02 mas,corresponding to an apparent contraction velocity of 0.37c+/-0.02c. assumingthat the radio structure is intrinsically symmetric, the high flux densityratio between the outer components can be explained in terms of doppler beamingeffects where the mildly relativistic jets are separating with an intrinsicvelocity of 0.43c+/-0.04c at an angle between 12 and 28 degrees to the line ofsight. in this context, the apparent contraction may be interpreted as a knotin the jet that is moving towards the southern component with an intrinsicvelocity of 0.66c+/-0.03c, and its flux density is boosted by a doppler factorof 2.0.

1006.2049	spectral variability in faint high frequency peakers	we present the analysis of simultaneous multi-frequency very large array(vla) observations of 57 out of 61 sources from the ``faint'' high frequencypeaker (hfp) sample carried out in various epochs. sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data have been used to identify the optical counterpart of each radiosource. from the analysis of the multi-epoch spectra we find that 24 sources donot show evidence of spectral variability, while 12 objects do not possess apeaked spectrum anymore at least in one of the observing epochs. among theremaining 21 sources showing some degree of variability, we find that in 8objects the spectral properties change consistently with the expectation for aradio source undergoing adiabatic expansion. the comparison between thevariability and the optical identification suggests that the majority of radiosources hosted in galaxies likely represent the young radio source population,whereas the majority of those associated with quasars are part of a differentpopulation similar to flat-spectrum objects, which possess peaked spectraduring short intervals of their life, as found in other samples ofhigh-frequency peaking objects. the analysis of the optical images from thesdss points out the presence of companions around 6 hfp hosted in galaxies,suggesting that young radio sources resides in groups.

0708.3979	constraining the nature of high frequency peakers. i. the spectral  variability	we investigate the spectral characteristics of 51 candidate high frequencypeakers (hfps), from the ``bright'' hfp sample, in order to determine thenature of each object, and to obtain a smaller sample of genuine young radiosources. simultaneous multi-frequency vla observations carried out at variousepochs have been used to detect flux density and spectral shape variability inorder to pinpoint contaminant objects, since young radio sources are notexpected to be significantly variable on such a short time-scale. from theanalysis of the spectral variability we find 13 contaminant objects, 11quasars, 1 bl lac, and 1 unidentified object, which we have rejected from thesample of candidate young radio sources. the 6 years elapsed between the firstand latest observing run are not enough to detect any substantial evolution ofthe overall spectrum of genuine, non variable, young radio sources. if we alsoconsider the pc-scale information, we find that the total radio spectrum weobserve is the result of the superposition of the spectra of different regions(lobes, hot-spots, core, jets), instead of a single homogeneous radiocomponent. this indicates that the radio source structure plays a relevant rolein determining the spectral shape also in the rather common case in which themorphology appears unresolved even on high-resolution scales.

0708.4330	radio morphology and spectral analysis of cd galaxies in rich and poor  galaxy clusters	we present a radio morphological study and spectral analysis for a sample of13 cd galaxies in rich and poor clusters of galaxies.} our study is based onnew high sensitivity giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) observations at1.28 ghz, 610 mhz and 235 mhz, and on archival data. from a statistical sampleof cluster cd galaxies we selected those sources with little informationavailable in the literature and promising for the detection of aged radioemission. beyond the high sensitivity images for all 13 radio galaxies, wepresent also a detailed spectral analysis for 7 of them. we found a variety ofmorphologies and linear sizes, as typical for radio galaxies in the radio powerrange sampled here (low to intermediate power radio galaxies). the spectralanalysis shows that 10/13 radio galaxies have steep radio spectrum, withspectral index $\alpha \ge 1$. in general, the radiative ages and growthvelocities are consistent with previous findings that the evolution of radiogalaxies at the cluster centres is affected by the dense external medium (i.e.low growth velocities and old ages. we suggest that the dominant galaxies in a2622 and mkw 03s are dying radio sources, which at present are not fed bynuclear activity. on the other hand, the spectacular source at the centre of a2372 might be a very interesting example of restarted radio galaxy. for thissource we estimated a life cycle of the order of 10$^6$ yr.

1012.0111	steep-spectrum sources and the duty cycle of the radio emission	it is currently accepted that intrinsically compact and bright radio sourcescharacterized by a convex spectrum peaking at frequencies ranging from 100 mhzto a few ghz are young objects. following the evolutionary models, theseobjects would evolve into the population of classical radio galaxies. however,the fraction of young radio sources in flux density-limited samples is muchlarger than what expected from the number counts of large radio sources. thismay suggest that for some reason a significant fraction of young objects wouldnever become large radio galaxies with sizes up to a few mpc. the discovery ofthe young radio source pks 1518+047 characterized by an uncommonly steepspectrum confirms that the radio emission may switch off shortly after itsonset. then the source spectrum steepens and evolves due to energy losses. ifthe interruption is not temporary, the fate of the fading sources is todisappear at frequencies lower than those explored by current radio telescopes.fossils of past activities have been recently found at pc-scale distances fromnewly born radio sources, suggesting the presence of short-lived objects withan intermittent radio emission.

1106.3205	multi-epoch parsec-scale observations of the blazar pks 1510-089	(abridged) we investigate the flux density variability and changes in theparsec-scale radio structure of the flat spectrum radio quasar pks 1510-089.this source was target of multi-epoch vlbi and space-vlbi observations at 4.8,8.4 and 22 ghz carried out between 1999 and 2001. the comparison of theparsec-scale structure observed at different epochs shows the presence of anon-stationary jet feature moving with a superluminal apparent velocity of16.2c+-0.7c. over three epochs at 8.4 ghz during this period the core fluxdensity varies of about 50%, while the scatter in the jet flux density iswithin 10%. the polarization percentage of both core and jet componentssignificantly change from 2 to 9 per cent, while the polarization angle of thecore shows an abrupt change of about 90 degrees becoming roughly perpendicularto the jet direction, consistent with a change in the opacity. to complete thepicture of the physical processes at work, we complemented our observationswith multi-epoch vlba data at 15 ghz from the mojave programme spanning a timebaseline from 1995 to 2010. since 1995 jet components are ejected roughly onceper year with the same position angle and an apparent speed between 15c and20c, indicating that no jet precession is taking place on a timescale longerthan a decade in our frame. the variability of the total intensity flux densitytogether with variations in the polarization properties may be explainedassuming either a change between the optically-thick and -thin regimes producedby a shock that varies the opacity, or a highly ordered magnetic field producedby the compression of the relativistic plasma by a shock propagating along thejet. taking into account the high gamma-ray emission observed from this sourceby the agile and fermi satellites we investigated the connection between theradio and gamma-ray activity during 2007-2010.

0710.0801	cosmic rays and radio halos in galaxy clusters : new constraints from  radio observations	clusters of galaxies are sites of acceleration of charged particles andsources of non-thermal radiation. we report on new constraints on thepopulation of cosmic rays in the intra cluster medium (icm) obtained via radioobservations of a fairly large sample of massive, x-ray luminous, galaxyclusters in the redshift interval 0.2--0.4. the bulk of the observed galaxyclusters does not show any hint of mpc scale synchrotron radio emission at thecluster center (radio halo). we obtained solid upper limits to the diffuseradio emission and discuss their implications for the models for the origin ofradio halos. our measurements allow us to derive also a limit to the content ofcosmic ray protons in the icm. assuming spectral indices of these protons delta=2.1-2.4 and microg level magnetic fields, as from rotation measures, theselimits are one order of magnitude deeper than present egret upper limits, whilethey are less stringent for steeper spectra and lower magnetic fields.

1205.0395	parsec-scale morphology and spectral index distribution in faint high  frequency peakers	we investigate the parsec-scale structure of 17 high frequency peaking radiosources from the faint hfp sample. vlba observations were carried out at twoadjacent frequencies, 8.4 and 15.3 ghz, both in the optically-thin part of thespectrum, to obtain the spectral index information. we found that 64% of thesources are resolved into subcomponents, while 36% are unresolved even at thehighest frequency. among the resolved sources, 7 have a morphology and aspectral index distribution typical of young radio sources, while in other 4sources, all optically associated with quasars, the radio properties resemblethose of the blazar population. the equipartition magnetic field of the singlecomponents are a few tens milligauss, similar to the values found in thehotspots of young sources with larger sizes. such high magnetic fields causesevere radiative losses, precluding the formation of extended lobe structuresemitting at centimeter wavelengths. the magnetic fields derived in the variouscomponents of individual source are usually very different, indicating a nonself-similar source evolution, at least during the very first stages of thesource growth.

0712.3516	revised statistics of radio halos and the re-acceleration model	aims. the statistical properties of radio halos can be used to discriminateamong the possible models for their origin. therefore an unbiased andexhaustive investigation in this direction is crucial.  methods. with this goal in mind in this paper we revise the occurrence ofradio halos in the redshift range 0-0.4, combining the low redshift (z&lt;0.2)statistical study of xbacs clusters with the nvss (by giovannini et al. 1999)with our recent results from the radio follow up of reflex and ebcs clusters,the gmrt radio halo survey, at higher redshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4).  results. we find a significant statistical evidence (at 3.7 sigma) of anincrease of the fraction of clusters with radio halos with the x-ray luminosity(mass) of the parent clusters and show that this increase is in line withstatistical calculations based on the re-acceleration scenario. we argue that afundamental expectation of this scenario is that the probability to have radiohalos emitting at hundred mhz is larger than that at ghz frequencies and thusthat future radio interferometers operating at low frequencies, such as lofarand lwa, should detect a larger number of radio halos with respect to thatcaught by present ghz observations. we also show that the expected increase ofthe fraction of clusters with radio halos with the cluster mass as measuredwith future lofar and lwa surveys should be less strong than that in presentsurveys.

1308.0992	radio emission at the centre of the galaxy cluster abell 3560: evidence  for core sloshing?	previous radio observations of the galaxy cluster a3560 in the shapleyconcentration showed complex radio emission associated with the brightestcluster member.to understand its origin we observed it with the gmrt, the vlaand atca at 240 and 610 mhz, 1.28,1.4, 2.3,4.8 and 8.4 ghz, and performed adetailed morphological and spectral study of the radio emission associated withthe bcg. we also observed the cluster with xmm-newton and chandra to derive theproperties of the icm. the radio emission of the n-e nucleus of the dumb-bellbcg shows an active radio galaxy, plus aged diffuse emission, which is notrefurbished at present. our chandra data show that the radio active nucleus ofthe bcg has extended x-ray emission, which we classify as a low-luminositycorona. a residual image of the xmm-newton brightness shows the presence of aspiral-like feature, which we interpret as the signature of gas sloshing. thepresence of a subgroup is clear in the surface brightness residual map, and inthe xmm-newton temperature analysis. the optical 2d analysis shows substructurein a3560. a galaxy clump was found at the location of the x-ray subgroup, andanother group is present south of the cluster core, close to the spiral-likefeature. the aged part of the radio emission closely follows the spiral patternof the x-ray residual brightness distribution, while the two active radio lobesare bent in a completely different direction. we conclude that the complexradio emission associated with the cluster bcg is the result of a minor mergerevent in a3560. the aged diffuse emission is strongly affected by the sloshingmotion in the icm. on the other hand, the bent jets and lobes of the currentradio agn activity may reflect a complex gas velocity field in the innermostcluster regions and/or sloshing-induced oscillations in the motion of the cdgalaxy.

1309.5286	on the connection between radio and gamma rays. variability and  polarization properties in relativistic jets	relativistic jets are one of the most powerful manifestations of the releaseof energy produced around supermassive black holes at the centre of activegalactic nuclei (agn). their emission is observed across the entireelectromagnetic spectrum, from the radio band to gamma rays. despite decades ofefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. inparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energyemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths areamong the greatest challenges in the study of agn. from the comparison of theradio and gamma-ray light curves of gamma-ray flaring objects, there isevidence that some flares, either in radio or in gamma rays, have not anobvious connection at the other extreme of the electromagnetic spectrum, likein the case of the narrow-line seyfert 1 sbs 0846+513. an intriguing aspectpointed out by high resolution radio observations is the change of thepolarization properties close in time with some high energy flares. inparticular, in pks 1510-089 and 3c 454.3 a rotation of almost 90 degrees hasbeen observed after strong gamma-ray flares. the swing of the polarizationangle may be related either to the propagation of a shock along the jet thatorders the magnetic field, or a change of the opacity regime.

1311.2999	physical properties in young radio sources. vlba observations of high  frequency peaking radio sources	multifrequency very long baseline array (vlba) observations were performed tostudy the radio morphology and the synchrotron spectra of four high frequencypeaking radio sources. they are resolved in several compact components and theradio emission is dominated by the hotspots/lobes. the core region isunambiguously detected in j1335+5844 and j1735+5049. the spectra of the mainsource components peak above 3 ghz. assuming that the spectral peak is producedby synchrotron self-absorption, we estimate the magnetic field directly fromobservable quantities and in half of the components it agrees with theequipartition field, while in the others the difference exceeds an order ofmagnitude. by comparing the physical properties of the targets with those oflarger objects we found that the luminosity increases with the linear size forsources smaller than a few kpc, while it decreases for larger objects. theasymmetric sources j1335+5844 and j1735+5049 suggest that the ambient medium isinhomogeneous and is able to influence the evolution of the radio emission evenduring its first stages. the core luminosity increases with the linear size forsources up to a few kpc, while it seems constant for larger sources suggestingan evolution independent from the source total luminosity.

0803.4084	gmrt radio halo survey in galaxy clusters at z = 0.2 -- 0.4. ii.the ebcs  clusters and analysis of the complete sample	we present the results of the gmrt cluster radio halo survey. the mainpurposes of our observational project are to measure which fraction of massivegalaxy clusters in the redshift range z=0.2--0.4 hosts a radio halo, and toconstrain the expectations of the particle re--acceleration model for theorigin of the non--thermal radio emission. we selected a complete sample of 50clusters in the x-ray band from the reflex (27) and the ebcs (23) catalogues.in this paper we present giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) observations at610 mhz for all clusters still lacking high sensitivity radio information, i.e.16 ebcs and 7 reflex clusters, thus completing the radio information for thewhole sample. the typical sensitivity in our images is in the range 1$\sigma\sim 35-100 \mu$jy b$^{-1}$. we found a radio halo in a697, a diffuseperipheral source of unclear nature in a781, a core--halo source in z7160, acandidate radio halo in a1682 and ``suspect'' central emission in z2661.including the literature information, a total of 10 clusters in the sample hosta radio halo. a very important result of our work is that 25 out of the 34clusters observed with the gmrt do not host extended central emission at thesensitivity level of our observations, and for 20 of them firm upper limits tothe radio power of a giant radio halo were derived. the gmrt radio halo surveyshows that radio halos are not common, and our findings on the fraction ofgiant radio halos in massive clusters are consistent with the statisticalexpectations based on the re--acceleration model. our results favour primary tosecondary electron models.

0803.4127	shock acceleration as origin of the radio relic in a521?	we present new high sensitivity observations of the radio relic in a521carried out with the giant metrewave radio telescope at 327 mhz and with thevery large array at 4.9 and 8.5 ghz. we imaged the relic at these frequenciesand carried out a detailed spectral analysis, based on the integrated radiospectrum between 235 mhz and 4.9 ghz, and on the spectral index image in thefrequency range 327-610 mhz. to this aim we used the new gmrt observations andother proprietary as well as archival data. we also searched for a possibleshock front co-located with the relic on a short archival chandra x-rayobservation of the cluster. the integrated spectrum of the relic is consistentwith a single power law; the spectral index image shows a clear trend ofsteepening going from the outer portion of the relic toward the cluster centre.we discuss the origin of the source in the light of the theoretical models forthe formation of cluster radio relics. our results on the spectral propertiesof the relic are consistent with acceleration of relativistic electrons by ashock in the intracluster medium. this scenario is further supported by ourfinding of an x-ray surface brightness edge coincident with the outer border ofthe radio relic. this edge is likely a shock front.

1411.1113	the radio relic in abell 2256: overall spectrum and implications for  electron acceleration	the galaxy cluster abell 2256 hosts one of the most intriguing examples inthe class of radio relics. it has been found that this radio relic has a ratherflat integrated spectrum at low frequencies that would imply an injectionspectral index for the electrons that is inconsistent with the flattest allowedby the test particle diffusive shock acceleration (dsa). we performed newhigh-frequency observations at 2273, 2640, and 4850 mhz. combining these newobservations with images available in the literature, we constrain the radiointegrated spectrum of the radio relic in abell 2256 over the widest sampledfrequency range collected so far for this class of objects (63 -10450 mhz).moreover, we used x-ray observations of the cluster to check the temperaturestructure in the regions around the radio relic. we find that the relic keepsan unusually flat behavior up to high frequencies. although the relicintegrated spectrum between 63 and 10450 mhz is not inconsistent with a singlepower law with $\alpha_{63}^{10450}= 0.92\pm 0.02$, we find hints of asteepening at frequencies &gt; 1400 mhz. the two frequency ranges 63-1369 mhz and1369-10450 mhz are, indeed, best represented by two different power laws, with$\alpha_{63}^{1369}= 0.85\pm 0.01$ and $\alpha_{1369}^{10450}= 1.00\pm 0.02$.this broken power law would require special conditions to be explained in termsof test-particle dsa, e.g., non-stationarity of the spectrum and/ornon-stationarity of the shock. on the other hand, the single power law wouldmake of this relic the one with the flattest integrated spectrum known so far,even flatter than what allowed in the test-particle approach to dsa. we find arather low temperature ratio of $t_2/t_1 \sim 1.7$ across the g region of theradio relic and no temperature jump across the h region.

1412.5940	cluster radio halos at the crossroads between astrophysics and cosmology  in the ska era	giant radio halos (rh) are diffuse, mpc-sized, synchrotron radio sourcesobserved in a fraction of merging galaxy clusters. the current scenario for theorigin of rhs assumes that turbulence generated during cluster mergersre-accelerates pre-existing fossil and/or secondary electrons in theintra-cluster-medium (icm) to the energies necessary to produce the observedradio emission. moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse "off state"halos produced by secondary electrons. in this chapter we use monte carlosimulations, that combine turbulent-acceleration physics and the generation ofsecondaries in the icm, to calculate the occurrence of rhs in the universe,their spectral properties and connection with properties of the hostingclusters. predictions for ska1 surveys are presented at low (100-300 mhz) andmid (1-2 ghz) frequencies assuming the expected sensitivities and spatialresolutions of ska1. ska1 will step into an unexplored territory allowing us tostudy the formation and evolution of rhs in a totally new range of clustermasses and redshift, allowing firm tests of the current theoretical hypothesis.in particular, the combination of ska1-low and sur will allow the discovery of~1000 ultrasteep- spectrum halos and to detect for the very first time "offstate" rhs. we expect that at least ~2500 giant rhs will be discovered byska1-low surveys up to z~0.6. remarkably these surveys will be sensitive to rhsin a cluster mass range (down to ~10^14 solar masses) and redshifts (up to ~1)that are unexplored by current observations. ska1 surveys will be highlycompetitive with present and future sz-surveys in the detection ofhigh-redshift massive objects.

0806.4831	are young radio sources in equipartition?	the knowledge of physical conditions in young radio sources is important fordefining the framework of models describing radio source evolution. weinvestigate whether young radio sources are in equipartition (i.e. minimumenergy) conditions by comparing the equipartition magnetic fields of 5 highfrequency peakers (hfp) with values directly inferred from the spectral peakassumed to be produced by synchrotron self absorption. multi-frequency vlbaobservations of 5 hfps were carried out in both the optically thick and thinpart of the spectrum to determine the spectral shape and angular size of thecomponents for which individual radio spectra were obtained. we find that themagnetic fields measured using observations agree well with those obtained byassuming equipartition, which implies that these sources are in minimum energycondition and the turnover in their spectra is due probably to ssa. in twosource components, we found that the peak of the spectrum is caused byabsorption of a thermal plasma instead of being due to ssa. the magnetic fieldsfound in the various components range from 10 to 100 mg. in the presence ofsuch high magnetic fields, electron populations with rather low $\gamma$ emitin the ghz-regime. in one source, we detect low-surface brightness extendedemission at low frequency located ~30 mas (~50 pc) from the main source. thisfeature may be related to either an earlier episode of radio activity or adiscontinuous start of the radio activity (sputtering). by comparing our datawith previous vlba observations, we estimate the hotspot advance speed to be inthe range 0.1-0.7c and kinematic ages of a few hundred years.

(2000), showsthat the normal to the dust disk in the nucleus is ~30 degrees from the planeof the sky and within 12 degrees of parallel to the overall orientation of theradio source. we suggest that the radio axis is also at an angle of ~30 degreesto the plane of the sky and that the north-west jet is on the approaching side.this orientation implies an overall size of 4.5 mpc (h_o = 75 km/s/mpc, q_o =0.5) for 3c236. the coincidence of a dust feature and the south-east compactjet, within the astrometric errors, leads us to suggest that the dust may be inthe form of a cloud encountered by the jet in the first ~400 pc of its journeyout from the nucleus. one-sided emission at 5 ghz on 1 mas scales would suggestthat the jets are ejected initially at &lt;= 35 degrees to the line of sight, butthis is difficult to reconcile with the obvious orientation stability of thejet system as a whole. free-free absorption of the counter-jet may be analternative explanation for the one-sideness.

astro-ph;0108185	vlba observations of ghz-peaked-spectrum radio sources at 15 ghz	we present vlba observations at 15 ghz of ten ghz peaked spectrum (gps) radiosources. the cores are often difficult or impossible to locate. when likelycores are found, they account for a small fraction of the flux density in gpsgalaxies - around or below 2%, while in gps quasars they can account for morethan 20% of the total flux density. we detect low polarization in the gpssources -- i.e., typically less than a few percent and often less than onepercent. this establishes that low polarization in the parsec scale structureis an important defining characteristic of the gps sources. the dichotomy inthe radio morphology versus optical identification, i.e., galaxies aresymmetric and quasars are not, is basically confirmed from these new data,which also indicate that the radio emission from gps quasars is dominated by ajet, with often a weak or hidden core, suggesting they are at moderate anglesto the line of sight, and so are only moderately beamed.

astro-ph;0111279	bendings of radio jets in bl lacertae objects i: evn and merlin  observations	several blazars, and bl lac objects in particular, show a misalignmentbetween the jet orientation on parsec and kiloparsec scales. some authors (i.e.conway &amp; murphy, 1993) have attempted to explain this behaviour invokinghelical jets for misalignment angles around 90$\degr$, showing how in this casethere are interesting implications for the understanding of the medium intowhich the jet is expanding. by comparing sensitive vla observations (cassaro etal., 1999) with images available in the literature for the bl lac objects fromthe 1-jy sample (stickel et al., 1991), it is clear that there is a wide rangeof misalignments between the initial jet direction and the kpc-scale jet, whendetected. we have carried out vlbi observations of these bl lac objects, inorder to investigate the spatial evolution of the radio jets from few tens tohundreds of mas, and to search for helical jets in this class of sources. wepresent here the first dataset obtained from evn+merlin observations at 5 ghzfor seven objects. from these observations we never have a clear detection ofhelical jets, we only have a possible signature of their presence in 2 objects.in only one of the sources with a misalignment angle around 90$\degr$ thepresence of helical jets can be ruled out. this implies that it is not possibleto invoke helical jets to explain the morphology of all the sources showing amisalignment of about 90$\degr$ between the parsec and the kiloparsec scalejets.

astro-ph;0302080	the radio halo in the merging cluster a3562	we present new vla observations at 1.4 ghz confirming the presence of a radiohalo at the centre of the cluster a3562, in the core of the shapleyconcentration. we also report a detailed multifrequency radio study of the headtail galaxy j1333--3141, which is completely embedded in the halo emission. theradio halo has an irregular shape, and a largest linear size of $\sim$ 620 kpc,which is among the smallest found in the literature. the source has a steepspectrum, i.e. $\alpha_{843 mhz}^{1.4 ghz} \sim 2$, and its total radio power,p$_{1.4 ghz} \sim 2 \times10^{23}$ w hz$^{-1}$, is the lowest known to date.theradio power of the halo and the x-ray parameters of the cluster, such as l$_x$and kt, nicely fit the correlations found in the literature for the other haloclusters, extending them to low radio powers. we found that the total number ofelectrons injected in the cluster environment by the head--tail source isenough to feed the halo, if we assume that the galaxy has been radio activeover a large fraction of its crossing time. we discuss possible origins of theradio halo in the light of the two--phase model (brunetti et al. 2001) andpropose that the observed scenario is the result of a young source at thebeginning of the reacceleration phase.

astro-ph;0311251	agn and starburst radio activity in the a3558 cluster complex	in this paper we present very large array (vla) 1.4 ghz (21 cm) observationsof the region between the centres of a3558 and a3562, in the majorclustermerger complex of the shapley concentration. our final catalogue includes atotal of 174 radio sources above the flux density limit of 0.25 mjy b$^{-1}$.by cross-correlation with optical and spectroscopic catalogues we found 33optical counterparts belonging to the shapley concentration. we investigatedthe effects of cluster merger on the radio emission properties of the galaxypopulation by means of the radio source counts and the radio luminosityfunctions (rlf). we found that the radio source counts are consistent with thefield source counts.the rlf of elliptical and s0 galaxies in the regionsurveyed here, is consistent with the ``universal'' rlf for early--typegalaxies.this result suggests that the deficit in radio galaxies found inourprevious works over the whole a3558 chain, is entirely due to the clustera3558. a population of faint radio galaxies (logp$_{1.4 ghz}$(w hz$^{-1}$)\ltsim 22) is also found.half of these objects are also blue, suggesting thatstarburst is the main mechanism driving the radio emission. finally, wedetected 14 spiral radio galaxies, whose ratio between radio and opticalemission is similar to those found in galaxies located in rich and dynamicallyevolved clusters. our results are briefly discussed in the light of the age andstage of the merger in the a3558 cluster complex.

astro-ph;0406225	magnetic fields and faraday rotation in clusters of galaxies	we present a numerical approach to investigate the relationship betweenmagnetic fields and faraday rotation effects in clusters of galaxies. we caninfer the structure and strength of intra-cluster magnetic fields by comparingour simulations with the observed polarization properties of extended clusterradio sources such as radio galaxies and halos. we find the observationsrequire a magnetic field which fluctuates over a wide range of spatial scales(at least one order of magnitude). if several polarized radio sources arelocated at different projected positions in a galaxy cluster, as is the casefor a119, detailed faraday rotation images allow us to constrain both themagnetic field strength and the slope of the power spectrum. our results showthat the standard analytic expressions applied in the literature overestimatethe cluster magnetic field strengths by a factor of about 2. we investigate thepossible effects of our models on beam depolarization of radio sources whoseradiation traverses the magnetized intracluster medium. finally, we point outthat radio halos may provide important information about the spatial powerspectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations on large scales. in particular,different values of the index of the power spectrum produce very differenttotal intensity and polarization brightness distributions.

astro-ph;0501068	evn observations of eleven ghz-peaked-spectrum radio sources at  2.3/8.4ghz	we present results of evn observations of eleven ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps)radio sources at 2.3/8.4 ghz. these sources are from the classical ''bright''gps source samples with peak flux densities $&gt;$ 0.2 jy and spectral indices$\alpha &lt; -0.2$ ($s \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$) in the optically thick regime oftheir convex spectra. most of the target sources did not have vlbi images atthe time this project started. the aim of the work is to find compact symmetricobject (cso) candidates from the ''bright'' gps samples. these csos play a keyrole in understanding the very early stage of the evolution of individual radiogalaxies. the reason for investigating gps source samples is that csocandidates are more frequently found among this class of radio sources. in factboth classes, gps and cso, represent a small fraction of the flux limited andflat-spectrum samples like pr+cj1 (pr: pearson-readhead survey, cj1: the firstcaltech--jodrell bank survey) and cjf (the caltech--jodrell bank flat spectrumsource survey) with a single digit percentage progressively decreasing withdecreasing flux density limit. our results, with at least 3, but possibly morecso sources detected among a sample of 11, underline the effectiveness of ourapproach. the three confirmed cso sources (1133+432, 1824+271, and 2121$-$014)are characterized by a symmetric pair of resolved components, each with steepspectral indices. five further sources (0144+209, 0554$-$026, 0904+039,0914+114 and 2322$-$040) can be considered likely cso candidates. the remainingthree sources (0159+839, 0602+780 and 0802+212) are either of core-jet type ordominated by a single component at both frequencies.

astro-ph;0505370	a supernova factory in mrk 273?	we report on 1.6 and 5.0 ghz observations of the ultraluminous infraredgalaxy (ulirg) mrk 273, using the european vlbi network (evn) and themulti-element radio-linked interferometer network (merlin). we also make use ofpublished 1.4 ghz vlba observations of mrk 273 by carilli &amp; taylor (2000). our5 ghz images have a maximum resolution of 5-10 mas, which corresponds to linearresolutions of 3.5-7 pc at the distance of mrk 273, and are the most sensitivehigh-resolution radio observations yet made of this ulirg. component n1, oftenpinpointed as a possible agn, displays a steep spectral index ($\alpha = 1.2\pm 0.1; s_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$); hence it is very difficult to reconcilewith n1 being an agn, and rather suggests that the compact nonthermal radioemission is produced by an extremely high luminous individual radio supernova(rsn), or a combination of unresolved emission from nested supernova remnants(snr), luminous rsne, or both. component n2 is partly resolved out into severalcompact radio sources --none of which clearly dominates-- and a region ofextended emission about 30 pc in size. the integrated spectral index of thisregion is flat ($\alpha = 0.15 \pm 0.1$), which can be interpreted as due to asuperposition of several unresolved components, e.g., rsne or snrs, whose radioemission peaks at different frequencies and is partially free-free absorbed.the overall extended radio emission from component n is typical of nonthermal,optically thin radio emission ($\alpha = 0.8 \pm 0.1$), and its 1.4 ghzluminosity ($l_{1.4 \rm ghz} = (2.2 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{23} $ whz$^{-1}$) isconsistent with being produced by relativistic electrons diffused away fromsupernova remnants in an outburst.

astro-ph;0505614	spectral properties and origin of the radio halo in a3562	we present a new detailed multiband study of the merging cluster a3562, inthe core of the shapley concentration supercluster. we analyzed new, lowfrequency radio data performed at 240 mhz, 332 mhz and 610 mhz with the giantmetrewave radio telescope (gmrt). the new gmrt data allowed us to carry out adetailed study of the radio halo at the centre of a3562, as well as of thehead--tail radio galaxy j1333--3141 embedded in it, and of the extendedemission around the peripheral cluster galaxy j1332--3146a. thanks to thepresent observations we could derive the integrated spectrum of the radio halowith five data points in the frequency range 240 mhz -- 1.4 ghz. our data showa clear steepening of the total spectrum in this frequency range. furthermore,by comparing the gmrt 332 mhz image with a previously published vla 1.4 ghzimage, we produced an image of the halo spectral index distribution. the imageshows a very complex structure, with an average value of$\alpha^{1.4ghz}_{332mhz} \sim 1.5$ and a number of knots steepening up to$\sim 2$. we performed a combined morphological and statistical analysis usingthe radio images and the quantities derived from xmm--newton and {\it chandra}observations. we discuss our results in the light of particle re--accelerationprocesses in galaxy clusters. in particular, we outline an overall picture,consistent with the available radio and x-ray data, in which the cluster mergerkinematics, the injection of turbulence and b--amplification induced by themerger between a 3562 and sc 1329--313 are jointly taken into account.

astro-ph;0507499	extended emission around gps radio sources	extended radio emission detected around a sample of ghz peaked spectrum (gps)radio sources is discussed. evidence for extended emission which is related tothe gps source is found in 6 objects out of 33. three objects are associatedwith quasars with core-jet pc-scale morphology, and three are identified withgalaxies with symmetric (cso) radio morphology. we conclude that the core-jetgps quasars are likely to be beamed objects with a continuous supply of energyfrom the core to the kpc scale. it is also possible that low surface brightnessextended radio emission is present in other gps quasars but the emission isbelow our detection limit due to the high redshifts of the objects. on theother hand, the cso/galaxies with extended large scale emission may berejuvenated sources where the extended emission is the relic of previousactivity. in general, the presence of large scale emission associated with gpsgalaxies is uncommon, suggesting that in the context of the recurrent activitymodel, the time scale between subsequent bursts is in general longer than theradiative lifetime of the radio emission from the earlier activity.

astro-ph;0510433	the cluster relic source in a521	we present high sensitivity radio observations of the merging cluster a521,at a mean redsfhit z=0.247. the observations were carried out with the gmrt at610 mhz and cover a region of $\sim$1 square degree, with a sensitivity limitof $1\sigma$ = 35 $\mu$jy b$^{-1}$. the most relevant result of theseobservations is the presence of a radio relic at the cluster periphery, at theedge of a region where group infalling into the main cluster is taking place.thanks to the wealth of information available in the literature in the opticaland x-ray bands, a multi--band study of the relic and its surroundings wasperformed. our analysis is suggestive of a connection between this source andthe complex ongoing merger in the a521 region. the relic might be ``revived'fossil radio plasma through adiabatic compression of the magnetic field orshock re--acceleration due to the merger events. we also briefly discussed thepossibility that this source is the result of induced ram pressure stripping ofradio lobes associated with the nearby cluster radio galaxy j0454--1016a.allowing for the large uncertainties due to the small statistics, the number ofradio emitting early--type galaxies found in a521 is consistent with theexpectations from the standard radio luminosity function for local (z$\le$0.09)cluster ellipticals.

astro-ph;0602158	vlba images of high frequency peakers	we propose a morphological classification based on the parsec scale structureof fifty-one high frequency peakers (hfps) from the ``bright'' hfp sample. vlbaimages at two adjacent frequencies (chosen among 8.4, 15.3, 22.2 and 43.2 ghz)have been used to investigate the morphological properties of the hfps in theoptically thin part of their spectrum. we confirm that there is quite a cleardistinction between the pc-scale radio structure of galaxies and quasars: the78% of the galaxies show a ``double/triple'' morphology, typical of compactsymmetric objects (csos), while the 87% of the quasars are characterised bycore-jet or unresolved structure. this suggests that most hfp candidatesidentified with quasars are likely blazar objects in which a flaringself-absorbed component at the jet base was outshining the remainder of thesource at the time of the selection based on the spectral shape. among thesources classified as csos or candidates it is possible to find extremely youngradio sources with ages of about 100 years or even less.

astro-ph;0607137	hi absorption in high-frequency peaker galaxies	wsrt observations have been used to investigate the presence of neutralhydrogen in extremely young radio galaxies. these objects were selected from asample of high-frequency peakers (hfps). we detect 2 of the 6 observed galaxiesconfirming previous detection of hi in these objects. in the case of oq 208 -for which discrepant results were available - we confirm the presence of abroad (~ 1800 km/s), blue-shifted and shallow hi absorption. no significantchanges in the hi profile have been found between the two epochs of theobservations. the intriguing result is that the derived hi column densities andupper limits obtained for the most compact sources, do not follow the inversecorrelation between the column density and the linear size found for css/gpssources. this can be explained - assuming the gas is already in a torus/diskstructure - by a combination of the orientation and the extreme compactness ofthe sources. in this scenario, our line of sight to the source would intersectthe torus in its inner region with low optical depth due to high spin andkinetic temperatures. there is no evidence, with the exception of oq 208, ofunsettled, high column density gas still enshrouding the young radio sources.this can be due to the low filling factor of such a medium.

0810.4288	a low-frequency radio halo associated with a cluster of galaxies	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in theuniverse, containing about 10^15 solar masses of hot (10^8 k) gas, galaxies anddark matter in a typical volume of about 10 mpc^3. magnetic fields andrelativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant radiohaloes, which arise from diffuse, megaparsec-scale synchrotron radiation atcluster center. radio haloes require that the emitting electrons areaccelerated in situ (by turbulence), or are injected (as secondary particles)by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium. they are found only in afraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests aconnection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. here we report a radiohalo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster abell 521. thishalo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequencycut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 ghz(the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied).the spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, whichsuggests that many radio haloes in the universe should emit mainly at lowfrequencies.
