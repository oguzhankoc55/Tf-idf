0902.0001	disk-braking in young stars: probing rotation in chamaeleon i and  taurus-auriga	we present a comprehensive study of rotation, disk and accretion signaturesfor 144 t tauri stars in the young (~2 myr old) chamaeleon i and taurus-aurigastar forming regions based on multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectra fromthe magellan clay 6.5 m telescope supplemented by mid-infared photometry fromthe spitzer space telescope. in contrast to previous studies in the orionnebula cluster and ngc 2264, we do not see a clear signature of disk braking intau-aur and cha i. we find that both accretors and non-accretors have similardistributions of v sin i. the rotational velocities in both regions show aclear mass dependence, with f--k stars rotating on average about twice as fastas m stars, consistent with results reported for other clusters of similar age.similarly, we find the upper envelope of the observed values of specificangular momentum j varies as m^0.5 for our sample which spans a mass range of~0.16 to ~3 m_sun. this power law complements previous studies in orion whichestimated j is proportional to m^0.25 for &lt; ~2 myr stars in the same massregime, and a sharp decline in j with decreasing mass for older stars (~10 myr)with m &lt; 2 m_sun. for a subsample of 67 objects with mid-ir photometry, weexamine the connection between accretion signatures and dusty disks: in thevast majority of cases (63/67), the two properties correlate well, whichsuggests that the timescale of gas accretion is similar to the lifetime ofinner disks.

0902.4235	how variable is accretion in young stars?	we analyze the variability in accretion-related emission lines for 40classical t tauri stars to probe the extent of accretion variations in youngstellar objects. our analysis is based on multi-epoch high-resolution spectrafor young stars in tau-aur and cha i. for all stars, we obtain typically fourspectra, covering timescales from hours to months. as proxies for the accretionrate, we use the h-alpha 10% width and the caii-8662 line flux. we find thatwhile the two quantities are correlated, their variability amplitude is not.converted to accretion rates, the caii fluxes indicate typical accretion ratechanges of 0.35 dex, with 32% exceeding 0.5 dex, while h-alpha 10% widthsuggests changes of 0.65 dex, with 66% exceeding 0.5 dex. we conclude that caiifluxes are a more robust quantitative indicator of accretion than h-alpha 10%width, and that intrinsic accretion rate changes typically do not exceed 0.5dex on timescales of days to months. the maximum extent of the variability isreached after a few days, suggesting that rotation is the dominant cause ofvariability. we see a decline of the inferred accretion rates towards laterspectral types, reflecting the dm/dt vs. m relationship. there is a gap betweenaccretors and non-accretors, pointing to a rapid shutdown of accretion. weconclude that the ~2 orders of magnitude scatter in the dm/dt vs. mrelationship is dominated by object-to-object scatter instead of intrinsicsource variability.

0907.0476	hot spots and a clumpy disk: variability of brown dwarfs and stars in  the young sigma ori cluster	the properties of accretion disks around stars and brown dwarfs in the soricluster (age 3 myr) are studied based on nir time series photometry supportedby mir spectral energy distributions. we monitor ~30 young low-mass sourcesover 8 nights in the j- and k-band using the dupont telescope at las campanas.we find three objects showing variability with j-band amplitudes &gt;0.5 mag; fiveadditional objects exhibit low-level variations. all three highly variablesources have been previously identified as highly variable; thus we establishthe long-term nature of their flux changes. the lightcurves contain periodiccomponents with timescales of ~0.5-8 days, but have additional irregularvariations superimposed -- the characteristic behaviour for classical t tauristars. based on the colour variability, we conclude that hot spots are thedominant cause of the variations in two objects, including one likely browndwarf, with spot temperatures in the range of 6000-7000 k. for the third one(#2), a brown dwarf or very low mass star, inhomogenities at the inner edge ofthe disk are the likely origin of the variability. based on mid-infrared datafrom spitzer, we confirm that the three highly variable sources are surroundedby circum-(sub)-stellar disks. they show typical seds for t tauri-like objects.using sed models we infer an enhanced scaleheight in the disk for the object#2, which favours the detection of disk inhomogenities in lightcurves and isthus consistent with the information from variability. in the sori cluster,about every fifth accreting low-mass object shows persistent high-levelphotometric variability. we demonstrate that estimates for fundamentalparameters in such objects can be significantly improved by determining theextent and origin of the variations.

0707.1754	emission line variability of the accreting young brown dwarf 2massw  j1207334-393254: from hours to years	we have obtained a series of high-resolution optical spectra for the browndwarf 2massw j1207334-393254 (2m1207) using the eso very large telescope withthe uves spectrograph during two consecutive observing nights (time resolutionof ~12 min) and the magellan clay telescope with the mike spectrograph.combined with previously published results, these data allow us to investigatechanges in the emission line spectrum of 2m1207 on timescales of hours toyears. most of the emission line profiles of 2m1207 are broad, in particularthat of halpha, indicating that the dominant fraction of the emission must beattributed to disk accretion rather than to magnetic activity. from the halpha10% width we deduce a relatively stable accretion rate between10^(-10.1...-9.8) msun/yr for two nights of consecutive observations.therefore, either the accretion stream is nearly homogeneous over (sub-)stellarlongitude or the system is seen face-on. small but significant variations areevident throughout our near-continuous observation, and they reach a maximumafter ~8 h, roughly the timescale on which maximum variability is expectedacross the rotation cycle. together with past measurements, we confirm that theaccretion rate of 2m1207 varies by more than one order of magnitude ontimescales of months to years. such variable mass accretion yields a plausibleexplanation for the observed spread in the accretion rate vs. mass diagram. themagnetic field required to drive the funnel flow is on the order of a fewhundred g. despite the obvious presence of a magnetic field, no radio nor x-rayemission has been reported for 2m1207. possibly strong accretion suppressesmagnetic activity in brown dwarfs, similar to the findings for higher mass ttauri stars.

0708.0266	a comprehensive view of circumstellar disks in chamaeleon i: infrared  excess, accretion signatures and binarity	we present a comprehensive study of disks around 81 young low-mass stars andbrown dwarfs in the nearby ~2-myr-old chamaeleon i star-forming region. we usemid-infrared photometry from the spitzer space telescope, supplemented byfindings from ground-based high-resolution optical spectroscopy and adaptiveoptics imaging. we derive disk fractions of 52 (+/-6) % and 58 (+6/-7) % basedon 8-micron and 24-micron colour excesses, respectively, consistent with thosereported for other clusters of similar age. within the uncertainties, the diskfrequency in our sample of k3-m8 objects in cha i does not depend on stellarmass. diskless and disk-bearing objects have similar spatial distributions.there are no obvious transition disks in our sample, implying a rapid timescalefor the inner disk clearing process; however, we find two objects with weakexcess at 3-8 microns and substantial excess at 24 microns, which may indicategrain growth and dust settling in the inner disk. for a sub-sample of 35objects with high-resolution spectra, we investigate the connection betweenaccretion signatures and dusty disks: in the vast majority of cases (29/35) thetwo are well correlated, suggesting that, on average, the timescale for gasdissipation is similar to that for clearing the inner dust disk. the exceptionsare six objects for which dust disks appear to persist even though accretionhas ceased or dropped below measurable levels. adaptive optics images of 65 ofour targets reveal that 17 have companions at (projected) separations of 10-80au. of the five &lt;20 au binaries, four lack infrared excess, possibly indicatingthat a close companion leads to faster disk dispersal. the closest binary withexcess is separated by ~20 au, which sets an upper limit of ~8 au for the outerdisk radius.

1005.3027	near-infrared thermal emission from the hot jupiter tres-2b:  ground-based detection of the secondary eclipse	we present near-infrared ks-band photometry bracketing the secondary eclipseof the hot jupiter tres-2b using the wide-field infrared camera on thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. we detect its thermal emission with an eclipsedepth of 0.062 +/- 0.012% (5-sigma). our best-fit secondary eclipse isconsistent with a circular orbit (a 3-sigma upper limit on the eccentricity, e,and argument or periastron, omega, of |ecos(omega)| &lt; 0.0090), in agreementwith mid-infrared detections of the secondary eclipse of this planet. asecondary eclipse of this depth corresponds to a day-side ks-band brightnesstemperature of tb = 1636 +/- 88 k. our thermal emission measurement whencombined with the thermal emission measurements using spitzer/irac fromo'donovan and collaborators suggest that this planet exhibits relativelyefficient day to night-side redistribution of heat and a near isothermaldayside atmospheric temperature structure, with a spectrum that is wellapproximated by a blackbody. it is unclear if the atmosphere of tres-2brequires a temperature inversion; if it does it is likely due to chemicalspecies other than tio/vo as the atmosphere of tres-2b is too cool to allowtio/vo to remain in gaseous form. our secondary eclipse has the smallest depthof any detected from the ground at around 2 micron to date.

1006.3070	the directly imaged planet around the young solar analog 1rxs  j160929.1-210524: confirmation of common proper motion, temperature and mass	giant planets are usually thought to form within a few tens of au of theirhost stars, and hence it came as a surprise when we found what appeared to be aplanetary mass (~0.008 msun) companion around the 5 myr-old solar mass star1rxs j160929.1-210524 in the upper scorpius association. at the time, we tookthe object's membership in upper scorpius -- established from near-infrared, h-and k-band spectroscopy -- and its proximity (2.2", or 330 au) to the primaryas strong evidence for companionship, but could not verify their common propermotion. here, we present follow-up astrometric measurements that confirm thatthe companion is indeed co-moving with the primary star, which we interpret asevidence that it is a truly bound planetary mass companion. we also present newj-band spectroscopy and 3.0-3.8 microns photometry of the companion. based on acomparison with model spectra, these new measurements are consistent with theprevious estimate of the companion effective temperature of 1800+/-200 k. wepresent a new estimate of the companion mass based on evolution models and thecalculated bolometric luminosity of the companion; we obtain a value of 0.008(-0.002/+0.003) msun, again consistent with our previous result. finally, wepresent angular differential imaging observations of the system allowing us torule out additional planets in the system more massive than 1, 2 and 8 mjup atprojected separations larger than 3" (~440 au), 0.7" (~100 au) and 0.35" (~50au), respectively. this companion is the least massive known to date at such alarge orbital distance; it shows that objects in the planetary mass range existat orbital separations of several hundred au, posing a serious challenge forcurrent formation models.

0708.3851	multiplicity among young brown dwarfs and very low mass stars	characterizing multiplicity in the very low mass (vlm) domain is a topic ofmuch current interest and fundamental importance. here we report on a near-irao imaging survey of 31 young brown dwarfs and vlm stars, 28 of which are inchamaeleon i, using the eso vlt. our survey is sensitive enough to detect equalmass binaries down to separations of 0.04-0.07" (6-10 au at 160 pc) and,typically, companions with mass ratios as low as 0.2 outside of 0.2" (~30 au).we resolve the suspected 0.16" (~26 au) binary cha_halpha 2 and present two newbinaries, hn 13 and chxr 15, with separations of 0.13" (~20 au) and 0.30" (~50au); the latter is one of the widest vlm systems discovered to date. we do notfind companions around the majority of our targets, giving a binary frequencyof 11% [+9,-6], thus confirming the trend for a lower binary frequency withdecreasing mass. by combining our work with previous surveys, we arrive at thelargest sample of young vlmos (72) with high angular resolution imaging todate. its multiplicity fraction is in statistical agreement with that for vlmosin the field. in addition we note that many field stellar binaries with lowerbinding energies and/or wider cross sections have survived dynamical evolutionand that statistical models suggest tidal disruption by passing stars isunlikely to affect the binary properties of our systems. thus, we argue thatthere is no significant evolution of multiplicity with age among brown dwarfsand vlm stars in ob and t associations between a few myr to several gyr.instead, the observations to date suggest that vlm objects are either lesslikely to be born in fragile multiple systems than solar mass stars or suchsystems are disrupted very early.

1105.2577	high-contrast imaging search for planets and brown dwarfs around the  most massive stars in the solar neighborhood	there has been a long-standing discussion in the literature as to whethercore accretion or disk instability is the dominant mode of planet formation.over the last decade, several lines of evidence have been presented showingthat core accretion is most likely the dominant mechanism for the close-inpopulation of planets probed by radial velocity and transits. however, thisdoes not by itself prove that core accretion is the dominant mode for the totalplanet population, since disk instability might conceivably produce and retainlarge numbers of planets in the far-out regions of the disk. if this is arelevant scenario, then the outer massive disks of b-stars should be among thebest places for massive planets and brown dwarfs to form and reside. in thisstudy, we present high-contrast imaging of 18 nearby massive stars, of which 15are in the b2--a0 spectral type range and provide excellent sensitivity to widecompanions. by comparing our sensitivities to model predictions of diskinstability based on physical criteria for fragmentation and cooling, and usingmonte-carlo simulations for orbital distributions, we find that ~85 % of suchcompanions should have been detected in our images on average. given this highdegree of completeness, stringent statistical limits can be set from thenull-detection result, even with the limited sample size. we find that &lt;32 % ofmassive stars form and retain disk instability planets, brown dwarfs and verylow-mass stars of &lt;100 mjup within 300 au, at 99 % confidence. these results,combined with previous findings in the literature, lead to the conclusion thatcore accretion is likely the dominant mode of planet formation.

1201.3403	large amplitude variations of an l/t transition brown dwarf:  multi-wavelength observations of patchy, high-contrast cloud features	we present multiple-epoch photometric monitoring in the $j$, $h$, and $k_s$bands of the t1.5 dwarf 2mass j21392676+0220226 (2m2139), revealing persistent,periodic ($p=7.721\pm$0.005 hr) variability with a peak-to-peak amplitude ashigh as 26% in the $j$-band. the light curve shape varies on a timescale ofdays, suggesting that evolving atmospheric cloud features are responsible.using interpolations between model atmospheres with differing cloud thicknessesto represent a heterogeneous surface, we find that the multi-wavelengthvariations and the near-infrared spectrum of 2m2139 can be reproduced by either(1)cool, thick cloud features sitting above a thinner cloud layer, or (2)warmregions of low condensate opacity in an otherwise cloudy atmosphere, possiblyindicating the presence of holes or breaks in the cloud layer. we find thattemperature contrasts between thick and thin cloud patches must be greater than175 k and as high as 425 k. we also consider whether the observed variabilitycould arise from an interacting binary system, but this scenario is ruled out.2m2139 joins the t2.5 dwarf simp0136 discovered by artigau and coworkers as thesecond l/t transition brown dwarf to display large-amplitude variability onrotational timescales, suggesting that the fragmentation of dust clouds at thel/t transition may contribute to the abrupt decline in condensate opacity and$j$-band brightening observed to occur over this regime.

0704.3266	rotation and activity of pre-main-sequence stars	we present a study of rotation (vsini) and chromospheric activity (halpha ew)based on an extensive set of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with mikeon the 6.5m magellan clay telescope. our targets are 74 f-m dwarfs in the youngstellar associations eta cha, tw hydrae, beta pic, and tuc-hor, spanning agesfrom 6 to 30 myr. while the halpha ew for most f and g stars are consistentwith pure photospheric absorption, most k and m stars show chromosphericemission. by comparing halpha ew in our sample to results in the literature, wesee a clear evolutionary sequence: chromospheric activity declines steadilyfrom the t tauri phase to the main sequence. using activity as an ageindicator, we find a plausible age range for the tuc-hor association of 10-40myr. between 5 and 30 myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in thetotal sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.this difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 myr,possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disklifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. the rotation-activity relation isflat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linearcorrelation for slow rotators. we argue that this is because young starsgenerate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way frommain-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.by comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for asubset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) myr and 9 (7-17} myr for theeta cha and twa associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by baraffe et al.(1998) are in agreement with the observed radii within +-15%.

1209.2121	new brown dwarf companions to young stars in scorpius-centaurus	we present the discoveries of three faint companions to young stars in thescorpius-centaurus region, imaged with the nici instrument on gemini south. wehave confirmed all three companions through common proper motion tests.follow-up spectroscopy has confirmed two of them, hip 65423 b and hip 65517 b,to be brown dwarfs, while the third, hip 72099 b, is more likely a verylow-mass star just above the hydrogen burning limit. the detection of widecompanions in the mass range of ~40--100 mjup complements previous work in thesame region, reporting detections of similarly wide companions with lowermasses, in the range of ~10--30 mjup. such low masses near the deuteriumburning limit have raised the question of whether those objects formed likeplanets or stars. the existence of intermediate objects as reported here couldrepresent a bridge between lower-mass companions and stellar companions, but inany case demonstrate that mass alone may not provide a clear-cut distinctionfor the formation of low-mass companions to stars.

1303.4151	hst spectral mapping of l/t transition brown dwarfs reveals cloud  thickness variations	most directly imaged giant exoplanets are fainter than brown dwarfs withsimilar spectra. to explain their relative underluminosity unusually cloudyatmospheres have been proposed. however, with multiple parameters varyingbetween any two objects, it remained difficult to observationally test thisidea. we present a new method, sensitive time-resolved hubble space telescopenear-infrared spectroscopy, to study two rotating l/t transition brown dwarfs(2m2139 and simp0136). the observations provide spatially and spectrallyresolved mapping of the cloud decks of the brown dwarfs. the data allow thestudy of cloud structure variations while other parameters are unchanged. wefind that both brown dwarfs display variations of identical nature: j- andh-band brightness variations with minimal color and spectral changes. our lightcurve models show that even the simplest surface brightness distributionsrequire at least three elliptical spots. we show that for each source thespectral changes can be reproduced with a linear combination of only twodifferent spectra, i.e. the entire surface is covered by two distinct types ofregions. modeling the color changes and spectral variations together revealpatchy cloud covers consisting of a spatially heterogenous mix oflow-brightness, low-temperature thick clouds and brighter, thin and warmclouds. we show that the same thick cloud patches seen in our varying browndwarf targets, if extended to the entire photosphere, predict near-infraredcolors/magnitudes matching the range occupied by the directly imaged exoplanetsthat are cooler and less luminous than brown dwarfs with similar spectraltypes. this supports the models in which thick clouds are responsible for thenear infrared properties of these underluminous exoplanets.

1305.3271	optical phase curves of kepler exoplanets	we have conducted a comprehensive search for optical phase variations of allplanet candidates with tight orbits in fifteen quarters of data from the keplerspace telescope. after correcting for systematics, we found eight systems thatappear to show secondary eclipses as well as phase variations. of these, five(kepler-5, kepler-6, kepler-8, koi-64 and koi-2133) are new and three (tres-2,hat-p-7 and koi-13) have previously published phase curves, albeit with manyfewer observations. we model the full phase curve of each planet candidate,including the primary and secondary transits, and derive their albedos, day-and night-side temperatures, ellipsoidal variations and doppler beaming. wefind that koi-64 and koi-2133 have night-side temperatures well above theirequilibrium values (while koi-2133 also has an albedo &gt;1), so we conclude thatthey are likely to be self-luminous objects rather than planets. thecharacteristics of the six other candidates are consistent with their beingplanets with low geometric albedos (&lt;0.3). for tres-2 and koi-13, the keplerbandpass appears to probe atmospheric layers hotter than the planet'sequilibrium temperature. for koi-13, we detect a never-before-seen third cosineharmonic with an amplitude of 6.7+/-0.3 ppm and a phase shift of -1.1+/-0.1radians in the phase curve residual, which could be due to its spin-orbitmisalignment. we report derived planetary parameters for all six planets,including masses from ellipsoidal variations and doppler beaming, and compareour results to published values when available. our results nearly double thenumber of kepler exoplanets with measured phase curve variations, thusproviding valuable new constraints on the properties of close-in hot jupiters.

1305.5544	search for rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of gj1214b	we investigate the atmosphere of gj1214b, a transiting super-earth planetwith a low mean density, by measuring its transit depth as a function ofwavelength in the blue optical portion of the spectrum. it is thought that thisplanet is either a mini-neptune, consisting of a rocky core with a thick,hydrogen-rich atmosphere, or a planet with a composition dominated by water.most observations favor a water-dominated atmosphere with a small scale-height,however, some observations indicate that gj1214b could have an extendedatmosphere with a cloud layer muting the molecular features. in an atmospherewith a large scale-height, rayleigh scattering at blue wavelengths is likely tocause a measurable increase in the apparent size of the planet towards theblue. we observed the transit of gj1214b in the b-band with the focal reducingspectrograph (fors) at the very large telescope (vlt) and in the g-band withboth acam on the william hershel telescope (wht) and the wide field camera(wfc) at the isaac newton telescope (int). we find a planet-to-star radiusratio in the b-band of 0.1162+/-0.0017, and in the g-band 0.1180+/-0.0009 and0.1174+/-0.0017 for the wht &amp; int observations respectively. these optical datado not show significant deviations from previous measurements at longerwavelengths. in fact, a flat transmission spectrum across all wavelengths bestdescribes the combined observations. when atmospheric models are considered asmall scale-height water-dominated model fits the data best.

1306.0935	quick-mess: a fast statistical tool for exoplanet imaging surveys	several tools have been developed in the past few years for the statisticalanalysis of the exoplanet search surveys, mostly using a combination ofmonte-carlo simulations or a bayesian approach.here we present the quick-mess,a grid-based, non-monte carlo tool aimed to perform statistical analyses onresults from and help with the planning of direct imaging surveys. quick-messuses the (expected) contrast curves for direct imaging surveys to assess foreach target the probability that a planet of a given mass and semi-major axiscan be detected. by using a grid-based approach quick-mess is typically morethan an order of magnitude faster than tools based on monte-carlo sampling ofthe planet distribution. in addition, quick-mess is extremely flexible,enabling the study of a large range of parameter space for the mass andsemi-major axes distributions without the need of re-simulating the planetdistribution. in order to show examples of the capabilities of the quick-mess,we present the analysis of the gemini deep planet survey and the predictionsfor upcoming surveys with extreme-ao instruments.

1307.2243	a multiplicity census of intermediate-mass stars in scorpius-centaurus	stellar multiplicity properties have been studied for much of the range fromthe lowest to the highest stellar masses, but intermediate-mass stars fromf-type to late a-type have received relatively little attention. here we reporton a gemini/nici snapshot imaging survey of 138 such stars in the youngscorpius-centaurus (sco-cen) region, for the purpose of studying multiplicitywith sensitivity down to planetary masses at wide separations. in addition totwo brown dwarfs and a companion straddling the hydrogen burning limit wereported previously, here we present 26 new stellar companions and determine amultiplicity fraction within 0.1"--5.0" of 21+/-4%. depending on the adoptedsemi-major axis distribution, our results imply a total multiplicity in therange of ~60--80%, which further supports the known trend of a smoothlycontinuous increase in the multiplicity fraction as a function of primarystellar mass. a surprising feature in the sample is a distinct lack of nearlyequal-mass binaries, for which we discuss possible reasons. the survey yieldedno additional companions below or near the deuterium-burning limit, implyingthat their frequency at &gt;200 au separations is not quite as high as might beinferred from previous detections of such objects within the sco-cen region.

1308.5702	discovery of a visual t-dwarf triple system and binarity at the l/t  transition	we present new high contrast imaging of 8 l/t transition brown dwarfs usingthe nirc2 camera on the keck ii telescope. one of our targets, the t3.5 dwarf2mass j08381155 + 1511155, was resolved into a hierarchal triple with projectedseparations of 2.5+/-0.5 au and 27+/-5 au for the bc and a(bc) componentsrespectively. resolved osiris spectroscopy of the a(bc) components confirm thatall system members are t dwarfs. the system therefore constitutes the firsttriple t-dwarf system ever reported. using resolved photometry to model theintegrated-light spectrum, we infer spectral types of t3, t3, and t4.5 for thea, b, and c components respectively. the uniformly brighter primary has a bluerj-ks color than the next faintest component, which may reflect a sensitivedependence of the l/t transition temperature on gravity, or alternativelydivergent cloud properties amongst components. relying on empirical trends andevolutionary models we infer a total system mass of 0.034-0.104 msun for the bccomponents at ages of 0.3-3 gyr, which would imply a period of 12-21 yrassuming the system semi-major axis to be similar to its projection. we alsoinfer differences in effective temperatures and surface gravities betweencomponents of no more than ~150 k and ~0.1 dex. given the similar physicalproperties of the components, the 2m0838+15 system provides a controlled samplefor constraining the relative roles of effective temperature, surface gravity,and dust clouds in the poorly understood l/t transition regime. combining ourimaging survey results with previous work we find an observed binary fractionof 4/18 or 22_{-8}^{+10}% for unresolved spectral types of l9-t4 at separations&gt;~0.1 arcsec. this translates into a volume-corrected frequency of13^{-6}_{+7}%, which is similar to values of ~9-12% reported outside thetransition.

1309.0823	substellar objects in nearby young clusters vii: the substellar mass  function revisited	the abundance of brown dwarfs (bds) in young clusters is a diagnostic of starformation theory. here we revisit the issue of determining the substellarinitial mass function (imf), based on a comparison between ngc1333 and ic348,two clusters in the perseus star-forming region. we derive their massdistributions for a range of model isochrones, varying distances, extinctionlaws and ages, with comprehensive assessments of the uncertainties. we findthat the choice of isochrone and other parameters have significant effects onthe results, thus we caution against comparing imfs obtained using differentapproaches. for ngc1333, we find that the star/bd ratio r is between 1.9 and2.4, for all plausible scenarios, consistent with our previous work. for ic348,r is between 2.9 and 4.0, suggesting that previous studies have overestimatedthis value. thus, the star forming process generates about 2.5-5 substellarobjects per 10 stars. the derived star/bd ratios correspond to a slope of thepower-law mass function of alpha=0.7-1.0 for the 0.03-1.0msol mass range. themedian mass in these clusters - the typical stellar mass - is between0.13-0.30msol. assuming that ngc1333 is at a shorter distance than ic348, wefind a significant difference in the cumulative distribution of masses betweenthe two clusters, resulting from an overabundance of very low mass objects inngc1333. gaia astrometry will constrain the cluster distances better and willlead to a more definitive conclusion. furthermore, ratio r is somewhat largerin ic348 compared with ngc1333, although this difference is still within themargins of error. our results indicate that environments with higher objectdensity may produce a larger fraction of very low mass objects, in line withpredictions for brown dwarf formation through gravitational fragmentation offilaments falling into a cluster potential.

1407.2245	changing phases of alien worlds: probing atmospheres of kepler planets  with high-precision photometry	we present a comprehensive analysis of planetary phase variations, includingpossible planetary light offsets, using eighteen quarters of data from thekepler space telescope. after correcting for systematics, we found fourteensystems with significant detections in each of the phase curve components:planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, doppler boosting and ellipsoidalvariations. we model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary andsecondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures andplanet masses. most planets manifest low optical geometric albedos (&lt;0.25),with the exception of kepler-10b, kepler-91b and koi-13b. we find that koi-13b,with a small eccentricity of 0.0006+\-0.0001, is the only planet for which aneccentric orbit is favored. we detect a third harmonic with an amplitude of1.9+\-0.2 ppm for hat-p-7b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonicfor koi-13b reported in esteves et al. : both could be due to their spin-orbitmisalignments. for six planets, we report a planetary brightness peak offsetfrom the substellar point: of those, the hottest two (kepler-76b and hat-p-7b)exhibit pre-eclipse shifts or to the evening-side, while the cooler four(kepler-7b, kepler-8b, kepler-12b and kepler-41b) peak post-eclipse or on themorning-side. our findings dramatically increase the number of kepler planetswith detected planetary light offsets, and provide the first evidence in thekepler data for a correlation between the peak offset direction and theplanet's temperature. such a correlation could arise if thermal emissiondominates light from hotter planets that harbor hot spots shifted toward theevening-side, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominatescooler planets with clouds on the planet's morning-side.

1506.05132	protoplanetary disk evolution: singles vs. binaries	based on a large number of observations carried out in the last decade itappears that the fraction of stars with protoplanetary disks declines steadilybetween ~1 myr and ~10 myr. we do, however, know that the multiplicity fractionof star-forming regions can be as high as &gt;50% and that multiples have reduceddisk lifetimes on average. as a consequence, the observed roughly exponentialdisk decay can be fully attributed neither to single nor binary stars and itsfunctional form may need revision. observational evidence for a non-exponentialdecay has been provided by kraus et al. (2012), who statistically correctprevious disk frequency measurements for the presence of binaries and findagreement with models that feature a constantly high disk fraction up to ~3myr, followed by a rapid ($\lesssim$2 myr) decline. we present results from ourhigh angular resolution observational program to study the fraction ofprotoplanetary disks of single and binary stars separately. we find that diskevolution timescales of stars bound in close binaries (&lt;100 au) aresignificantly reduced compared to wider binaries. the frequencies of accretorsamong single stars and wide binaries appear indistinguishable, and are found tobe lower than predicted from planet forming disk models governed by viscousevolution and photoevaporation.

1511.05965	the frequency of accretion disks around single stars: chamaeleon i	it is well known that stellar companions can influence the evolution of aprotoplanetary disk. nevertheless, previous disk surveys did not - and couldnot - consistently exclude binaries from their samples. we present a studydedicated to investigating the frequency of ongoing disk accretion aroundsingle stars in a star-forming region. we obtained near-infrared spectroscopyof 54 low-mass stars selected from a high-angular resolution survey in the 2-3myr-old chamaeleon i region to determine the presence of brackett-$\gamma$emission, taking the residual chance of undetected multiplicity into account,which we estimate to be on the order of 30%. the result is compared withprevious surveys of the same feature in binary stars of the same region toprovide a robust estimate of the difference between the accretor fractions ofsingle stars and individual components of binary systems. we find br$\gamma$emission among $39.5^{+14.0}_{-9.9}$% of single stars, which is a significantlyhigher fraction than for binary stars in chamaeleon i. in particular, closebinary systems with separations &lt;100 au show emission in only$6.5^{+16.5}_{-3.0}$% of the cases according to the same analysis. the emitterfrequency of wider binaries appears consistent with the single star value.interpreting br$\gamma$ emission as a sign of ongoing accretion and correctingfor sensitivity bias, we infer an accretor fraction of single stars off_acc=$47.8^{+14.0}_{-9.9}$%. this is slightly higher but consistent withprevious estimates that do not clearly exclude binaries from their samples.through our robust and consistent analysis, we confirm that the fraction ofyoung single stars harboring accretion disks is much larger than that of closebinaries at the same age. our findings have important implications for thetimescales of disk evolution and planet formation.

astro-ph;0008052	mid-infrared imaging of the massive young star afgl 2591: probing the  circumstellar environment of an outflow source	most, if not all, stars are now believed to produce energetic outflows duringtheir formation. yet, almost 20 years after the discovery of bipolar outflowsfrom young stars, the origins of this violent phenomenon are not wellunderstood. one of the difficulties of probing the outflow process,particularly in the case of massive embedded stars, is a deficit of highspatial resolution observations. here, we present sub-arcsecond-resolutionmid-infrared images of one massive young stellar object, afgl 2591, and itsimmediate surroundings. our images, at 11.7, 12.5 and 18.0 microns, reveal aknot of emission ~6'' sw of the star, which may be evidence for a recentejection event or an embedded companion star. this knot is roughly coincidentwith a previously seen near-infrared reflection nebula and a radio source, andlies within the known large-scale co outflow. we also find a new faint nwsource which may be another embedded lower-luminosity star. the irasmid-infrared spectrum of afgl 2591 shows a large silicate absorption feature at10 microns, implying that the primary source is surrounded by an opticallythick dusty envelope. we discuss the interrelationship of these phenomena andsuggest that mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy provide powerful tools forprobing massive star birth.

astro-ph;0010051	infall models of class 0 protostars	we have carried out radiative transfer calculations of infalling, dustyenvelopes surrounding embedded protostars to understand the observed propertiesof the recently identified ``class 0'' sources. to match the far-infrared peaksin the spectral energy distributions of objects such as the prototype class 0source vla 1623, pure collapse models require mass infall rates$\sim10^{-4}\msun$yr$^{-1}$. the radial intensity distributions predicted bysuch infall models are inconsistent with observations of vla 1623 at sub-mmwavelengths, in agreement with the results of andre et al. (1993) who found adensity profile of $\rho \propto r^{-1/2}$ rather than the expected $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ gradient. to resolve this conflict, while still invokinginfall to produce the outflow source at the center of vla 1623, we suggest thatthe observed sub-mm intensity distribution is the sum of two components: aninner infall zone, plus an outer, more nearly constant-density region. thisexplanation of the observations requires that roughly half the total massobserved within 2000 au radius of the source lies in a region external to theinfall zone. the column densities for this external region are comparable tothose found in the larger oph a cloud within which vla 1623 is embedded. theextreme environments of class 0 sources lead us to suggest an alternative oradditional interpretation of these objects: rather than simply concluding withandre et al. that class 0 objects only represent the earliest phases ofprotostellar collapse, and ultimately evolve into older ``class i'' protostars,we suggest that many class 0 sources could be the protostars of very denseregions.

astro-ph;0303565	evidence for a t tauri phase in young brown dwarfs	as part of a multi-faceted program to investigate the origin and earlyevolution of sub-stellar objects, we present high-resolution keck opticalspectra of 14 very low mass sources in the ic 348 young cluster and the taurusstar-forming cloud. all of our targets, which span a range of spectral typesfrom m5 to m8, exhibit moderate to very strong h$\alpha$ emission. in half ofthe ic 348 objects, the h$\alpha$ profiles are broad and asymmetric, indicativeof on-going accretion. of these, ic348-355 (m8) is the lowest mass object todate to show accretion-like h$\alpha$. three of our ~m6 ic 348 targets withbroad h$\alpha$ also harbor broad oi (8446\aa) and caii (8662\aa) emission, andone shows broad hei (6678\aa) emission; these features are usually seen instrongly accreting classical t tauri stars. we find that in very low massaccretors, the h$\alpha$ profile may be somewhat narrower than that in highermass stars. we propose that low accretion rates combined with small infallvelocities at very low masses can conspire to produce this effect. in thenon-accretors in our sample, h$\alpha$ emission is commensurate with, or higherthan, saturated levels in field m dwarfs of similar spectral type. our resultsconstitute the most compelling evidence to date that young brown dwarfs undergoa t tauri-like accretion phase similar to that in stars. this is consistentwith a common origin for most low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and isolatedplanetary mass objects.

astro-ph;0306514	magellan echelle spectroscopy of tw hydrae brown dwarfs	we present high-resolution optical spectroscopy of four candidate members ofthe nearby tw hydrae young association including three brown dwarfs (2mass1207-3932, 2mass 1139-3159 and twa 5b) and one t tauri multiple star (twa 5a).using echelle spectra from the magellan baade 6.5-meter telescope, we confirmthe pre-main sequence status and cluster membership of the substellarcandidates, through the detection of lii, nai consistent with low gravity, andradial velocity. given their late spectral type (~m8) and the youth of theassociation (age ~10myr), cluster membership certifies these three objects asvery low-mass young brown dwarfs. one of them (2mass 1207-3932) shows strongemission both in the hydrogen balmer series (h_alpha to h_epsilon) and in hei(4471, 5876, 6678 and 7065 a), compared to other young brown dwarfs of similarspectral type. the h_alpha line is also relatively broad (10% width ~200 km/s)and asymmetric. these characteristics suggest that 2mass 1207-3932 is a (weak)accretor. while we cannot rule out activity, comparison to a flaring fielddwarf implies that such activity would have to be quite anomalous. theverification of accretion would make 2mass 1207-3932 the oldest activelyaccreting brown dwarf known to date, suggesting that inner disk lifetimes insubstellar objects can be comparable to those in stars, consistent with asimilar formation mechanism. finally, twa 5a appears to be a variable accretor:observations separated by two days show broad accretion-like h_alpha (10% width\~270 km/s), with significant changes in the h_alpha profile, as well as in thestrengths of hei, na d and [oi 6300]. twa 5a is known to be a close triple;thus, our result implies that long-lived disks can exist even in multiplesystems.

0808.3584	lithium depletion of nearby young stellar associations	we estimate cluster ages from lithium depletion in five pre-main-sequencegroups found within 100 pc of the sun: tw hydrae association, eta chamaeleontiscluster, beta pictoris moving group, tucanae-horologium association and abdoradus moving group. we determine surface gravities, effective temperaturesand lithium abundances for over 900 spectra through least squares fitting tomodel-atmosphere spectra. for each group, we compare the dependence of lithiumabundance on temperature with isochrones from pre-main-sequence evolutionarytracks to obtain model dependent ages. we find that the eta chamaelontiscluster and the tw hydrae association are the youngest, with ages of 12+/-6 myrand 12+/-8 myr, respectively, followed by the beta pictoris moving group at21+/-9 myr, the tucanae-horologium association at 27+/-11 myr, and the abdoradus moving group at an age of at least 45 myr (where we can only set alower limit since the models -- unlike real stars -- do not show much lithiumdepletion beyond this age). here, the ordering is robust, but the precise agesdepend on our choice of both atmospheric and evolutionary models. as a result,while our ages are consistent with estimates based on hertzsprung-russellisochrone fitting and dynamical expansion, they are not yet more precise. ourobservations do show that with improved models, much stronger constraintsshould be feasible: the intrinsic uncertainties, as measured from the scatterbetween measurements from different spectra of the same star, are very low:around 10 k in effective temperature, 0.05 dex in surface gravity, and 0.03 dexin lithium abundance.

astro-ph;0403265	measuring fundamental parameters of substellar objects. i: surface  gravities	(abridged) we present an analysis of high resolution optical spectra for asample of very young, mid- to late m, low-mass stellar and substellar objectsin upper sco and taurus. effective temperatures (t_eff) and surface gravitiesare derived from a multi-feature spectral analysis using tio, nai and ki,through comparison with the latest synthetic spectra. in combination, theyallow us to determine t_eff to within 50k and gravity to within 0.25 dex. ourhigh-resolution analysis does not require extinction estimates. moroever, ityields t_eff and gravities independent of theoretical evolutionary models. wefind that our gravities for most of the sample agree remarkably well with theisochrone predictions for the likely cluster ages. however, discrepanciesappear in our coolest targets: these appear to have significantly lower gravity(by up to 0.75 dex) than our hotter objects, even though our entire samplecovers a relatively narrow range in t_eff (about 300k). this drop in gravity isalso implied by inter-comparisons of the data alone, without recourse tosynthetic spectra. we consider, and argue against, dust opacity, cool stellarspots or metallicity differences leading to the observed spectral effects; areal decline in gravity is strongly indicated. such gravity variations arecontrary to the predictions of the evolutionary tracks, causing improbably lowages to be inferred from the tracks for our coolest targets. we venture thatthese results may arise from evolutionary model uncertainties related toaccretion, deuterium-burning and/or convection effects. finally, when combinedwith photometry and distances, our technique for deriving gravities andtemperatures provides a way of obtaining masses and radii for substellarobjects independent of evolutionary models, as presented in paper ii.

astro-ph;0403269	measuring fundamental parameters of substellar objects. ii: masses and  radii	we present mass and radius derivations for a sample of very young, mid- tolate m, low-mass stellar and substellar objects in upper sco and taurus. in aprevious paper, we determined effective temperatures and surface gravities forthese targets, from an analysis of their high-resolution optical spectra andcomparisons to the latest synthetic spectra. we now derive extinctions, radii,masses and luminosities by combining our previous results with observedphotometry, surface fluxes from the synthetic spectra and the known clusterdistances. these are the first mass and radius estimates for young, very lowmass bodies that are independent of theoretical evolutionary models (though ourestimates do depend on spectral modeling). we find that for most of our sample,our derived mass-radius and mass-luminosity relationships are in very goodagreement with the theoretical predictions. however, our results diverge fromthe evolutionary model values for the coolest, lowest-mass targets: ourinferred radii and luminosities are significantly larger than predicted forthese objects at the likely cluster ages, causing them to appear much youngerthan expected. we suggest that uncertainties in the evolutionary models - e.g.,in the choice of initial conditions and/or treatment of interior convection -may be responsible for this discrepancy. finally, two of our late-m objects(usco 128 and 130) appear to have masses close to the deuterium-fusion boundary(9--14 jupiters, within a factor of 2). this conclusion is primarily aconsequence of their considerable faintness compared to other targets withsimilar extinction, spectral type and temperature (difference of 1 mag). ourresult suggests that the faintest young late-m or cooler objects may besignificantly lower in mass than the current theoretical tracks indicate.

astro-ph;0502155	the t tauri phase down to nearly planetary masses: echelle spectra of 82  very low mass stars and brown dwarfs	using the largest high-resolution spectroscopic sample to date of young, verylow mass stars (vlms) and brown dwarfs (bds), we investigate disk accretion inobjects ranging from just above the hydrogen-burning limit all the way tonearly planetary masses. our 82 targets span spectral types from m5 to m9.5, ormasses from 0.15 msun down to ~15 jupiters. they are confirmed members of therho oph, taurus, cha i, ic 348, r cra, upper sco and tw hydrae regions, withages &lt;1 to ~10 myr. the sample contains 41 bds (spectral types &gt;= m6.5). wefind that: (1) classical t tauri-like disk-accretion persists in the bd domaindown to nearly the deuterium-burning limit; (2) in addition to h-alpha,permitted emission lines of caii, oi and hei are also good accretionindicators, as in ctts; (3) the caii 8662a flux is an excellent quantitativemeasure of the accretion rate (mdot) in vlms and bds(as in ctts); (4) mdotdiminishes as m^2 -- our measurements support previous findings of thiscorrelation, and extend it to the entire range of sub-stellar masses; (5) theaccretor fraction among vlms and bds decreases substantially with age, as inhigher-mass stars; (6) at any given age, the vlms and bd accretor fraction iscomparable to that in higher-mass stars; and (7) a number of sources with irdisk excesses do not evince measurable accretion, with the incidence of such amismatch increasing with age: this implies that disks in the low mass regimecan persist beyond the main accretion phase, and parallels the transition fromthe classical to post-t tauri stage in more massive stars. these strongsimilarities at young ages, between higher-mass stars and low-mass bodies closeto and below the hydrogen-burning limit, are consistent with a common formationmechanism in the two mass regimes.

astro-ph;0510629	variable accretion and outflow in young brown dwarfs	we report on the first dedicated monitoring campaign of spectroscopicvariability in young brown dwarfs. high-resolution optical spectra of sixtargets in nearby star-forming regions were obtained over 11 nights between2005 january-march on the magellan 6.5m telescope. we find significantvariability in halpha and a number of other emission lines related to accretionand outflow processes on a variety of timescales ranging from hours to weeks toyears. the most dramatic changes are seen for 2m1207, 2m1101 and chai-iso217.we observe possible accretion rate changes by about an order of magnitude intwo of these objects, over timescales of weeks (2m1207) or hours (2m1101). theaccretion 'burst' seen in 2m1101 could be due to a 'clumpy' flow. we also seeindications for changes in the outflow rate in at least three objects. in onecase (iso217), there appears to be a ~1-hour time lag between outflow andaccretion variations, consistent with a scenario in which the wind originatesfrom the inner disk edge. our variability study supports a close to edge-oninclination for the brown dwarf ls-rcra 1. the fact that all targets in oursample show variations in accretion and/or outflow indicators suggests thatstudies of young brown dwarf properties should be based either on large samplesor time series. as an example, we demonstrate that the large scatter in therecently found accretion rate vs. mass relationship can be explained primarilywith variability. the observed profile variations imply asymmetric accretionflows in brown dwarfs, which, in turn, is evidence for magnetic funneling bylarge-scale fields. we show that accreting sub-stellar objects may harbormagnetic fields with ~kg strength (abridged).

astro-ph;0603619	exploring brown dwarf disks: a 1.3 mm survey in taurus	we have carried out sensitive 1.3 mm observations of 20 young brown dwarfs inthe taurus star-forming region, representing the largest sample of youngsubstellar objects targeted in a deep millimeter continuum survey to date.under standard assumptions, the masses of brown dwarf disks range from ~&lt;0.4 toseveral jupiter masses. their relative disk masses are comparable to thosederived for coeval low-mass stars: most of them are in the ~&lt;1-5% range, andthere is no clear change of relative disk mass with object mass from 0.015 to 3solar masses. specifically, we do not find evidence for disk truncation, aswould be expected in the ejection scenario for brown dwarf origin, although thesignature of ejection may be hidden in our non-detections. we use the derivedmm fluxes, complemented by mid-infrared data from the spitzer space telescopeand ground-based near-infrared images, to construct spectral energydistributions (seds) for six of our sources, and model those seds with a montecarlo radiative transfer code. while the model fits are by no means unique,they allow us to investigate disk properties such as the degree of flaring andminimum radii. in several cases, we find that the seds in the mid-infraredexhibit lower flux levels than predicted by hydrostatic models, implying dustsettling to the disk midplane. what's more, at least 25% of our targets arelikely to have disks with radii &gt;10 au; models with smaller disks cannotreproduce the mm fluxes even if they are very massive. this finding is incontrast to the results of some simulations of the ejection scenario for browndwarf formation that suggest only ~5% of ejected objects would harbor diskslarger than 10 au. our findings imply that ejection is probably not thedominant formation process, but may still be relevant for some brown dwarfs.

astro-ph;0605601	accretion disks around young stars: lifetimes, disk locking and  variability	we report the findings of a comprehensive study of disk accretion and relatedphenomena in four of the nearest young stellar associations spanning 6-30million years in age, an epoch that may coincide with the late stages of planetformation. we have obtained ~650 multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectra of100 low-mass stars that are likely members of the eta chamaeleontis (~6 myr),tw hydrae (~8 myr), beta pictoris (~12 myr) and tucanae-horologium (~30 myr)groups. our data were collected over 12 nights between 2004 december - 2005july on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. based on h$\alpha$ line profiles,along with a variety of other emission lines, we find clear evidence ofon-going accretion in three out of 11 eta cha stars and two out of 32 tw hydraemembers. none of the 57 beta pic or tuc-hor members shows measurable signs ofaccretion. together, these results imply significant evolution of the diskaccretion process within the first several myr of a low-mass star's life. whilea few disks can continue to accrete for up to ~10 myr, our findings suggestthat disks accreting for beyond that timescale are rather rare. this resultprovides an indirect constraint on the timescale for gas dissipation in innerdisks and, in turn, on gas giant planet formation. all accretors in our sampleare slow rotators, whereas non-accretors cover a large range in rotationalvelocities. this may hint at rotational braking by disks at ages up to ~8 myr.our multi-epoch spectra confirm that emission-line variability is common evenin somewhat older t tauri stars, among which accretors tend to showparticularly strong variations. thus, our results indicate that accretion andwind activity undergo significant and sustained variations throughout thelifetime of accretion disks.

astro-ph;0607152	spectroscopy of young planetary mass candidates with disks	it is now well established that many young brown dwarfs exhibitcharacteristics similar to classical t tauri stars, including infrared excessfrom disks and emission lines related to accretion. whether the same holds truefor even lower mass objects, namely those near and below the deuterium-burninglimit, is an important question. here we present optical spectra of sixisolated planetary mass candidates in chamaeleon ii, lupus i and ophiuchusstar-forming regions, recently identified by allers and collaborators to harborsubstantial mid-infrared excesses. our spectra, from eso's very large telescopeand new technology telescope, show that four of the targets have spectral typesin the ~m9-l1 range, and three of those also exhibit h_alpha. theirluminosities are consistent with masses of ~5-15 m_{jupiter} according tomodels of chabrier, baraffe and co-workers, thus placing these four objectsamong the lowest mass brown dwarfs known to be surrounded by circum-sub-stellardisks. our findings bolster the idea that free-floating planetary mass objectscould have infancies remarkably similar to those of sun-like stars and suggestthe intriguing possibility of planet formation around primaries whose massesare comparable to those of extra-solar giant planets. another target appears tobe a brown dwarf (~m8) with prominent h_alpha emission, possibly arising fromaccretion. the sixth candidate is likely a background source, underlining theneed for spectroscopic confirmation.

astro-ph;0610601	infrared spectroscopy of the ultra low mass binary oph 162225-240515	binary properties are an important diagnostic of the star and brown dwarfformation processes. while wide binaries appear to be rare in the sub-stellarregime, recent observations have revealed ophiuchus 162225-240515 (2massj16222521-2405139) as a likely young ultra-low-mass binary with an apparentseparation of ~240 au. here, we present low-resolution near-infrared spectra ofthe pair from ntt/sofi (r~600) and vlt/isaac (r~1400), covering the 1.0-2.5umspectral region. by comparing to model atmospheres from chabrier &amp; baraffe andburrows et al., we confirm the surface temperatures to be t_a = (2350+/-150) kand t_b = (2100+/-100) k for the two components of the binary, consistent withearlier estimates from optical spectra. using gravity sensitive k i features,we find the surface gravity to be significantly lower than field dwarfs of thesame spectral type, providing the best evidence so far that these objects areindeed young. however, we find that models are not sufficiently reliable toinfer accurate ages/masses from surface gravity. instead, we derive masses ofm_a = 13 (+8/-4) m_j and m_b = 10 (+5/-4) m_j for the two objects using thewell-constrained temperatures and assuming an age of 1-10 myr, consistent withthe full range of ages reported for the oph region.

0705.4290	the gemini deep planet survey -- gdps	we present the results of the gemini deep planet survey, a near-infraredadaptive optics search for giant planets and brown dwarfs around nearby youngstars. the observations were obtained with the altair adaptive optics system atthe gemini north telescope and angular differential imaging was used tosuppress the speckle noise of the central star. detection limits for the 85stars observed are presented, along with a list of all faint point sourcesdetected around them. typically, the observations are sensitive to angularseparations beyond 0.5" with 5-sigma contrast sensitivities in magnitudedifference at 1.6 micron of 9.5 at 0.5", 12.9 at 1", 15.0 at 2", and 16.5 at5". for the typical target of the survey, a 100 myr old k0 star located 22 pcfrom the sun, the observations are sensitive enough to detect planets moremassive than 2 mjup with a projected separation in the range 40-200 au. secondepoch observations of 48 stars with candidates (out of 54) have confirmed thatall candidates are unrelated background stars. a detailed statistical analysisof the survey results, yielding upper limits on the fractions of stars withgiant planet or low mass brown dwarf companions, is presented. assuming aplanet mass distribution dn/dm m^{-1.2} and a semi-major axis distributiondn/da a^{-1}, the 95% credible upper limits on the fraction of stars with atleast one planet of mass 0.5-13 mjup are 0.28 for the range 10-25 au, 0.13 for25-50 au, and 0.093 for 50-250 au. the 95% credible interval for the fractionof stars with at least one brown dwarf companion having a semi-major axis inthe range 25-250 au is 0.019 (-0.015/+0.083), irrespective of any assumption onthe mass and semi-major axis distributions. the stars hd 14802, hd 166181, andhd 213845 have been resolved into binaries for the first time.

astro-ph;0701703	evolution of brown dwarf disks: a spitzer survey in upper scorpius	we have carried out a spitzer survey for brown dwarf (bd) disks in the ~5 myrold upper scorpius (upsco) star forming region, using irs spectroscopy from 8to 12\mu m and mips photometry at 24\mu m. our sample consists of 35 confirmedvery low mass members of upsco. thirteen objects in this sample show clearexcess flux at 24\mu m, explained by dust emission from a circum-sub-stellardisk. objects without excess emission either have no disks at all or disks withinner opacity holes of at least ~5 au radii. our disk frequency of 37\pm 9% ishigher than what has been derived previously for k0-m5 stars in the same region(on a 1.8 sigma confidence level), suggesting a mass-dependent disk lifetime inupsco. the clear distinction between objects with and without disks as well asthe lack of transition objects shows that disk dissipation inside 5 au occursrapidly, probably on timescales of &lt;~10^5 years. for the objects with disks,most seds are uniformly flat with flux levels of a few mjy, well modeled asemission from dusty disks affected by dust settling to the midplane, which alsoprovides indirect evidence for grain growth. the silicate feature around 10\mum is either absent or weak in our seds, arguing for a lack of hot, small dustgrains. compared with younger objects in taurus, bd disks in upsco show lessflaring. taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that we see disks inan advanced evolutionary state: dust settling and grain growth are ubiquituousin circum-sub-stellar disks at ages of 5 myr, arguing for planet formingprocesses in bd disks. for almost all our targets, results from high-resolutionspectroscopy and high-spatial resolution imaging have been published before,thus providing a large sample of bds for which information about disks,accretion, and binarity is available.

astro-ph;9806188	a dust disk surrounding the young a star hr4796a	we report the codiscovery of the spatially-resolved dust disk of thevega-like star hr 4796a. images of the thermal dust emission at $\lambda = 18\mu$m show an elongated structure approximately 200 au in diameter surroundingthe central a0v star. the position angle of the disk, $30^{\circ} \pm10^{\circ}$, is consistent to the position angle of the m companion star,$225^{\circ}$, suggesting that the disk-binary system is being seen nearlyalong its orbital plane. the surface brightness distribution of the disk isconsistent with the presence of an inner disk hole of approximately 50 auradius, as was originally suggested by jura et al. on the basis of the infraredspectrum. hr 4796 is a unique system among the vega-like or $\beta$ pictorisstars in that the m star companion (a weak-emission t tauri star) shows thatthe system is relatively young, $\sim 8 \pm 3$ myr. the inner disk hole mayprovide evidence for coagulation of dust into larger bodies on a timescalesimilar to that suggested for planet formation in the solar system.

astro-ph;9905173	mid-infrared imaging of the young binary star hen 3-600: evidence for a  dust disk around the primary	we present high-resolution mid-infrared observations of the nearby late-typeyoung binary system hen 3-600. the binary, at a distance of $\sim$ 50 pc, couldbe a member of the tw hydrae association, the nearest known group of youngstars, with an age of a few million years. our images make it possible for thefirst time to determine which star in the pair, separated by 1.4'', harbors themid-infrared excess detected by iras. in the near-infrared, where the radiationis primarily photospheric, hen 3-600a (m3) and hen 3-600b (m3.5) have a fluxratio of 1.6. at 4.8$\mu$m, 10.8$\mu$m, and 18.2$\mu$m, the primary becomesincreasingly dominant over the secondary, suggesting that most of thecircumstellar dust in the system resides around hen 3-600a. comparison of thespectral energy distribution (sed) of hen 3-600a to the median sed of classicalt tauri stars suggests that its disk may be truncated by the secondary andprovides tentative evidence for a central disk hole. the distribution of dustin the hen 3-600 system may provide important clues to the formation andevolution of protoplanetary disks in close binaries.

astro-ph;9906280	the complex protostellar source iras 04325+2402	we report hubble space telescope near-infrared nicmos observations of aremarkable low-luminosity class i (protostellar) source in the taurus molecularcloud. iras 04325+2402 exhibits a complex bipolar scattered light nebula. thecentral continuum source is resolved and may be multiple, or may be crossed bya small dust lane. complex arcs seen in scattered light surround the centralsource; the physical nature of these structures is not clear, but they mayreflect perturbations from multiple stellar sources or from time-dependent massejection. a second, resolved continuum source is found at a projected distanceof approximately 1150 au from the central region, near the edge of a nebularlobe probably produced by outflow. the images indicate that this second sourceis another low-luminosity young stellar object, seen nearly edge-on through adusty disk and envelope system with disk diameter $\sim 60$ au. we suggest thatthe scattered light ``streaks'' associated with this second source arelimb-brightened outflow cavities in the dusty envelope, possibly perturbed byinteraction with the outflow lobes of the main source. the nature of thecompanion is uncertain, since it is observed mostly in scattered light, but ismost probably a very low mass star or brown dwarf, with a minimum luminosity of$\sim 10^{-2} \lsun$. our results show that protostellar sources may havemultiple centers of infall and non-aligned disks and outflows, even onrelatively small scales.

astro-ph;9906316	a disk census for the nearest group of young stars: mid-infrared  observations of the tw hydrae association	a group of young, active stars in the vicinity of tw hydrae has recently beenidentified as a possible physical association with a common origin. given itsproximity ($\sim$50 pc), age ($\sim$10 myr) and abundance of binary systems,the tw hya association is ideally suited to studies of diversity and evolutionof circumstellar disks. here we present mid-infrared observations of 15candidate members of the group, 11 of which have no previous flux measurementsat wavelengths longer than 2$\mu$m. we report the discovery of a possible10$\mu$m excess in cd -33$^{\circ}$7795, which may be due to a circumstellardisk or a faint, as yet undetected binary companion. of the other stars, onlytw hya, hd 98800, hen 3-600a, and hr 4796a -- all of which were detected byiras -- show excess thermal emission. our 10$\mu$m flux measurements for theremaining members of the association are consistent with photospheric emission,allowing us to rule out dusty inner disks. in light of these findings, wediscuss the origin and age of the tw hya association as well as implicationsfor disk evolution timescales.
