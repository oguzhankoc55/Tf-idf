0905.4742	heracles: the hera co-line extragalactic survey	we present the hera co-line extragalactic survey (heracles), an atlas of coemission from 18 nearby galaxies that are also part of the hi nearby galaxysurvey (things) and the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). weused the hera multi-pixel receiver on the iram 30-m telescope to map the coj=2-1 line over the full optical disk (defined by the isophotal radius r_25) ofeach target, at 13" angular resolution and 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. herewe describe the observations and reduction of the data and show channel maps,azimuthally averaged profiles, integrated intensity maps, and peak intensitymaps. the implied h2 masses range from 7 \times 10^6 to 6 \times 10^9 m_sun,with four low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies yielding only upper limits.in the cases where co is detected, the integrated h2-to-hi ratios range from0.02 - 1.13 and h2-to-stellar mass ratios from 0.01 to 0.25. exponential scalelengths of the co emission for our targets are in the range 0.8 - 3.2 kpc, or0.2 \pm 0.05 r_25. the intensity-weighted mean velocity of co matches that ofhi very well, with a 1\sigma scatter of only 6 km/s. the co j=2-1 / j=1-0 lineratio varies over a range similar to that found in the milky way and othernearby galaxies, \sim 0.6 - 1.0, with higher values found in the centers ofgalaxies. the typical line ratio, \sim 0.8, could be produced by opticallythick gas with an excitation temperature of \sim 10 k.

0707.0395	warm molecular hydrogen in the spitzer sings galaxy sample	(simplified) results on the properties of warm h2 in 57 normal galaxies arederived from h2 rotational transitions, obtained as part of sings. this studyextends previous extragalactic surveys of h2, the most abundant constituent ofthe molecular ism, to more common systems (l_fir = e7 to 6e10 l_sun) of allmorphological and nuclear types. the s(1) transition is securely detected inthe nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5m_sun. the derived column densities of warm h2 (t &gt; ~100 k), even thoughaveraged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolvedpdrs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. they amount to between 1% and &gt;30%of the total h2. the power emitted in the sum of the s(0) to s(2) transitionsis on average 30% of the [siii] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infraredpower (tir) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistentwith excitation in pdrs. the fact that h2 emission scales tightly with pahemission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factorten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in pdrs,either dense or diffuse. a large fraction of the 25 liner/sy targets, however,strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer h2 in the excitedstates, and an excess of h2 emission with respect to pahs, tir and [siii]. wepropose a threshold in h2 to pah power ratios, allowing the identification oflow-luminosity agns by an excess h2 excitation. a dominant contribution fromshock heating is favored in these objects. finally, we detect, in nearly halfthe star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent withfuv pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,or possibly non-equilibrium pdr fronts advancing into cold gas.

0907.3031	evidence of triggered star formation in g327.3-0.6. dust-continuum  mapping of an infrared dark cloud with p-art\'emis	aims. expanding hii regions and propagating shocks are common in theenvironment of young high-mass star-forming complexes. they can compress apre-existing molecular cloud and trigger the formation of dense cores. weinvestigate whether these phenomena can explain the formation of high-massprotostars within an infrared dark cloud located at the position of g327.3-0.6in the galactic plane, in between two large infrared bubbles and two hiiregions. methods: the region of g327.3-0.6 was imaged at 450 ? m with the ceap-art\'emis bolometer array on the atacama pathfinder experiment telescope inchile. apex/laboca and apex-2a, and spitzer/irac and mips archives data wereused in this study. results: ten massive cores were detected in the p-art\'emisimage, embedded within the infrared dark cloud seen in absorption at both 8 and24 ?m. their luminosities and masses indicate that they form high-mass stars.the kinematical study of the region suggests that the infrared bubbles expandtoward the infrared dark cloud. conclusions: under the influence of expandingbubbles, star formation occurs in the infrared dark areas at the border of hiiregions and infrared bubbles.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2634	the herschel first look at protostars in the aquila rift	as part of the science demonstration phase of the herschel mission of thegould belt key program, the aquila rift molecular complex has been observed.the complete ~ 3.3deg x 3.3deg imaging with spire 250/350/500 micron and pacs70/160 micron allows a deep investigation of embedded protostellar phases,probing of the dust emission from warm inner regions at 70 and 160 micron tothe bulk of the cold envelopes between 250 and 500 micron. we used a systematicdetection technique operating simultaneously on all herschel bands to build asample of protostars. spectral energy distributions are derived to measureluminosities and envelope masses, and to place the protostars in an m_env -l_bol evolutionary diagram. the spatial distribution of protostars indicatesthree star-forming sites in aquila, with w40/sh2-64 hii region by far therichest. most of the detected protostars are newly discovered. for a reducedarea around the serpens south cluster, we could compare the herschel census ofprotostars with spitzer results. the herschel protostars are younger than inspitzer with 7 class 0 ysos newly revealed by herschel. for the entire aquilafield, we find a total of ~ 45-60 class 0 ysos discovered by herschel. thisconfirms the global statistics of several hundred class~0 ysos that should befound in the whole gould belt survey.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.1016	resolving the far-ir line deficit: photoelectric heating and far-ir line  cooling in ngc 1097 and ngc 4559	the physical state of interstellar gas and dust is dependent on the processeswhich heat and cool this medium. to probe heating and cooling of the ism over alarge range of infrared surface brightness, on sub-kiloparsec scales, we employline maps of [c \ii] 158 $\mu$m, [o \one] 63 $\mu$m, and [n \ii] 122 $\mu$m inngc 1097 and ngc 4559, obtained with the pacs spectrometer onboard {\itherschel}. we matched new observations to existing spitzer-irs data that tracethe total emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). we confirm atsmall scales in these galaxies that the canonical measure of photoelectricheating efficiency, ([c \ii] + [o \one])/tir, decreases as the far-infraredcolor, $\nu f_\nu$(70 $\mu$m)/$\nu f_\nu$(100 $\mu$m), increases. in contrast,the ratio of far-infrared (far-ir) cooling to total pah emission, ([c \ii] + [o\one])/pah, is a near constant $\sim$6% over a wide range of far-infraredcolor, 0.5 \textless\ $\nu f_\nu$(70 $\mu$m)/$\nu f_\nu$(100 $\mu$m) $\lesssim$0.95. in the warmest regions, where $\nu f_\nu$(70 $\mu$m)/$\nu f_\nu$(100$\mu$m) $\gtrsim$ 0.95, the ratio ([c \ii] + [o \one])/pah drops rapidly to 4%.we derived representative values of the local uv radiation density, $g_0$, andthe gas density, $n_h$, by comparing our observations to models ofphotodissociation regions. the ratio $g_0/n_h$, derived from fine-structurelines, is found to correlate with the mean dust-weighted starlight intensity,$&lt;u&gt;$ derived from models of the ir sed. emission from regions that exhibit aline deficit is characterized by an intense radiation field, indicating thatsmall grains are susceptible to ionization effects. we note that there is ashift in the 7.7 / 11.3 $\mu$m pah ratio in regions that exhibit a deficit in([c \ii] + [o \one])/pah, suggesting that small grains are ionized in theseenvironments.

1201.2178	the dust &amp; gas properties of m83	we examine the dust and gas properties of the nearby, barred galaxy m83,which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey. using images from the pacs andspire instruments of herschel, we examine the dust temperature and dust masssurface density distribution. we find that the nuclear, bar and spiral armregions exhibit higher dust temperatures and masses compared to interarmregions. however, the distribution of dust temperature and mass are notspatially coincident. assuming a trailing spiral structure, the dusttemperature peaks in the spiral arms lie ahead of the dust surface densitypeaks. the dust mass surface density correlates well with the distribution ofmolecular gas as traced by co (j=3-2) images (jcmt) and the star formation rateas traced by h?2 with a correction for obscured star formation using 24 micronemission. using hi images from things to trace the atomic gas component, wemake total gas mass surface density maps and calculate the gas-to-dust ratio.we find a mean gas-to-dust ratio of 84 \pm 4 with higher values in the innerregion assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion factor. we also examine thegas-to-dust ratio using co-to-h2 conversion factor that varies withmetallicity.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

1203.5721	the dust properties of bubble hii regions as seen by herschel	because of their relatively simple morphology, "bubble" hii regions have beeninstrumental to our understanding of star formation triggered by hii regions.with the far-infrared (fir) spectral coverage of the herschel satellite, we canaccess the wavelengths where these regions emit the majority of their energythrough their dust emission. at herschel wavelengths 70 micron to 500 micron,the emission associated with hii regions is dominated by the cool dust in theirphotodissociation regions (pdrs). we find average dust temperatures of 26kalong the pdrs, with little variation between the hii regions in the sample,while local filaments and infrared dark clouds average 19k and 15krespectively. higher temperatures lead to higher values of the jeans mass,which may affect future star formation. the mass of the material in the pdr,collected through the expansion of the hii region, is between ~300 and ~10,000solar masses for the hii regions studied here. these masses are in roughagreement with the expected masses swept up during the expansion of the \hii\regions. approximately 20% of the total fir emission is from the direction ofthe bubble central regions. this suggests that we are detecting emission fromthe "near-side" and "far-side" pdrs along the line of sight and that bubblesare three-dimensional structures. we find only weak support for a relationshipbetween dust temperature and beta, of a form similar to that caused by noiseand calibration uncertainties alone.

1207.1301	mapping the cold dust temperatures and masses of nearby kingfish  galaxies with herschel	taking advantage of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the herschelspace observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterizethe physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study therobustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbodymodels. for a pilot subsample of the kingfish program, we perform 2 temperaturefits of the spitzer and herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warmand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.at global scales,we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and tc(19.1 to 25.1k).wecompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustnessof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. when the emissivityis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.when theemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniformfitted emissivities.gathering resolved elements in a tc-beta_c diagramunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.it remains difficultto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, ormixing along the line of sight and in the beam. we finally observe in bothcases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and barends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in theselocations).we also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptionsabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverageused in the fits. we show that modified blackbody fits using a shallowemissivity (beta_c &lt; 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared tothe beta_c &lt; 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 forinstance.the working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: massesincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

1207.4186	modeling dust and starlight in galaxies observed by spitzer and  herschel: ngc 628 and ngc 6946	we characterize the dust in ngc628 and ngc6946, two nearby spiral galaxies inthe kingfish sample. with data from 3.6um to 500um, dust models are stronglyconstrained. using the draine &amp; li (2007) dust model, (amorphous silicate andcarbonaceous grains), for each pixel in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust masssurface density, (2) dust mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pah)s, (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating thedust, (4) total infrared (ir) luminosity emitted by the dust, and (5) irluminosity originating in regions with high starlight intensity. we obtain mapsfor the dust properties, which trace the spiral structure of the galaxies. thedust models successfully reproduce the observed global and resolved spectralenergy distributions (seds). the overall dust/h mass ratio is estimated to be0.0082+/-0.0017 for ngc628, and 0.0063+/-0.0009 for ngc6946, consistent withwhat is expected for galaxies of near-solar metallicity. our derived dustmasses are larger (by up to a factor 3) than estimates based onsingle-temperature modified blackbody fits. we show that the sed fits aresignificantly improved if the starlight intensity distribution includes a(single intensity) "delta function" component. we find no evidence forsignificant masses of cold dust t&lt;12k. discrepancies between pacs and mipsphotometry in both low and high surface brightness areas result in largeuncertainties when the modeling is done at pacs resolutions, in which casespire, mips70 and mips160 data cannot be used. we recommend against attemptingto model dust at the angular resolution of pacs.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1301.6884	a detailed study of the radio--fir correlation in ngc6946 with  herschel-pacs/spire from kingfish	we derive the distribution of the synchrotron spectral index across ngc6946and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) andfar-infrared (fir) emission using the kingfish herschel pacs and spire data.the radio--fir correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surfacebrightness. the synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and theso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. the synchrotronspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), whileit is flat in places of giant h{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). the map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observationalevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in thedisk of the galaxy. variations in the synchrotron--fir correlation across thegalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.we find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather thanwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the mainheating source of dust. the synchrotron--fir correlation suggests a couplingbetween the magnetic field and the gas density. ngc6946 shows a power-lawbehavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength b and the starformation rate surface density $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ with an index of0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. this indicates an efficient production of the turbulentmagnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively starforming regions. the scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--fircorrelation indicates that the ism affects the propagation of old/diffusedcosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $d_0=4.6\times10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,gev cres.

1308.3702	regional variations in the dense gas heating and cooling in m51 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in m51, [cii](158 \mu m), [nii](122 &amp; 205 \mu m),[oi](63 and 145 \mu m) and [oiii](88 \mu m). we compare the observed flux ofthese lines with the predicted flux from a photon dominated region model todetermine characteristics of the cold gas such as density, temperature and thefar-ultraviolet radiation field, g_0, resolving details on physical scales ofroughly 600 pc. we find an average [cii]/f_tir of 4 x 10^{-3}, in agreementwith previous studies of other galaxies. a pixel-by-pixel analysis of fourdistinct regions of m51 shows a radially decreasing trend in both thefar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation field, g_0 and the hydrogen density, n, peakingin the nucleus of the galaxy, then falling off out to the arm and interarmregions. we see for the first time that the fuv flux and gas density aresimilar in the differing environments of the arm and interarm regions,suggesting that the inherent physical properties of the molecular clouds inboth regions are essentially the same.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1309.6338	cold dust but warm gas in the unusual elliptical galaxy ngc 4125	data from the herschel space observatory have revealed an unusual ellipticalgalaxy, ngc 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission fromcold dust but only very strict upper limits to its co and hi emission.depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 msun. whilethe neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (&lt; 12-30), including theionized gas traced by [cii] emission raises this limit to &lt; 39-100. the dustemission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust tostellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearbyelliptical galaxies. we suggest that ngc 4125 is currently in an unusual phasewhere evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation arepumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. in thisscenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas beingheated to temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k faster than the dust is evaporated. ifgalaxies like ngc 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutralgas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could havesignificant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies andgalaxy evolution.

1311.3664	pillars and globules at the edges of h ii regions, confronting herschel  observations and numerical simulations	pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, suchas the eagle nebula (m16) and the rosette molecular cloud, and understandingtheir origin will help characterize triggered star formation. the formationmechanisms of these structures are still being debated. recent numericalsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell inon itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulentmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. the goal here is to testthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,m16 and rosette. the column density structure of the interface betweenmolecular clouds and h ii regions was characterized using column density mapsobtained from far-infrared imaging of the herschel hobys key programme. then,the disperse algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layersaround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. finally,their velocity structure was investigated using co data, and all observationalsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established fromsimulations. the column density profiles have revealed the importance ofcompression at the edge of the ionized gas. the velocity properties of thestructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict fromthe numerical simulations. we have identified a good candidate of a nascentpillar in the rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of theshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. globules have abulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initialturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shellcollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

1401.3693	dissecting the origin of the submillimeter emission in nearby galaxies  with herschel and laboca	we model the infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution of 11nearby galaxies of the kingfish sample using spitzer and herschel data andcompare model extrapolations at 870um (using different fitting techniques) withlaboca 870um observations. we investigate how the differences betweenpredictions and observations vary with model assumptions or environment. atglobal scales, we find that modified blackbody models using realistic coldemissivity indices (beta_c=2 or 1.5) are able to reproduce the 870um observedemission within the uncertainties for most of the sample. low values(beta_c&lt;1.3) would be required in ngc0337, ngc1512 and ngc7793. at localscales, we observe a systematic 870um excess when using beta_=2.0. thebeta_c=1.5 or the draine and li (2007) models can reconcile predictions withobservations in part of the disks. some of the remaining excesses occur towardsthe centres and can be partly or fully accounted for by non-dust contributionssuch as co(3-2) or, to a lesser extent, free-free or synchrotron emission. inthree non-barred galaxies, the remaining excesses rather occur in the diskoutskirts. this could be a sign of a flattening of the submm slope (anddecrease of the effective emissivity index) with radius in these objects.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1404.0403	the physical characteristics of the gas in the disk of centaurus a using  the herschel space observatory	we search for variations in the disk of centaurus a of the emission fromatomic fine structure lines using herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy. inparticular we observe the [c ii](158 $\mu$m), [n ii](122 and 205 $\mu$m), [oi](63 and 145 $\mu$m) and [o iii](88 $\mu$m) lines, which all play an importantrole in cooling the gas in photo-ionized and photodissociation regions. wedetermine that the ([c ii]+[o i]$_{63}$)/$f_{tir}$ line ratio, a proxy for theheating efficiency of the gas, shows no significant radial trend across theobserved region, in contrast to observations of other nearby galaxies. wedetermine that 10 - 20% of the observed [c ii] emission originates in ionizedgas. comparison between our observations and a pdr model shows that thestrength of the far-ultraviolet radiation field, $g_0$, varies between$10^{1.75}$ and $10^{2.75}$ and the hydrogen nucleus density varies between$10^{2.75}$ and $10^{3.75}$ cm$^{-3}$, with no significant radial trend ineither property. in the context of the emission line properties of thegrand-design spiral galaxy m51 and the elliptical galaxy ngc 4125, the gas incen a appears more characteristic of that in typical disk galaxies rather thanelliptical galaxies.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1409.7123	[cii] 158 $\mu$m emission as a star formation tracer	the [cii] 157.74 $\mu$m transition is the dominant coolant of the neutralinterstellar gas, and has great potential as a star formation rate (sfr)tracer. using the herschel kingfish sample of 46 nearby galaxies, weinvestigate the relation of [cii] surface brightness and luminosity with sfr.we conclude that [cii] can be used for measurements of sfr on both global andkiloparsec scales in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strongactive galactic nuclei (agn). the uncertainty of the $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. the main source ofscatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm ircolors, and we provide an adjustment based on ir color that reduces thescatter. we show that the color-adjusted $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$,holding for both normal star-forming galaxies and non-agn luminous infraredgalaxies. using [cii] luminosity instead of surface brightness to estimate sfrsuffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting sfr in luminousinfrared galaxies even after ir color adjustment (although this depends on thesfr measure employed). we suspect that surface brightness relations are betterbehaved than the luminosity relations because the former are more closelyrelated to the local far-uv field strength, most likely the main parametercontrolling the efficiency of the conversion of far-uv radiation into gasheating. a simple model based on starburst99 population-synthesis code toconnect sfr to [cii] finds that heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normalgalaxies.

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0007168	the baryon content of groups and clusters of galaxies	we have analyzed the properties of a sample of 33 groups and clusters ofgalaxies and examine the baryon content to check for trends over a decade intemperature down to 1 kev. we examine the relative contribution of galaxies andicm to baryons in clusters through the gas-to-stellar mass ratio and find thatthe typical stellar contribution to the baryonic mass is between 5 and 20%.this ratio is found to be roughly independent of temperature. therefore, we donot confirm the trend of increasing gas-to-stellar mass ratio with increasingtemperature as previously claimed. we also determine distribution of the baryonfraction with the density contrast. virial masses are estimated from twodifferent mass estimators: one based on the isothermal hydrostatic equation(ihe), the other based on scaling law models (slm). comparing the two methods,we find that slm lead to less dispersed baryon fractions over all densitycontrasts and that the derived mean absolute valuesare significantly lower thanihe mean values. we show that this is not due to the uncertainties on the outerslope $\beta$ of the gas density profile but is rather indicating that ihemasses are less reliable. examining the shape of the baryon fraction profileswe find that cluster baryon fractions estimated from slm follow a scaling law.moreover, we do not find any strong evidence of increasing baryon (gas)fraction with temperature, neither do we find the slope $\beta$ to increasewith temperature. the absence of clear trends between $f_{b}$ and$m_{gas}/m_{*}$ with temperature is consistent with the similarity of baryonfraction profiles and suggests that non-gravitational processes such as galaxyfeedback, do not play a dominant r\^ole in heating the intra-cluster gas on thevirial scale.

astro-ph;0104087	the impact of bars on the mid-infrared dust emission of spiral galaxies:  global and circumnuclear properties	we study the mid-infrared properties of a sample of 69 nearby spiralgalaxies, selected to avoid seyfert activity contributing a significantfraction of the central energetics, or strong tidal interaction, and to havenormal infrared luminosities. these observations were obtained with isocam,which provides an angular resolution of the order of 10 arcsec (half-powerdiameter of the point spread function) and low-resolution spectro-imaginginformation. between 5 and 18 microns, we mainly observe two dust phases,aromatic infrared bands and very small grains, both out of thermal equilibrium.on this sample, we show that the global f15/f7 colors of galaxies are veryuniform, the only increase being found in early-type strongly barred galaxies,consistent with previous iras studies. the f15/f7 excesses are unambiguouslydue to galactic central regions where bar-induced starbursts occur. however,the existence of strongly barred early-type galaxies with normal circumnuclearcolors indicates that the relationship between a distortion of thegravitational potential and a central starburst is not straightforward. as thephysical processes at work in central regions are in principle identical inbarred and unbarred galaxies, and since this is where the mid-infrared activityis mainly located, we investigate the mid-infrared circumnuclear properties ofall the galaxies in our sample. we show how surface brightnesses and colors arerelated to both the available molecular gas content and the mean age of stellarpopulations contributing to dust heating. therefore, the star formation historyin galactic central regions can be constrained by their position in acolor-surface brightness mid-infrared diagram.

astro-ph;0104088	the relationship between star formation rates and mid-infrared emission  in galactic disks	the halpha and mid-infrared mean disk surface brightnesses are compared in asample of nearby spirals observed by isocam. this shows that, in spiral disks,dust emission at 7 and 15 microns provides a reasonable star formation tracer.the fact that the 15 to 7 micron flux ratio is nearly constant in variousglobal exciting conditions indicates a common origin, namely the aromaticinfrared band carriers, and implies that at these wavelengths, dust emissionfrom the disks of normal galaxies is dominated by photodissociation regions andnot by hii regions themselves. we use this newly-found correlation between themid-infrared and the halpha line to investigate the nature of the link betweenthe far-infrared (60 and 100 microns) and halpha. although the separation ofthe central regions from the disk is impossible to achieve in the far-infrared,we show that a circumnuclear contribution to the dust emission, having noequivalent counterpart in halpha, is most likely responsible for the well-knownnon-linearity between far-infrared and halpha fluxes in spiral galaxies. wederive a calibration of 7 and 15 micron fluxes in terms of star formation ratesfrom a primary calibration of halpha in the literature, and also outline theapplicability limits of the proposed conversion, which should not be blindlyextrapolated to objects whose nature is unknown.

astro-ph;0402388	warm dust and aromatic bands as quantitative probes of star-formation  activity	we combine samples of spiral galaxies and starburst systems observed withisocam to investigate the reliability of mid-infrared (mir) dust emission as aquantitative tracer of star formation (sf) activity. the total sample coversvery diverse galactic environments and probes a much wider dynamic range in sfrate density than previous similar studies. we find that both the monochromatic15 micron continuum and the 5-8.5 micron emission constitute excellentindicators of the sf rate as quantified by the lyman continuum luminosityl_lyc, within specified validity limits which are different for the twotracers. normalized to projected surface area, the 15 micron luminosity s_15ctis directly proportional to s_lyc over several orders of magnitude. two regimesare distinguished from the relative offsets in the observed relation: theproportionality factor increases by a factor of ~ 5 between quiescent disks inspiral galaxies, and moderate to extreme star-forming environments incircumnuclear regions of spirals and in starburst systems. the transitionoccurs near s_lyc ~ 10^2 l_sun pc^{-2} and is interpreted as due to very smalldust grains starting to dominate the emission at 15 microns over aromaticspecies above this threshold. the 5-8.5 micron luminosity per unit area is alsoproportional to s_lyc, with a single conversion factor from the most quiescentobjects in the sample up to s_lyc ~ 10^4 l_sun pc^{-2}, where the relation thenflattens. the turnover is attributed to depletion of aromatic band carriers inthe harsher conditions prevailing in extreme starbursts. the observed relationsprovide empirical calibrations useful for estimating sf rates from mid-irobservations in deeply embedded hii regions and obscured starbursts, and forpredictions from evolutionary synthesis models.

astro-ph;0507645	infrared spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) is carrying out acomprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. the1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imagingdata from spitzer, 2mass, iso, iras, and scuba. the infrared colors derivedfrom the globally-integrated spitzer data are generally consistent with theprevious generation of models that were developed based on global data fornormal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailedinvestigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for variouslocations within the three large, nearby galaxies ngc3031 (m81), ngc5194 (m51),and ngc7331. strong correlations exist between the local star formation rateand the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local starformation activity level. preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colorswithin ngc3031, ngc5194, and ngc7331. if the galaxy-to-galaxy variations inspectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of therange present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infraredluminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will beuncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). the correspondinguncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for az=2 source) are factors of 10-20. considerable caution should be used wheninterpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.

astro-ph;0510227	an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlation within nearby  star-forming galaxies using the spitzer space telescope	(abridged) we present an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlationwithin the star-forming disks of four nearby, nearly face-on galaxies (ngc2403, ngc 3031, ngc 5194, and ngc 6946). using spitzer mips imaging and wsrtradio continuum data, observed as part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxiessurvey (sings), we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic 24mu/22cm(q_24) and 70mu/22cm (q_70) surface brightness ratios across each disk atsub-kpc scales. we find general trends of decreasing q_24 and q_70 withdeclining surface brightness and with increasing radius. the residualdispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versus surface brightness issmaller than the residual dispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versusradius, on average by ~0.1 dex, indicating that the distribution of starformation sites is more important in determining the infrared/radio diskappearance than the exponential profiles of disks. we have also performedpreliminary phenomenological modeling of cosmic ray electron (cre^-) diffusionusing an image-smearing technique, and find that smoothing the infrared mapsimproves their correlation with the radio maps. exponential kernels tend towork better than gaussian kernels which suggests that additional processesbesides simple random-walk diffusion in three dimensions must affect theevolution of cre^-s. the best fit smoothing kernels for the two less activestar-forming galaxies (ngc 2403 and ngc 3031) have much larger scale-lengthsthan those of the more active star-forming galaxies (ngc 5194 and ngc 6946).this difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent cre^- injectioninto the interstellar medium (ism) for the galaxies having largely quiescentdisks.

astro-ph;0603160	spitzer and jcmt observations of the active galactic nucleus in the  sombrero galaxy (ngc 4594)	we present spitzer 3.6-160 micron images, spitzer mid-infrared spectra, andjcmt scuba 850 micron images of the sombrero galaxy (ngc 4594), an sa galaxywith a 10^9 m_solar low luminosity active galactic nucleus (agn). the brightestinfrared sources in the galaxy are the nucleus and the dust ring. the spectralenergy distribution of the agn demonstrates that, while the environment aroundthe agn is a prominent source of mid-infrared emission, it is a relatively weaksource of far-infrared emission, as had been inferred for agn in previousresearch. the weak nuclear 160 micron emission and the negligible polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon emission from the nucleus also implies that the nucleus isa site of only weak star formation activity and the nucleus contains relativelylittle cool interstellar gas needed to fuel such activity. we propose that thisgalaxy may be representative of a subset of low ionization nuclear emissionregion galaxies that are in a quiescent agn phase because of the lack of gasneeded to fuel circumnuclear star formation and seyfert-like agn activity.surprisingly, the agn is the predominant source of 850 micron emission. weexamine the possible emission mechanisms that could give rise to the 850 micronemission and find that neither thermal dust emission, co line emission,bremsstrahlung emission, nor the synchrotron emission observed at radiowavelengths can adequately explain the measured 850 micron flux density bythemselves. the remaining possibilities for the source of the 850 micronemission include a combination of known emission mechanisms, synchrotronemission that is self-absorbed at wavelengths longer than 850 microns, orunidentified spectral lines in the 850 micron band.

astro-ph;0604007	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of nuclear and extra-nuclear regions  in nearby galaxies	mid-infrared diagnostics are presented for a large portion of the spitzerinfrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample plus archival data from theinfrared space observatory and the spitzer space telescope. our main result isthat these mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominantpower source. the combination of a high ionization line index and pah strengthserves as an efficient discriminant between agn and star-forming nuclei,confirming progress made with iso spectroscopy on starbursting andultraluminous infrared galaxies. the sensitivity of spitzer allows us to probefainter nuclei and star-forming regions within galaxy disks. we find that bothstar-forming nuclei and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that arepowered by seyfert or liner activity. in fact, we identify areas within fourdiagnostic diagrams containing &gt;90% seyfert/liner nuclei or &gt;90% hiiregions/hii nuclei. we also find that, compared to starbursting nuclei,extranuclear regions typically separate even further from agn, especially forlow-metallicity extranuclear environments. in addition, instead of thetraditional mid-infrared approach to differentiating between agn andstar-forming sources that utilizes relatively weak high-ionization lines, weshow that strong low-ionization cooling lines of x-ray dominated regions like[siii] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.finally, the typical target in this sample shows relatively modest interstellarelectron density (~400 cm^{-3}) and obscuration (a_v ~ 1.0 mag for a foregroundscreen), consistent with a lack of dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dustresiding in the emitting regions.

astro-ph;0604267	the opaque nascent starburst in ngc 1377: spitzer sings observations	we analyze extensive data on ngc1377 from the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). within the category of nascent starbursts, that wepreviously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excessof the average and their hot dust, ngc1377 has the largest infrared excess yetmeasured. optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of arecent accretion event. infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaquesource dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micronsilicate band). we provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity beingthe heating source. hii regions are detected through the single [neii] line,probing &lt;1% of the ionizing radiation. not only is the optical depth very high,but &gt;85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. the only other detectedemission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly byshocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. the newobservations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely youngstarburst (&lt;1 myr). more generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron arelikely observed within a few myr of the onset of a starburst and after a longquiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ism with cosmic rays. the similarinfrared-radio properties of ngc1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxiessuggest that ngc1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburstevolution. although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionarystage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction ofmerger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. since they differdramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequencesfor the interpretation of deep surveys.

astro-ph;0609724	the effect of star formation on the far-infrared--radio correlation  within galaxies	using data obtained for twelve galaxies as part of the {\it spitzer} infrarednearby galaxies survey (sings) and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt)-sings radio continuum survey, we study how star formation activityaffects the far-infrared (fir)--radio correlation {\it within} galaxies bytesting a phenomenological model, which describes the radio image as a smearedversion of the fir image. the physical basis of this description is thatcosmic-ray (cr) electrons will diffuse measurably farther than the mean freepath of dust-heating photons before decaying by synchrotron radiation. thisdescription works well in general. galaxies with higher infrared surfacebrightnesses have best-fit smoothing scale-lengths of a few hundred parsecs,substantially shorter than those for lower surface brightness galaxies. weinterpret this result to suggest that galaxies with higher disk averaged starformation rates have had a recent episode of enhanced star formation and arecharacterized by a higher fraction of young cr electrons that have traveledonly a few hundred parsecs from their acceleration sites in supernova remnantscompared to galaxies with lower star formation activity.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0702378	dust and atomic gas in dwarf irregular galaxies of the m81 group: the  sings and things view	[abridged] we present observations of the dust and atomic gas phase in sevendwarf irregular galaxies of the m81 group from the sings and things surveys.the spitzer observations provide a first glimpse of the nature of thenon-atomic ism in these metal-poor (z~0.1 z_sun), quiescent (sfr~0.001-0.1m_sun/yr) dwarf galaxies. dust emission is detected in five out of the seventargets. most detected dust emission is restricted to hi column densities&gt;1x10^21 cm^-2. spitzer spectroscopy of two regions in the brightest galaxies(ic 2574 and holmberg ii) show distinctly different spectral shapes. thespectrum of ic 2574 shows aromatic features that are less luminous (relative tothe fir luminosity) compared to an average sings spiral galaxy by a factor of\~7 . the aromatic features in holmberg~ii (which has only a slightly lowergas-phase metallicity) are fainter than in ic 2574 by an order of magnitude.this result emphazises that the strength of the aromatic features is not asimple linear function of metallicity. we estimate dust masses of ~10^4-10^6m_sun for the m81 dwarf galaxies, resulting in an average dust--to--gas ratio(m_dust/m_hi) of ~3x10^-4 (1.5x10^-3 if only the hi that is associated withdust emission is considered); this is an order of magnitude lower than thetypical value derived for the sings spirals. the dwarf galaxies areunderluminous per unit star formation rate at 70um as compared to the moremassive galaxies in sings by a factor of ~2. however, the average 70um/160umratio in the sample dwarf galaxies is higher than what is found in the othergalaxies of the sings sample. this can be explained by a combination of a lowerdust content in conjunction with a higher dust temperature in the dwarfs.
