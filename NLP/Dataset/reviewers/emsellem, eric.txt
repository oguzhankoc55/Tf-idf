0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0905.3349	oasis integral-field spectroscopy of the central kpc in 11 seyfert 2  galaxies	we map narrow-line regions (nlrs) of 11 nearby seyfert 2 galaxies with theoptical integral-field spectrograph oasis mounted at cfht. we modelemission-line profiles of 5 forbidden-line doublets and 2 balmer lines,correcting for the underlying stellar absorption by reconstructing stellarspectra with synthetic evolutionary stellar population models. for each of the11 targets, we present 2d maps of surface brightness in the observed emissionlines, diagnostic line intensity ratios, gas kinematics (mean line-of-sightvelocity and velocity dispersion), electron density, and interstellarreddening, and we plot spatially resolved spectral-diagnostic diagrams. thestellar data are represented by maps of mean line-of-sight (los) velocities andof the relative mass fractions of the young stellar populations. the gasvelocity fields in 80% of the sample exhibit twisted s-shaped isovelocitycontours, which are signatures of non-circular orbits and indicatenon-axisymmetric gravitational potentials, gas motions out of the galacticplane, or possible outflows and inflows. based on the kinematic measurements,we identified a possible nuclear ring or radial gas flow in ngc 262 (mrk 348),not reported before. eight of the eleven observed objects exhibit stronglyasymmetric or multi-component emission-line profiles, in most cases confined toan elongated region passing through the galactic centre, perpendicular to themajor axis of emission.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1005.4208	a collisional origin for the leo ring	extended hi structures around galaxies are of prime importance to probegalaxy formation scenarios. the giant hi ring in the leo group is one of thelargest and most intriguing hi structures in the nearby universe. whether itconsists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any opticalcounterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearbygalaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.we present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtainedwith megacam on the cfht. they reveal optical counterparts to several hi and uvcondensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likelycorrespond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. analyzingthe spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we foundit to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. wethen use simulations to test the hypothesis that the leo ring results from ahead-on collision between leo group members ngc 3384 and m96. according to ourmodel which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observationalproperties of the system, the leo ring is consistent with being a collisionalring. it is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-upof pre-enriched collisional debris.

1006.1574	the sauron project - xvii. stellar population analysis of the absorption  line strength maps of 48 early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a stellar population analysis of the absorption linestrength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample. using the linestrength index maps of hbeta, fe5015, and mgb, measured in the lick/ids systemand spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictionsfrom up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellarpopulation-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio[alpha/fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately oneeffective radius. we find a large range of ssp-equivalent ages in our sample,of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellarpopulation. the most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, withssp-equivalent ages of &lt;=3 gyr observed over the full field-of-view, andsometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to lowmass systems(sigma_e &lt;= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 m_sol). spatially restricted casesof young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively belinked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seenin the near-uv or mid-ir. the flattened components with disk-like kinematicspreviously identified in all fast rotators (krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to beconnected to regions of distinct stellar populations. these range from theyoung, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increasedmetallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, toapparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which areobserved to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/fe] ratiocompared to the main body of the galaxy. the slow rotators generally show nostellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicitygradients and are largely consistent with old (&gt;=10 gyr) stellar populations.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2240	the planetary nebulae population in the central regions of m32: the  sauron view	extragalactic planetary nebulae (pne) are not only useful as distancesignposts or as tracers of the dark-matter content of their host galaxies, butconstitute also good indicators of the main properties of their parent stellarpopulations. yet, so far, the properties of pne in the optical regions ofgalaxies where stellar population gradients can be more extreme have remainedlargely unexplored, mainly because the detection of pne with narrow-bandimaging or slit-less spectroscopy is considerably hampered by a strong stellarbackground. integral-field spectroscopy (ifs) can overcome this limitation, andhere we present a study of the pn population in the nearby compact ellipticalm32. using sauron data taken with just two 10-minutes-long pointings we havedoubled the number of known pne within the effective radius of m32, detectingpne five times fainter than previously found in narrow-band images thatcollected nearly the same number of photons. furthermore, by carefullyaccounting for the incompleteness of our survey we could conclude, despitehaving only 15 sources, that the central pne population of m32 is consistentwith the generally adopted shape for the pne luminosity function and itstypical normalization observed in early-type galaxies. finally, owing to theproximity of m32 and to uv images taken with hst, we could identify the mostlikely candidates for the central star of a subset of our detected pne andconclude that these stars are affected by substantial amounts of circumstellardust extinction, a finding that could reconcile the intriguing discrepancypreviously reported in m32 between model predictions and observations for thelater stages of stellar evolution. considering the modest time investment on a4m-class telescope that delivered these results, this work illustrates thepotential of future ifs studies for the central pne population of early-typegalaxies.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

0710.3161	formation of central massive objects via tidal compression	for a density that is not too sharply peaked towards the center, the localtidal field becomes compressive in all three directions. available gas can thencollapse and form a cluster of stars in the center, including or even beingdominated by a central black hole. we show that for a wide range of(deprojected) sersic profiles in a spherical potential, the tidal forces arecompressive within a region which encloses most of the corresponding light ofobserved nuclear clusters in both late-type and early-type galaxies. in suchmodels, tidal forces become disruptive nearly everywhere for relatively largesersic indices n &gt;= 3.5. we also show that the mass of a central massive object(cmo) required to remove all radial compressive tidal forces scales linearlywith the mass of the host galaxy. if cmos formed in (progenitor) galaxies withn ~ 1, we predict a mass fraction of ~ 0.1-0.5%, consistent with observationsof nuclear clusters and super-massive black holes. while we find that tidalcompression possibly drives the formation of cmos in galaxies, beyond thecentral regions and on larger scales in clusters disruptive tidal forces mightcontribute to prevent gas from cooling.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1212.5268	the planetary nebulae population in the nuclear regions of m31: the  sauron view	following a first study of the central regions of m32 that illustrated thepower of integral-field spectroscopy (ifs) in detecting and measuring the [oiii]{\lambda}5007 emission of pne against a strong stellar background, we turnto the very nuclear pn population of m31, within 80 pc of its centre. we showthat pne can also be found in the presence of emission from diffuse gas andfurther illustrate the excellent sensitivity of ifs in detecting extragalacticpne through a comparison with narrowband images obtained with the hubble spacetelescope. we find the nuclear pne population of m31 is only marginallyconsistent with the generally adopted form of the pne luminosity function(pnlf). in particular, this is due to a lack of pne with absolute magnitudem5007 brighter than -3, which would only result from a rather unfortunate drawfrom such a model pnlf. we suggest that the observed lack of bright pne in thenuclear regions of m31 is due to a horizontal-branch population that is moretilted toward less massive and hotter he-burning stars, so that its progenyconsists mostly of uv-bright stars that fail to climb back up the asymptoticgiant branch (agb) and only of few, if any, bright pne powered by centralpost-agb stars. these results are also consistent with recent reports on adearth of bright post-agb stars towards the nucleus of m31, and lend furthersupport to the idea that the metallicity of a stellar population has an impacton the way the horizontal branch is populated and to the loose anticorrelationbetween the strength of the uv-upturn and the specific number of pne that isobserved in early-type galaxies. finally, our investigation also serves tostress the importance of considering the same spatial scales when comparing thepne population of galaxies with the properties of their stellar populations.

1302.6611	the next generation virgo cluster survey. iv. ngc 4216: a bombarded  spiral in the virgo cluster	we present an investigation into the origins of a series of interlaced narrowfilamentary stellar structures, loops and plumes in the vicinity of the virgocluster, edge-on spiral galaxy, ngc 4216 that were previously identified by theblackbird telescope. using the deeper, higher-resolution and preciselycalibrated optical cfht/megacam images obtained as part of the next generationvirgo cluster survey (ngvs), we confirm the previously identified features andidentify a few additional structures. the ngvs data allowed us to make aphysical study of these low-surface brightness features and investigate theirorigin. the likely progenitors of the structures were identified as eitheralready catalogued vcc dwarfs or newly discovered satellites caught in the actof being destroyed. they have the same g-i color index and likely containsimilar stellar populations. the alignment of three dwarfs along an apparentlysingle stream is intriguing, and we cannot totally exclude that these aresecond-generation dwarf galaxies being born inside the filament from the debrisof an original dwarf. the observed complex structures, including in particulara stream apparently emanating from a satellite of a satellite, point to a highrate of ongoing dwarf destruction/accretion in the region of the virgo clusterwhere ngc 4216 is located. we discuss the age of the interactions and whetherthey occurred in a group that is just falling into the cluster and shows signsof so-called "pre-processing" before it gets affected by the clusterenvironment, or in a group which already ventured towards the central regionsof virgo cluster.

1303.4399	fueling agn-i: how the global characteristics of the central kiloparsec  of seyferts differ from quiescent galaxies	in a matched sample of seyfert and quiescent galaxies we simultaneously probethe stellar and molecular gas kinematics from 1 kpc down to 50 pc with the aimof identifying the dynamical processes dictating black hole accretion rates.this first paper compares the global characteristics of a sample of tengalaxies. we find several differences within a radius of 500 pc that arecorrelated with active galactic nucleus (agn) activity. the seyferts have: (1)a more centrally concentrated nuclear stellar surface brightness with lowerstellar luminosities beyond a radius of 100 pc, (2) a lower stellar velocitydispersion within a radius of 200 pc, (3) elevated h2 luminosity out to aradius of at least 250 pc, and (4) more centrally concentrated h2 surfacebrightness profiles. these observed differences can be interpreted as evidencefor seyfert galaxies having a dynamically cold (in comparison to the bulge)nuclear structure composed of a significant gas reservoir and a relativelyyoung stellar population. this structure is undetected (and possibly does notexist) in quiescent galaxies. the presence of such a nuclear structure inseyfert galaxies provides evidence for inflow of the surrounding interstellarmedium since the nuclear stellar population requires a supply of gas from whichto form. the fueling of a seyfert agn is thus associated with the formation ofa dynamically cold component of gas and stars on scales of hundreds of parsecs.

1311.6469	ngc1266 as a local candidate for rapid cessation of star formation	we present new spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae(sauron) integral-field spectroscopy and swift ultraviolet optical telescope(uvot) observations of molecular outflow host galaxy ngc 1266 that indicate ngc1266 has experienced a rapid cessation of star formation. both the sauron mapsof stellar population age and the swift uvot observations demonstrate thepresence of young ($&lt; 1$ gyr) stellar populations within the central 1 kpc,while existing combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma)co(1--0) maps indicate that the sites of current star formation are constrainedto the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy only. the optical spectrum ofngc 1266 from moustakas &amp; kennicutt (2006) reveal a characteristicpost-starburst (k+a) stellar population and davis et al. (2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1402.1680	the role of turbulence in star formation laws and thresholds	the schmidt-kennicutt relation links the surface densities of gas to the starformation rate in galaxies. the physical origin of this relation, and inparticular its break, i.e. the transition between an inefficient regime at lowgas surface densities and a main regime at higher densities, remains debated.here, we study the physical origin of the star formation relations and breaksin several low-redshift galaxies, from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. weuse numerical simulations representative of the milky way, the large and thesmall magellanic clouds with parsec up to subparsec resolution, and whichreproduce the observed star formation relations and the relative variations ofthe star formation thresholds. we analyze the role of interstellar turbulence,gas cooling, and geometry in drawing these relations, at 100 pc scale. wesuggest in particular that the existence of a break in the schmidt- kennicuttrelation could be linked to the transition from subsonic to supersonicturbulence and is independent of self-shielding effects. this transition beingconnected to the gas thermal properties and thus to the metallicity, the breakis shifted toward high surface densities in metal-poor galaxies, as observed indwarf galaxies. our results suggest that together with the collapse of cloudsunder self-gravity, turbulence (injected at galactic scale) can induce thecompression of gas and regulate star formation.

1403.0626	identification of old tidal dwarfs near early-type galaxies from deep  imaging and hi observations	it has recently been proposed that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies located inthe local group disks of satellites (doss) may be tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs)born in a major merger at least 5 gyr ago. whether tdgs can live that long isstill poorly constrained by observations. as part of deep optical and hisurveys with the cfht megacam camera and westerbork synthesis radio telescopemade within the atlas3d project, and follow-up spectroscopic observations withthe gemini-north telescope, we have discovered old tdg candidates aroundseveral early-type galaxies. at least one of them has an oxygen abundance closeto solar, as expected for a tidal origin. this confirmed pre-enriched object islocated within the gigantic, but very low surface brightness, tidal tail thatemanates from the elliptical galaxy, ngc 5557. an age of 4 gyr estimated fromits sed fitting makes it the oldest securely identified tdg ever found so far.we investigated the structural and gaseous properties of the tdg and of acompanion located in the same collisional debris, and thus most likely of tidalorigin as well. despite several gyr of evolution close to their parentgalaxies, they kept a large gas reservoir. their central surface brightness islow and their effective radius much larger than that of typical dwarf galaxiesof the same mass. this possibly provides us with criteria to identify tidalobjects which can be more easily checked than the traditional ones requiringdeep spectroscopic observations. in view of the above, we discuss the survivaltime of tdgs and question the tidal origin of the doss.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1504.03714	the next generation virgo cluster survey. xii. stellar populations and  kinematics of compact, low-mass early-type galaxies from gemini gmos-ifu  spectroscopy	we present gemini gmos-ifu data of eight compact low-mass early-type galaxies(etgs) in the virgo cluster. we analyse their stellar kinematics, stellarpopulation, and present two-dimensional maps of these properties covering thecentral 5"x 7" region. we find a large variety of kinematics: from non- tohighly-rotating objects, often associated with underlying disky isophotesrevealed by deep images from the next generation virgo cluster survey. in halfof our objects, we find a centrally-concentrated younger and more metal-richstellar population. we analyze the specific stellar angular momentum throughthe lambdar parameter and find six fast-rotators and two slow-rotators, onehaving a thin counter-rotating disk. we compare the local galaxy density andstellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-massvirgo etgs from the smakced survey and 260 massive ($m&gt;10^{10}$\msun) etgs fromthe a3d sample. the compact low-mass etgs in our sample are located in highdensity regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, olderand more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. wefind that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocitydispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trendsfound for massive etgs. our study supports a scenario where low-mass compactetgs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, includingram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsiblefor their compact nature.

1505.06226	unveiling the counter-rotating nature of the kinematically distinct core  in ngc5813 with muse	muse observations of ngc5813 reveal a complex structure in the velocitydispersion map, previously hinted by sauron observations. the structure isreminiscent of velocity dispersion maps of galaxies comprising twocounter-rotating discs, and may explain the existence of the kinematicallydistinct core (kdc). further evidence for two counter-rotating components comesfrom the analysis of the higher moments of the stellar line-of-sight velocitydistributions and fitting muse spectra with two separate gaussian line-of-sightvelocity distributions. the emission-line kinematics show evidence of beinglinked to the present cooling flows and the buoyant cavities seen in x-rays. wedetect ionised gas in a nuclear disc-like structure, oriented like the kdc,which is, however, not directly related to the kdc. we build an axisymmetricschwarzschild dynamical model, which shows that the muse kinematics can bereproduced well with two counter-rotating orbit families, characterised byrelatively low angular momentum components, but clearly separated in integralphase space and with radially varying contributions. the model indicates thatthe counter-rotating components in ngc5813 are not thin discs, but dynamicallyhot structures. our findings give further evidence that kdcs in massivegalaxies should not necessarily be considered as structurally or dynamicallydecoupled regions, but as the outcomes of the mixing of different orbitalfamilies, where the balance in the distribution of mass of the orbital familiesis crucial. we discuss the formation of the kdc in ngc5813 within the frameworkof gas accretion, binary mergers and formation of turbulent thick discs fromcold streams at high redshift.

1509.05236	the hi tully-fisher relation of early-type galaxies	we study the hi k-band tully-fisher relation and the baryonic tully-fisherrelation for a sample of 16 early-type galaxies, taken from the atlas3d sample,which all have very regular hi disks extending well beyond the optical body (&gt;5 r_eff). we use the kinematics of these disks to estimate the circularvelocity at large radii for these galaxies. we find that the tully-fisherrelation for our early-type galaxies is offset by about 0.5-0.7 magnitudes fromthe relation for spiral galaxies. the residuals with respect to the spiraltully-fisher relation correlate with estimates of the stellar mass-to-lightratio, suggesting that the offset between the relations is mainly driven bydifferences in stellar populations. we also observe a small offset between ourtully-fisher relation with the relation derived for the atlas3d sample based onco data representing the galaxies' inner regions (&lt; 1 r_eff). this indicatesthat the circular velocities at large radii are systematically 10% lower thanthose near 0.5-1 r_eff, in line with recent determinations of the shape of themass profile of early-type galaxies. the baryonic tully-fisher relation of oursample is distinctly tighter than the standard one, in particular when usingmass-to-light ratios based on dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. wefind that the early-type galaxies fall on the spiral baryonic tully-fisherrelation if one assumes m/l_k = 0.54 m_sun/l_sun for the stellar populations ofthe spirals, a value similar to that found by recent studies of the dynamics ofspiral galaxies. such a mass-to-light ratio for spiral galaxies would implythat their disks are 60-70% of maximal. our analysis increases the range ofgalaxy morphologies for which the baryonic tully-fisher relations holds,strengthening previous claims that it is a more fundamental scaling relationthan the classical tully-fisher relation.

0807.1505	the sauron project - xii. kinematic substructures in early-type  galaxies: evidence for disks in fast rotators	[abridged] we analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxiesobtained with the sauron and oasis integral-field spectrographs usingkinemetry, a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher order momentsof the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd). in the sauron sample, wefind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of themulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest havingthree. in addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. we find that the velocitymaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in thetransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. in terms of e/s0classification, this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components withdisk-like kinematics. for the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axialratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary towhat is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations.the position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly inslow rotators. velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similarto the distribution of light. we constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - v/sigmaand h4 - v/sigma diagrams from sauron observations. we confirm the classicalanti-correlation of h3 and v\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero insome objects or even weakly correlated with v/sigma. the distribution of h4 forfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. the difference betweenslow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the losvd, withevidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likelydifferent evolutionary paths.

astro-ph;0011254	galaxy mapping with the sauron integral-field spectrograph: the star  formation history of ngc 4365	we report the first wide-field mapping of the kinematics and stellarpopulations in the e3 galaxy ngc 4365. the velocity maps extend previouslong-slit work. they show two independent kinematic subsystems: the central 300x 700 pc rotates about the projected minor axis, and the main body of thegalaxy, 3 x 4 kpc, rotates almost at right angles to this. the line-strengthmaps show that the metallicity of the stellar population decreases from acentral value greater than solar, to one-half solar at a radius of 2 kpc. thedecoupled core and main body of the galaxy have the same luminosity-weightedage, of ~14 gyr, and the same elevated magnesium-to-iron ratio. the twokinematically distinct components have thus shared a common star formationhistory. we infer that the galaxy underwent a sequence of mergers associatedwith dissipative star formation that ended &gt;12 gyr ago. the misalignmentbetween the photometric and kinematic axes of the main body is unambiguousevidence of triaxiality. the similarity of the stellar populations in the twocomponents suggests that the observed kinematic structure has not changedsubstantially in 12 gyr.

astro-ph;0210379	difficulties with recovering the masses of supermassive black holes from  stellar kinematical data	we investigate the ability of three-integral, axisymmetric, orbit-basedmodeling algorithms to recover the parameters defining the gravitationalpotential (m/l ratio and black hole mass mh) in spheroidal stellar systemsusing stellar kinematical data. we show that the potential estimation problemis generically under-determined when applied to long-slit kinematical data ofthe kind used in most black hole mass determinations to date. a range ofparameters (m/l, mh) can provide equally good fits to the data, making itimpossible to assign best-fit values. we illustrate the indeterminacy using avariety of data sets derived from realistic models as well as publishedobservations of the galaxy m32. in the case of m32, our reanalysis demonstratesthat data published prior to 2000 are equally consistent with mh in the range1.5x10^6-5x10^6 solar masses, with no preferred value in that range. while thehst/stis data for this galaxy may overcome the degeneracy in mh, hst data formost galaxies do not resolve the black hole's sphere of influence and in thesegalaxies the degree of degeneracy allowed by the data may be substantial. weinvestigate the effect on the degeneracy of enforcing smoothness(regularization) constraints. however we find no indication that the truepotential can be recovered simply by enforcing smoothness. for a givensmoothing level, all solutions in the minimum-chisquare valley exhibit similarlevels of noise. these experiments affirm that the indeterminacy is real andnot an artifact associated with non-smooth solutions.

astro-ph;0308146	a two-arm gaseous spiral in the inner 200 pc of the early-type galaxy  ngc 2974: signature of an inner bar	tiger integral-field spectrography and hst/wfpc2 imaging of the e3 galaxy ngc2974 are used to derive the kinematics of the stellar and ionized gascomponents in its central 500 pc. we derive a numerical two-integraldistribution function from a mge mass model using the hq formalism. the tigeras well as published long-slit stellar kinematics are well fitted with thisself-consistent model, requiring neither the addition of a significant masscontribution from a hidden disc structure, nor the presence of a central darkmass. the data reveal the presence of a striking, highly contrasted, two-armgaseous spiral structure within a radius of ~200 pc, corresponding to a totalmass of 6.8x10^4 msun of ionized gas. we use a deconvolved tiger datacube toprobe its kinematics at a resolution of about 0.35 arcsec. strong departuresfrom circular motions are observed, as well as high velocity dispersion valueson the inner side of the arms. we interpret the observed gas morphology andkinematics as the signature of streaming gas flows driven by a ~540 pc diameterbar with ome=700+/-100 km/s/kpc. this hypothesis is strongly supported by thepredictions of a density wave model. this model predicts that the bar shouldlie at about 35 degree from the line of nodes, and implies gas inflow towardsthe central ~50 pc. the quadrupole pertubation due to this bar is estimated torepresent less than 2% of the underlying gravitational potential. despite itsweakness, the inner bar of ngc 2974 may be able to drive some gas within a 10pc radius. we suggest that the presence of such inner bars might be more commonamong early-type disk galaxies than is generally thought, and that deephigh-resolution emission-line imagery may be the best way to detect suchstructures.

astro-ph;0406103	long-lived triaxiality in the dynamically old elliptical galaxy ngc  4365: a limit on chaos and black hole mass	supermassive black holes in the centres of giant elliptical galaxies arethought to induce chaos and eliminate triaxiality in their hosts. we addresswhether this process operates in real systems, by modeling the stellarkinematics of the old elliptical ngc 4365. this galaxy has a mean stellarpopulation age &gt; 12 gyr and is known for its kinematically decoupled core andskew rotation at larger radii. we fit the two-dimensional mean velocity fieldobtained by the sauron integral-field spectrograph, and the isophotalellipticity and position-angle profiles, using the velocity field fittingapproach. we find ngc 4365 to be strongly triaxial (triaxiality parameter tapproximately 0.45) and somewhat flatter than it appears. axisymmetry or nearaxisymmetry (t &lt; 0.1) is ruled out at &gt; 95% confidence. in the most probableorientation the long axis points roughly toward the observer, extending to thesouthwest in projection. strong triaxiality has persisted for hundreds ofdynamical times, ruling out black holes above 3 x 10^9 solar masses. them-sigma relation predicts 4 x 10^8 solar masses, which would not precludelong-lived triaxiality and is consistent with the observations. ngc 4365 lendssupport to a picture in which supermassive black holes, while omnipresent inluminous giant elliptical galaxies, are not massive enough to alter theirglobal structure through chaos.

0705.4162	the central kiloparsec of seyfert and inactive host galaxies: a  comparison of two-dimensional stellar and gaseous kinematics	we investigate the properties of the two-dimensional distribution andkinematics of ionised gas and stars in the central kiloparsecs of a matchedsample of nearby active (seyfert) and inactive galaxies, using the sauronintegral field unit on the william herschel telescope. the ionised gasdistributions show a range of low excitation regions such as star formationrings in seyferts and inactive galaxies, and high excitation regions related tophotoionisation by the agn. the stellar kinematics of all galaxies in thesample show regular rotation patterns typical of disc-like systems, withkinematic axes which are well aligned with those derived from the outerphotometry and which provide a reliable representation of the galactic line ofnodes. after removal of the non-gravitational components due to e.g. agn-drivenoutflows, the ionised gas kinematics in both the seyfert and inactive galaxiesare also dominated by rotation with global alignment between stars and gas inmost galaxies. this result is consistent with previous findings fromphotometric studies that the large-scale light distribution of seyfert hostsare similar to inactive hosts. however, fully exploiting the two-dimensionalnature of our spectroscopic data, deviations from axisymmetric rotation in thegaseous velocity fields are identified that suggest the gaseous kinematics aremore disturbed at small radii in the seyfert galaxies compared with theinactive galaxies, providing a tentative link between nuclear gaseous streamingand nuclear activity.

astro-ph;0509642	a bar signature and central disk in the gaseous and stellar velocity  fields of ngc5448	we analyse sauron kinematic maps of the inner kpc of the early-type (sa)barred spiral galaxy ngc5448. the observed morphology and kinematics of theemission-line gas is patchy and perturbed, indicating clear departures fromcircular motion. the kinematics of the stars is more regular, and display asmall inner disk-like system embedded in a large-scale rotating structure. wefocus on the [oiii] gas, and use a harmonic decomposition formalism to analysethe gas velocity field. the higher-order harmonic terms and the main kinematicfeatures of the observed data are consistent with an analytically constructedsimple bar model. the bar model is derived using linear theory, considering anm=2 perturbation mode, and with bar parameters which are consistent with thelarge-scale bar detected via imaging. we also study optical and near infra-redimages to reveal the asymmetric extinction in ngc5448, and we recognise thatsome of the deviations between the data and the analytical bar model may be dueto these complex dust features. our study illustrates how the harmonicdecomposition formalism can be used as a powerful tool to quantify non-circularmotions in observed gas velocity fields.

astro-ph;0610834	the origin of sigma-drops: mapping stellar kinematics and populations in  spirals	the link between nuclear activity and the host galaxy remains elusive. itseems now clear that the galactic environment is not the key, and that there isno significant apparent difference in terms of the presence of bars/spiralsbetween active and non-active galaxies. nuclear activity nevertheless requiresa small central gas reservoir (10^4-10^7 msun) which may be only partlyconsumed during the 10^6-10^7 yr agn duty cycle. a possible route towards abetter understanding of the involved physical processes is to directly probethe gravitational potential of the host galaxies, with the hope that thecorresponding sensitive tracers (stars, gas) will deliver convincing evidencefor a kinematic signature associated with the agn. this is the motivation foran on-going survey of 50 galaxies, for which the two-dimensional kinematics ofthe (neutral, ionised and molecular) gas and stellar components are beingobtained (see dumas et al., this conference). with only 10 to 15% of seyfertgalaxies in the local universe, we must also acknowledge the possibility thatthis activity is a recurrent (but short) process, and that signatures of recentgas accretion associated with the onset of the central activity should bedetectable. this paper is a short report on the detection and study ofsigma--drops which we believe are the result of past gas accretion followed bysubsequent star formation.

astro-ph;0703531	the sauron project -- ix. a kinematic classification for early-type  galaxies	2d stellar kinematics of 48 representative e and s0 galaxies obtained withthe sauron ifs reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours,depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. we definea new parameter lambdar which involves luminosity weighted averages over thefull 2d kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellarangular momentum per unit mass. we use it as a basis for a new kinematicclassification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators(srs, frs), depending on whether they have lambdar values within theireffective radius re below or above 0.1, respectively. srs and frs are shown tobe physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be theconsequence of a biased viewing angle. frs tend to be relatively low luminositygalaxies. srs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are stillspread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample,among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. remarkably, allother srs contain a large kpc-scale kdc. all frs show well aligned photometricand kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most srs whichexhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. in a companion paper(paper x), we also show that frs and srs are distinct classes in terms of theirorbital distribution. we suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formationand evolution of frs, and that the slowest rotators are the extremeevolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells wheredissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which mostof the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards.

astro-ph;9701088	n body simulations of the nucleus of m 31	we test through stellar n-body simulations some scenarios to explain thedynamics of the peculiar nucleus of the andromeda galaxy (m~31): although hstobservations reveal a double nucleus morphology, the rotation field is almostsymmetric around the bulge gravity centre and the velocity dispersion isoff-centred. we show that any m=1 perturbation has a very short life-time (afew 10$^5$ yr). assuming that the bright peak (p1) is a cold stellar clusterinfalling into the nucleus, and that the large central velocity gradient is dueto a central dark mass (in the range 7~$10^7$--$10^8$~\msun), we obtain areasonably good fit to the observations. however, if this cluster lies in thecentral 20 pc, we estimate the life-time of the cluster to be less than0.5~myr. the dynamical friction is more efficient than estimated by analyticformulae, and is essentially due to the deformation of the stellar clusterthrough the huge tidal forces provided by the black hole. we show that thecluster cannot be on a circular orbit around the centre if the nucleus hosts amassive black hole of a few $10^7$~\msun, and finally provide some estimates ofthe kinematics as observed with hst.

0811.1988	dynamical evolution of agn host galaxies - gas in/out-flow rates in 7  nuga galaxies	to examine the role of the host galaxy structure in fueling nuclear activity,we estimated gas flow rates from several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc forseven nearby spiral galaxies, selected from the nuga sample (nuclei ofgalaxies). we calculated gravitational torques from near-ir images anddetermined gas in/out-flow rates as a function of radius and location withinthe galactic disks, based on high angular resolution interferometricobservations of molecular (co using pdbi) and atomic (hi using the vla) gas.the results are compared with kinematic evidence for radial gas flows and thedynamical state of the galaxies (via resonances) derived from several differentmethods. we show that gravitational torques are very efficient at transportinggas from the outer disk all the way into the galaxies centers at ~100 pc;previously assumed dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the corotationresonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by gravitational torque inducedgas flows from other non-axisymmmetric structures. the resulting rates of gasmass inflow range from 0.01 to 50 solar masses per year and are larger for thegalaxy center than for the outer disk. our gas flow maps show the action ofnested bars within larger bars for 3 galaxies. non-circular streaming motionsfound in the kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer disk andappear to correlate only loosely with the in/out-flow rates as a function ofradius. we demonstrate that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems thatundergo strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation periods (e.g. 5times 10^8 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to the effectiveness of gravitationaltorques in redistributing the cold galactic gas.
