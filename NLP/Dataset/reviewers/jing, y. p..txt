0902.3734	influence of baryonic physics on the merger time-scale of galaxies in  n-body/hydrodynamical simulations	following our previous work(jiang et al.(2008)), in which we studied themerger time-scale of galaxies in a high-resolution cosmological hydro/n-bodysimulation, we investigate the potential influence of uncertainties in thenumerical implementation of baryonic physics on the merger time-scale. thesimulation used in the previous work suffers from the overcooling problem whichcauses the central galaxies of large halos too massive. this may result in ashortened merger time-scale compared to that in the real universe. we run asimilar simulation, but the stellar mass is significantly reduced to modelanother extreme case of low stellar mass. our result shows that the mergertime-scale is little affected by the star formation recipes, except for thesatellites in nearly radial orbits which show a 22 percent higher time-scale inthe lower stellar mass case. since the radial orbits only account for a smallpart of the satellites' orbits, the fitting formula in jiang et al.(2008) isstill applicable to a reasonable accuracy, nearly immune to the uncertainty inthe baryonic physics.

0904.3200	a determination of dark matter bispectrum with a large set of n-body  simulations	we use a set of numerical n-body simulations to study the large-scalebehavior of the reduced bispectrum of dark matter and compare the results withthe second-order perturbation theory and the halo models for different halomass functions. we find that the second-order perturbation theory (pt2) agreeswith the simulations fairly well on large scales of k&lt;0.05 h/mpc, but it showsa signature of deviation as the scale goes down. even on the largest scalewhere the bispectrum can be measured reasonably well in our simulations, theinconsistency between pt2 and the simulations appears for the colinear triangleshapes. for the halo model, we find that it can only serve as a qualitativemethod to help study the behavior of q on large scales and also on relativelysmall scales. the failure of second-order perturbation theory will also affectthe precise determination of the halo models, since they are connected throughthe 3-halo term in the halo model. the 2-halo term has too much contribution onthe large scales, which is the main reason for the halo model to overpredictthe bispectrum on the large scales. since neither of the models can provide asatisfying description for the bispectrum on scales of about 0.1h/mpc for therequirement of precision cosmology, we release the reduced bispectrum of darkmatter on a large range of scales for future analytical modeling of thebispectrum.

0906.0585	the velocity function in the local environment from lcdm and lwdm  constrained simulations	using constrained simulations of the local universe for generic cold darkmatter and for 1kev warm dark matter, we investigate the difference in theabundance of dark matter halos in the local environment. we find that the massfunction within 20 mpc/h of the local group is ~2 times larger than theuniversal mass function in the 10^9-10^13 m_odot/h mass range. imposing thefield of view of the on-going hi blind survey alfalfa in our simulations, wepredict that the velocity function in the virgo-direction region exceeds theuniversal velocity function by a factor of 3. furthermore, employing a schemeto translate the halo velocity function into a galaxy velocity function, wecompare the simulation results with a sample of galaxies from the early catalogrelease of alfalfa. we find that our simulations are able to reproduce thevelocity function in the 80-300 km/s velocity range, having a value ~10 timeslarger than the universal velocity function in the virgo-direction region. inthe low velocity regime, 35-80 km/s, the warm dark matter simulation reproducesthe observed flattening of the velocity function. on the contrary, thesimulation with cold dark matter predicts a steep rise in the velocity functiontowards lower velocities; for v_max=35 km/s, it forecasts ~10 times moresources than the ones observed. if confirmed by the complete alfalfa survey,our results indicate a potential problem for the cold dark matter paradigm orfor the conventional assumptions about energetic feedback in dwarf galaxies.

0907.0282	determine the galaxy bias factors on large scales using bispectrum  method	we study whether the bias factors of galaxies can be unbiasedly recoveredfrom their power spectra and bispectra. we use a set of numerical n-bodysimulations and construct large mock galaxy catalogs based upon thesemi-analytical model of croton et al. (2006). we measure the reduced bispectrafor galaxies of different luminosity, and determine the linear and firstnonlinear bias factors from their bispectra. we find that on large scales downto that of the wavenumber k=0.1h/mpc, the bias factors b1 and b2 are nearlyconstant, and b1 obtained with the bispectrum method agrees very well with theexpected value. the nonlinear bias factor b2 is negative, except for the mostluminous galaxies with m&lt;-23 which have a positive b2. the behavior of b2 ofgalaxies is consistent with the b2 mass dependence of their host halos. we showthat it is essential to have an accurate estimation of the dark matterbispectrum in order to have an unbiased measurement of b1 and b2. we also testthe analytical approach of incorporating halo occupation distribution to modelthe galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum. the halo model predictions do not fitthe simulation results well on the precision requirement of currentcosmological studies.

0910.4013	impacts of source properties on strong lensing by rich galaxy clusters	we use a high-resolution $n$-body simulation to investigate the influence ofbackground galaxy properties, including redshift, size, shape and clustering,on the efficiency of forming giant arcs by gravitational lensing of rich galaxyclusters. two large sets of ray-tracing simulations are carried out for 10massive clusters at two redshifts, i.e. $z_{\rm l} \sim 0.2$ and 0.3. thevirial mass ($m_{\rm vir}$) of the simulated lens clusters at $z\sim0.2$ rangesfrom $6.8\times10^{14} h^{-1} {m_{\odot}}$ to $1.1\times 10^{15} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$. the information of background galaxies brighter than 25 magnitudein the $i$-band is taken from cosmological evolution survey (cosmos) imagingdata. around $1.7\times 10^5$ strong lensing realizations with these images asbackground galaxies have been performed for each set. we find that theefficiency for forming giant arcs for $z_{\rm l}=0.2$ clusters is broadlyconsistent with observations. the efficiency of producing giant arcs by richclusters is weakly dependent on the source size and clustering. our principalfinding is that a small proportion ($\sim 1/3$) of galaxies with elongatedshapes (e.g. ellipticity $\epsilon=1-b/a&gt;0.5$) can boost the number of giantarcs substantially. compared with recent studies where a uniform ellipticitydistribution from 0 to 0.5 is used for the sources, the adoption of directlyobserved shape distribution increases the number of giant arcs by a factor of$\sim2$. our results indicate that it is necessary to account for sourceinformation and survey parameters (such as point-spread-function, seeing) tomake correct predictions of giant arcs and further to constrain thecosmological parameters.(abridged)

0911.1864	modelling galaxy stellar mass evolution from z~0.8 to today	we apply the empirical method built for z=0 in the previous work of wang etal. to a higher redshift, to link galaxy stellar mass directly with its hostingdark matter halo mass at z~0.8. the relation of the galaxy stellar mass and thehost halo mass m_infall is constrained by fitting both the stellar massfunction and the correlation functions at different stellar mass intervals ofthe vvds observation, where m_infall is the mass of the hosting halo at thetime when the galaxy was last the central galaxy. we find that for low masshaloes, their residing central galaxies are less massive at high redshift thanthose at low redshift. for high mass haloes, central galaxies in these haloesat high redshift are a bit more massive than the galaxies at low redshift.satellite galaxies are less massive at earlier times, for any given mass ofhosting haloes. fitting both the sdss and vvds observations simultaneously, wealso propose a unified model of the m_stars-m_infall relation, which describesthe evolution of central galaxy mass as a function of time. the stellar mass ofa satellite galaxy is determined by the same m_stars-m_infall relation ofcentral galaxies at the time when the galaxy is accreted. with these models, westudy the amount of galaxy stellar mass increased from z~0.8 to the present daythrough galaxy mergers and star formation. low mass galaxies gain their stellarmasses from z~0.8 to z=0 mainly through star formation. for galaxies of highermass, the increase of stellar mass solely through mergers from z=0.8 can makethe massive galaxies a factor ~2 larger than observed at z=0. we can alsopredict stellar mass functions of redshifts up to z~3, and the results areconsistent with the latest observations.

0707.2628	a fitting formula for the merger timescale of galaxies in hierarchical  clustering	we study galaxy mergers using a high-resolution cosmological hydro/n-bodysimulation with star formation, and compare the measured merger timescales withtheoretical predictions based on the chandrasekhar formula. in contrast tonavarro et al., our numerical results indicate, that the commonly used equationfor the merger timescale given by lacey and cole, systematically underestimatesthe merger timescales for minor mergers and overestimates those for majormergers. this behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of theirexpression for the coulomb logarithm, \ln (m_pri/m_sat). the two alternativeforms \ln (1+m_pri/m_sat) and 1/2\ln [1+(m_pri/m_sat)^2] for the coulomblogarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully,but both of them underestimate the merger time scale by a factor 2. since \ln(1+m_pri/m_sat) represents the mass dependence slightly better we adopt thisexpression for the coulomb logarithm. furthermore, we find that the dependenceof the merger timescale on the circularity parameter \epsilon is much weakerthan the widely adopted power-law \epsilon^{0.78}, whereas0.94*{\epsilon}^{0.60}+0.60 provides a good match to the data. based on thesefindings, we present an accurate and convenient fitting formula for the mergertimescale of galaxies in cold dark matter models.

1004.3548	systematic effects on determination of the growth factor from  redshift-space distortions	the linear growth factor of density perturbations is believed to be apowerful observable of future redshift surveys to probe physical properties ofdark energy and to distinguish among gravity theories. we investigatesystematic effects on determination of the growth factor f from a measurementof redshift-space distortions. using n-body simulations we identify dark matterhalos over a broad mass range. we compute the power spectra and correlationfunctions for the halos and then examine how well the redshift distortionparameter beta=f/b can be reconstructed as a function of halo mass. we findthat beta measured for a fixed halo mass is generally a function of scale evenon large scales, in contrast with the common expectation that beta approaches aconstant described by kaiser's formula on such scales. the scale dependencedepends on the halo mass, being stronger for smaller halos. it also cannot beeasily explained with the well-known distribution function of the halo peculiarvelocities. we demonstrate that the biasing for smaller halos has largernonlinearity and stochasticity, thus the linear bias assumption becomes worsefor smaller halos. only for massive halos with b&gt;1.5, beta approaches thelinear theory prediction on scales of r or pi/k&gt;30mpc/h. luminous red galaxies(lrg), targeted by the sdss-iii's boss survey, tend to reside in very massivehalos. our results indicate that if the lrg is used for the measurement ofredshift distortions, f can be measured unbiasedly. on the other hand, if oneconsiders to use emission line galaxies, which are targeted by the bigbosssurvey and inhabited in halos of a broad mass range, the scale dependence ofbeta must be taken into account carefully; otherwise one might give incorrectconstraints on dark energy or modified gravity theories. we also find that betareconstructed in fourier space behaves better than that in configuration space.

1007.0612	internal properties and environments of dark matter halos	we use seven high-resolution $n$-body simulations to study the correlationsamong different halo properties (assembly time, spin, shape and substructure),and how these halo properties are correlated with the large-scale environmentin which halos reside. the large-scale tidal field estimated from halos above amass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scaleenvironment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and themorphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. for halos at afixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment,particularly the tidal field. the environmental dependence of halo assemblytime is primarily driven by local tidal field. the mass of the unbound fractionin substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the boundfraction is suppressed. halos have a tendency to spin faster in stronger tidalfield and the trend is stronger for more massive halos. the spin vectors showsignificant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, asexpected from the tidal torque theory. both the major and minor axes of halosare strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field.in general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of itsmain halo on average is younger, is more elongated, spins faster, and containsa larger amount of substructure. higher density environments not only providemore material for halo to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal fieldthat tends to suppress halo accretion. the environmental dependencies are theresults of these two competing effects. the tidal field based on halos can beestimated from observation, and we discuss the implications of our results forthe environmental dependence of galaxy properties.

1011.2058	galaxy clustering and projected density profiles as traced by satellites  in photometric surveys: methodology and luminosity dependence	we develop a new method which measures the projected density distributionw_p(r_p)n of photometric galaxies surrounding a set ofspectroscopically-identified galaxies, and simultaneously the projectedcorrelation function w_p(r_p) between the two populations. in this method weare able to divide the photometric galaxies into subsamples in luminosityintervals when redshift information is unavailable, enabling us to measurew_p(r_p)n and w_p(r_p) as a function of not only the luminosity of thespectroscopic galaxy, but also that of the photometric galaxy. extensive testsshow that our method can measure w_p(r_p) in a statistically unbiased way. theaccuracy of the measurement depends on the validity of the assumption in themethod that the foreground/background galaxies are randomly distributed andthus uncorrelated with those galaxies of interest. therefore, our method can beapplied to the cases where foreground/background galaxies are distributed inlarge volumes, which is usually valid in real observations. we applied ourmethod to data from sdss including a sample of 10^5 lrgs at z~0.4 and a sampleof about half a million galaxies at z~0.1, both of which are cross-correlatedwith a deep photometric sample drawn from the sdss. on large scales, therelative bias factor of galaxies measured from w_p(r_p) at z~0.4 depends onluminosity in a manner similar to what is found at z~0.1, which are usuallyprobed by autocorrelations of spectroscopic samples. on scales smaller than afew mpc and at both z~0.4 and z~0.1, the photometric galaxies of differentluminosities exhibit similar density profiles around spectroscopic galaxies atfixed luminosity and redshift. this provides clear support for the assumptioncommonly-adopted in hod models that satellite galaxies of differentluminosities are distributed in a similar way, following the dark matterdistribution within their host halos.

1103.2099	resolving subhaloes' lives with the hierarchical bound-tracing algorithm	we develop a new code, the hierarchical bound-tracing (hbt for short) code,to find and trace dark matter subhaloes in simulations based on the mergerhierarchy of dark matter haloes. application of this code to a recent benchmarktest of finding subhaloes demonstrates that hbt stands as one of the best codesto trace the evolutionary history of subhaloes. the success of the code lies inits careful treatment of the complex physical processes associated with theevolution of subhaloes and in its robust unbinding algorithm with an adaptivesource subhalo management. we keep a full record of the merger hierarchy ofhaloes and subhaloes, and allow growth of satellite subhaloes through accretionfrom its "satellite-of-satellites", hence allowing mergers among satellites.local accretion of background mass is omitted, while rebinding of stripped massis allowed. the justification of these treatments is provided by case studiesof the lives of individual subhaloes and by the success in finding the completesubhalo catalogue. we compare our result to other popular subhalo finders andshow that hbt is able to well resolve subhaloes in high density environment andkeep strict physical track of subhaloes' merger history. this code is fullyparallelized and freely available upon request to the authors.

1105.3880	autocorrelations of stellar light and mass at z~0 and ~1: from sdss to  deep2	we present measurements of projected autocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) forthe stellar mass of galaxies and for their light in the u, b and v bands, usingdata from the third data release of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and thefinal data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we investigate theclustering bias of stellar mass and light by comparing these to projectedautocorrelations of dark matter estimated from the millennium simulations (ms)at z=1 and 0.07, the median redshifts of our galaxy samples. all of theautocorrelation and bias functions show systematic trends with spatial scaleand waveband which are impressively similar at the two redshifts. this showsthat the well-established environmental dependence of stellar populations inthe local universe is already in place at z=1. the recent ms-based galaxyformation simulation of guo et al. (2011) reproduces the scale-dependentclustering of luminosity to an accuracy better than 30% in all bands and atboth redshifts, but substantially overpredicts mass autocorrelations atseparations below about 2 mpc. further comparison of the shapes of our stellarmass bias functions with those predicted by the model suggests that both thesdss and deep2 data prefer a fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 0.8 rather thanthe sigma_8=0.9 assumed by the ms.

1206.3566	internal kinematics of groups of galaxies in the sloan digital sky  survey data release 7	we present measurements of the velocity dispersion profile (vdp) for galaxygroups in the final data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). forgroups of given mass we estimate the redshift-space cross-correlation function(ccf) with respect to a reference galaxy sample, xi(r_p, pi), the projectedccf, w_p(r_p), and the real-space ccf, xi(r). the vdp is then extracted fromthe redshift distortion in xi(r_p, pi), by comparing xi(r_p, pi) with xi(r). wefind that the velocity dispersion (vd) within virial radius (r_200) shows aroughly flat profile, with a slight increase at radii below ~0.3 r_200 for highmass systems. the average vd within the virial radius, sigma_v, is a stronglyincreasing function of central galaxy mass. we apply the same methodology ton-body simulations with the concordance lambda cold dark matter cosmology butdifferent values of the density fluctuation parameter sigma_8, and we comparethe results to the sdss results. we show that the sigma_v-m_* relation from thedata provides stringent constraints on both sigma_8 and sigma_ms, thedispersion in log m_* of central galaxies at fixed halo mass. our best-fittingmodel suggests sigma_8 = 0.86 +/- 0.03 and sigma_ms = 0.16 +/- 0.03. theslightly higher value of sigma_8 compared to the wmap7 result might be due to asmaller matter density parameter assumed in our simulations. our vdmeasurements also provide a direct measure of the dark matter halo mass forcentral galaxies of different luminosities and masses, in good agreement withthe results obtained by mandelbaum et al. (2006) from stacking thegravitational lensing signals of the sdss galaxies.

0711.3792	interaction-induced star formation in a complete sample of 10^5 nearby  star-forming galaxies	we investigate the clustering properties of a complete sample of 10^5star-forming galaxies drawn from the sdss dr4. on scales less than 100 kpc, theamplitude of the correlation function exhibits a strong dependence on thespecific star formation rate of the galaxy. we interpret this as the signatureof enhanced star formation induced by tidal interactions. we then explore howthe average star formation rate in a galaxy is enhanced as the projectedseparation r_p between the galaxy and its companions decreases. we find thatthe enhancement depends strongly on r_p, but very weakly on the relativeluminosity of the companions. the enhancement is also stronger in low massgalaxies than in high mass galaxies. in order to explore whether a tidalinteraction is not only sufficient, but also necessary to trigger enhanced starformation in a galaxy, we compute background subtracted neighbour counts forthe galaxies in our sample. the average number of close neighbours aroundgalaxies with low to average values of sfr/m* is close to zero. at the highestspecific star formation rates, however, more than 40% of the galaxies in oursample have a companion within a projected radius of 100 kpc. visual inspectionof the highest sfr/m* galaxies without companions reveals that more than 50% ofthese are clear interacting or merging systems. we conclude that tidalinteractions are the dominant trigger of enhanced star formation in the moststrongly star-forming systems. finally, we find clear evidence that tidalinteractions not only lead to enhanced star formation in galaxies, but alsocause structural changes such as an increase in concentration.

1210.5700	stellar mass versus stellar velocity dispersion: which is better for  linking galaxies to their dark matter halos?	it was recently suggested that, compared to its stellar mass (m*), thecentral stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) of a galaxy might be a betterindicator for its host dark matter halo mass. here we test this hypothesis byestimating the dark matter halo mass for central alaxies in groups as functionof m* and sigma*. for this we have estimated the redshift-spacecross-correlation function (ccf) between the central galaxies at given m* andsigma* and a reference galaxy sample, from which we determine both theprojected ccf, w_p(r_p), and the velocity dispersion profile (vdp) ofsatellites around the centrals. a halo mass is then obtained from the averagevelocity dispersion within the virial radius. at fixed m*, we find very weak orno correlation between halo mass and sigma*. in contrast, strong massdependence is clearly seen even when sigma* is limited to a narrow range. ourresults thus firmly demonstrate that the stellar mass of central galaxies isstill a good (if not the best) indicator for dark matter halo mass, better thanthe stellar velocity dispersion. the dependence of galaxy clustering on sigma*fixed m*, as recently discovered by wake et al. (2012), may be attributed tosatellite galaxies, for which the tidal stripping occurring within halos hasstronger effect on stellar mass than on central stellar velocity dispersion.

0712.0383	interactions, star formation and agn activity	it has long been known that galaxy interactions are associated with enhancedstar formation. in a companion paper, we explored this connection by applying avariety of statistics to sdss data. in particular, we showed that specific starformation rates of galaxies are higher if they have close neighbours. here weapply exactly the same techniques to agn in the survey, showing that closeneighbours are not associated with any similar enhancement of nuclear activity.star formation is enhanced in agn with close neighbours in exactly the same wayas in inactive galaxies, but the accretion rate onto the black hole, asestimated from the extinction-corrected [o iii] luminosity, is not influencedby the presence or absence of companions. previous work has shown that galaxieswith more strongly accreting black holes contain more young stars in theirinner regions. this leads us to conclude that star formation induced by a closecompanion and star formation associated with black hole accretion are distinctevents. these events may be part of the same physical process, for example amerger, provided they are separated in time. in this case, accretion onto theblack hole and its associated star formation would occur only after the twointeracting galaxies have merged. the major caveat in this work is ourassumption that the extinction-corrected [o iii] luminosity is a robustindicator of the bolometric luminosity of the central black hole. it is thusimportant to check our results using indicators of agn activity at otherwavelengths.

0712.3570	environmental effects on real-space and redshift-space galaxy clustering	galaxy formation inside dark matter halos, as well as the halo formationitself, can be affected by large-scale environments. evaluating the imprints ofenvironmental effects on galaxy clustering is crucial for precise cosmologicalconstraints with data from galaxy redshift surveys. we investigate such anenvironmental impact on both real-space and redshift-space galaxy clusteringstatistics using a semi-analytic model derived from the millennium simulation.we compare clustering statistics from original sam galaxy samples and shuffledones with environmental influence on galaxy properties eliminated. among theluminosity-threshold samples examined, the one with the lowest thresholdluminosity (~0.2l_*) is affected by environmental effects the most, which has a~10% decrease in the real-space two-point correlation function (2pcf) aftershuffling. by decomposing the 2pcf into five different components based on thesource of pairs, we show that the change in the 2pcf can be explained by theage and richness dependence of halo clustering. the 2pcfs in redshift space arefound to change in a similar manner after shuffling. if the environmentaleffects are neglected, halo occupation distribution modeling of the real-spaceand redshift-space clustering may have a less than 6.5% systematic uncertaintyin constraining beta from the most affected sam sample and have substantiallysmaller uncertainties from the other, more luminous samples. we argue that theeffect could be even smaller in reality. in the appendix, we present a methodto decompose the 2pcf, which can be applied to measure the two-pointauto-correlation functions of galaxy sub-samples in a volume-limited galaxysample and their two-point cross-correlation functions in a single runutilizing only one random catalog.

1303.2609	stellar mass and color dependence of the three-point correlation  function of galaxies in the local universe	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) for galaxies provides anopportunity to measure the non-gaussianity generated from nonlinear structureformation and also probes information about galaxy formation and evolution thatis generally not available from the two-point correlation function (2pcf). wemeasure the 3pcf of the sloan digital sky survey dr7 main sample galaxies inboth redshift and projected spaces on scales up to 40mpc/h. we explore thedependence of the 3pcf on galaxy stellar mass and color in order to constrainthe formation and evolution for galaxies of different properties. the study ofthe dependence on these properties also helps better constrain the relationbetween galaxy stellar mass and color and the properties of their hostingdark-matter halos. we focus on the study of the reduced 3pcf, q, defined as theratio between the 3pcf and the sum of the products of the 2pcfs. we find a veryweak stellar mass dependence of q in both redshift and projected spaces. onsmall scales, more massive galaxies tend to have slightly higher amplitudes ofq. the shape dependence of q is also weak on these small scales, regardless ofstellar mass and color. the reduced 3pcf has a strong color dependence for thelow-mass galaxies, while no significant dependence on color is found for thehigh-mass galaxies. low-mass red galaxies have higher amplitudes and strongershape dependence of the reduced 3pcf than the blue galaxies, implying thatthese low-mass red galaxies tend to populate filamentary structures. the lineargalaxy bias model fails to interpret the color dependence of q, emphasizing theimportance of a nonvanishing quadratic bias parameter in the correct modelingof the galaxy color distribution.

(2003), and the stellar mass densities at $m_{\ast}\sim5\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$ and $m_{\ast}\sim 10^{12} m_{\odot}$ are a few tenthsand a factor of few higher than those of bernardi et al.

0803.1213	reconstructing the cosmic density field with the distribution of dark  matter halos	we develop a new method to reconstruct the cosmic density field from thedistribution of dark matter haloes above a certain mass threshold. ourmotivation is that well-defined samples of galaxy groups/clusters, which can beused to represent the dark halo population, can now be selected from largeredshift surveys of galaxies, and our ultimate goal is to use such data toreconstruct the cosmic density field in the local universe. our reconstructionmethod starts with a sample of dark matter haloes above a given mass threshold.each volume element in space is assigned to the domain of the nearest haloaccording to a distance measure that is scaled by the virial radius of thehalo. the distribution of the mass in and around dark matter haloes of a givenmass is modelled using the cross-correlation function between dark matterhaloes and the mass distribution within their domains. we use n-bodycosmological simulations to show that the density profiles required in ourreconstruction scheme can be determined reliably from large cosmologicalsimulations, and that our method can reconstruct the density field accuratelyusing haloes with masses down to $\sim 10^{12}\msun$ (above which samples ofgalaxy groups can be constructed from current large redshift surveys ofgalaxies). working in redshift space, we demonstrate that the redshiftdistortions due to the peculiar velocities of haloes can be corrected in aniterative way. we also describe some applications of our method.

1407.3451	elucid - exploring the local universe with reconstructed initial density  field i: hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo method with particle mesh  dynamics	simulating the evolution of the local universe is important for studyinggalaxies and the intergalactic medium in a way free of cosmic variance. here wepresent a method to reconstruct the initial linear density field from an inputnon-linear density field, employing the hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo(hmc) algorithm combined with particle mesh (pm) dynamics. the hmc+pm method isapplied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear densityfields are then evolved to the present day with n-body simulations. theconstrained simulations so obtained accurately reproduce both the amplitudesand phases of the input simulations at various $z$. using a pm model with agrid cell size of 0.75 mpc/h and 40 time-steps in the hmc can recover more thanhalf of the phase information down to a scale k~0.85 h/mpc at high z and tok~3.4 h/mpc at z=0, which represents a significant improvement over similarreconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model canreconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamicalrange. adopting pm models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yieldseven better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by theavailability of computer resource than by principle. dynamic models ofstructure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can inducenon-gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn cancause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function. suchdeviations are greatly reduced or absent in our reconstruction.

1408.5407	the stellar-to-halo mass relations of local galaxies segregates by color	we derive the stellar-to-halo mass relations, shmr, of local blue and redcentral galaxies separately, as well as the fraction of halos hosting blue/redcentral galaxies. we find that: 1) the shmr of central galaxies is segregatedby color, with blue centrals having a shmr above the one of red centrals; atlogmh~12, the ms/mh ratio of the blue centrals is ~0.05, which is ~1.7 timeslarger than the value of red centrals. 2) the intrinsic scatters of the shmrsof red and blue centrals are ~0.14 and ~0.11dex, respectively. the intrinsicscatter of the average shmr of all central galaxies changes from ~0.20dex to~0.14dex in the 11.3&lt;logmh&lt;15 range. 3) the fraction of halos hosting bluecentrals at mh=1e11msun is 87%, but at 2x1e12msun decays to ~20%, approachingto a few per cents at higher masses. the characteristic mass at which thisfraction is the same for blue and red galaxies is mh~7x1e11msun. our resultssuggest that the shmr of central galaxies at large masses is shaped by halomass quenching (likely through shock virial heating and agn feedback), butgroup richness also plays an important role: central galaxies living in lessdense environments quenched their star formation later or did not quench ityet. at low masses, processes that delay star formation without invoking toostrong supernova-driven outflows could explain the high ms/mh ratios of bluecentrals as compared to those of the scarce red centrals.

1503.00780	estimating the evolution of gas in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy  from its star formation history: an illustrative example	we propose that detailed data on the star formation history of a dwarfspheroidal galaxy (dsph) may be used to estimate the evolution of the totalmass m_g(t) for cold gas in its star-forming disk. using fornax as anillustrative example, we estimate its m_g(t) and the corresponding net gas flowrate delta f(t) assuming a global star formation rate psi(t) =lambda_*(t)[m_g(t)/m_sun]^alpha consistent with observations of nearbygalaxies. we identify the onset of the transition in delta f(t) from a netinflow to a net outflow as the time t_sat at which the fornax halo became amilky way satellite and estimate the evolution of its total mass m_h(t) at t &lt;t_sat using the median halo growth history in the lambdacdm cosmology and itspresent mass within the half-light radius derived from observations. we examinethree different cases of alpha = 1, 1.5, and 2, and justify the correspondinglambda_*(t) by comparing the gas mass fraction f_g(t) = m_g(t)/m_h(t) at t &lt;t_sat with results from simulations of gas accretion by halos in a reionizeduniverse. we find that the fornax halo grew to m_h(t_sat) ~ 2x10^9 m_sun att_sat ~ 5 or 8 gyr, in broad agreement with previous studies using data on itsstellar kinematics and its orbital motion. we describe qualitatively theevolution of fornax as a satellite and discuss potential extension of ourapproach to other dsphs.

astro-ph;0001076	cosmological sph simulations with four million particles: statistical  properties of x-ray clusters in a low-density universe	we present results from a series of cosmological sph (smoothed particlehydrodynamics) simulations coupled with the p3m(particle-particle-particle-mesh) solver for the gravitational force. thesimulations are designed to predict the statistical properties of x-rayclusters of galaxies as well as to study the formation of galaxies. we haveseven simulation runs with different assumptions on the thermal state of theintracluster gas. following the recent work by pearce et al., we modify our sphalgorithm so as to phenomenologically incorporate the galaxy formation bydecoupling the cooled gas particles from the hot gas particles. all thesimulations employ 128^3 particles both for dark matter and for gas components,and thus constitute the largest systematic catalogues of simulated clusters inthe sph method performed so far. these enable us to compare the analyticalpredictions on statistical properties of x-ray clusters against our directsimulation results in an unbiased manner. we find that the luminosities of thesimulated clusters are quite sensitive to the thermal history and also to thenumerical resolution of the simulations, and thus are not reliable. on theother hand, the mass-temperature relation for the simulated clusters is fairlyinsensitive to the assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster gas,robust against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with theanalytic prediction. therefore the prediction for the x-ray temperaturefunction of clusters on the basis of the press-schechter mass function and thevirial equilibrium is fairly reliable.

astro-ph;0009032	scaling properties of the redshift power spectrum: theoretical models	we report the results of an analysis of the redshift power spectrum$p^s(k,\mu)$ in three typical cold dark matter (cdm) cosmological models, where$\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the wave vector and the line-of-sight.two distinct biased tracers derived from the primordial density peaks ofbardeen et al. and the cluster-underweight model of jing, mo, &amp; b\"orner areconsidered in addition to the pure dark matter models. based on a large set ofhigh resolution simulations, we have measured the redshift power spectrum forthe three tracers from the linear to the nonlinear regime. we investigate thevalidity of the relation - guessed from linear theory - in the nonlinear regime$$ p^s(k,\mu)=p^r(k)[1+\beta\mu^2]^2d(k,\mu,\sigma_{12}(k)), $$ where $p^r(k)$is the real space power spectrum, and $\beta$ equals $\omega_0^{0.6}/b_l$. thedamping function $d$ which should generally depend on $k$, $\mu$, and$\sigma_{12}(k)$, is found to be a function of only one variable$k\mu\sigma_{12}(k)$. this scaling behavior extends into the nonlinear regime,while $d$ can be accurately expressed as a lorentz function - well known fromlinear theory - for values $d &gt; 0.1$. the difference between $\sigma_{12}(k)$and the pairwise velocity dispersion defined by the 3-d peculiar velocity ofthe simulations (taking $r=1/k$) is about 15%. therefore $\sigma_{12}(k)$ is agood indicator of the pairwise velocity dispersion. the exact functional formof $d$ depends on the cosmological model and on the bias scheme. we have givenan accurate fitting formula for the functional form of $d$ for the modelsstudied.

astro-ph;0101210	a new test for the stable clustering hypothesis	the stable clustering hypothesis is a fundamental assumption about thenonlinear clustering of matter in cosmology. it states that the mean physicalseparation of particles is a constant on sufficiently small scales. while manyauthors have attempted to test the hypothesis with cosmological n-bodysimulations, no consensus has been reached on whether and where the hypothesisis valid, because of the limited dynamical range this type of simulations canachieve. in this letter, we propose to test the hypothesis with high resolutionhalo simulations, since the individual halo simulations can resolve much betterthe fine structures of the halos and since almost all pairs of particles withsmall separations are presumed to be inside virialized halos. we calculated themean pair velocity for 14 high resolution halos of $\sim 1$ million particlesin a low-density flat cold dark matter model. the result agrees very well withthe stable clustering prediction within the measurement uncertainty $\sim 30%$over a large range of scales where the overdensity is $10^3$ to $10^6$. theaccuracy of the test can be improved to $\sim 10%$ if some 100 halos with asimilar resolution are analyzed.

astro-ph;0101211	the scaling of the redshift power spectrum: observations from the las  campanas redshift survey	in a recent paper we have studied the redshift power spectrum $p^s(k,\mu)$ inthree cdm models with the help of high resolution simulations. here we applythe method to the largest available redshift survey, the las campanas redshiftsurvey (lcrs). the basic model is to express $p^s(k,\mu)$ as a product of threefactors p^s(k,\mu)=p^r(k)(1+\beta\mu^2)^2 d(k,\mu). here $\mu$ is the cosine ofthe angle between the wave vector and the line of sight. the damping function$d$ for the range of scales accessible to an accurate analysis of the lcrs iswell approximated by the lorentz factor d=[1+{1\over2}(k\mu\sigma_{12})^2]^{-1}. we have investigated different values for $\beta$($\beta=0.4$, 0.5, 0.6), and measured $p^r(k)$ and $\sigma_{12}(k)$ from$p^s(k,\mu)$ for different values of $\mu$. the velocity dispersion$\sigma_{12}(k)$ is nearly a constant from $k=0.5$ to 3 $\mpci$. the averagevalue for this range is $510\pm 70 \kms$. the power spectrum $p^r(k)$ decreaseswith $k$ approximately with $k^{-1.7}$ for $k$ between 0.1 and 4 $\mpci$. thestatistical significance of the results, and the error bars, are found with thehelp of mock samples constructed from a large set of high resolutionsimulations. a flat, low-density ($\omega_0=0.2$) cdm model can give a good fitto the data, if a scale-dependent special bias scheme is used which we havecalled the cluster-under-weighted bias (jing et al.).

astro-ph;0104023	spatial correlation functions and the pairwise peculiar velocity  dispersion of galaxies in the pscz survey: implications for the galaxy  biasing in cold dark matter models	we report on the measurement of the two-point correlation function, and thepairwise peculiar velocity of galaxies in the iras pscz survey. we computethese statistics first in redshift space, and then obtain the projectedfunctions which have simple relations to the real-space correlation functionson the basis of the method developed earlier in analyzing the las campanasredshift survey (lcrs) by jing, mo, &amp; b\"orner (1998). we find that the realspace two-point correlation function can be fitted to a power law $\xi(r) =(r_0/r)^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma=1.69$ and $r_0=3.70 \mpc$. the pairwise peculiarvelocity dispersion $\sigma_{12}(r_p)$ is close to $400 \kms$ at $r_p=3\mpc$and decreases to about $150 \kms$ at $r_p \approx 0.2 \mpc$. these values aresignificantly lower than those obtained from the lcrs. in order to understandthe implications of those measurements on the galaxy biasing, we construct mocksamples for a low density spatially-flat cold dark matter model ($\omega_0 =0.3$, $\lambda_0=0.7$, $\gamma=0.2$, $\sigma_8=1$) using a set ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations. applying a stronger cluster-underweightbiasing ($\propto m^{-0.25}$) than for the lcrs ($\propto m^{-0.08}$), we areable to reproduce these observational data, except for the strong decrease ofthe pairwise peculiar velocity at small separations. this is qualitativelyascribed to the different morphological mixture of galaxies in the twocatalogues. disk-dominated galaxy samples drawn from the theoreticallyconstructed gif catalog yield results rather similar to our mock samples withthe simple cluster-underweight biasing.

astro-ph;0104361	nonlinear stochastic biasing of galaxies and dark halos in cosmological  hydrodynamic simulations	we perform an extensive analysis of nonlinear and stochastic biasing ofgalaxies and dark halos in spatially flat low-density cdm universe usingcosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we compare their biasing properties withthe predictions of an analytic halo biasing model. dark halos in oursimulations exhibit reasonable agreement with the predictions only on scaleslarger than 10h^{-1}mpc, and on smaller scales the volume exclusion effect ofhalos due to their finite size becomes substantial. interestingly the biasingproperties of galaxies are better described by extrapolating the halo biasingmodel predictions.  we also find the clear dependence of galaxy biasing on their formation epoch;the distribution of old populations of galaxies tightly correlates with theunderlying mass density field, while that of young populations is slightly morestochastic and anti-biased relative to dark matter. the amplitude of two-pointcorrelation function of old populations is about 3 times larger than that ofthe young populations. furthermore, the old population of galaxies residewithin massive dark halos while the young galaxies are preferentially formed insmaller dark halos. assuming that the observed early and late-type galaxiescorrespond to the simulated old and young populations of galaxies,respectively, all of these segregations of galaxies are consistent withobservational ones for the early and late-type of galaxies such as themorphology--density relation of galaxies.

astro-ph;0201124	an analytical model for the non-linear redshift-space power spectrum	we use n-body simulations to test the predictions of the redshift distortionin the power spectrum given by the halo model in which the clustering of darkmatter particles is considered as a result both of the clustering of dark halosin space and of the distribution of dark matter particles in individual darkhalo. the predicted redshift distortion depends sensitively on several modelparameters in a way different from the real-space power spectrum. an accuratemodel of the redshift distortion can be constructed if the following propertiesof the halo population are modelled accurately: the mass function of darkhalos, the velocity dispersion among dark halos, and the non-linear nature ofhalo bias on small scales. the model can be readily applied to interpreting theclustering properties and velocity dispersion of different populations ofgalaxies once a cluster-weighted bias (or equivalently an halo occupationnumber model) is specified for the galaxies. some non-trivial bias featuresobserved from redshift surveys of optical galaxies and of iras galaxiesrelative to the standard low-density cold dark matter model can be easilyexplained in the cluster weighted bias model. the halo model further indicatesthat a linear bias can be a good approximation only on for k &lt;= 0.1 hmpc^{-1}.

astro-ph;0201520	the angular momentum distribution within halos in different dark matter  models	we study the angular momentum profile of dark matter halos for a statisticalsample drawn from a set of high-resolution cosmological simulations of $256^3$particles. two typical cold dark matter (cdm) models have been analyzed, andthe halos are selected to have at least $3\times 10^4$ particles in order toreliably measure the angular momentum profile. in contrast with the recentclaims of bullock et al., we find that the degree of misalignment of angularmomentum within a halo is very high. about 50 percent of halos have more than10 percent of halo mass in the mass of negative angular momentum $j$. after themass of negative $j$ is excluded, the cumulative mass function $m(&lt;j)$ followsapproximately the universal function proposed by bullock et al., though westill find a significant fraction of halos ($\sim 50%$) which exhibitsystematic deviations from the universal function. our results, however, arebroadly in good agreement with a recent work of van den bosch et al.. we alsostudy the angular momentum profile of halos in a warm dark matter (wdm) modeland a self-interacting dark matter (sidm) model. we find that the angularmomentum profile of halos in the wdm is statistically indistinguishable fromthat in the cdm model, but the angular momentum of halos in the sidm is reducedby the self-interaction of dark matter.

astro-ph;0206098	intrinsic correlation of halo ellipticity and its implications for  large-scale weak lensing surveys	we use a large set of state-of-the-art cosmological n-body simulations [512^3particles] to study the intrinsic ellipticity correlation functions of halos.with the simulations of different resolutions, we find that the ellipticitycorrelations converge once the halos have more than 160 members. for halos withfewer members, the correlations are underestimated, and the underestimationamounts to a factor of 2 when the halos have only 20 particles. aftercorrecting for the resolution effects, we show that the ellipticitycorrelations of halos in the bigger box (l=300 mpc) agree very well with thoseobtained in the smaller box (l=100 mpc). combining these results from thedifferent simulation boxes, we present accurate fitting formulae for theellipticity correlation function c_{11}(r) and for the projected correlationfunctions sigma_{11}(r_p) and sigma_{22}(r_p) over three orders of magnitude inhalo mass. the latter two functions are useful for predicting the contributionof the intrinsic correlations to deep lensing surveys. with reasonableassumptions for the redshift distribution of galaxies and for the mass ofgalaxies, we find that the intrinsic ellipticity correlation can contributesignificantly not only to shallow surveys but also to deep surveys. our resultsindicate that previous similar studies significantly underestimated thiscontribution for their limited simulation resolutions.

astro-ph;0303053	spatial and dynamical biases in velocity statistics of galaxies	we present velocity statistics of galaxies and their biases inferred from thestatistics of the underlying dark matter using a cosmological hydrodynamicsimulation of galaxy formation in low-density and spatially flat cold darkmatter cosmogony. we find that the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd) of allgalaxies is significantly lower than that of the dark matter particles, andthat the pvd of the young galaxies is lower than that of the old types, andeven of all galaxies together, especially at small separations. these resultsare in reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of pvds in the lascampanas redshift survey, the pscz catalogue and the sdss data. we also findthat the low pvd of young galaxies is due to the effects of dynamical frictionas well as the different spatial distribution. we also consider the mean infallvelocity and the potent density reconstruction that are often used to measurethe cosmological parameters, and investigate the effects of spatial bias anddynamical friction. in our simulation, the mean infall velocity of younggalaxies is significantly lower than that of all the galaxies or of the oldgalaxies, and the dynamical bias becomes important on scales less than 3mpc/h.the mass density field reconstructed from the velocity field of young galaxiesusing the potent-style method suffers in accuracy both from the spatial biasand the dynamical friction on the smoothing scale of r_s=8mpc/h. on the otherhand, in the case of r_s=12mpc/h, which is typically adopted in the actualpotent analysis, the density reconstruction based on various tracers ofgalaxies is reasonably accurate.

astro-ph;0305187	modeling peculiar velocities of dark matter halos	we present a simple model that accurately describes various statisticalproperties of peculiar velocities of dark matter halos. we pay particularattention to the following two effects; first, the evolution of the halopeculiar velocity depends on the local matter density, instead of the globaldensity. second, dark matter halos are biased tracers of the underlying massdistribution, thus halos tend to be located preferentially at high densityregions. for the former, we develop an empirical model calibrated with n-bodysimulations, while for the latter, we use a conventional halo bias models basedon the extended press-schechter model combined with an empirical log-normalprobability distribution function of the mass density distribution. we findthat compared with linear theory, the present model significantly improves theaccuracy of predictions of statistical properties of the halo peculiar velocityfield including the velocity dispersion, the probability distribution function,and the pairwise velocity dispersion at large separations. thus our modelpredictions may be useful in analyzing future observations of the peculiarvelocities of galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0306385	formation time distribution of dark matter haloes: theories versus  n-body simulations	this paper uses numerical simulations to test the formation time distributionof dark matter haloes predicted by the analytic excursion set approaches. theformation time distribution is closely linked to the conditional mass functionand this test is therefore an indirect probe of this distribution. theexcursion set models tested are the extended press-schechter (eps) model, theellipsoidal collapse (ec) model, and the non-spherical collapse boundary (ncb)model. three sets of simulations (6 realizations) have been used to investigatethe halo formation time distribution for halo masses ranging from dwarf-galaxylike haloes ($m=10^{-3} m_*$, where $m_*$ is the characteristic non-linear massscale) to massive haloes of $m=8.7 m_*$. none of the models can match thesimulation results at both high and low redshift. in particular, dark matterhaloes formed generally earlier in our simulations than predicted by the epsmodel. this discrepancy might help explain why semi-analytic models of galaxyformation, based on eps merger trees, under-predict the number of high redshiftgalaxies compared with recent observations.

astro-ph;0307270	angular momentum distribution of hot gas and implications for disk  galaxy formation	we study the angular momentum profiles both for dark matter and for gaswithin virialized halos, using a statistical sample of halos drawn fromcosmological hydrodynamics simulations. three simulations have been analyzed,one is the ``non-radiative'' simulation, and the other two have radiativecooling. we find that the gas component on average has a larger spin andcontains a smaller fraction of mass with negative angular momentum than itsdark matter counterpart in the non-radiative model. as to the cooling models,the gas component shares approximately the same spin parameter as its darkmatter counterpart, but the hot gas has a higher spin and is more aligned inangular momentum than dark matter, while the opposite holds for the cold gas.after the mass of negative angular momentum is excluded, the angular momentumprofile of the hot gas component approximately follows the universal functionoriginally proposed by bullock et al. for dark matter, though the shapeparameter $\mu$ is much larger for hot gas and is comfortably in the rangerequired by observations of disk galaxies. since disk formation is related tothe distribution of hot gas that will cool, our study may explain the fact thatthe disk component of observed galaxies contains a smaller fraction of lowangular momentum material than dark matter in halos.

astro-ph;0405234	a halo-based galaxy group finder: calibration and application to the  2dfgrs	we use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders inmagnitude-limited redshift surveys. since, according to the current scenario ofstructure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter halos,we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our groupfinder. the method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign atentative mass to each group. this mass is used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership (in redshift space). this procedure isrepeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. we find that thefinal groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratioassumed. we use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf), to test the performance of our group finder in terms ofcompleteness of true members and contamination by interlopers. our group finderis more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends group finder inassigning galaxies in common dark matter halos to a single group. we apply ourgroup finder to the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey and compare theresulting group properties with model predictions based on the clf. for the$\lambda$cdm `concordance' cosmology we find a clear discrepancy between themodel and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. inorder to match the observational results we have to either increase themass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher thancurrent observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma_8 \simeq 0.7$, comparedto the `concordance' value of 0.9.

astro-ph;0406077	the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies: luminosity dependence and  a new test of galaxy formation models	we present the first determination of the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd)for galaxies in different luminosity intervals using the final release of thetwo-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we have discovered quitesurprisingly that the relative velocities of the faint galaxies at smallseparation are very high, around $700 \kms$, reaching similar values as thebrightest galaxies. at intermediate luminosities $m^*-1$ ($m^*$ is thecharacteristic luminosity of the schechter function), the relative velocitiesexhibit a well defined steep minimum near $400 \kms$. this result has beenderived using a novel method to determine the real space power spectrum and thepvd from the redshift space power spectrum of the 2dfgrs. both quantities canbe determined quite reliably. we have taken the parameter $\beta$ equal to0.45. but we have also checked that the results are changed very little, if weallow a variation of $\beta$ with luminosity. the result is a challenge to thecurrent halo model of galaxies of yang et al. that was obtained by matching theclustering and luminosity function of the 2dfgrs, but cannot reproduce theluminosity dependence of the pvd. it may also be an mportant constraint ingeneral on theories of galaxy formation, such as semi-analytical models andhydro/n-body simulations of galaxy formation. combined with the observedluminosity dependence of clustering, our result implies that a substantialfraction of faint galaxies, as well as the brightest ones, are in massive halosof galaxy cluster size, but most of the $m^*$ galaxies are in galactic halos.

astro-ph;0406593	the two-point correlation of galaxy groups: probing the clustering of  dark matter haloes	we analyze the 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of galaxy groupsidentified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey with the halo basedgroup finder recently developed by yang et al (2004b). with this groupcatalogue we are able to estimate the 2pcfs for systems ranging from isolatedgalaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. the real-space correlation lengthobtained for these systems ranges from $\sim 4\mpch$ to $\sim 15\mpch$,respectively. the observed correlation amplitude (and the corresponding biasfactor) as a function of group abundance is well reproduced by associatinggalaxy groups with dark matter haloes in the standard $\lambda$cdm model.redshift distortions are clearly detected in the redshift-space correlationfunction, the degree of which is consistent with the assumption ofgravitational clustering and halo bias in the cosmic density field. inagreement with previous studies we find a strong increase of the correlationlength with the mean inter-group separation. although well determinedobservationally, we show that current theoretical predictions are not yetaccurate enough to allow for stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.finally, we use our results to explore the power-law nature of the 2pcf ofgalaxies. we split the 2pcf in 1-group and 2-group terms, equivalent to the1-halo and 2-halo terms in halo occupation models, and show that the power-lawform of the 2pcf is broken, when only including galaxies in the more massivesystems.

astro-ph;0407600	the non-linear evolution of bispectrum from the scale-free n-body  simulation	we have accurately measured the bispectrum for four scale-free models ofstructure formation with the spectral index $n=1$, 0, -1, and -2. themeasurement is based on a new method that can effectively eliminate the aliasand numerical artifacts, and reliably extend the analysis into the stronglynon-linear regime. the work makes use of a set of state-of-the art n-bodysimulations that have significantly increased the resolution range comparedwith the previous studies on the subject. with these measured results, wedemonstrated that the measured bispectrum depends on the shape and size of$k$-triangle even in the strongly nonlinear regime. it increases withwavenumber and decreases with the spectral index. these results are in contrastwith the hypothesis that the reduced bispectrum is a constant in the stronglynon-linear regime. we also show that the fitting formula of scoccimarro &amp;frieman (1999) does not describe our simulation results well (with a typicalerror about 40 percent). in the end, we present a new fitting formula for thereduced bispectrum that is valid for $-2 \leq n \leq 0$ with a typical error of10 percent only.

astro-ph;0408475	semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with high-resolution n-body  simulations	we model the galaxy formation in a series of high-resolution n-bodysimulations using the semi-analytical approach. unlike many earlierinvestigations based on semi-analytical models, we make use of the subhalosresolved in the $n$-body simulations to follow the mergers of galaxies in darkhalos, and we show that this is pivotal in modeling correctly the galaxyluminosity function at the bright end and the bimodal nature of galaxy colordistribution. mergers of galaxies based on subhalos also result in many morebright red galaxies at high $z$. the semi-analytical model we adopt is similarto those used in earlier semi-analytical studies, except that we consider theeffect of a prolonged cooling in small halos and that we explicitly follow thechemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. we use our model to makepredictions for the properties of the galaxy population at low redshift andcompare them with various current observations. we find that our modelpredictions can match the luminosity functions of galaxies in various wavebandsredder than the u-band. the shape of the luminosity function at bright end iswell reproduced if galaxy mergers are modeled with the merger trees of subhalosand the steep faint-end slope can be moderated if the gas cooling time inlow-mass halos is comparable to the age of the universe. the model withsubhalos resolved can reproduce the main features in the observed color bimodaldistribution, though it still predicts too many bright blue galaxies. the samemodel can also match the color-magnitude relation for elliptical galaxies inclusters, the metallicity-luminosity relation.

astro-ph;0409240	correcting for the alias effect when measuring the power spectrum using  fft	because of mass assignment onto grid points in the measurement of the powerspectrum using the fast fourier transform (fft), the raw power spectrum $\la|\delta^f(k)|^2\ra$ estimated with fft is not the same as the true powerspectrum $p(k)$. in this paper, we derive the formula which relates $\la|\delta^f(k)|^2\ra$ to $p(k)$. for a sample of $n$ discrete objects, theformula reads: $\la |\delta^f(k)|^2\ra=\sum_{\vec n}[|w(\kalias)|^2p(\kalias)+1/n|w(\kalias)|^2]$, where $w(\vec k)$ is the fouriertransform of the mass assignment function $w(\vec r)$, $k_n$ is the nyquistwavenumber, and $\vec n$ is an integer vector. the formula is different fromthat in some of previous works where the summation over $\vec n$ is neglected.for the ngp, cic and tsc assignment functions, we show that the shot noise term$\sum_{\vec n} 1/n|w(\kalias)|^2]$ can be expressed by simple analyticalfunctions. to reconstruct $p(k)$ from the alias sum $\sum_{\vecn}|w(\kalias)|^2 p(\kalias)$, we propose an iterative method. we test themethod by applying it to an n-body simulation sample, and show that the methodcan successfully recover $p(k)$. the discussion is further generalized tosamples with observational selection effects.

astro-ph;0410114	galaxy occupation statistics of dark matter haloes: observational  results	we study the occupation statistics of galaxies in dark matter haloes usinggalaxy groups identified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey withthe halo-based group finder of yang et al. the occupation distribution isconsidered separately for early and late type galaxies, as well as in terms ofcentral and satellite galaxies. the mean luminosity of the central galaxiesscales with halo mass approximately as $l_c\propto m^{2/3}$ for haloes withmasses $m&lt;10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$, and as $l_c\propto m^{1/4}$ for more massivehaloes. the characteristic mass of $10^{13} h^{-1} \msun$ is consistent withthe mass scale where galaxy formation models suggest a transition fromefficient to inefficient cooling. another characteristic halo mass scale,$m\sim 10^{11} h^{-1}\msun$, which cannot be probed directly by our groups, isinferred from the conditional luminosity function (clf) that matches theobserved galaxy luminosity function and clustering. for a halo of given mass,the distribution of $l_c$ is rather narrow. the satellite galaxies are found tofollow a poissonian number distribution. the central galaxies in low-masshaloes are mostly late type galaxies, while those in massive haloes are almostall early types. we also measure the clf of galaxies in haloes of given mass.over the mass range that can be reliably probed with the present data ($13.3\lta {\rm log}[m/(h^{-1}\msun)] \lta 14.7$), the clf is reasonably well fit bya schechter function. contrary to recent claims based on semi-analytical modelsof galaxy formation, the presence of central galaxies does not show up as astrong peak at the bright end of the clf.

astro-ph;0502466	the phase-space parameters of brightest halo galaxies	the brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest atthe center of the halo. in this paper we test this `central galaxy paradigm'using group catalogues extracted from the 2dfgrs and the sdss. for each groupwe compute a parameter, r, defined as the difference between the velocity ofthe brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members(hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocitydispersion of the satellite galaxies. using detailed mock galaxy redshiftsurveys, we show that the central galaxy paradigm is inconsistent with the dataat high confidence, and that instead the brightest halo galaxies have aspecific kinetic energy that is about 25 percent of that of the satellites.this indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the darkmatter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, thatthe halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potentialwell. the former is consistent with the fact that we find a weak hint that thevelocity bias of brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes,while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matterhaloes. we discuss several implications of these findings, including massestimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halooccupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0503172	is the number of giant arcs in lcdm consistent with observations?	we use high-resolution n-body simulations to study the galaxy-clustercross-sections and the abundance of giant arcs in the $\lambda$cdm model.clusters are selected from the simulations using the friends-of-friends method,and their cross-sections for forming giant arcs are analyzed. the backgroundsources are assumed to follow a uniform ellipticity distribution from 0 to 0.5and to have an area identical to a circular source with diameter $1\arcsec$. wefind that the optical depth scales as the source redshift approximately as$\tau_{1''} = 2.25 \times 10^{-6}/[1+(\zs/3.14)^{-3.42}]$ ($0.6&lt;\zs&lt;7$). theamplitude is about 50% higher for an effective source diameter of $0.5\arcsec$.the optimal lens redshift for giant arcs with the length-to-width ratio ($l/w$)larger than 10 increases from 0.3 for $\zs=1$, to 0.5 for $\zs=2$, and to0.7-0.8 for $\zs&gt;3$. the optical depth is sensitive to the source redshift, inqualitative agreement with wambsganss et al. (2004). however, our overalloptical depth appears to be only $\sim$ 10% to 70% of those from previousstudies. the differences can be mostly explained by different power spectrumnormalizations ($\sigma_8$) used and different ways of determining the $l/w$ratio. finite source size and ellipticity have modest effects on the opticaldepth. we also found that the number of highly magnified (with magnification$|\mu|&gt;10$) and ``undistorted'' images (with $l/w&lt;3$) is comparable to thenumber of giant arcs with $|\mu|&gt;10$ and $l/w&gt;10$. we conclude that ourpredicted rate of giant arcs may be lower than the observed rate, although theprecise `discrepancy' is still unclear due to uncertainties both in theory andobservations.

astro-ph;0504477	the cross-correlation between galaxies and groups: probing the galaxy  distribution in and around dark matter haloes	we determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxygroups, using both the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we study the cross-correlation as a functionof group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. all thesecross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups inconsideration. on scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlationfunctions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. inparticular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massivegroups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. in the `1-halo' regime, thecross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the groupcenter. we consider both a luminosity-weighted center (lwc) and a centerdefined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (bgc). with the firstdefinition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to bemore centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. using thebgc, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, weonly find significant segregation in massive groups ($m \gta10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours orspecific star formation rates). in haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. comparing theresults from the 2dfgrs with those obtained from realistic mock samples, wefind that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated thandark matter haloes predicted by the current $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0509873	the dependence of clustering on galaxy properties	(abridged)we use a sample of ~200,000 galaxies drawn from the sloan digitalsky survey to study how clustering depends on properties such as stellar mass(m*), colour (g-r), 4000a break strength (d4000), concentration index (c), andstellar surface mass density (\mu_*). we find that more massive galaxiescluster more strongly than less massive galaxies, with the differenceincreasing above the characteristic stellar mass of the schechter massfunction. when divided by physical quantities, galaxies with redder colours,larger d4000, higher c and larger \mu_* cluster more strongly. the clusteringdifferences are largest on small scales and for low mass galaxies. at fixedstellar mass,the dependences of clustering on colour and 4000a break strengthare similar. different results are obtained when galaxies are split byconcentration or surface density. the dependence of w(r_p) on g-r and d4000extends out to physical scales that are significantly larger than those ofindividual dark matter haloes (&gt; 5 mpc/h). this large-scale clusteringdependence is not seen for the parameters c or \mu_*. on small scales (&lt; 1mpc/h), the amplitude of the correlation function is constant for ``young''galaxies with 1.1 &lt; d4000&lt; 1.5 and a steeply rising function of age for``older'' galaxies with d4000&gt;1.5. in contrast, the dependence of the amplitudeof w(r_p) on concentration on scales less than 1 mpc/h is strongest fordisk-dominated galaxies with c&lt;2.6. this demonstrates that different processesare required to explain environmental trends in the structure and in starformation history of galaxies.

astro-ph;0509874	the dependence of the pairwise velocity dispersion on galaxy properties	(abridged) we present measurements of the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd)for different classes of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey. for a sampleof about 200,000 galaxies, we study the dependence of the pvd on galaxyproperties such as luminosity, stellar mass (m_*), colour (g-r), 4000a breakstrength (d4000), concentration index (c), and stellar surface mass density(\mu_*). the luminosity dependence of the pvd is in good agreement with theresults of jing &amp; b\"orner (2004) for the 2dfgrs catalog. the value of\sigma_{12} measured at k=1 h/mpc decreases as a function of increasing galaxyluminosity for galaxies fainter than l*, before increasing again for the mostluminous galaxies in our sample. each of the galaxy subsamples selectedaccording to luminosity or stellar mass is divided into two further subsamplesaccording to colour, d4000, c and \mu_*. we find that galaxies with reddercolours and higher d4000, c, and \mu_* values have larger pvds on all scalesand at all luminosities/stellar masses. the dependence of the pvd on parametersrelated to recent star formation(colour, d4000) is stronger than on parametersrelated to galaxy structure (c, \mu_*), especially on small scales and forfaint galaxies. the reddest galaxies and galaxies with high surface massdensities and intermediate concentrations have the highest pairwise peculiarvelocities, i.e. these move in the strongest gravitational fields. we concludethat the faint red population located in rich clusters is responsible for thehigh pvd values that are measured for low-luminosity galaxies on small scales.

astro-ph;0512426	the influence of baryons on the clustering of matter and weak lensing  surveys	future weak lensing measurements of cosmic shear will reach such highaccuracy that second order effects in weak lensing modeling, like the influenceof baryons on structure formation, become important. we use a controlled set ofstate of the art cosmological simulations to quantify this effect by comparingpure n-body dark matter runs with corresponding hydrodynamical simulations,carried out both in non-radiative, and in dissipative form with cooling andstar formation. in both hydrodynamical simulations, the clustering of the gasis suppressed while that of dark matter is boosted at scales k&gt;1 h/mpc. despitethis counterbalance between dark matter and gas, the clustering of the totalmatter is suppressed by up to 1 percent at 1&lt;k&lt;10 h/mpc, while for k ~ 20 h/mpcit is boosted, up to 2 percent in the non-radiative run and 10 percent in therun with star formation. the stellar mass formed in the latter is highly biasedrelative to the dark matter in the pure n-body simulation. using our powerspectrum measurements to predict the effect of baryons on the weak lensingsignal at 100&lt;l&lt;10000, we find that baryons may change the lensing powerspectrum by less than 0.5 percent at l&lt;1000, but by 1 to 10 percent at1000&lt;l&lt;10000. the size of the effect exceeds the predicted accuracy of futurelensing power spectrum measurements and will likely be detected. precisedeterminations of cosmological parameters with weak lensing, and studies ofsmall-scale fluctuations and clustering, therefore rely on properly includingbaryonic physics.

astro-ph;0601040	the alignment between the distribution of satellites and the orientation  of their central galaxy	we use galaxy groups selected from the sloan digital sky survey to examinethe alignment between the orientation of the central galaxy (defined as thebrightest group member) and the distribution of satellite galaxies. byconstruction, we therefore only address the alignment on scales smaller thanthe halo virial radius. we find a highly significant alignment of satelliteswith the major axis of their central galaxy. this is in qualitative agreementwith the recent study of brainerd (2005), but inconsistent with severalprevious studies who detected a preferential minor axis alignment. thealignment strength in our sample is strongest between red central galaxies andred satellites. on the contrary, the satellite distribution in systems with ablue central galaxy is consistent with isotropic. we also find that thealignment strength is stronger in more massive haloes and at smaller projectedradii from the central galaxy. in addition, there is a weak indication thatfainter (relative to the central galaxy) satellites are more strongly aligned.we present a detailed comparison with previous studies, and discuss theimplications of our findings for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0601120	the dependence of the occupation of galaxies on the halo formation time	we study the dependence of the galaxy contents within halos on the haloformation time using two galaxy formation models, one being a semianalyticmodel utilizing the halo assembly history from a high resolution n-bodysimulation and the other being a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulationincluding radiative cooling, star formation, and energy feedback from galacticwinds. we confirm the finding by gao et al. that at fixed mass, the clusteringof halos depends on the halo formation time, especially for low-mass halos.this age dependence of halo clustering makes it desirable to study thecorrelation between the occupation of galaxies within halos and the halo age.we find that, in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies has astrong dependence on halo age, with fewer satellites in older halos. theyoungest one-third of the halos can have an order of magnitude more satellitesthan the oldest one-third. for central galaxies, in halos that form earlier,they tend to have more stars and thus appear to be more luminous, and thedependence of their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as that of stellarmass. the results can be understood through the star formation history in halosand the merging of satellites onto central galaxies. the age dependence of thegalaxy contents within halos would constitute an important ingredient in a moreaccurate halo-based model of galaxy clustering.

astro-ph;0601685	massive and red objects predicted by a semianalytical model of galaxy  formation	we study whether hierarchical galaxy formation in a concordance $\lambda$cdmuniverse can produce enough massive and red galaxies compared to theobservations. we implement a semi-analytical model in which the central blackholes gain their mass during major mergers of galaxies and the energy feedbackfrom active galaxy nuclei (agn) suppresses the gas cooling in their host halos.the energy feedback from agn acts effectively only in massive galaxies whensupermassive black holes have been formed in the central bulges. compared withprevious models without black hole formation, our model predicts more massiveand luminous galaxies at high redshift, agreeing with the observations of k20up to $z\sim 3$. also the predicted stellar mass density from massive galaxiesagrees with the observations of gdds. because of the energy feedback from agn,the formation of new stars is stopped in massive galaxies with the terminationof gas cooling and these galaxies soon become red with color $r-k&gt;$5 (vegamagnitude), comparable to the extremely red objects (eros) observed at redshift$z\sim$1-2. still the predicted number density of very eros is lower thanobserved at $z\sim 2$, and it may be related to inadequate descriptions of dustextinction, star formation history and agn feedback in those luminous galaxies.

astro-ph;0603557	smoothing algorithms and high-order singularities in gravitational  lensing	we propose a new smoothing method for obtaining surface densities fromdiscrete particle positions from numerical simulations. this is an essentialstep for many applications in gravitational lensing. this method is based onthe ``scatter'' interpretation of the discrete density field in the smoothedparticle hydrodynamics. we use monte carlo simulations of uniform densityfields and one isothermal ellipsoid to empirically derive the noise properties,and best smoothing parameters (such as the number of nearest neighbors used). acluster from high-resolution simulations is then used to assess the reality ofhigh-order singularities such as swallowtails and butterflies in caustics,which are important for the interpretation of substructures in gravitationallenses. we also compare our method with the delaunay tesselation fieldestimator using the galaxy studied by bradac et al. (2004), and find goodagreements. we show that higher order singularities are not only connected withbound subhaloes but also with the satellite streams. however, the presence ofhigh-order singularities are sensitive to not only the fluctuation amplitude ofthe surface density, but also the detailed form of the underlying smoothlensing potential (such as ellipticity and external shear).

astro-ph;0607552	weak lensing by galaxies in groups and clusters: i.--theoretical  expectations	galaxy-galaxy lensing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising means toaccurately measure the average relation between galaxy properties and halomass. in order to obtain a signal of sufficient signal-to-noise, one needs tostack many lens galaxies according to their property of interest, such asluminosity or stellar mass. since such a stack consists of both central andsatellite galaxies, which contribute very different lensing signals, theresulting shear measurements can be difficult to interpret. in the past,galaxy-galaxy lensing studies have either completely ignored this problem, haveapplied rough isolation criteria in an attempt to preferentially select`central' galaxies, or have tried to model the contribution of satellitesexplicitely. however, if one is able to {\it a priori} split the galaxypopulation in central and satellite galaxies, one can measure their lensingsignals separately. this not only allows a much cleaner measurement of therelation between halo mass and their galaxy populations, but also allows adirect measurement of the sub-halo masses around satellite galaxies. in thispaper, we use a realistic mock galaxy redshift survey to show that galaxygroups, properly selected from large galaxy surveys, can be used to accuratelysplit the galaxy population in centrals and satellites. stacking the resultingcentrals according to their group mass, estimated from the total groupluminosity, allows a remarkably accurate recovery of the masses and densityprofiles of their host haloes. in addition, stacking the correspondingsatellite galaxies according to their projected distance from the group centeryields a lensing signal that can be used to accurate measure the masses of bothsub-haloes and host haloes.

astro-ph;0607555	the influence of baryons on the mass distribution of dark matter halos	using a set of high-resolution n-body/sph cosmological simulations withidentical initial conditions but run with different numerical setups, weinvestigate the influence of baryonic matter on the mass distribution of darkhalos when radiative cooling is not included. we compare the concentrationparameters of about 400 massive halos with virial mass from $10^{13}$ \msun to$7.1 \times 10^{14}$ \msun. we find that the concentration parameters for thetotal mass and dark matter distributions in non radiative simulations are onaverage larger by ~3% and 10% than those in a pure dark matter simulation. ourresults indicate that the total mass density profile is little affected by ahot gas component in the simulations. after carefully excluding the effects ofresolutions and spurious two-body heating between dark matter and gasparticles, we conclude that the increase of the dark matter concentrationparameters is due to interactions between baryons and dark matter. wedemonstrate this with the aid of idealized simulations of two-body mergers. theresults of individual halos simulated with different mass resolutions show thatthe gas profiles of densities, temperature and entropy are subjects of massresolution of sph particles. in particular, we find that in the inner parts ofhalos, as the sph resolution increases the gas density becomes higher but boththe entropy and temperature decrease.

astro-ph;0608690	environmental dependence of cold dark matter halo formation	we use a high-resolution $n$-body simulation to study how the formation ofcold dark matter (cdm) halos is affected by their environments, and how suchenvironmental effects produce the age-dependence of halo clustering observed inrecent $n$-body simulations. we estimate, for each halo selected at redshift$z=0$, an `initial' mass $m_{\rm i}$ defined to be the mass enclosed by thelargest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the halo particles andwithin which the mean linear density is equal to the critical value forspherical collapse at $z=0$. for halos of a given final mass, $m_{\rm h}$, theratio $m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm h}$ has large scatter, and the scatter is larger forhalos of lower final masses. halos that form earlier on average have larger$m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm h}$, and so correspond to higher peaks in the initial densityfield than their final masses imply. old halos are more strongly clustered thanyounger ones of the same mass because their initial masses are larger. theage-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due to thedifference in the initial/final mass ratio. low-mass old halos are almostalways located in the vicinity of big structures, and their old ages arelargely due to the fact that their mass accretions are suppressed by the hotenvironments produced by the tidal fields of the larger structure. theage-dependence of clustering is weaker for more massive halos because theheating by large-scale tidal fields is less important.

(2004) for the hierarchical relation of three-point correlationfunctions of sdss galaxies. while the relations between b_1 and b_2 arequantitatively different for specific biasing models, their approximatelysimilar correlations indicate a fairly generic outcome of the biasing due tothe gravity in primordial gaussian density fields.

0809.1868	halo occupation distribution modeling of clustering of luminous red  galaxies	we perform halo occupation distribution (hod) modeling to interpretsmall-scale and intermediate-scale clustering of 35,000 luminous early-typegalaxies and their cross-correlation with a reference imaging sample of normall* galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey. the modeling results show thatmost of these luminous red galaxies (lrgs) are central galaxies residing inmassive halos of typical mass m ~ a few times 10^13 to 10^14 msun/h, while afew percent of them have to be satellites within halos in order to produce thestrong auto-correlations exhibited on smaller scales. the mean luminosity lc ofcentral lrgs increases with the host halo mass, with a rough scaling relationof lc \propto m^0.5. the halo mass required to host on average one satellitelrg above a luminosity threshold is found to be about 10 times higher than thatrequired to host a central lrg above the same threshold. we find that inmassive halos the distribution of l* galaxies roughly follows that of the darkmatter and their mean occupation number scales with halo mass as m^1.5. the hodmodeling results also allows for an intuitive understanding of thescale-dependent luminosity dependence of the cross-correlation between lrgs andl_* galaxies. constraints on the lrg hod provide tests to models of formationand evolution of massive galaxies, and they are also useful for cosmologicalparameter investigations. in one of the appendices, we provide lrg hodparameters with dependence on cosmology inferred from modeling the two-pointauto-correlation functions of lrgs.

astro-ph;0701130	the alignment between satellites and central galaxies: theory vs.  observations	recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies ispreferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy. thestrength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours ofthe satellite and central galaxies, and only weakly on the mass of the halo inwhich the galaxies reside. in this paper we study whether these alignmentsignals, and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties, can be reproducedin a hierarchical structure formation model of a $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. to that extent we use a large $n$-body simulation which we populatewith galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. we findthat if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that ofits dark matter halo, then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal ismuch stronger than observed. if, however, the minor axis of a central galaxy isperfectly aligned with the angular momentum vector of its dark matter halo, wecan accurately reproduce the observed alignment strength as function of halomass and galaxy color. although this suggests that the orientation of centralgalaxies is governed by the angular momentum of their dark matter haloes, weemphasize that any other scenario in which the minor axes of central galaxy andhalo are misaligned by $\sim 40^{\circ}$ (on average) will match the dataequally well. finally, we show that dependence of the alignment strength on thecolor of the central galaxy is most likely an artefact due to interlopers inthe group catalogue. the dependence on the color of the satellite galaxies, onthe other hand, is real and owes to the fact that red satellites are associatedwith subhaloes that were more massive at their time of accretion.

astro-ph;0701218	luminosity dependence of the spatial and velocity distributions of  galaxies: semi-analytic models versus the sloan digital sky survey	by comparing semi-analytic galaxy catalogues with data from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss), we show that current galaxy formation models reproducequalitatively the dependence of galaxy clustering and pairwise peculiarvelocities on luminosity, but some subtle discrepancies with the data stillremain. the comparisons are carried out by constructing a large set of mockgalaxy redshift surveys that have the same selection function as the sdss datarelease four (dr4). the mock surveys are based on two sets of semi-analyticcatalogues presented by croton et al. and kang et al. from the mock catalogues,we measure the redshift-space projected two-point correlation function, thepower spectrum, and the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd) in fourier space andin configuration space, for galaxies in different luminosity intervals. we thencompare these theoretical predictions with the measurements derived from thesdss dr4. on large scales and for galaxies brighter than l*, both sets of mockcatalogues agree well with the data. for fainter galaxies, however, both modelspredict stronger clustering and higher pairwise velocities than observed. wedemonstrate that this problem can be resolved if the fraction of faintsatellite galaxies in massive haloes is reduced by ~30% compared to the modelpredictions. a direct look into the model galaxy catalogues reveals that asignifcant fraction (15%) of faint galaxies ($-18&lt;m_{^{0.1}r}&lt;-17$) reside inhaloes with $m_{vir}&gt;10^{13}\msun$, and this population is predominantly red incolour. these faint red galaxies are responsible for the high pvd values oflow-luminosity galaxies on small scales.

astro-ph;9411045	substructures of clusters and cosmological models	we investigate, using high resolution n-body simulations, the densityprofiles and the morphologies of galaxy clusters in three models of structureformation. we show that these properties are closely related to the occurrenceof a significant merging event to a cluster in the recent past. the threemodels are: (1) the standard cdm model (scdm) with $\omega_0 = 1$,$\lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.5$; (2) a low-density flat model (lcdm) with$\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$; (3) a cdm dominated open model(ocdm) with $\omega_0=0.1$, $\lambda_0=0$. we find that the clusters in theocdm model have the steepest density profiles, their density contours are theroundest and show the smallest center shifts, among the three models. theclusters in the scdm model have contours that are most elongated and show thelargest center shifts, indicating the existence of frequent mergers in therecent past. the clusters in the lcdm model have density profiles and centershifts (in their density contours) similar to those in the scdm model, althoughthe density contours tend to be rounder. our results show that, although thedensity profiles and morphologies of clusters depend on models of structureformation, the lcdm model, which is currently considered as a successfulalternative to the scdm model, can do as well in producing a substantialfraction of clusters with substructures. this is in contrast to the conceptionthat this model may have serious problem in this aspect.

astro-ph;9412072	substructures and density profiles of clusters in models of galaxy  formation	in this paper we investigate, using high resolution n-body simulations, thedensity profiles and the morphologies of galaxy clusters in seven models ofstructure formation. we show that these properties of clusters are closelyrelated to the occurrence of a significant merging event in the recent past.the seven models are: (1) the standard cdm model (scdm) with $\omega_0 = 1$,$\lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.5$; (2) a low-density flat model (fl03) with$\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$; (3) an open model (op03) with$\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.75$; (4) a low-density flat model (fl02)with $\omega_0=0.2$, $\lambda_0=0.8$ and $h=1$; (5) an open model (op02) with$\omega_0=0.2$, $\lambda_0=0$ and $h=1$; (6) a low-density flat model (fl01)with $\omega_0=0.1$ and $\lambda_0=0.9$; (7) an open model (op01) with$\omega_0=0.1$ and $\lambda_0=0$. we find that the density profiles andmorphologies of clusters depend both on $\omega_0$ and on $\lambda_0$. for$\lambda_0=0$, these properties are a monotonic function of $\omega_0$.clusters in op01 have the steepest density profiles, their density contours arethe roundest and show the smallest center shifts. the other extreme case isscdm, where clusters show the least steep density profiles and the mostelongated contours. for a given $\omega_0$ ($&lt;1$), clusters in the flat model(i.e. with $\lambda_0=1-\omega_0$) have flatter density profiles and lesssubstructures than in the corresponding open model. in particular, our resultsshow that low-density flat models with $\omega_0\sim 0.3$, which are currentlyconsidered as a successful alternative to scdm, can produce a substantialfraction of clusters with substructures. this is in contrast to the conceptionthat this kind of models may have serious problem in this aspect.

astro-ph;9506134	three-point correlation function of galaxy clusters in cosmological  models: a strong dependence on triangle shape	in this paper, we use large $\pppm$ n-body simulations to study thethree-point correlation function $\zeta$ of clusters in two theoretical models.the first model (lcdm) is a low-density flat model of $\omega_0=0.3$,$\lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$, and the second model (pim) is aneinstein-de-sitter model with its linear power spectrum obtained fromobservations. we found that the scaled function $q(r,u,v)$, which is defined asthe ratio of $\zeta (r, ru, ru+rv)$ to the hierarchical sum $\xi (r)\xi (ru)+\xi (ru) \xi (ru+rv) +\xi (ru+rv)\xi (r)$ (where $\xi$ is the two-pointcorrelation function of clusters), depends weakly on $r$ and $u$, but verystrongly on $v$. $q(r,u,v)$ is about 0.2 at $v=0.1$ and 1.8 at $v=0.9$. a modelof $q(r,u,v)=\theta 10^{1.3v^2}$ can fit the data of $\zeta$ very nicely with$\theta\approx 0.14$. this model is found to be universal for the lcdm clustersand for the pim clusters. furthermore, $q(r,u,v)$ is found to be insensitive tothe cluster richness. we have compared our n-body results with simpleanalytical theories of cluster formation, like the peak theories or the localmaxima theories. we found that these theories do not provide an adequatedescription for the three-point function of clusters. we have also examined theobservational data of $\zeta$ presently available, and have not found anycontradiction between the observations and our model predictions. the$v$-dependence of $q$ in a projected catalogue of clusters is shown to be muchweaker than the $v$-dependence of $q$ found in the three-dimensional case. itwould be important to search for the $v$-dependence of $q$ in redshift samplesof rich clusters.

astro-ph;9508104	the velocity dispersion profiles of clusters of galaxies: a cosmological  test and the sampling effect	in this paper we investigate the velocity dispersion profiles of clusters ofgalaxies for seven cosmological models. one model is the scdm model, and theothers are six low-density models with the density parameter $\omega=0.1$, 0.2or 0.3 and with or without a cosmological constant $\lambda=1-\omega$. we findthat the velocity dispersion profiles depend both on $\omega$ and on $\lambda$.for $\lambda=0$, the profiles are steeper in a lower-$\omega$ model than in ahigher-$\omega$ one. the cosmological constant significantly weakens thedependence on $\omega$: the difference in the profile distributions between twoflat models is much smaller than that between the two corresponding open modelswith the same $\omega$. these results in principle can be used to constrain thecosmological parameters when a large sample of the velocity dispersion profilesis available. motivated by the practical situation that a sample of $\sim 100$clusters with $\sim 100$ measured redshifts per cluster is still the bestsample available in the foreseen future, we examine carefully to what degreethe cosmological parameters can be constrained with the velocity dispersionprofiles of such a sample of clusters. the limited sampling around clusters andthe limited number of clusters seriously degrade the discriminative power ofthe velocity dispersion profiles among cosmological models. we find that thefive models of $\omega\ge 0.2$ cannot be distinguished by this type ofobservation. due to the limited sampling, one should be very cautious inextracting information about the density profile and/or the dynamics aroundsingle clusters from the diluted velocity dispersion profiles

astro-ph;9602052	the correlation function of clusters of galaxies and the amplitude of  mass fluctuations in the universe	we show that if a sample of galaxy clusters is complete above some massthreshold, then hierarchical clustering theories for structure formationpredict its autocorrelation function to be determined purely by the clusterabundance and by the spectrum of linear density fluctuations. thus if the shapeof the initial fluctuation spectrum is known, its amplitude $\sigma_8$ can beestimated directly from the correlation length of a cluster sample in a waywhich is independent of the value of $\omega_0$. if the cluster masscorresponding to the sample threshold is also known, it provides an independentestimate of the quantity $\sigma_8\omega_0^{0.6}$. thus cluster data shouldallow both $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_0$ to be determined observationally. weexplore these questions using n-body simulations together with a simple butaccurate analytical model based on extensions of press-schechter theory.applying our results to currently available data we find that if the linearfluctuation spectrum has a shape similar to that suggested by the apm galaxysurvey, then a correlation length $r_0$ in excess of $20\mpch$ for abellclusters would require $\sigma_8&gt;1$, while $r_0&lt;15\mpch$ would require$\sigma_8&lt;0.5$. with conventional estimates of the relevant mass thresholdthese imply $\omega_0\la 0.3$ and $\omega_0\ga 1$ respectively.

astro-ph;9707106	spatial correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion of  galaxies: cdm models versus the las campanas survey	we show, with the help of large n-body simulations, that the real-spacetwo-point correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies canboth be measured reliably from the las campanas redshift survey. the real-spacecorrelation function is well fitted by the power law $\xi(r)=(r_0/r)^\gamma$with $r_0=(5.06\pm0.12)\mpc$ and $\gamma=1.862\pm 0.034$, and the pairwisevelocity dispersion at $1\mpc$ is $(570\pm 80)\kms$. a detailed comparisonbetween these observational results and the predictions of current cdmcosmogonies is carried out. we construct 60 mock samples for each theoreticalmodel from a large set of high resolution n-body simulations, which allows usto include various observational selection effects in the analyses and to useexactly the same methods for both real and theoretical samples. we demonstratethat such a procedure is essential in the comparison between models andobservations. the observed two-point correlation function is significantlyflatter than the mass correlation function in current cdm models on scales $\la1\mpc$. the observed pairwise velocity dispersion is also lower than that ofdark matter particles in these models. we propose a simple antibias model toexplain these discrepancies. this model assumes that the number of galaxies perunit dark matter mass, $n/m$, decreases with the mass of dark haloes. thepredictions of cdm models with $\sigma_8\omega_0^{0.6}\sim 0.4$-0.5 and$\omega_0 h\sim 0.2$ are in agreement with the observational results, if thetrend of $n/m$ with $m$ is at the level already observed for rich clusters ofgalaxies. thus cdm models with cluster-abundance normalization are consistentwith the observed correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion ofgalaxies. a high level of velocity bias is not required in these models.

astro-ph;9805202	accurate fitting formula for the two-point correlation function of the  dark matter halos	an accurate fitting formula is reported for the two-point correlationfunction of the dark matter halos in hierarchical clustering models, it isvalid for the the linearly clustering regime, and its accuracy is about 10% inthe correlation amplitude for the halos with mass m greater than 1/100 --1/1000 of the characteristic non-linear mass m_c. the result is found on thebasis of a careful analysis for a large set of scale-free simulations with 17million particles. the fitting formula has a weak explicit dependence on theindex n of the initial power spectrum, but can be equally well applied to thecold dark matter (cdm) cosmological models if the effective index n_{eff} ofthe cdm power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass replaces the index n. theformula agrees with the analytical formula of mo &amp; white (mw96) for massivehalos with m&gt;m_c, but the mw96 formula significantly underpredicts thecorrelation for the less massive halos. the difference between the fitting andthe analytical formulae amounts to a factor =&gt; 2 in the correlation amplitudefor m=0.01 m_c. one of the most interesting applications of this fittingformula would be the clustering of galaxies since the majority of halos hostinggalaxies satisfies m&lt;&lt; m_c.

0706.0262	spatial and kinematic alignments between central and satellite halos	based on a cosmological n-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematicalignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group sizehost halos (rvir). we measure three different types of spatial alignment: haloalignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (gcs) andthe distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation ofa satellite and the direction towards its gcs, and direct alignment between theorientation of the gcs and that of its satellites. in analogy we use thedirections of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connectingline between satellite and gcs, the halo velocity alignment between theorientation of the gcs and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignmentbetween the satellites orientations and their velocities. we find thatsatellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the gcs within atleast 6 rvir (the range probed here). furthermore, satellites preferentiallypoint towards the gcs. the most pronounced signal is detected on small scalesbut a detectable signal extends out to 6 rvir. the direct alignment signal isweaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances &lt; 2 rvir. allvelocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. our results suggestthat the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure whichextends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. in contrast, the maincontribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of thesatellite orientations in the group tidal field. the projected data reveal goodagreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys.

0811.0828	accurate universal models for the mass accretion histories and  concentrations of dark matter halos	a large amount of observations have constrained cosmological parameters andthe initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy. however,cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of the powerspectrum varies with mass scale dramatically in the so-called concordancelambda cdm cosmology. thus, any successful model for its structural evolutionshould work well simultaneously for various cosmological models and differentpower spectra. we use a large set of high-resolution n-body simulations of avariety of structure formation models (scale-free, standard cdm, open cdm, andlambda cdm) to study the mass accretion histories (mahs), the mass and redshiftdependence of concentrations and the concentration evolution histories of darkmatter halos. we find that there is significant disagreement between themuch-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. according totwo simple but tight correlations we find from the simulation results, wedevelop new empirical models for both the mahs and the concentration evolutionhistories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to predict themass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. these models are accurateand universal: the same set of model parameters works well for differentcosmological models and for halos of different masses at different redshiftsand the model predictions are highly accurate even when the histories aretraced to very high redshift. these models are also simple and easy toimplement. a web calculator and a user-friendly code to make the relevantcalculations are available from http://www.shao.ac.cn/dhzhao/mandc.html . weexplain why lambda cdm halos on nearly all mass scales show two distinct phasesin their evolution histories.

0811.1995	alignment between galaxies and large-scale structure	based on the sloan digital sky survey dr6 (sdss) and millennium simulation(ms) we investigate the alignment between galaxies and large-scale structure.for this purpose we develop two new statistical tools, namely the alignmentcorrelation function and the cos(2theta)-statistic. the former is atwo-dimensional extension of the traditional two-point correlation function andthe latter is related to the ellipticity correlation function used for cosmicshear measurements. both are based on the cross correlation between a sample ofgalaxies with orientations and a reference sample which represents thelarge-scale structure. applied to the sdss galaxy catalog the alignmentcorrelation function reveals an overabundance of reference galaxies along themajor axes of red, luminous (l &gt; l*) galaxies out to projected separations of60 mpc/h. no alignment signal is detected for blue galaxies. thecos(2\theta)-statistic yields very similar results. starting from a mssemi-analytic galaxy catalog we assign an orientation to each red, luminous andcentral galaxy, based on the central region of the host halo. alternatively, weuse the orientation of the host halo itself. we find a mean projectedmisalignment between a halo and its central region of ~25 deg. agreement withthe sdss results is good if the central orientations are used. using the haloorientations overestimates the observed alignment by more than a factor of 2.the large volume of the ms allows to generate two-dimensional maps of thealignment correlation function which show the reference galaxy distribution tobe flattened parallel to the orientations of red luminous galaxies with axisratios of ~0.5 and ~0.75 for halo and central orientations,respectively. theseratios are almost independent of scale out to 60 mpc/h.

0811.3558	the distribution of ejected subhalos and its implication for halo  assembly bias	using a high-resolution cosmological $n$-body simulation, we identify theejected population of subhalos, which are halos at redshift $z=0$ but were oncecontained in more massive `host' halos at high redshifts. the fraction of theejected subhalos in the total halo population of the same mass ranges from 9%to 4% for halo masses from $\sim 10^{11}$ to $\sim 10^{12}\msun$. most of theejected subhalos are distributed within 4 times the virial radius of theirhosts. these ejected subhalos have distinct velocity distribution around theirhosts in comparison to normal halos. the number of subhalos ejected from a hostof given mass increases with the assembly redshift of the host. ejectedsubhalos in general reside in high-density regions, and have a much higher biasparameter than normal halos of the same mass. they also have earlier assemblytimes, so that they contribute to the assembly bias of dark matter halos seenin cosmological simulations. however, the assembly bias is {\it not} dominatedby the ejected population, indicating that large-scale environmental effects onnormal halos are the main source for the assembly bias.
