0911.3408	type iib supernovae with compact and extended progenitors	the classic example of a type iib supernova is sn 1993j, which had a coolextended progenitor surrounded by a dense wind. there is evidence for anothercategory of type iib supernova which has a more compact progenitor with a lowerdensity, probably fast, wind. distinguishing features of the compact categoryare: weak optical emission from the shock heated envelope at early times;nonexistent or very weak h emission in the late nebular phase; rapidly evolvingradio emission; rapid expansion of the radio shell; and expected nonthermal asopposed to thermal x-ray emission. type iib supernovae that have one or more ofthese features include sne 1996cb, 2001ig, 2003bg, 2008ax, and 2008bo. all ofthese with sufficient radio data (the last four) show evidence for presupernovawind variability. we estimate a progenitor envelope radius ~1e11 cm for sn2008ax, a value consistent with a compact wolf-rayet progenitor. supernovae inthe sn 1993j extended category include sn 2001gd and probably the cas asupernova. we suggest that the compact type iib events be designated type ciiband the extended ones type eiib. the h envelope mass dividing these categoriesis ~0.1 msun.

1005.1932	radio and x-ray observations of the type ic sn 2007gr reveal an  ordinary, non-relativistic explosion	we present extensive radio and x-ray observations of the nearby type ic sn2007gr in ngc 1058 obtained with the very large array and the chandra x-rayobservatory and spanning 5 to 150 days after explosion. through our detailedmodeling of these data, we estimate the properties of the blastwave and thecircumstellar environment. we find evidence for a freely-expanding andnon-relativistic explosion with an average blastwave velocity, v~0.2c, and atotal internal energy for the radio emitting material of e ~ 2 x 10^46 ergassuming equipartition of energy between electrons and magnetic fields(epsilon_e=epsilon_b=0.1). the temporal and spectral evolution of the radioemission points to a stellar wind-blown environment shaped by a steadyprogenitor mass loss rate of mdot ~ 6 x 10^-7 solar masses per year (windvelocity, v_w=10^3 km/s). these parameters are fully consistent with thoseinferred for other sne ibc and are in line with the expectations for anordinary, homologous sn explosion. our results are at odds with those of paragiet al. (2010) who recently reported evidence for a relativistic blastwave in sn2007gr based on their claim that the radio emission was resolved away in a lowsignal-to-noise very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) observation. here weshow that the exotic physical scenarios required to explain the claimedrelativistic velocity -- extreme departures from equipartition and/or a highlycollimated outflow -- are excluded by our detailed very large array radioobservations. moreover, we present an independent analysis of the vlbi data andpropose that a modest loss of phase coherence provides a more naturalexplanation for the apparent flux density loss which is evident on both shortand long baselines. we conclude that sn 2007gr is an ordinary type ibcsupernova.

1005.4682	disentangling the origin and heating mechanism of supernova dust:  late-time spitzer spectroscopy of the type iin sn 2005ip	this paper presents late-time near-infrared and {\it spitzer} mid-infraredphotometric and spectroscopic observations of warm dust in the type iin sn2005ip in ngc 2906. the spectra show evidence for two dust components withdifferent temperatures. spanning the peak of the thermal emission, theseobservations provide strong constraints on the dust mass, temperature, andluminosity, which serve as critical diagnostics for disentangling the originand heating mechanism of each component. the results suggest the warmer dusthas a mass of $\sim 5 \times 10^{-4}~$\msolar, originates from newly formeddust in the ejecta, or possibly the cool, dense shell, and is continuouslyheated by the circumstellar interaction. by contrast, the cooler componentlikely originates from a circumstellar shock echo that forms from the heatingof a large, pre-existing dust shell $\sim 0.01 - 0.05$~\msolar~by the late-timecircumstellar interaction. the progenitor wind velocity derived from the blueedge of the he 1 1.083 \micron~p cygni profile indicates a progenitor eruptionlikely formed this dust shell $\sim$100 years prior to the supernova explosion,which is consistent with a luminous blue variable (lbv) progenitor star.

1101.1111	shock breakout in dense mass loss: luminous supernovae	we examine the case where a circumstellar medium around a supernova issufficiently opaque that a radiation dominated shock propagates in thecircumstellar region. the initial propagation of the shock front into thecircumstellar region can be approximated by a self-similar solution thatdetermines the radiative energy in a shocked shell; the eventual escape of thisenergy gives the maximum luminosity of the supernova. if the circumstellardensity is described by \rho=dr^{-2} out to a radius r_w, where d is aconstant, the properties of the shock breakout radiation depend on r_w andr_d\equiv\kappa dv_{sh}/c, where \kappa is the opacity and v_{sh} is the shockvelocity. if r_w&gt;r_d, the rise to maximum light begins at ~ r_d/v_{sh}; theduration of the rise is also ~ r_d/v_{sh}; the outer parts of the opaque mediumare extended and at low velocity at the time of peak luminosity; and a denseshell forms whose continued interaction with the dense mass loss gives acharacteristic flatter portion of the declining light curve. if r_w&lt;r_d, therise to maximum light begins at r_w/v_{sh}; the duration of the rise isr_w^2/v_{sh}r_d; the outer parts of the opaque medium are not extended and areaccelerated to high velocity by radiation pressure at the time of maximumluminosity; and a dense shell forms but does not affect the light curve nearmaximum. we argue that sn 2006gy is an example of the first kind of event,while sn 2010gx and related supernovae are examples of the second.

1104.5012	a spitzer survey for dust in type iin supernovae	recent observations suggest that type iin supernovae (sne iin) may exhibitlate-time (&gt;100 days) infrared (ir) emission from warm dust more than othertypes of core-collapse sne. mid-ir observations, which span the peak of thethermal spectral energy distribution, provide useful constraints on theproperties of the dust and, ultimately, the circumstellar environment,explosion mechanism, and progenitor system. due to the low sn iin rate (&lt;10% ofall core-collapse sne), few ir observations exist for this subclass. thehandful of isolated studies, however, show late-time ir emission from warm dustthat, in some cases, extends for five or six years post-discovery. whileprevious spitzer/irac surveys have searched for dust in sne, none have targetedthe type iin subclass. this article presents results from a warm spitzer/iracsurvey of the positions of all 68 known sne iin within a distance of 250 mpcbetween 1999 and 2008 that have remained unobserved by spitzer more than 100days post-discovery. the detection of late-time emission from ten targets(~15%) nearly doubles the database of existing mid-ir observations of sne iin.although optical spectra show evidence for new dust formation in some cases,the data show that in most cases the likely origin of the mid-ir emission ispre-existing dust, which is continuously heated by optical emission generatedby ongoing circumstellar interaction between the forward shock andcircumstellar medium. furthermore, an emerging trend suggests that these snedecline at ~1000--2000 days post-discovery once the forward shock overruns thedust shell. the mass-loss rates associated with these dust shells areconsistent with luminous blue variable (lbv) progenitors.

1109.1752	pulsar wind nebulae with thick toroidal structure	we investigate a class of pulsar wind nebulae that show synchrotron emissionfrom a thick toroidal structure. the best studied such object is the smallradio and x-ray nebula around the vela pulsar, which can be interpreted as theresult of interaction of a mildly supersonic inward flow with the recent pulsarwind. such a flow near the center of a supernova remnant can be produced in atransient phase when the reverse shock reaches the center of the remnant. othernebulae with a thick toroidal structure are g106.6+2.9 and g76.9+1.0. theirstructure contrasts with young pulsar nebulae like the crab nebula and 3c 38,which show a more chaotic, filamentary structure in the synchrotron emission.in both situations, a torus-jet structure is present where the pulsar windpasses through a termination shock, indicating the flow is initially toroidal.we suggest that the difference is due to the rayleigh-taylor instability thatoperates when the outer boundary of the nebula is accelerating into freelyexpanding supernova ejecta. the instability gives rise to mixing in the craband related objects, but is not present in the nebulae with thick toroidalregions.

1201.0994	evla observations constrain the environment and progenitor system of  type ia supernova 2011fe	we report unique evla observations of sn 2011fe representing the mostsensitive radio study of a type ia supernova to date. our data place directconstraints on the density of the surrounding medium at radii ~10^15-10^16 cm,implying an upper limit on the mass loss rate from the progenitor system ofmdot &lt;~ 6 x 10^-10 msol/yr (assuming a wind speed of 100 km/s), or expansioninto a uniform medium with density n_csm &lt;~ 6 cm^-3. drawing from the observedproperties of non-conservative mass transfer among accreting white dwarfs, weuse these limits on the density of the immediate environs to exclude a phasespace of possible progenitors systems for sn 2011fe. we rule out a symbioticprogenitor system and also a system characterized by high accretion rate ontothe white dwarf that is expected to give rise to optically-thick accretionwinds. assuming that a small fraction, 1%, of the mass accreted is lost fromthe progenitor system, we also eliminate much of the potential progenitorparameter space for white dwarfs hosting recurrent novae or undergoing stablenuclear burning. therefore, we rule out the most popular single degenerateprogenitor models for sn 2011fe, leaving a limited phase space inhabited bysome double degenerate systems and exotic progenitor scenarios.

1201.5120	radio observations reveal unusual circumstellar environments for some  type ibc supernova progenitors	we present extensive radio observations of the nearby type ibc supernovae2004cc, 2004dk, and 2004gq spanning 8-1900 days after explosion. using adynamical model developed for synchrotron emission from a slightly deceleratedshockwave, we estimate the velocity and energy of the fastest ejecta and thedensity profile of the circumstellar medium. the shockwaves of all threesupernovae are characterized by non-relativistic velocities of v ~ (0.1-25)cand associated energies of e ~ (2-10) * 1e47 erg, in line with the expectationsfor a typical homologous explosion. smooth circumstellar density profiles areindicated by the early radio data and we estimate the progenitor mass lossrates to be ~ (0.6-13) * 1e-5 m_sun/yr (wind velocity 10^3 km/s). theseestimates approach the saturation limit (~1e-4 m_sun/yr) for line-driven windsfrom wolf-rayet stars, the favored progenitors of sne ibc including thoseassociated with long-duration grbs. intriguingly, at later epochs all threesupernovae show evidence for abrupt radio variability that we attribute tolarge density modulations (factor of ~3-6) at circumstellar radii of r ~ (1-50)* 1e16 cm. if due to variable mass loss, these modulations are associated withprogenitor activity on a timescale of ~ 10-100 years before explosion. weconsider these results in the context of variable mass loss mechanismsincluding wind clumping, metallicity-independent continuum-driven ejections,and binary-induced modulations. it may also be possible that the sn shockwavesare dynamically interacting with wind termination shocks, however, thisrequires the environment to be highly pressurized and/or the progenitor to berapidly rotating prior to explosion. the proximity of the density modulationsto the explosion sites may suggest a synchronization between unusual progenitormass loss and the sn explosion, reminiscent of type iin supernovae.

1201.5581	x-rays from supernova shocks in dense mass loss	type iin and related supernovae show evidence for an interaction with a densecircumstellar medium that produces most of the supernova luminosity. x-rayemission from shock heated gas is crucial for the energetics of the interactionand can provide diagnostics on the shock interaction. provided that the shockis at an optical depth tau_w\la c/v_s in the wind, where c is the speed oflight and v_s is the shock velocity, a viscous shock is expected that heats thegas to a high temperature. for tau_w\ga 1, the shock wave is in the coolingregime; inverse compton cooling dominates bremsstrahlung at higher densitiesand shock velocities. although tau_w\ga 1, the optical depth through theemission zone is \la 1 so that inverse compton effects do not give rise tosignificant x-ray emission. the electrons may not reach energy equipartitionwith the protons at higher shock velocities. as x-rays move out through thecool wind, the higher energy photons are lost to compton degradation. ifbremsstrahlung dominates the cooling and compton losses are small, theenergetic radiation can completely photoionize the preshock gas. however,inverse compton cooling in the hot region and compton degradation in the windreduce the ionizing flux, so that complete photoionization is not obtained andphotoabsorption by the wind further reduces the escaping x-ray flux. weconjecture that the combination of these effects led to the low observed x-rayflux from the optically luminous sn 2006gy.

1203.1614	strong evolution of x-ray absorption in the type iin supernova sn 2010jl	we report two epochs of chandra-acis x-ray imaging spectroscopy of the nearbybright type iin supernova sn 2010jl, taken around 2 months and then a yearafter the explosion. the majority of the x-ray emission in both the spectra ischaracterized by a high temperature ($\ga 10$ kev) and is likely to be from theforward shocked region resulting from circumstellar interaction. the absorptioncolumn density in the first spectrum is high, ~ 10^{24} cm^{-2}, more than 3orders of magnitude higher than the galactic absorption column, and weattribute it to absorption by circumstellar matter. in the second epochobservation, the column density has decreased by a factor of 3, as expected forshock propagation in the circumstellar medium. the unabsorbed 0.2-10 kevluminosity at both epochs is ~7 x 10^{41} erg/s. the 6.4 kev fe line clearlypresent in the first spectrum is not detected in the second spectrum. thestrength of the fluorescent line is roughly that expected for the columndensity of circumstellar gas, provided the fe is not highly ionized. there isalso evidence for an absorbed power law component in both the spectra, which weattribute to a background ultraluminous x-ray source.

1204.3300	common envelope evolution leading to supernovae with dense interaction	a variety of supernova events, including type iin supernovae andultraluminous supernovae, appear to have lost up to solar masses of theirenvelopes in 10's to 100's of years leading up to the explosion. in order toexplain the close timing of the mass loss and supernova events, we explore thepossibility that the mass loss is driven by common envelope evolution of acompact object (neutron star or black hole) in the envelope of a massive starand the supernova is triggered by the inspiral of the compact object to thecentral core of the companion star. the expected rate of such events is smallerthan the observed rate of type iin supernovae but the rates may agree withinthe uncertainties. the mass loss velocity is related to the escape velocityfrom the common envelope system and is comparable to the observed velocity of100's of km s$^{-1}$ in type iin events. the mass loss is expected to be densernear the equatorial plane of the binary system and there is good evidence thatthe circumstellar media in type iin supernovae are asymmetric. some of thesesupernova types show evidence for energies in excess of the canonical $10^{51}$ergs, which might be the result of explosions from rapid accretion onto acompact object through a disk.

1204.3913	particle transport in young pulsar wind nebulae	the model for pulsar wind nebulae (pwne) as the result of themagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) downstream flow from a shocked, relativistic pulsarwind has been successful in reproducing many features of the nebulae observedclose to the central pulsars. however, observations of well-studied youngnebulae like the crab nebula, 3c 58, and g21.5--0.9 do not show the toroidalmagnetic field on a larger scale that might be expected in the mhd flow model;in addition, the radial variation of spectral index due to synchrotron lossesis smoother than expected in the mhd flow model. we find that pure diffusionmodels can reproduce the basic data on nebular size and spectral indexvariation for the crab, 3c 58, and g21.5--0.9. most of our models use an energyindependent diffusion coefficient; power law variations of the coefficient withenergy are degenerate with variation in the input particle energy distributionindex in the steady state, transmitting boundary case. energy dependentdiffusion is a possible reason for the smaller diffusion coefficient inferredfor the crab. monte carlo simulations of the particle transport allowing foradvection and diffusion of particles suggest that diffusion dominates over muchof the total nebular volume of the crab. advection dominates close to thepulsar and is likely to play a role in the x-ray half-light radius. the sourceof diffusion and mixing of particles is uncertain, but may be related to therayleigh-taylor instability at the outer boundary of a young pwn or toinstabilities in the toroidal magnetic field structure.

1205.0250	radio and x-ray observations of sn 2006jd: another strongly interacting  type iin supernova	we report four years of radio and x-ray monitoring of the type iin supernovasn 2006jd at radio wavelengths with the very large array, giant metrewave radiotelescope and expanded very large array; at x-ray wavelengths with {\emchandra}, {\em xmm-newton} and {\em swift}-xrt. we assume that the radio andx-ray emitting particles are produced by shock interaction with a densecircumstellar medium. the radio emission shows an initial rise that can beattributed to free-free absorption by cool gas mixed into the nonthermalemitting region; external free-free absorption is disfavored because of theshape of the rising light curves and the low gas column density inferred alongthe line of sight to the emission region. the x-ray luminosity implies apreshock circumstellar density $\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at a radius $r\sim 2\times10^{16}$ cm, but the column density inferred from the photoabsorption of x-raysalong the line of sight suggests a significantly lower density. the implicationmay be an asymmetry in the interaction. the x-ray spectrum shows fe lineemission at 6.9 kev that is stronger than is expected for the conditions in thex-ray emitting gas. we suggest that cool gas mixed into the hot gas plays arole in the line emission. our radio and x-ray data both suggest the densityprofile is flatter than $r^{-2}$ because of the slow evolution of theunabsorbed emission.

1403.6825	a mid-life crisis? sudden changes in radio and x-ray emission from  supernova 1970g	supernovae provide a backdrop from which we can probe the end state ofstellar evolution in the final years before the progenitor star explodes. asthe shock from the supernova expands, the timespan of mass loss history we areable to probe also extends, providing insight to rapid time-scale processesthat govern the end state of massive stars. while supernovae transition intoremnants on timescales of decades to centuries, observations of this phase arecurrently limited. here we present observations of sn 1970g, serendipitouslyobserved during the monitoring campaign of sn 2011fe that shares the same hostgalaxy. utilizing the new jansky very large array upgrade and a deep x-rayexposure taken by the chandra space telescope, we are able to recover thismiddle-aged supernova and distinctly resolve it from the hii cloud with whichit is associated. we find that the flux density of sn 1970g has changedsignificantly since it was last observed - the x-ray luminosity has increasedby a factor of ~3, while we observe a significantly lower radio flux of only27.5 micro-jy at 6.75 ghz, a level only detectable through the upgrades now inoperation at the jansky very large array. these changes suggest that sn 1970ghas entered a new stage of evolution towards a supernova remnant, and we may bedetecting the turn-on of the pulsar wind nebula. deep radio observations ofadditional middle-aged supernovae with the improved radio facilities willprovide a statistical census of the delicate transition period betweensupernova and remnant.

1510.07662	a deep search for prompt radio emission from thermonuclear supernovae  with the very large array	searches for circumstellar material around type ia supernovae (sne ia) areone of the most powerful tests of the nature of sn ia progenitors, and radioobservations provide a particularly sensitive probe of this material. here wereport radio observations for sne ia and their lower-luminosity thermonuclearcousins. we present the largest, most sensitive, and spectroscopically diversestudy of prompt (delta t &lt;~ 1 yr) radio observations of 85 thermonuclear sne,including 25 obtained by our team with the unprecedented depth of the karl g.jansky very large array. with these observations, sn 2012cg joins sn 2011fe andsn 2014j as a sn ia with remarkably deep radio limits and excellent temporalcoverage (six epochs, spanning 5--216 days after explosion, yielding mdot/v_w&lt;~ 5 x 10^-9 m_sun/yr / (100 km/s), assuming epsilon_b = 0.1 and epsilon_e =0.1).  all observations yield non-detections, placing strong constraints on thepresence of circumstellar material. we present analytical models for thetemporal and spectral evolution of prompt radio emission from thermonuclear sneas expected from interaction with either wind-stratified or uniform densitymedia. these models allow us to constrain the progenitor mass loss rates, withlimits ranging from mdot &lt;~ 10^-9--10^-4 m_sun/yr, assuming a wind velocityv_w=100 km/s. we compare our radio constraints with measurements of galacticsymbiotic binaries to conclude that &lt;~10% of thermonuclear sne have red giantcompanions.

0807.3555	near-infrared photometry of the type iin sn 2005ip: the case for dust  condensation	near-infrared photometric observations of the type iin sn 2005ip in ngc 2906reveal large fluxes (&gt;1.3 mjy) in the k_s-band over more than 900 days. whilewarm dust can explain the late-time k_s-band emission of sn 2005ip, the natureof the dust heating source is ambiguous. shock heating of pre-existing dust bypost-shocked gas is unlikely because the forward shock is moving too slowly tohave traversed the expected dust-free cavity by the time observations firstreveal the k_s emission. while an infrared light echo model correctly predictsa near-infrared luminosity plateau, heating dust to the observed temperaturesof ~1400-1600 k at a relatively large distance from the supernova (&gt; 10^{18}cm) requires an extraordinarily high early supernova luminosity (~1 x 10^{11}l_solar). the evidence instead favors condensing dust in the cool, dense shellbetween the forward and reverse shocks. both the initial dust temperature andthe evolutionary trend towards lower temperatures are consistent with thisscenario. we infer that radiation from the circumstellar interaction heats thedust. while this paper includes no spectroscopic confirmation, the photometryis comparable to other sne that do show spectroscopic evidence for dustformation. observations of dust formation in sne are sparse, so these resultsprovide a rare opportunity to consider sne type iin as dust sources.

astro-ph;0002374	observations of the crab nebula and its pulsar in the far-ultraviolet  and in the optical	we present hst/stis far-uv observations of the crab nebula and its pulsar.broad, blueshifted absorption arising in the nebula is seen in c iv 1550,reaching about 2500 km/s. this can be interpreted as evidence for a fast outershell, and we adopt a spherically symmetric model to constrain the propertiesof this. we find that the density appears to decrease outward in the shell. alower limit to the mass is 0.3 solar masses with an accompanying kinetic energyof 1.5ee{49} ergs. a massive 10^{51} erg shell cannot be excluded, but is lesslikely if the density profile is much steeper than r^{-4} and the velocity is&lt;6000 km/s. the observations cover the region 1140-1720 a. with the time-tagmode of the spectrograph we obtain the pulse profile. it is similar to that inthe near-uv, although the primary peak is marginally narrower. together withthe near-uv data, and new optical data from not, our spectrum of the pulsarcovers the entire region from 1140-9250 a. dereddening the spectrum gives aflat spectrum for e(b-v)=0.52, r=3.1. this dereddened spectrum of the crabpulsar can be fitted by a power law with spectral index alpha_{\nu} = 0.11 +/-0.04. the main uncertainty is the amount and characteristics of the interstel-lar reddening, and we have investigated the dependence of \alpha_{\nu} one(b-v) and r. in the extended emission covered by our 25" x 0.5" slit in thefar-uv, we detect c iv 1550 and he ii 1640 emission lines from the crab nebula.several interstellar absorption lines are detected toward the pulsar. the lyalpha absorption indicates a column density of 3.0+/-0.5\ee{21} cm^{-2} ofneutral hydrogen, which agrees well with our estimate of e(b-v)=0.52 mag. otherlines show no evidence of severe depletion of metals in atomic gas.

astro-ph;0005105	instabilities and clumping in type ia supernova remnants	we present two-dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations inspherical polar coordinates of a type ia supernova interacting with a constantdensity interstellar medium. the ejecta are assumed to be freely expanding withan exponential density profile. the interaction gives rise to a double-shockedstructure susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities. the rayleigh-taylorinstability initially grows, but the kelvin-helmholtz instability takes over,producing vortex rings. the nonlinear instability initially evolves towardlonger wavelengths and eventually fades away when the reverse shock front is inthe flatter part of the supernova density distribution. based on observationsof x-ray knots and the protrusion in the southeast outlin of tycho's supernovaremnant, we include clumping in the ejecta. the clump interaction with thereverse shock induces rayleigh-taylor and kelvin-helmholtz instabilities on theclump surface that facilitate fragmentation. in order to survive crushing andto have a bulging effect on the forward shock, the clump's initial densityratio to the surrounding ejecta must be at least 100 for the conditions intycho's remnant. the 56ni bubble effect may be important for the development ofclumpiness in the ejecta. the observed presence of an fe clump would thenrequire a non-radioactive origin for this fe, possibly 54fe. the large radialdistance of the x-ray emitting si and s ejecta from the remnant centerindicates that they were initially in clumps.

astro-ph;0006029	young circumstellar disks near evolved massive stars and supernovae	there is increasing evidence that low mass stars with circumstellar disks canbe born close to massive stars, in some cases within tenths of a pc. if thedisks have lifetimes greater than those of the more massive stars, they areexposed to the radiation fields and gas flows from the late evolutionary phasesand supernovae of the massive stars. the fast flows from supernovae are likelyto give some stripping of mass from the disks, but do not typically lead tocomplete disruption of the disks. in the slow wind from a red supergiant star,there is the possibility of gravitational accretion of wind matter onto thecircumstellar disk. in the supernova explosion of a red supergiant, theradiative flux at the time of shock breakout can heat and ionize a nearby disk,leading to transient, narrow line emission. there are consequences for thesolar nebula if it was born ~0.2 pc from a massive star that became a redsupergiant. accretion from the wind could supply a substantial amount of 26alto the disk. the high radiative luminosity of the eventual supernova could leadto the melting of dust grains and the formation of chondrules. the passage ofthe supernova ejecta could drive a shock wave in the disk, heating it.

astro-ph;0006030	implications of the x-ray properties of pulsar nebulae	a plausible model for the crab nebula is one in which a particle dominated,highly relativistic wind from the pulsar passes through a shock front in whichthe particles attain a power law energy distribution. the electrons andpositrons lose energy radiating synchrotron emission. here, a one zone versionof the model is developed and applied to observations of x-ray pulsar nebulae.efficient conversion of pulsar spin-down power to x-ray luminosity is expectedif the observed electrons are in the synchrotron cooling regime and theirenergy spectrum is similar to that in the crab nebula. in this case, therelation between x-ray luminosity and pulsar spin-down power depends onlyweakly on the model parameters. the dependence is stronger for a steeperparticle spectrum, as appears to be present in n157b, and the efficiency ofx-ray production can be lower. if the electrons are not in the cooling regime,the x-ray luminosity can be low, as appears to be the case for the compactnebula around the vela pulsar. slow cooling is likely to be caused by asub-equipartition magnetic field in the radiating region. observations canplace constraints on the uncertain physics of relativistic mhd shocks. themodel is related to those developed for gamma-ray burst afterglows.

astro-ph;0107076	pulsar wind nebulae in evolved supernova remnants	for pulsars similar to the one in the crab nebula, most of the energy inputto the surrounding wind nebula occurs on a timescale of less than 1000 years;during this time, the nebula expands into freely expanding supernova ejecta. ona timescale 10,000 years, the interaction of the supernova with the surroundingmedium drives a reverse shock front toward the center of the remnant, where itcrushes the pwn (pulsar wind nebula). one- and two-dimensional, two-fluidsimulations of the crushing and re-expansion phases of a pwn show that (1)these phases are subject to rayleigh-taylor instabilities that result in themixing of thermal and nonthermal fluids, and (2) asymmetries in the surroundinginterstellar medium give rise to asymmetries in the position of the pwnrelative to the pulsar and explosion site. these effects are expected to beobservable in the radio emission from evolved pwn because of the long lifetimesof radio emitting electrons. the scenario can explain the chaotic andasymmetric appearance of the vela x pwn relative to the vela pulsar withoutrecourse to a directed flow from the vicinity of the pulsar. the displacementof the radio nebulae in g327.1--1.1, msh15--56 (g326.3--1.8), g0.9+0.1, and w44relative to the x-ray nebulae may be due to this mechanism. on timescales muchgreater than the nebular crushing time, the initial pwn may be mixed withthermal gas and become unobservable, so that even the radio emission isdominated by recently injected particles.

astro-ph;0107110	the nature of the compact supernova remnants in starburst galaxies	radio observations of starburst regions in galaxies have revealed groups ofcompact nonthermal sources that may be radiative supernova remnants expandingin the interclump medium of molecular clouds. because of the high pressure instarburst regions, the interclump medium may have a density ~ 10^3 h atomscm^{-3} in a starburst nucleus like m82 and ~ 10^4 h atoms cm^{-3} in anultraluminous galaxy like arp 220. in m82, our model can account for the sizes,the slow evolution, the high radio luminosities, and the low x-ray luminositiesof the sources. we predict expansion velocities ~ 500 km/s, which is slowerthan the one case measured by vlbi techniques. although we predict the remnantsto be radiative, the expected radiation is difficult to detect because it is atinfrared wavelengths and the starburst is itself very luminous; one detectionpossibility is broad [oi] 63 micron line emission at the positions of the radioremnants. the more luminous and compact remnants in arp 220 can be accountedfor by the higher molecular cloud density. in our model, the observed remnantslose most of the supernova energy to radiation. other explosions in a lowerdensity medium may directly heat a hot, low density interstellar component,leading to the superwinds that are associated with starburst regions.

astro-ph;0110002	interaction models for grb afterglows	we review interaction models for grb afterglows, with an eye on constrainingthe nature of their progenitors and the geometry of explosion. evidence ispresented for two types of progenitors. the radio afterglow of grb 980425/sn1998bw and the multi-frequency observations of grb 970508 can be fitted by ablast wave expanding into a wind-type medium, pointing to a massive starprogenitor. the broadband afterglow data of grbs 990123 and 990510 are bettermodeled by a jet expanding into a constant-density medium, implying a compactstar merger origin. among other well observed grbs, the jet model appears to bemore widely applicable than the wind model, although some cases are ambiguous.the model fits often require a deviation of the energy distribution of theradiating electrons from the commonly assumed single power-law form,particularly for sources with a rapid decline and/or pronounced steepening inthe optical light curves. transition to non-relativistic evolution has beensuggested as an alternative explanation for the light curve steepening,although to produce steepening on the order of days or less would require veryhigh ambient densities, which are generally difficult to reconcile with radioobservations. major open issues include the hydrodynamics of jet-ambient mediuminteraction, a self-consistent determination of the electron energydistribution, and the effects of pair production on the early afterglows whichare expected to be particularly large for the wind interaction model.

astro-ph;0111373	bullets in a core collapse supernova remnant: the vela remnant	we use two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to investigate theproperties of dense ejecta clumps (bullets) in a core collapse supernovaremnant, motivated by the observation of protrusions probably caused by clumpsin the vela supernova remnant. the ejecta, with an inner flat and an outersteep power law density distribution, were assumed to freely expand into anambient medium with a constant density, $\sim 0.1$ h atoms cm$^{-3}$ for thecase of vela. at an age of $10^4$ yr, the reverse shock front is expected tohave moved back to the center of the remnant. ejecta clumps with an initialdensity contrast $\chi \sim 100$ relative to their surroundings are found to berapidly fragmented and decelerated. in order to cause a pronounced protrusionon the blast wave, as observed in the vela remnant, $\chi \sim 1000$ may berequired. in this case, the clump should be near the inflection point in theejecta density profile, at an ejecta velocity $\sim 3000 \kms $. these resultsapply to moderately large clumps; smaller clumps would require an even largerdensity contrast. clumps can create ring structure in the shell of the velaremnant and we investigate the possibility that rx j0852--4622, an apparentsupernova remnant superposed on vela, is actually part of the vela shell. radioobservations support this picture, but the possible presence of a compactobject argues against it. the ni bubble effect or compression in a pulsar windnebula are possible mechanisms to produce the clumping.

astro-ph;0201295	interactions between pulsars, pulsar nebulae and supernova remnants	the crab nebula is likely to be expanding into freely expanding supernovaejecta, although the energy in the ejecta may be less than is typical for atype ii supernova. pulsar nebulae much younger than the crab have not beenfound and could have different properties. the search for such nebulae throughultraviolet/optical line emission in core collapse supernovae, or through theirx-ray emission (which could show strong absorption) is warranted. neutron starshave now been found in many young supernova remnants. there is not a clear linkbetween neutron star and remnant type, although there is an indication thatnormal pulsars avoid the o-rich remnants. in the later phases of a supernovaremnant, the pulsar wind nebula is crushed by the reverse shock front. recentsimulations show that this process is unstable, which can lead to mixing of thethermal and relativistic gases, and that the pulsar nebula is easily displacedfrom the pulsar, which can explain the position of the vela pulsar relative tothe vela x radio nebula.

astro-ph;0303650	wind-interaction models for the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts:  the case of grb 021004	wind-interaction models for gamma-ray burst afterglows predict that theoptical emission from the reverse shock drops below that from the forward shockwithin 100s of seconds of the burst. the typical frequency $\nu_m$ of thesynchrotron emission from the forward shock passes through the optical bandtypically on a timescale of minutes to hours. before the passage of $\nu_m$,the optical flux evolves as $t^{-1/4}$ and after the passage, the decaysteepens to $t^{-(3p-2)/4}$, where $p$ is the exponent for the assumedpower-law energy distribution of nonthermal electrons and is typically $\sim2$. the steepening in the slope of temporal decay should be readilyidentifiable in the early afterglow light curves. we propose that such asteepening was observed in the r-band light curve of grb 021004 around day 0.1.available data at several radio frequencies are consistent with thisinterpretation, as are the x-ray observations around day~1. the early evolutionof grb 021004 contrasts with that of grb 990123, which can be described byemission from interaction with a constant density medium.

astro-ph;0409013	young core collapse supernova remnants and their supernovae	massive star supernovae can be divided into four categories depending on theamount of mass loss from the progenitor star and the star's radius: redsupergiant stars with most of the h envelope intact (sn iip), stars with some hbut most lost (iil, iib), stars with all h lost (ib, ic), and blue supergiantstars with a massive h envelope (sn 1987a-like). various aspects of theimmediate aftermath of the supernova are expected to develop in different waysdepending on the supernova category: mixing in the supernova, fallback on thecentral compact object, expansion of any pulsar wind nebula, interaction withcircumstellar matter, and photoionization by shock breakout radiation. theobserved properties of young supernova remnants allow many of them to be placedin one of the supernova categories; all the categories are represented exceptfor the sn 1987a-like type. of the remnants with central pulsars, the pulsarproperties do not appear to be related to the supernova category. there is noevidence that the supernova categories form a mass sequence, as would beexpected in a single star scenario for the evolution. models for young pulsarwind nebulae expanding into supernova ejecta indicate initial pulsar periods of10-100 ms and approximate equipartition between particle and magnetic energies.ages are obtained for pulsar nebulae, including an age of 2400 pm 500 yr for3c58, which is not consistent with an origin in sn 1181. there is no evidencethat mass fallback plays a role in neutron star properties.

astro-ph;0509468	radio and x-ray emission as probes of type iip supernovae and red  supergiant mass loss	type iip (plateau) supernovae are thought to come from stars with initialmass about 8-25 solar masses that end their lives as red supergiants. theexpected stellar end points can be found from evolutionary calculations and thecorresponding mass loss properties at this point can be estimated from typicalvalues for galactic stars. the mass loss densities of observed supernovae canbe estimated from observations of the thermal x-ray and radio synchrotronemission that result from the interaction of the supernova with the surroundingwind. type iip supernovae are expected to have energy-conserving interactionduring typical times of observation. because type iip supernovae have anextended period of high optical luminosity, compton cooling can affect theradio emitting electrons, giving rise to a relatively flat radio light curve inthe optically thin regime. alternatively, a high efficiency of magnetic fieldproduction results in synchrotron cooling of the radio emitting electrons. boththe x-ray and radio luminosities are sensitive to the mass loss and initialmasses of the progenitor stars, although the turn-on of radio emission isprobably the best estimator of circumstellar density. both the mass lossdensity and the variation of density with stellar mass are consistent withexpectations for the progenitor stars deduced from direct observations ofrecent supernovae. current observations are consistent with mass being the onlyparameter; observations of a supernova in a metal poor region might show howthe mass loss depends on metallicity.

astro-ph;0607196	circumstellar emission from type ib and ic supernovae	the presumed wolf-rayet star progenitors of type ib/c supernovae have fast,low density winds and the shock waves generated by the supernova interactionwith the wind are not expected to be radiative at typical times of observation.the injected energy spectrum of radio emitting electrons typically has anobserved index p=3, which is suggestive of acceleration in cosmic ray dominatedshocks. the early, absorbed part of the radio light curves can be attributed tosynchrotron self-absorption, which leads to constraints on the magnetic fieldin the emitting region and on the circumstellar density. the range ofcircumstellar densities inferred from the radio emission is somewhat broaderthan that for galactic wolf-rayet stars, if similar efficiencies of synchrotronemission are assumed in the extragalactic supernovae. for the observed andexpected ranges of circumstellar densities to roughly overlap, a highefficiency of magnetic field production in the shocked region is required(epsilon_b ~ 0.1). for the expected densities around a wolf-rayet star, anonthermal mechanism is generally required to explain the observed x-rayluminosities of type ib/c supernovae. although the inverse compton mechanismcan explain the observed x-ray emission from sn 2002ap if the wind parametersare taken from the radio model, the mechanism is not promising for othersupernovae unless the postshock magnetic energy density is much smaller thanthe electron energy density. in some cases another mechanism is definitelyneeded and we suggest that it is x-ray synchrotron emission in a case where theshock wave is cosmic ray dominated so that the electron energy spectrumflattens at high energy. more comprehensive x-ray observations of a type ib/csupernova are needed to determine whether this suggestion is correct.

astro-ph;0703468	optical signatures of circumstellar interaction in type iip supernovae	we propose new diagnostics for circumstellar interaction in type iipsupernovae by the detection of high velocity (hv) absorption features in halphaand he i 10830 a lines during the photospheric stage. to demonstrate themethod, we compute the ionization and excitation of h and he in supernovaejecta taking into account time-dependent effects and x-ray irradiation. wefind that the interaction with a typical red supergiant wind should result inthe enhanced excitation of the outer layers of unshocked ejecta and theemergence of corresponding hv absorption, i.e. a depression in the blueabsorption wing of halpha and a pronounced absorption of he i 10830 a at aradial velocity of about -10,000 km/s. we identify hv absorption in halpha andhe i 10830 a lines of sn 1999em and in halpha of sn 2004dj as being due to thiseffect. the derived mass loss rate is close to 10^{-6} msun/yr for bothsupernovae, assuming a wind velocity 10 km/s. we argue that, in addition to thehv absorption formed in the unshocked ejecta, spectra of sn 2004dj and sn1999em show a hv notch feature that is formed in the cool dense shell (cds)modified by the rayleigh-taylor instability. the cds results from both shockbreakout and radiative cooling of gas that has passed through the reverse shockwave. the notch becomes dominant in the hv absorption during the latephotospheric phase, ~60 d. the wind density deduced from the velocity of thecds is consistent with the wind density found from the hv absorption producedby unshocked ejecta.

astro-ph;0703788	high resolution spectroscopy of the line emission from the inner  circumstellar ring of sn 1987a and its hot spots	we discuss high resolution vlt/uves observations (fwhm ~ 6 km/s) from october2002 (day ~5700 past explosion) of the shock interaction of sn 1987a and itscircumstellar ring. a nebular analysis of the narrow lines from the unshockedgas indicates gas densities of (1.5-5.0)e3 cm-3 and temperatures of 6.5e3-2.4e4k. this is consistent with the thermal widths of the lines. from the shockedcomponent we observe a large range of ionization stages from neutral lines to[fe xiv]. from a nebular analysis we find that the density in the lowionization region is 4e6-1e7 cm-3. there is a clear difference in the highvelocity extension of the low ionization lines and that of lines from [fex-xiv], with the latter extending up to ~ -390 km/s in the blue wing for [fexiv], while the low ionization lines extend to typically ~ -260 km/s. forh-alpha a faint extension up to ~ -450 km/s can be seen probably arising from asmall fraction of shocked high density clumps. we discuss these observations inthe context of radiative shock models, which are qualitatively consistent withthe observations. a fraction of the high ionization lines may originate in gaswhich has yet not had time to cool down, explaining the difference in widthbetween the low and high ionization lines. the maximum shock velocities seen inthe optical lines are ~ 510 km/s. we expect the maximum width of especially thelow ionization lines to increase with time.

astro-ph;9601137	axisymmetric circumstellar interaction in supernovae	multiwavelength observations of type ii supernovae have shown evidence forthe interaction of supernovae with the dense slow winds from the red supergiantprogenitor stars. observations of planetary nebulae and the nebula around sn1987a show that the slow winds from extended stars frequently have an axisymme-tric structure with a high density in the equatorial plane. we have carried outnumerical calculations of the interaction of a supernova with such an axisymme-tric density distribution. for small values of the angular density gradient atthe pole, the asymmetry in the interaction shell is greater than, but close to,that expected from purely radial motion. if the angular density gradient isabove a moderate value, the flow qualitatively changes and a protrusion emergesalong the axis. for a power-law supernova density profile, the flow approachesa self-similar state in which the protrusion length is $2-4$ times the radiusof the main shell. the critical density gradient is larger for steeper densityprofiles of the ejecta. most of our calculations are axisymmetric, but we havecarried out a 3-dimensional calculation to show that the protrusion is not anumerical artifact along the symmetry axis. for typical supernova parameters,the protrusions take $\gtrsim$ several years to develop. the appearance of theshell with protrusions is similar to that observed in vlbi radio images of theremnant 41.9 +58 in m82 and, possibly, of sn 1986j. we also considered thepossibility of asymmetric ejecta and found that it had a relatively smalleffect on the asymmetry of the interaction region.

astro-ph;9903483	radio supernova sn 1998bw and its relation to grb 980425	sn 1998bw is an unusual type ic supernova that may be associated with the$\gamma$-ray burst grb 980425. we use a synchrotron self-absorption model forits radio emission to deduce that the synchrotron-emitting gas is expandinginto a circumstellar medium of approximately $r^{-2}$ density profile, at aspeed comparable to the speed of light. we assume that the efficiencies ofproduction of relativistic electrons and magnetic field are constant throughthe evolution. the circumstellar density is consistent with that expectedaround the massive star core thought to be the progenitor of sn 1998bw. theexplosion energy in material moving with velocity $&gt;0.5c$ is $\sim 10^{49}-3\times 10^{50}$ ergs, with some preference for the high values. the rise inthe radio light curves observed at days 20-40 is inferred to be the result of arise in the energy of the blast wave by a factor $\sim 2.5$. interaction with ajump in the ambient density is not consistent with the observed evolution. weinfer that the boost in energy is from a shell of matter from the explosionthat catches up with the decelerating shock front. both the high explosionenergy and the nature of the energy input to the blast wave are difficult toreconcile with energy input from the shock-accelerated high velocity ejectafrom a supernova. the implication is that there is irregular energy input froma central engine, which is the type of model invoked for normal $\gamma$-raybursts. the link between sn 1998bw and grb 980425 is thus strengthened.

astro-ph;9908272	wind interaction models for gamma-ray burst afterglows: the case for two  types of progenitors	beginning with the $\gamma$-ray bursts grb 970228 and grb 970508, a standardmodel for the interpretation of grb afterglows emerged involving synchrotronemission from a constant energy blast wave expanding into a constant density,``interstellar'' medium. however, a massive star origin for grbs implies astellar wind environment, probably a wolf-rayet star, and we have previouslysuggested wind interaction models for the afterglows of grbs 980326, 980519,and 980425/sn 1998bw. here, we extend the theory of afterglows in winds,considering strong cooling phases, the transition to nonrelativistic motion,jets, and prompt, reverse shock emission. we find that, compared to theinterstellar case, the optical prompt emission in the wind case could have acomparable magnitude, but would die off faster. we examine the afterglows ofother well-observed grbs in the context of wind interaction models, and findthat grbs 970228 and 970508 are likely wind interactors. the revision in thenonthermal afterglow emission from grb 970228 caused by the recognition of latesupernova emission favors wind interaction. the radio evolution of grb 970508provides especially strong evidence for wind interaction. for grb 970508, theobservations suggest a density that is compatible with that expected in awolf-rayet star wind. finally, observations of the afterglow evolution of grbs990123 and 990510 and the prompt optical emission from grb 990123 favorinterstellar interaction models, which would suggest compact star mergerprogenitors for these objects.

0810.2661	time evolution of the line emission from the inner circumstellar ring of  sn 1987a and its hot spots	we present seven epochs between october 1999 and november 2007 of highresolution vlt/uves echelle spectra of the ejecta-ring collision of sn 1987a.the fluxes of most of the narrow lines from the unshocked gas decreased by afactor of 2-3 during this period, consistent with the decay from the initialionization by the shock break-out. however, [o iii] in particular shows anincrease up to day ~6800. this agrees with radiative shock models where thepre-shocked gas is heated by the soft x-rays from the shock. the line emissionfrom the shocked gas increases rapidly as the shock sweeps up more gas. we findthat the neutral and high ionization lines follow the evolution of the balmerlines roughly, while the intermediate ionization lines evolve less rapidly. upto day ~6800, the optical light curves have a similar evolution to that of thesoft x-rays. the break between day 6500 and day 7000 for [o iii] and [ne iii]is likely due to recombination to lower ionization levels. nevertheless, theevolution of the [fe xiv] line, as well as the lines from the lowest ionizationstages, continue to follow that of the soft x-rays, as expected. there is aclear difference in the line profiles between the low and intermediateionization lines, and those from the coronal lines at the earlier epochs. thisshows that these lines arise from regions with different physical conditions,with at least a fraction of the coronal lines coming from adiabatic shocks. atlater epochs the line widths of the low ionization lines, however, increase andapproach those of the high ionization lines of [fe x-xiv]. the h-alpha lineprofile can be traced up to ~500 km/s at the latest epoch. this is consistentwith the cooling time of shocks propagating into a density of (1-4)x10^4 cm-3.

0706.0461	what gamma-ray bursts explode into	the association of long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with type ib/c supernovaeimplies that they explode into the winds of their wolf-rayet progenitor stars.although the evolution of some grb afterglows is consistent with expansion intoa free wind, there is also good evidence for expansion into a constant densitymedium. the evidence includes the evolution of x-ray afterglows (when x-raysare below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break opticaland x-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. recentobservations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with aconstant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model.although radio observations do not support the constant density model for longbursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong.the most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is toshock the progenitor wind. this requires a smaller termination shock than wouldbe expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitorvelocity, or the particular evolution leading to a grb. however, the need forthe termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausiblyaccomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binaryprogenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.
