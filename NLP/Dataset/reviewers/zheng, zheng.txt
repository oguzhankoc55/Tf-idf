0902.1748	interpreting the clustering of distant red galaxies	we analyze the angular clustering of z~2.3 distant red galaxies (drgs)measured by quadri et al 2008. we find that, with robust estimates of themeasurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution modeling, themeasured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, incontrast to previous results. however, in order to fit the strong break inw(theta) at theta=10 arcsec, nearly all satellite galaxies in the drgluminosity range are required to be drgs. within this luminosity-thresholdsample, the fraction of galaxies that are drgs is ~44%, implying that theformation of drgs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for centralgalaxies. despite the evolved stellar populations contained within drgs atz=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the drg luminosity range have been accretedwithin 500 myr. thus, satellite drgs must have known they would becomesatellites well before the time of their accretion. this implies that theformation of drgs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass,although the large-scale bias of drgs can be well fit without such assumptions.further data are required to resolve this issue. using the observationalestimate that ~30% of drgs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescalefor star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 myr, although theuncertainty on this number is large. however, unless all non-star formingsatellite drgs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale issignificantly shorter than z~0 estimates. down to the completeness limit of thequadri et al sample, we find that the halo masses of central drgs are ~50%higher than non-drgs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halomasses the central galaxies are drgs only ~2/3 of the time.

0904.4257	primordial non-gaussianity from lamost surveys	the primordial non-gaussianity (png) in matter density perturbation is a verypowerful probe of the physics of the very early universe. the local png caninduce a distinct scale-dependent bias on the large scale structuredistribution of galaxies and quasars, which could be used for constraining it.we study the detection limits on png from the surveys of the lamost telescope.the cases of the main galaxy survey, the luminous red galaxy (lrg) survey, andthe quasar survey of different magnitude limits are considered. we find thatthe main1 sample (i.e. the main galaxy survey with one magnitude deeper thanthe sdss main galaxy survey, or r&lt;18.8) could only provide very weak constrainton png. for the main2 sample (r&lt;19.8) and the lrg survey, the 2\sigma (95.5%)limit on the png parameter f_{nl} are |f_{nl}|&lt;145 and |f_{nl}|&lt;114respectively, comparable to the current limit from cosmic microwave background(cmb) data. the quasar survey could provide much more stringent constraint, andwe find that the 2\sigma limit for |f_{nl}| is between 50 and 103, depending onthe magnitude limit of the survey. with planck-like priors on cosmologicalparameters, the quasar survey with g&lt;21.65 would improve the constraints to|f_{nl}|&lt;43 (2\sigma). we also discuss the possibility of further tighteningthe constraint by using the relative bias method proposed by seljak(2008).

0907.0704	lyman-alpha emission from cosmic structure i: fluorescence	we present predictions for the fluorescent lyman-alpha emission signaturearising from photoionized, optically thick structures in smoothed particlehydrodynamic (sph) cosmological simulations of a lambda-cdm universe using amonte carlo lyman-alpha radiative transfer code. we calculate the expectedlyman-alpha image and 2-dimensional spectra for gas exposed to a uniformultraviolet ionizing background as well as gas exposed additionally to thephotoionizing radiation from a local quasar, after correcting for theself-shielding of hydrogen. as a test of our numerical methods and forapplication to current observations, we examine simplified analytic structuresthat are uniformly or anisotropically illuminated. we compare these resultswith recent observations. we discuss future observing campaigns on largetelescopes and realistic strategies for detecting fluorescence owing to theambient metagalactic ionization and in regions close to bright quasars. whileit will take hundreds of hours on the current generation of telescopes todetect fluorescence caused by the ultraviolet background (uvb) alone, ourcalculations suggest that of order ten sources of quasar-induced fluorescentlyman-alpha emission should be detectable after a 10 hour exposure in a 10arcmin^2 field around a bright quasar. these observations will help probe thephysical conditions in the densest regions of the intergalactic medium as wellas the temporal light curves and isotropy of quasar radiation.

0910.2712	radiative transfer modeling of lyman alpha emitters. i. statistics of  spectra and luminosity	we combine a cosmological reionization simulation with box size of 100mpc/hon a side and a monte carlo lyman-alpha (lya) radiative transfer code to modellyman alpha emitters (laes) at z~5.7. the model introduces lya radiativetransfer as the single factor for transforming the intrinsic lya emissionproperties into the observed ones. spatial diffusion of lya photons fromradiative transfer results in extended lya emission and only the central partwith high surface brightness can be observed. because of radiative transfer,the appearance of laes depends on density and velocity structures incircumgalactic and intergalactic media as well as the viewing angle, whichleads to a broad distribution of apparent (observed) lya luminosity for a givenintrinsic lya luminosity. radiative transfer also causes frequency diffusion oflya photons. the resultant lya line is asymmetric with a red tail. the peak ofthe lya line shifts towards longer wavelength and the shift is anti-correlatedwith the apparent to intrinsic lya luminosity ratio. the simple radiativetransfer model provides a new framework for studying laes. it is able toexplain an array of observed properties of z~5.7 laes in ouchi et al. (2008),producing lya spectra, morphology, and apparent lya luminosity function (lf)similar to those seen in observation. the broad distribution of apparent lyaluminosity at fixed uv luminosity provides a natural explanation for theobserved uv lf, especially the turnover towards the low luminosity end. themodel also reproduces the observed distribution of lya equivalent width (ew)and explains the deficit of uv bright, high ew sources. because of the broaddistribution of the apparent to intrinsic lya luminosity ratio, the modelpredicts effective duty cycles and lya escape fractions for laes.

1003.4990	radiative transfer modeling of lyman alpha emitters. ii. new effects in  galaxy clustering	we study the clustering properties of z~5.7 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) in acosmological reionization simulation with a full lya radiative transfercalculation. lya radiative transfer substantially modifies the intrinsic lyaemission properties, compared to observed ones, depending on the density andvelocity structure environment around the lya emitting galaxy. thisenvironment-dependent lya selection introduces new features in lae clustering,suppressing (enhancing) the line-of-sight (transverse) density fluctuations andgiving rise to scale-dependent galaxy bias. in real space, the contours of thethree-dimensional two-point correlation function of laes appear to beprominently elongated along the line of sight on large scales, an effect thatis opposite to and much stronger than the linear redshift-space distortioneffect. the projected two-point correlation function is greatly enhanced inamplitude by a factor of up to a few, compared to the case without theenvironment dependent selection effect. the new features in lae clustering canbe understood with a simple, physically motivated model, where lya selectiondepends on matter density, velocity, and their gradients. we discuss theimplications and consequences of the effects on galaxy clustering from lyaselection in interpreting clustering measurements and in constraining cosmologyand reionization from laes.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1010.3017	extended lyman-alpha emission around star-forming galaxies	lyman-alpha (lya) photons that escape the interstellar medium of star-forminggalaxies may be resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms in thecircumgalactic and intergalactic media, thereby increasing the angular extentof the galaxy's lya emission. we present predictions of this extended, lowsurface brightness lya emission based on radiative transfer modeling in acosmological reionization simulation. the extended emission can be detectedfrom stacked narrowband images of lya emitters (laes) or of lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). its average surface brightness profile has a central cusp,then flattens to an approximate plateau beginning at an inner characteristicscale below ~0.2 mpc (comoving), then steepens again beyond an outercharacteristic scale of ~1 mpc. the inner scale marks the transition fromscattered light of the central source to emission from clustered sources, whilethe outer scale marks the spatial extent of scattered emission from theseclustered sources. both scales tend to increase with halo mass, uv luminosity,and observed lya luminosity. the extended emission predicted by our simulationis already within reach of deep narrowband photometry using large ground-basedtelescopes. such observations would test radiative transfer models of emissionfrom laes and lbgs, and they would open a new window on the circumgalacticenvironment of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.

1102.1437	the halo occupation distribution of black holes: dependence on mass	we investigate the halo occupation distribution (hod) of black holes within ahydrodynamic cosmological simulation that directly follows black hole growth.similar to the hod of galaxies/subhalos, we find that the black hole occupationnumber can be described by the form n_bh proportional to 1+ (m_host)^alphawhere alpha evolves mildly with redshift indicating that a given mass halo(m_host) at low redshift tends to host fewer bhs than at high redshift (asexpected as a result of galaxy and bh mergers). we further divide theoccupation number into contributions from black holes residing in central andsatellite galaxies within a halo. the distribution of m_bh within halos tendsto consist of a single massive bh (distributed about a peak mass stronglycorrelated with m_host), and a collection of relatively low-mass secondary bhs,with weaker correlation with m_host. we also examine the spatial distributionof bhs within their host halos, and find they typically follow a power-lawradial distribution (i.e. much more centrally concentrated than the subhalodistribution). finally, we characterize the host mass for which bh growth isfeedback dominated (e.g. star formation quenched). we show that halos withm_host &gt; 3 * 10^12 m_sun have primary bhs that are feedback dominated by z~3with lower mass halos becoming increasingly more affected at lower redshift.

1104.0389	the growth of galaxy stellar mass within dark matter halos	we study the evolution of stellar mass in galaxies as a function of host halomass, using the "mpa" and "durham" semi-analytic models, implemented on themillennium run simulation. the results from both models are similar. we findthat about 45% of the stellar mass in central galaxies in present-day halosless massive than ~10^{12} msun/h is already in place at z~1. this fractionincreases to ~65% for more massive halos. the peak of star formation efficiencyshifts toward lower mass halos from z~1 to z~0. the stellar mass in low-masshalos grows mostly by star formation since z~1, while in high-mass halos mostof the stellar mass is assembled by mergers. these trends are clear indicationsof "halo downsizing". we compare our findings to the results of thephenomenological method developed by zheng, coil &amp; zehavi (2007). thetheoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with these results,however there are large discrepancies. the most significant one concerns theamount of stars already in place in the progenitor galaxies at z~1, which isabout a factor of two larger in both semi-analytic models. we also use thesemi-analytic catalogs to test different assumptions made in that work, andillustrate the importance of smooth accretion of dark matter when estimatingthe mergers contribution. we demonstrate that methods studying galaxy evolutionfrom the galaxy-halo connection are powerful in constraining theoretical modelsand can guide future efforts of modeling galaxy evolution. conversely,semi-analytic models serve an important role in improving such methods.

1104.3550	the halo occupation distribution of active galactic nuclei	using a fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that self-consistentlyincorporates the growth and feedback of supermassive black holes and thephysics of galaxy formation, we examine the effects of environmental factors(e.g., local gas density, black hole feedback) on the halo occupationdistribution of low luminosity active galactic nuclei (agn). we decompose themean occupation function into central and satellite contribution and computethe conditional luminosity functions (clf). the clf of the central agn followsa log-normal distribution with the mean increasing and scatter decreasing withincreasing redshifts. we analyze the light curves of individual agn and showthat the peak luminosity of the agn has a tighter correlation with halo masscompared to instantaneous luminosity. we also compute the clf of satellite agnat a given central agn luminosity. we do not see any significant correlationbetween the number of satellites with the luminosity of the central agn at afixed halo mass. we also show that for a sample of agn with luminosity above10^42 ergs/s the mean occupation function can be modeled as a softened stepfunction for central agn and a power law for the satellite population. theradial distribution of agn inside halos follows a power law at all redshiftswith a mean index of -2.33 +/- 0.08. incorporating the environmental dependenceof supermassive black hole accretion and feedback, our formalism provides atheoretical tool for interpreting current and future measurements of agnclustering.

1107.4367	the kinematics of multiple-peaked ly-alpha emission in star-forming  galaxies at z~2-3	we present new results on the ly-alpha emission-line kinematics of 18 z~2-3star-forming galaxies with multiple-peaked ly-alpha profiles. with our largespectroscopic database of uv-selected star-forming galaxies at these redshifts,we have determined that ~30% of such objects with detectable ly-alpha emissiondisplay multiple-peaked emission profiles. these profiles provide additionalconstraints on the escape of ly-alpha photons due to the rich velocitystructure in the emergent line. despite recent advances in modeling the escapeof ly-alpha from star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, comparisons betweenmodels and data are often missing crucial observational information. using keckii nirspec spectra of h-alpha (z~2) and [oiii] 5007 (z~3), we have measuredaccurate systemic redshifts, rest-frame optical nebular velocity dispersionsand emission-line fluxes for the objects in the sample. accurate systemicredshifts allow us to translate the multiple-peaked ly-alpha profiles intovelocity space, revealing that the majority (11/18) display double-peakedemission straddling the velocity-field zeropoint with stronger red-sideemission. we compare our data with the predictions of simple models foroutflowing and infalling gas distributions around high-redshift galaxies. whilepopular "shell" models provide a qualitative match with many of theobservations of ly-alpha emission, we find that in detail there are importantdiscrepancies between the models and data, as well as problems with applyingthe framework of an expanding thin shell of gas to explain high-redshift galaxyspectra. our data highlight these inconsistencies, as well as illuminatingcritical elements for success in future models of outflow and infall inhigh-redshift galaxies.

1111.6598	a new method to correct for fiber collisions in galaxy two-point  statistics	in fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugsprevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting theability of studying galaxy clustering on all scales. we present a new methodfor correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statisticsbased on spectroscopic observations. our method makes use of observations intile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population,and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. the method is rootedin solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs.we demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the fullthree-dimensional redshift-space two-point correlation functions on scales bothbelow and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly usednearest neighbor and angular correction methods. we discuss potentialsystematic effects in our method. the statistical correction accuracy of ourmethod is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the squareroot of) the volume probed. for a sample similar to the final sdss-iii bossgalaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the levelof 1% on scales 0.1--30mpc/h for the two-point correlation functions. thesystematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by non-perfect correctionof collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5%.our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statisticsas well, enables more accurate measurements of full three-dimensional galaxyclustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys.

1202.6057	the clustering of galaxies at z~0.5 in the sdss-iii data release 9  boss-cmass sample: a test for the lcdm cosmology	we present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sample of massive galaxies withredshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii project.our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 mpc/h. we comparethese estimates with the expectations of the flat lcdm cosmological model withparameters compatible with wmap7 data. we use the multidark cosmologicalsimulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, toestimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloesand galaxy biases. we find that the lcdm model gives a reasonable descriptionto the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably goodagreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance ofboss galaxies, does not have any free parameters. however, we find a deviation(&gt;~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 mpc/h and ~10-40mpc/h. a more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics fromupcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. we also estimatethat about 12% of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellitesinhabiting central haloes with mass m&gt;~1e14 m_sun/h. using the multidarksimulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched cataloguefinding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtainedusing the measured boss projected correlation function. furthermore, the linearlarge-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matchedsample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/mpc)^3). extrapolating these resultsto bao scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signalproduced by non-linear evolution that leads to ~2-4% dips at ~3 sigma level forwavenumbers k&gt;~0.1 h/mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

1203.4570	the halo occupation distribution of sdss quasars	we present an estimate of the projected two-point correlation function (2pcf)of quasars in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) over the full range of one-and two-halo scales, 0.02-120 mpc/h. this was achieved by combining data fromsdss dr7 on large scales and hennawi et al. (2006; with appropriate statisticalcorrections) on small scales. our combined clustering sample is the largestspectroscopic quasar clustering sample to date, containing ~48,000 quasars inthe redshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 with median redshift 1.4. we interpret theseprecise 2pcf measurements within the halo occupation distribution (hod)framework and constrain the occupation functions of central and satellitequasars in dark matter halos. in order to explain the small-scale clustering,the hod modeling requires that a small fraction of z~1.4 quasars,fsat=(7.4+/-1.4) 10^(-4), be satellites in dark matter halos. at z~1.4, themedian masses of the host halos of central and satellite quasars areconstrained to be mcen=(4.1+0.3/-0.4) 10^12 msun/h and msat=(3.6+0.8/-1.0)10^14 msun/h, respectively. to investigate the redshift evolution of thequasar-halo relationship, we also perform hod modeling of the projected 2pcfmeasured by shen et al. (2007) for sdss quasars with median redshift 3.2. wefind tentative evidence for an increase in the mass scale of quasar hosthalos---the inferred median mass of halos hosting central quasars at z~3.2 ismcen=(14.1+5.8/-6.9) 10^12 msun/h. the cutoff profiles of the mean occupationfunctions of central quasars reveal that quasar luminosity is more tightlycorrelated with halo mass at higher redshifts. the average quasar duty cyclearound the median host halo mass is inferred to be fq=(7.3+0.6/-1.5) 10^(-4) atz~1.4 and fq=(8.6+20.4/-7.2) 10^(-2) at z~3.2. we discuss the implications ofour results for quasar evolution and quasar-galaxy co-evolution.

1210.3600	nature of lyman alpha blobs: powered by extreme starbursts	we present a new model for the observed lyman alpha blobs (labs) within thecontext of the standard cold dark matter model. in this model, labs are themost massive halos with the strongest clustering (proto-clusters) undergoingextreme starbursts in the high-z universe. aided by calculations of detailedradiative transfer of lya photons through ultra-high resolution (159pc)large-scale (&gt;30mpc) adaptive mesh-refinement cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations with galaxy formation, this model is shown to be able to, for thefirst time, reproduce simultaneously the global lya luminosity function andluminosity-size relation of the observed labs. physically, a combination ofdust attenuation of lya photons within galaxies, clustering of galaxies, andcomplex propagation of lya photons through circumgalactic and intergalacticmedium gives rise to the large sizes and frequently irregular isophotal shapesof labs that are observed. a generic and unique prediction of this model isthat there should be strong far-infrared (fir) sources within each lab, withthe most luminous fir source likely representing the gravitational center ofthe proto-cluster, not necessarily the apparent center of the lya emission ofthe lab or the most luminous optical source. upcoming alma observations shouldunambiguously test this prediction. if verified, labs will provide veryvaluable laboratories for studying formation of galaxies in the most overdenseregions of the universe at a time when global star formation is most vigorous.

1212.1211	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: luminosity and color dependence and redshift evolution	we measure the luminosity and color dependence and the redshift evolution ofgalaxy clustering in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey ninth data release. we focus on the projected two-pointcorrelation function (2pcf) of subsets of its cmass sample, which includesabout 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43&lt;z&lt;0.7. tominimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-definedluminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the cmass galaxyselection cuts. the 2pcf of the whole cmass sample, if approximated by apower-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06mpc/h and an index of\gamma=1.85\pm0.01. clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are foundfor the projected 2pcf in all redshift bins, with more luminous and reddergalaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2pcf. the colordependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,consistent with the behavior of sdss-ii main sample galaxies at lowerredshifts. at a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution ofthe projected 2pcfs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. wealso construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. the clustering of these galaxiesin the cmass redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted bypassive evolution. our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence andredshift evolution of galaxy clustering will allow for detailed modeling of therelation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints on galaxyformation and evolution.

1212.1460	disk stability and neutral hydrogen as a tracer of dark matter	we derive the projected surface mass distribution sigma_m for sphericallysymmetric mass distributions having an arbitrary rotation curve. for a galaxywith a flat rotation curve and an ism disk having a constant toomre stabilityparameter, q, the ism surface mass density sigma_g as well as sigma_m both falloff as 1/r. we use published data on a sample of 20 well studied galaxies toshow that ism disks do maintain a constant q over radii usually encompassingmore than 50% of the hi mass. the power law slope in sigma_g covers a range ofexponents and is well correlated with the slope in the epicyclic frequency.this implies that the ism disk is responding to the potential, and hence thatsecular evolution is important for setting the structure of ism disks. we showthat the gas to total mass ratio should be anti-correlated with the maximumrotational velocity, and that the sample falls on the expected relationship. avery steep fall off in sigma_g is required at the outermost radii to keep themass and angular momentum content finite for typical rotation curve shapes, andis observed. the observation that hi traces dark matter over a significantrange of radii in galaxies is thus due to the disks stabilising themselves in anormal dark matter dominated potential. this explanation is consistent with thecold dark matter paradigm.

1212.4526	cross-correlation of sdss dr7 quasars and dr10 boss galaxies: the weak  luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at z~0.5	we present the measurement of the two-point cross-correlation function (ccf)of 8,198 sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) quasars and349,608 dr10 cmass galaxies from the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey(boss) at redshift &lt;z&gt;~0.5 (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9). the cross-correlation function can bereasonably well fit by a power-law model xi_qg(r)=(r/r_0)^(-gamma) on projectedscales of r_p=2-25 mpc/h with r_0=6.61+-0.25 mpc/h and gamma=1.69+-0.07. weestimate a quasar linear bias of b_q=1.38+-0.10 at &lt;z&gt;=0.53 from the ccfmeasurements. this linear bias corresponds to a characteristic host halo massof ~4x10^12 m_sun/h, compared to ~10^13 m_sun/h characteristic host halo massfor cmass galaxies. we divide the quasar sample in luminosity and constrain theluminosity dependence of quasar bias to be db_q/dlogl=0.20+-0.34 or 0.11+-0.32(depending on different luminosity divisions) for quasar luminosities-23.5&gt;m_i(z=2)&gt;-25.5, implying a weak luminosity dependence of quasarclustering for the bright end of the quasar population at &lt;z&gt;~0.5. we compareour measurements with theoretical predictions, halo occupation distribution(hod) models and mock catalogs. these comparisons suggest quasars reside in abroad range of host halos, and the host halo mass distributions significantlyoverlap with each other for quasars at different luminosities, implying a poorcorrelation between halo mass and instantaneous quasar luminosity. we also findthat the quasar hod parameterization is largely degenerate such that differenthods can reproduce the ccf equally well, but with different outcomes such asthe satellite fraction and host halo mass distribution. these results highlightthe limitations and ambiguities in modeling the distribution of quasars withthe standard hod approach and the need for additional information in populatingquasars in dark matter halos with hod.

0712.3570	environmental effects on real-space and redshift-space galaxy clustering	galaxy formation inside dark matter halos, as well as the halo formationitself, can be affected by large-scale environments. evaluating the imprints ofenvironmental effects on galaxy clustering is crucial for precise cosmologicalconstraints with data from galaxy redshift surveys. we investigate such anenvironmental impact on both real-space and redshift-space galaxy clusteringstatistics using a semi-analytic model derived from the millennium simulation.we compare clustering statistics from original sam galaxy samples and shuffledones with environmental influence on galaxy properties eliminated. among theluminosity-threshold samples examined, the one with the lowest thresholdluminosity (~0.2l_*) is affected by environmental effects the most, which has a~10% decrease in the real-space two-point correlation function (2pcf) aftershuffling. by decomposing the 2pcf into five different components based on thesource of pairs, we show that the change in the 2pcf can be explained by theage and richness dependence of halo clustering. the 2pcfs in redshift space arefound to change in a similar manner after shuffling. if the environmentaleffects are neglected, halo occupation distribution modeling of the real-spaceand redshift-space clustering may have a less than 6.5% systematic uncertaintyin constraining beta from the most affected sam sample and have substantiallysmaller uncertainties from the other, more luminous samples. we argue that theeffect could be even smaller in reality. in the appendix, we present a methodto decompose the 2pcf, which can be applied to measure the two-pointauto-correlation functions of galaxy sub-samples in a volume-limited galaxysample and their two-point cross-correlation functions in a single runutilizing only one random catalog.

1303.2942	the halo occupation distribution of x-ray-bright active galactic nuclei:  a comparison with luminous quasars	we perform halo occupation distribution (hod) modeling of the projectedtwo-point correlation function (2pcf) of high-redshift (z~1.2) x-ray-brightactive galactic nuclei (agn) in the xmm-cosmos field measured by allevato etal. the hod parameterization is based on low-luminosity agn in cosmologicalsimulations. at the median redshift of z~1.2, we derive a median mass of(1.02+0.21/-0.23)x10^{13} msun/h for halos hosting central agn and an upperlimit of ~10% on the agn satellite fraction. our modeling results indicate (atthe 2.5-sigma level) that x-ray agn reside in more massive halos compared tomore bolometrically luminous, optically-selected quasars at similar redshift.the modeling also yields constraints on the duty cycle of the x-ray agn, and wefind that at z~1.2 the average duration of the x-ray agn phase is two orders ofmagnitude longer than that of the quasar phase. our inferred mean occupationfunction of x-ray agn is similar to recent empirical measurements with a groupcatalog and suggests that agn halo occupancy increases with increasing halomass. we project the xmm-cosmos 2pcf measurements to forecast the requiredsurvey parameters needed in future agn clustering studies to enable higherprecision hod constraints and determinations of key physical parameters likethe satellite fraction and duty cycle. we find that n^{2}/a~5x10^{6} deg^{-2}(with n the number of agn in a survey area of a deg^{2}) is sufficient toconstrain the hod parameters at the 10% level, which is easily achievable byupcoming and proposed x-ray surveys.

1307.2896	equilibrium star formation in a constant q disk: model optimisation and  initial tests	we develop a model for the distribution of the ism and star formation ingalaxies based on recent studies that indicate that galactic disks stabilise toa constant stability parameter, which we combine with prescriptions of how thephases of the ism are determined and for the star formation law (sfl). themodel predicts the gas surface mass density and star formation intensity of agalaxy given its rotation curve, stellar surface mass density and the gasvelocity dispersion. this model is tested on radial profiles of neutral andmolecular ism surface mass density and star formation intensity of 12 galaxiesselected from the things sample. our tests focus on intermediate radii.nevertheless, the model produces reasonable agreement with ism mass and starformation rate integrated over the central region in all but one case. tooptimise the model, we evaluate four recipes for the stability parameter, threerecipes for apportioning the ism into molecular and neutral components, andeight versions of the sfl. we find no clear-cut best prescription for thetwo-fluid (gas and stars) stability parameter q_2f and therefore forsimplicity, we use the wang&amp;silk(1994) approximation (q_ws). we found that anempirical scaling between the molecular to neutral ism ratio (r_mol) and thestellar surface mass density proposed by leroy et al. (2008) works marginallybetter than the other two prescriptions for this ratio in predicting the ismprofiles, and noticeably better in predicting star formation intensity from theism profiles produced by our model with the sfls we tested. thus in the contextof our modeled ism profiles, the linear molecular sfl and the two-component sfl(krumholz et al. 2009) work better than the other prescriptions we tested. weincorporate these relations into our `constant q disk' (cq-disk) model.

1308.1405	anisotropic lyman-alpha emission	as a result of resonant scatterings off hydrogen atoms, lyman-alpha (lya)emission from star-forming galaxies provides a probe of the (hardly isotropic)neutral gas environment around them. we study the effect of the environmentalanisotropy on the observed lya emission by performing radiative transfercalculations for models of neutral hydrogen clouds with prescriptions ofspatial and kinematic anisotropies. the environmental anisotropy leads tocorresponding anisotropy in the lya flux and spectral properties and inducescorrelations among them. the lya flux (or observed luminosity) depends on theviewing angle and shows an approximate correlation with the initial lya opticaldepth in the viewing direction relative to those in all other directions. thedistribution of lya flux from a set of randomly oriented clouds is skewed tohigh values, providing a natural contribution to the lya equivalent width (ew)distribution seen in observation. a narrower ew distribution is found at alarger peak offset of the lya line, similar to the trend suggested inobservation. the peak offset appears to correlate with the line shape (fullwidth at half maximum and asymmetry), pointing to a possibility of using lyaline features alone to determine the systemic redshifts of galaxies. the studysuggests that anisotropies in the spatial and kinematic distributions ofneutral hydrogen can be an important ingredient in shaping the observedproperties of lya emission from star-forming galaxies. we discuss theimplications of using lya emission to probe the circumgalactic andintergalactic environments of galaxies.

1309.3607	a direct measurement of the mean occupation function of quasars:  breaking degeneracies between halo occupation distribution models	recent work on quasar clustering suggests a degeneracy in the halo occupationdistribution constrained from two-point correlation functions. to break thisdegeneracy, we make the first empirical measurement of the mean occupationfunction (mof) of quasars at $z \sim 0.2$ by matching quasar positions withgroups and clusters identified in the maxbcg sample. we fit two models to themof, a power law and a 4-parameter model. the number distribution of quasars inhost halos is close to poisson, and the slopes of the mof obtained from ourbest-fit models (for the power law case) favor a mof that monotonicallyincreases with halo mass. the best-fit slopes are $0.53 \pm 0.04$ and $1.03\pm1.12$ for the power law model and the 4-parameter model, respectively. wemeasure the radial distribution of quasars within dark matter halos and find itto be adequately described by a power law with a slope $-2.3 \pm 0.4$. wemeasure the conditional luminosity function (clf) of quasars and show thatthere is no evidence that quasar luminosity depends on host halo mass, similarto the inferences drawn from clustering measurements. we also measure theconditional black hole mass function (cmf) of our quasars. although the resultsare consistent with no dependence on halo mass, we observe a slight indicationof downsizing of the black hole mass function. the lack of halo mass dependencein the clf and cmf shows that quasars residing in galaxy clusters havecharacteristic luminosity and black hole mass scales.

1311.1203	on the metallicities of kepler stars	we use 12000 stars from large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopictelescope (lamost) spectroscopic data to show that the metallicities of keplerfield stars as given in the kepler input catalog (kic) systematicallyunderestimate both the true metallicity and the dynamic range of the keplersample. specifically, to the first order approximation, we find [fe/h]_kic =-0.20 + 0.43 [fe/h]_lamost, with a scatter of ~0.25 dex, due almost entirely toerrors in kic. this relation is most secure for -0.3&lt;[fe/h]_lamost&lt;+0.4 wherewe have &gt;200 comparison stars per 0.1 dex bin and good consistency is shownbetween metallicities determined by lamost and high-resolution spectra. itremains approximately valid in a slightly broader range. when the relation isinverted, the error in true metallicity as derived from kic is (0.25dex)/0.43~0.6 dex. we thereby quantitatively confirm the cautionary note bybrown et al. (2011) that kic estimates of [fe/h] should not be used by "anyonewith a particular interest in stellar metallicities". fortunately, many morelamost spectroscopic metallicities will be available in the near future.

1401.3009	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: modeling of the luminosity and colour dependence in the  data release 10	we investigate the luminosity and colour dependence of clustering of cmassgalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey tenth data release. the halo occupation distribution framework isadopted to model the projected two-point correlation function measurements onsmall and intermediate scales (from $0.02$ to $60\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) and tointerpret the observed trends and infer the connection of galaxies to darkmatter halos. we find that luminous red galaxies reside in massive halos ofmass $m{\sim}10^{13}$--$10^{14}\,h^{-1}{\rm m_\odot}$ and more luminousgalaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive halos. the strongsmall-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellitesin massive halos, with the fraction at the level of 5--8 per cent anddecreasing with luminosity. the characteristic mass of a halo hosting onaverage one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor$8.7$ larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the samethreshold. at a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are morestrongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a largerfraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive halos. ourclustering measurements on scales below $0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$ allow us tostudy the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside halos. whilethe clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by anavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers asteeper or more concentrated profile. finally, we also use galaxy samples ofconstant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution ofluminous galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passiveevolution in the redshift range of $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$.

1407.4811	velocity bias from the small scale clustering of sdss-iii boss galaxies	we present the measurements and modelling of the projected and redshift-spaceclustering of cmass galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey data release 11. for a volume-limited luminousred galaxy sample in the redshift range of $0.48&lt;z&lt;0.55$, we perform halooccupation distribution modelling of the small- and intermediate-scale($0.1$--$60h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) projected and redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions, with an accurate model built on high resolution $n$-bodysimulations. to interpret the measured redshift-space distortions, thedistribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matterinside haloes of $\sim 10^{13}$--$10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}}$, i.e. the datarequire the existence of galaxy velocity bias. most notably, central galaxieson average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host haloes(defined by the inner 25% of particles around the halo potential minimum), butrather move around it with a 1d velocity dispersion of $0.22^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from the centre at thelevel of $\lesssim$1% of the halo virial radius. the luminous satellitegalaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities$0.86^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ times those of the dark matter, which suggests that thevelocity and spatial distributions of these satellites cannot both be unbiased.the constraints mainly arise from the fingers-of-god effect at nonlinear scalesand the smoothing to the kaiser effect in the translinear regime; therobustness of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests. in addition,no clear evidence is found for a strong luminosity dependence of the velocitybias. we discuss the implications of the existence of galaxy velocity bias forinvestigations of galaxy formation and cosmology.

1411.2597	on the intermediate-redshift central stellar mass-halo mass relation,  and implications for the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1	the stellar mass-halo mass relation is a key constraint in all semi-analytic,numerical, and semi-empirical models of galaxy formation and evolution.however, its exact shape and redshift dependence remain debated. several recentworks support a relation in the local universe steeper than previously thought.based on the comparisons with a variety of data on massive central galaxies, weshow that this steepening holds up to z~1, for stellar masses mstar&gt;2e11 msun.specifically, we find significant evidence for a high-mass end slope of\beta&gt;0.35-0.70, instead of the usual \beta~0.20-0.30 reported by a number ofprevious results. when including the independent constraints from the recentboss clustering measurements, the data, independent of any systematic errors instellar masses, tend to favor a model with a very small scatter (&lt; 0.15 dex) instellar mass at fixed halo mass, in the redshift range z &lt; 0.8 and formstar&gt;3e11 msun, suggesting a close connection between massive galaxies andhost halos even at relatively recent epochs. we discuss the implications of ourresults with respect to the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1.

0804.2293	red galaxy growth and the halo occupation distribution	we have traced the past 7 gyr of red galaxy stellar mass growth within darkmatter halos. we have determined the halo occupation distribution, whichdescribes how galaxies reside within dark matter halos, using the observedluminosity function and clustering of 40,696 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 red galaxies in bootes.half of 10^{11.9} msun/h halos host a red central galaxy, and this fractionincreases with increasing halo mass. we do not observe any evolution of therelationship between red galaxy stellar mass and host halo mass, although weexpect both galaxy stellar masses and halo masses to evolve over cosmic time.we find that the stellar mass contained within the red population has doubledsince z=1, with the stellar mass within red satellite galaxies tripling overthis redshift range. in cluster mass halos most of the stellar mass resideswithin satellite galaxies and the intra-cluster light, with a minority of thestellar mass residing within central galaxies. the stellar masses of the mostluminous red central galaxies are proportional to halo mass to the power of athird. we thus conclude that halo mergers do not always lead to rapid growth ofcentral galaxies. while very massive halos often double in mass over the past 7gyr, the stellar masses of their central galaxies typically grow by only 30%.

1502.01349	on the diffuse lyman-alpha halo around lyman-alpha emitting galaxies	ly$\alpha$ photons scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms in the circumgalacticmedia or produced in the halos of star-forming galaxies are expected to lead toextended ly$\alpha$ emission around galaxies. such low surface brightnessly$\alpha$ halos (lahs) have been detected by stacking ly$\alpha$ images ofhigh-redshift star-forming galaxies. we study the origin of lahs by performingradiative transfer modeling of nine $z=3.1$ lyman-alpha emitters (laes) in ahigh resolution hydrodynamic cosmological galaxy formation simulation. wedevelop a method of computing the mean ly$\alpha$ surface brightness profile ofeach lae by effectively integrating over many different observing directions.without adjusting any parameters, our model yields an average ly$\alpha$surface brightness profile in remarkable agreement with observations. we findthat observed lahs cannot be accounted for solely by photons originating fromthe central lae and scattered to large radii by hydrogen atoms in thecircumgalactic gas. instead, ly$\alpha$ emission from regions in the outer halois primarily responsible for producing the extended lahs seen in observations,which potentially includes both star-forming and cooling radiation. with thelimit on the star formation contribution set by the ultra-violet (uv) halomeasurement, we find that cooling radiation can play an important role informing the extended lahs. we discuss the implications and caveats of such apicture.

1504.04088	large-scale clustering of lyman-alpha emission intensity from sdss/boss	(abridged) we detect the large-scale structure of lya emission in theuniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of lya surfacebrightness with quasars in sdss/boss. we use a million spectra targetingluminous red galaxies at z&lt;0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxyspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift lya surfacebrightness. the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shapeconsistent with a lambdacdm model with omega_m =0.30^+0.10-0.07. the predictedamplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the meanlya surface brightness, &lt;mu_alpha&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and thequasar and lya emission bias factors. using known values, we infer&lt;mu_alpha&gt;(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 a^-1 arcsec^-2,where b_alpha is the lya emission bias factor. if the dominant sources of lyaemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_sfr = (0.28 +/- 0.07)(3/b_alpha) /yr/mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. for b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected lya emitters,although consistent with the total rho_sfr derived from dust-corrected,continuum uv surveys. 97% of the lya emission in the universe at theseredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of lya emitters. ourmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halossurrounding previously detected lya emitters, but we speculate that it arisesfrom similar lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. we alsodetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation,finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (zheng et al.(2011)). our measurements represent the first application of the intensitymapping technique to optical observations.

1505.05521	estimation of distances to stars with stellar parameters from lamost	we present a method to estimate distances to stars with spectroscopicallyderived stellar parameters. the technique is a bayesian approach withlikelihood estimated via comparison of measured parameters to a grid of stellarisochrones, and returns a posterior probability density function for eachstar's absolute magnitude. this technique is tailored specifically to data fromthe large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope (lamost) survey.because lamost obtains roughly 3000 stellar spectra simultaneously within each~5-degree diameter "plate" that is observed, we can use the stellar parametersof the observed stars to account for the stellar luminosity function and targetselection effects. this removes biasing assumptions about the underlyingpopulations, both due to predictions of the luminosity function from stellarevolution modeling, and from galactic models of stellar populations along eachline of sight. using calibration data of stars with known distances and stellarparameters, we show that our method recovers distances for most stars within~20%, but with some systematic overestimation of distances to halo giants. weapply our code to the lamost database, and show that the current precision oflamost stellar parameters permits measurements of distances with ~40% errorbars. this precision should improve as the lamost data pipelines continue to berefined.

1505.07861	redshift-space clustering of sdss galaxies --- luminosity dependence,  halo occupation distribution, and velocity bias	we present the measurements and modelling of the small-to-intermediate scale(0.1--25 mpc/h) projected and three-dimensional (3d) redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions (2pcfs) of local galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release 7. we find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering onluminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger formore luminous samples. the measurements are successfully interpreted within thehalo occupation distribution (hod) framework with central and satellitevelocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and tomodel redshift-space distortion (rsd) effects. in agreement with previousstudies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes.including the redshift-space 2pcfs helps tighten the hod constraints. moreover,we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres,with the velocity dispersion about 30% that of the dark matter. such a relativemotion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find thatcentral galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect totheir host haloes. the motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples isconsistent with their following that of the dark matter. for faint samples,satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloesabout 85% that of the dark matter. we discuss possible applications of thevelocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. in theappendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurementerrors, which is well described by a gaussian-convolved double exponentialdistribution.

0807.2271	a z = 3 lyman alpha blob associated with a damped lyman alpha system  proximate to its background quasar	we report on the discovery of a bright lyman alpha blob associated with thez=3 quasar sdssj124020.91+145535.6 which is also coincident with strong dampedlyman alpha absorption from a foreground galaxy (a so-called proximate dampedlyman alpha system; pdla). the one dimensional spectrum acquired by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) shows a broad lyman alpha emission line with a fwhm ~500 km/s and a luminosity of l_{lya} = 3.9e43 erg/s superposed on the trough ofthe pdla. mechanisms for powering this large lyman alpha luminosity arediscussed. we argue against emission from hii regions in the pdla galaxy sincethis requires an excessive star-formation rate ~ 500 msun/yr and wouldcorrespond to the largest lyman alpha luminosity ever measured from a dampedlyman alpha system or starburst galaxy. we use a monte carlo radiative transfersimulation to investigate the possibility that the line emission is fluorescentrecombination radiation from the pdla galaxy powered by the ionizing flux ofthe quasar, but find that the predicted lyman alpha flux is several orders ofmagnitude lower than observed. we conclude that the lyman alpha emission is notassociated with the pdla galaxy at all, but instead is intrinsic to thequasar's host and similar to the extended lyman alpha 'fuzz' which is detectedaround many agn. pdlas are natural coronagraphs that block their backgroundquasar at lyman alpha, and we discuss how systems similar tosdssj124020.91+145535.6 might be used to image the neutral hydrogen in the pdlagalaxy in silhouette against the screen of extended lyman alpha emission fromthe background quasar.

astro-ph;0201275	self-shielding effects on the column density distribution of damped  lyman alpha systems	we calculate the column density distribution of damped lyman alpha systems,modeled as spherical isothermal gaseous halos ionized by the external cosmicbackground. the effects of self-shielding introduce a hump in thisdistribution, at a column density n_{hi} \sim 1.6x10^{17} x^{-1} cm^{-2}, wherex is the neutral fraction at the radius where self-shielding starts beingimportant. the most recent compilation of the column density distribution bystorrie-lombardi &amp; wolfe shows marginal evidence for the detection of thisfeature due to self-shielding, suggesting a value x \sim 10^{-3}. assuming aphotoionization rate \gamma \sim 10^{-12} s^{-1} from the external ionizingbackground, the radius where self-shielding occurs is inferred to be about3.8kpc. if damped lyman alpha systems consist of a clumpy medium, this shouldbe interpreted as the typical size of the gas clumps in the region where theybecome self-shielding. clumps of this size with typical column densities n_h\sim 3x10^{20} cm^{-2} would be in hydrostatic equilibrium at thecharacteristic photoionization temperature \sim 10^4 k if they do not containdark matter. since this size is similar to the overall radius of damped \lyasystems in cold dark matter models, where all halos are assumed to containsimilar gas clouds producing damped absorbers, this suggests that the gas indamped absorbers is in fact not highly clumped.

astro-ph;0202358	do distinct cosmological models predict degenerate halo populations?	using cosmological n-body simulations, we investigate the influence of thematter density parameter omega_m and the linear theory power spectrum p(k) onstatistical properties of the dark matter halo population -- the mass functionn(m), the halo correlation function, and halo pairwise velocity statistics. forfixed p(k), the effect of changing omega_m is simple: the halo mass scale m_*shifts in proportion to omega_m, pairwise velocities (at fixed m/m_*) areproportional to omega_m^{0.6}, and halo clustering at fixed m/m_* is unchanged.if one simultaneously changes the p(k) amplitude sigma_8 to maintain a "clusternormalization" condition sigma_8 x omega_m^{0.5} = const, then n(m) staysapproximately constant near m ~ 5e14 msun, and halo clustering and pairwisevelocities are similar at fixed m. however, the shape of n(m) changes, with adecrease of omega_m from 0.3 to 0.2 producing a ~30% drop in the number of lowmass halos. one can preserve the shape of n(m) over a large dynamic range bychanging the shape of p(k), but the required changes are substantial, and theysignificantly alter the halo clustering and halo velocities. the sensitivity ofthe dark halo population to cosmological model parameters has encouragingimplications for efforts to constrain cosmology and galaxy bias with observedgalaxy clustering, since the predicted changes in the halo population cannoteasily be masked by altering the way that galaxies occupy halos. a shift inomega_m alone would be detected by any dynamically sensitive clusteringstatistic; a cluster normalized change to sigma_8 and omega_m would require achange in galaxy occupation as a function of m/m_*, which would alter galaxyclustering; and a simultaneous change to p(k) that preserves the halo massfunction would change the clustering of the halos themselves.

astro-ph;0301280	on departures from a power law in the galaxy correlation function	we measure the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) from the sloan digitalsky survey for a flux-limited sample of 118,000 galaxies and for a volumelimited subset of 22,000 galaxies with absolute magnitude m_r&lt;-21. bothcorrelation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fitpower law, in particular a change in slope at r_p~1-2 mpc/h. these departuresare stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relativelyluminous galaxies. we show that the inflection point in w_p(r_p) can benaturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according towhich it marks the transition from a large scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in the same dark matter halo. for example, given the dark halo populationpredicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projectedcorrelation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by amodel in which the mean number of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies in a halo of mass m&gt;m_1=4.74x 10^{13}\msun/h is &lt;n&gt;_m=(m/m_1)^{0.89}, with 75% of the galaxies residing inless massive, single-galaxy halos. this physically motivated model has the samenumber of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the w_p(r_p) data better,with a \chi^2/d.o.f.=0.93 compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom,incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). departuresfrom a power-law correlation function encode information about the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter halos. higher precision measurements of thesedepartures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias andprovide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.

0808.2988	extending recovery of the primordial matter power spectrum	the shape of the primordial matter power spectrum plin(k) encodes criticalinformation on cosmological parameters. at large scales, the observable galaxypower spectrum pobs(k) is expected to follow the shape of plin(k), but onsmaller scales the effects of nonlinearity and galaxy bias make the ratiopobs(k)/plin(k) scale-dependent. we develop a method that can extend thedynamic range of the plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on thegalaxy halo occupation distribution (hod) from the projected galaxy correlationfunction wp. we devise an analytic model to calculate pobs(k) in real-space andredshift-space. once hod parameters are determined by matching wp for a givencosmological model, galaxy bias is completely specified, and our analytic modelpredicts both the shape and normalization of pobs(k). applying our method tosdss main galaxy samples, we find that the real-space pobs(k) follows the shapeof the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the 1-2% level up to k=0.2 h/mpc.when we apply our method to sdss lrg samples, the linear bias approximation isaccurate to 5% at k&lt;0.08 h/mpc, but the scale-dependence of lrg bias preventsthe use of linear theory at k&gt;0.08 h/mpc. our hod model prediction is in goodagreement with the recent sdss lrg pobs(k) measurements at all measured scales(k&lt;0.2 h/mpc), naturally explaining the shape of pobs(k). the "q-model"prescription is a poor description of galaxy bias for the lrg samples, and itcan lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates when measurements at k&gt;0.1h/mpc are included in the analysis. we quantify the potential bias andconstraints on cosmological parameters that arise from applying linear theoryand q-model fitting, and we demonstrate the utility of hod modeling of futurehigh precision measurements of pobs(k) on quasi-linear scales.

astro-ph;0307030	interpreting the observed clustering of red galaxies at z~3	daddi et al. have recently reported strong clustering of a population of redgalaxies at z~3 in the hubble deep field-south. fitting the observed angularclustering with a power law of index -0.8, they infer a comoving correlationlength r_0~8 mpc/h; for a standard cosmology, this r_0 would imply that the redgalaxies reside in rare, m&gt;10^{13} msun/h halos, with each halo hosting ~100galaxies to match the number density of the population. using the framework ofthe halo occupation distribution (hod) in a $\lambda$cdm universe, we show thatthe daddi et al. data can be adequately reproduced by less surprising models,e.g., models with galaxies residing in halos of mass m&gt;m_min=6.3x10^{11} msun/hand a mean occupation navg(m)=1.4(m/m_min)^{0.45} above this cutoff. theresultant correlation functions do not follow a strict power law, showinginstead a clear transition from the 1-halo dominated regime, where the twogalaxies of each pair reside in the same dark matter halo, to the 2-halodominated regime, where the two galaxies of each pair are from different halos.the observed high-amplitude data points lie in the one-halo-dominated regime,so these hod models are able to explain the observations despite having smallercorrelation lengths, r_0~5 mpc/h. hod parameters are only loosely constrainedby the current data because of large sample variance and the lack of clusteringinformation on scales that probe the 2-halo regime. if our explanation of thedata is correct, then future observations covering a larger area should showthat the large scale correlations lie below a \theta^{-1.8} extrapolation ofthe small scale points. our models of the current data suggest that the redgalaxies are somewhat more strongly clustered than uv-selected lyman-breakgalaxies and have a greater tendency to reside in small groups.

astro-ph;0405527	projected three-point correlation functions and galaxy bias	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) can now be measured in largegalaxy redshift surveys, but in three dimensions its interpretation iscomplicated by the presence of redshift-space distortions. i investigate theprojected 3pcf, where these distortions are eliminated by integrating over theredshift dimension, as is commonly done for the two-point correlation function.the calculation of the projected 3pcf from the real-space, three-dimensionalbispectrum is greatly simplified by expanding both quantities in fouriercomponents, analogous to szapudi's (2004) expansion of the three-dimensionalquantities in multipole components. in the weakly nonlinear regime, thebispectrum can be well represented by the first few fourier components. thereis a well-known relation between the reduced 3pcfs of matter and galaxies inthe weakly nonlinear regime, which can be used to infer galaxy bias factors ifthe real-space three-dimensional galaxy correlation functions (two-point andthree-point) can be measured. i show that the same relation holds for thereduced {\it projected} 3pcfs if these are properly defined. these resultsshould aid determinations of galaxy bias from large redshift surveys byeliminating the complication of redshift-space distortions.

astro-ph;0408003	cosmology and the halo occupation distribution from small-scale galaxy  clustering in the sloan digital sky survey	we use the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) of a volume-limitedsubsample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy redshift catalogueto measure the halo occupation distribution (hod) of the galaxies of thesample. simultaneously, we allow the cosmology to vary within cosmologicalconstraints imposed by cosmic microwave background experiments in a lambda-cdmmodel. we find that combining w_p(r_p) for this sample alone with theobservations by wmap, acbar, cbi and vsa can provide one of the most precisetechniques available to measure cosmological parameters. for a minimal flatsix-parameter lambda-cdm model with an hod with three free parameters, we findomega_m=0.278^{+0.027}_{-0.027}, sigma_8=0.812^{+0.028}_{-0.027}, andh_0=69.8^{+2.6}_{-2.6}km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}; these errors are significantlysmaller than from cmb alone and similar to those obtained by combining cmb withthe large-scale galaxy power spectrum assuming scale-independent bias. thecorresponding hod parameters describing the minimum halo mass and thenormalization and cut-off of the satellite mean occupation arem_min=(3.03^{+0.36}_{-0.36})x 10^{12} h^{-1} m_sun, m_1 =(4.58^{+0.60}_{-0.60})x 10^{13} h^{-1} m_sun, and kappa=4.44^{+0.51}_{-0.69}.when more parameters are added to the hod model, the error bars on the hodparameters increase because of degeneracies, but the error bars on thecosmological parameters do not increase greatly. similar modeling for othergalaxy samples could reduce the statistical errors on these results, while morethorough investigations of the cosmology dependence of nonlinear halo bias andhalo mass functions are needed to eliminate remaining systematic uncertainties,which may be comparable to statistical uncertainties.

astro-ph;0408564	theoretical models of the halo occupation distribution: separating  central and satellite galaxies	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the relation betweengalaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. theproperties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those ofsatellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. using asmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulation and a semi-analytic (sa)galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central andsatellite galaxies to the hod, more specifically to the probability p(n|m) thata halo of virial mass m contains n galaxies of a particular class. in agreementwith earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupationfunction &lt;n&gt; for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximatedby a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, andthat the distribution of satellite numbers is close to poisson at fixed halomass. for galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, thereis a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass mmin required to hosta central galaxy and the mass m1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite,with m1 ~ 14 mmin (sph) or m1 ~ 18 mmin (sa). the mean occupation number ofyoung galaxies exhibits a local minimum at m ~ 10 mmin where halos are toomassive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to hostsatellites. we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halomass cannot be described by a schechter function because central galaxiesproduce a "bump" at high masses. we suggest parameterizations for the hod andthe conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxyclustering. many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent resultsinferred from clustering in the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;0501029	redshift-space distortions with the halo occupation distribution i:  numerical simulations	we show how redshift-space distortions of the galaxy correlation function orpower spectrum can constrain the matter density parameter omega_m and thelinear matter fluctuation amplitude sigma_8. we improve on previous treatmentsby adopting a fully non-linear description of galaxy clustering and bias, whichallows us to break parameter degeneracies by combining large-scale and small-scale distortions. we consider different combinations of omega_m and sigma_8and find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (hod) that yieldnearly identical galaxy correlation functions in real space. we use these hodparameters to populate the dark matter halos of large n-body simulations, fromwhich we measure redshift-space distortions on small and large scales. weinclude a velocity bias parameter alpha_v that allows the velocity dispersionsof satellite galaxies in halos to be systematically higher or lower than thoseof dark matter. large-scale distortions are determined by the parametercombination beta = omega_m^{0.6}/b_g, where b_g is the galaxy bias, inagreement with linear theory. however, linear theory does not accuratelydescribe the distortions themselves on scales accessible to our simulations. weprovide fitting formulas to estimate beta from the redshift-space correlationfunction or power spectrum, and we show that these formulas are significantlymore accurate than those in the existing literature. on small scales, the``finger-of-god'' distortions at projected separations ~0.1 mpc/h depend onomega_m*alpha_v^2 but are independent of sigma_8, while at intermediateseparations they depend on sigma_8 as well. one can thus use redshift-spacedistortions over a wide range of scales to separately determine omega_m,sigma_8, and alpha_v.

astro-ph;0512071	breaking the degeneracies between cosmology and galaxy bias	adopting the framework of the halo occupation distribution (hod), weinvestigate the ability of galaxy clustering measurements to simultaneouslyconstrain cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. starting with a fiducialcosmological model and galaxy hod, we calculate spatial clustering observableson a range of length and mass scales, dynamical clustering observables thatdepend on galaxy peculiar velocities, and the galaxy-matter cross-correlationmeasurable by weak lensing. we then change one or more cosmological parametersand use chi^2-minimization to find the galaxy hod that best reproduces theoriginal clustering. our parameterization of the hod incorporates a flexiblerelation between galaxy occupation numbers and halo mass and allows spatial andvelocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos. despite this flexibility,we find that changes to the hod cannot mask substantial changes to the matterdensity omega_m, the matter clustering amplitude sigma_8, or the shapeparameter gamma of the linear matter power spectrum -- cosmology and bias arenot degenerate. with the conservative assumption of 10% fractional errors, theset of observables considered here can provide ~10% (1 sigma) constraints onsigma_8, omega_m, and gamma, using galaxy clustering data alone. thecombination sigma_8*omega_m^0.75 is constrained to ~5%. in combination withtraditional methods that focus on large scale structure in the "perturbative"regime, hod modeling can greatly amplify the cosmological power of galaxyredshift surveys by taking advantage of high-precision clustering measurementsat small and intermediate scales (from sub-mpc to ~20mpc/h). at the same time,the inferred constraints on the galaxy hod provide valuable tests of galaxyformation theory.

astro-ph;0601120	the dependence of the occupation of galaxies on the halo formation time	we study the dependence of the galaxy contents within halos on the haloformation time using two galaxy formation models, one being a semianalyticmodel utilizing the halo assembly history from a high resolution n-bodysimulation and the other being a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulationincluding radiative cooling, star formation, and energy feedback from galacticwinds. we confirm the finding by gao et al. that at fixed mass, the clusteringof halos depends on the halo formation time, especially for low-mass halos.this age dependence of halo clustering makes it desirable to study thecorrelation between the occupation of galaxies within halos and the halo age.we find that, in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies has astrong dependence on halo age, with fewer satellites in older halos. theyoungest one-third of the halos can have an order of magnitude more satellitesthan the oldest one-third. for central galaxies, in halos that form earlier,they tend to have more stars and thus appear to be more luminous, and thedependence of their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as that of stellarmass. the results can be understood through the star formation history in halosand the merging of satellites onto central galaxies. the age dependence of thegalaxy contents within halos would constitute an important ingredient in a moreaccurate halo-based model of galaxy clustering.

astro-ph;0703457	galaxy evolution from halo occupation distribution modeling of deep2 and  sdss galaxy clustering	we model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function ofdeep2 (z~1) and sdss (z~0) galaxies within the halo occupation distribution(hod) framework. at both epochs, there is a tight correlation between centralgalaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing forlarger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higherluminosity. central l* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z~1than at z~0. we find little evolution in the relation between mass scales ofhost halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the sameluminosity threshold. combining these hod results with theoretical predictionsof the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection betweenthe galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies toz~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us tostudy the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. we find that thestellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. on average, the majorityof the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low mass halos(~5x10^11 msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in centralgalaxies of high mass halos (~10^13 msun/h) result from star formation betweenz~1 and z~0. in addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formationefficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time.future work can combine hod modeling of the clustering of galaxies at differentredshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matterhalos. this can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to bothmergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerfultests of galaxy formation theories.

0809.3002	forecasting the dark energy measurement with baryon acoustic  oscillations: prospects for the lamost surveys	the large area multi-object spectroscopic telescope (lamost) is a dedicatedspectroscopic survey telescope being built in china, with an effective apertureof 4 meters and equiped with 4000 fibers. using the lamost telescope, one couldmake redshift survey of the large scale structure (lss). the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) features in the lss power spectrum provide standard rulersfor measuring dark energy and other cosmological parameters. in this paper weinvestigate the meaurement precision achievable for a few possible surveys: (1)a magnitude limited survey of all galaxies, (2) a survey of color selected redluminous galaxies (lrg), and (3) a magnitude limited, high density survey ofz&lt;2 quasars. for each survey, we use the halo model to estimate the bias of thesample, and calculate the effective volume. we then use the fisher matrixmethod to forecast the error on the dark energy equation of state and othercosmological parameters for different survey parameters. in a few cases we alsouse the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method to make the same forecast as acomparison. the fiber time required for each of these surveys is alsoestimated. these results would be useful in designing the surveys for lamost.

astro-ph;9804243	is gamma-ray absorption by induced electric fields important in the  pulsar magnetospheres?	although the unified formula for gamma-ray absorption process involving boththe magnetic field and a perpendicular electric field derived by daugherty &amp;lerche (1975) is correct, we argued in this paper that their conclusion thatthe induced electric fields are important in the pair formation process in thepulsar magnetospheres is wrong and misleading. the key point is that usuallythe direction of a gamma photon at the emission point observed in thelaboratory frame should be (v/c, 0, [1-(v/c)^2]^{1/2}) rather than (0, 0, 1),where v is the co-rotating velocity. this emission direction is just the onewhich results in zero attenuation coefficient of the gamma photon. calculationshows that after the photon has moved a distance, its direction lead to theresult that the induced electric field is also of minor importance. thus onlygamma-b process is the important mechanism for the pair production in thepulsar magnetospheres. the implications of the modification by ejecting theinduced electric field are also discussed.

0706.0895	radiative transfer effect on ultraviolet pumping of the 21cm line in the  high redshift universe	during the epoch of reionization the 21cm signal is sensitive to thescattering rate of the ultraviolet photons, redshifting across the lyman_alpharesonance. here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a singleultraviolet source. after taking into account previously neglected naturalbroadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonancefrequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distancefrom the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/h), where dnu=nu-nu_0 isthe initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initialfrequency offset decreases. as a consequence, the scattering rate p(r) dropsmuch faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile.near the source (r&lt;1mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshiftinto the ly_alpha resonance converges to p(r) \propto r^{-7/3}. the scatteringrate of ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into ahigher resonance (ly_gamma, ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by theradiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of ly_alpha photonsproduced from all higher resonances also converges to p(r) \propto r^{-7/3}near the source. at 15&lt;z&lt;35, on scales of ~0.01-20mpc/h (comoving), the totalscattering rate of ly_alpha photons from all lyman resonances is found to behigher by a factor of ~1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^{2/3} than obtained without fullradiative transfer. consequently, during the early stage of reionization, thedifferential brightness of 21cm signal against the cosmic microwave backgroundis also boosted by a similar factor.
