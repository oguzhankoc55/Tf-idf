0902.0736	global star formation rate density over 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.9	we determine the global star formation rate density at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.9 usingemission-line selected galaxies identified in hubble space telescope nearinfrared camera and multi-object spectrograph (hst-nicmos) grism spectroscopyobservations. observing in pure parallel mode throughout hst cycles 12 and 13,our survey covers ~104 arcmin2 from which we select 80 galaxies with likelyredshifted ha emission lines. in several cases, a somewhat weaker [oiii]doublet emission is also detected. the ha luminosity range of the emission-linegalaxy sample is 4.4 x 10^41 &lt; l(ha) &lt; 1.5 x 10^43 erg/s. in this range, theluminosity function is well described by a schechter function with phi* =(4.24\pm3.55) x 10^-3 mpc^-3, l* = (2.88\pm1.58) x 10^42 erg/s, and alpha =-1.39\pm0.43. we derive a volume-averaged star formation rate density of0.138\pm0.058 msun/yr/mpc3 at z=1.4 without an extinction correction.subdividing the redshift range, we find star formation rate densities of0.088\pm0.056 msun/yr/mpc3 at z=1.1 and 0.265\pm0.174 msun/yr/mpc3 at z=1.6.the overall star formation rate density is consistent with previous studiesusing ha when the same average extinction correction is applied, confirmingthat the cosmic peak of star formation occurs at z&gt;1.5.

0906.5271	the ~0.9 mjy sample: a mid-infrared spectroscopic catalog of 150  infrared-luminous, 24 micron selected galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5	we present a catalog of mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 150 infrared (ir)luminous galaxies in the spitzer extragalactic first look survey obtained withirs on board spitzer. the sample is selected to be brighter than ~0.9 mjy at 24micron and it has a z distribution in the range [0.3,3.5] with a peak at z=1.it primarily comprises ultraluminous ir galaxies at z&gt;1 and luminous irgalaxies at z&lt;1, as estimated from their monochromatic 14 micron luminosities.the number of sources with spectra that are dominated by an active galacticnucleus (agn) continuum is 49, while 39 sources have strong, star-formationrelated features. for this classification, we used the equivalent width (ew) ofthe 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) feature. severalintermediate/high z starbursts have higher pah ew than local ulirgs. anincrease in the agn activity is observed with increasing z and luminosity,based on the decreasing ew of pahs and the increasing [neiii]/[neii] ratio.spectral stacking leads to the detection of the 3.3 micron pah, the h2 0-0 s(1)and s(3) lines, and the [nev] line. we observe differences in the flux ratiosof pahs in the stacked spectra of ir-luminous galaxies with z or luminosity,which are not due to extinction effects. when placing the observed galaxies onir color-color diagrams, we find that the wedge defining agn comprises mostsources with continuum-dominated spectra, but also contains many starbursts.the comparison of the 11.3 micron pah ew and the h-band effective radius,measured from hst data, indicates that sources with ew&gt;2 micron, are typicallymore extended than ~3 kpc. however, there is no strong correlation between themir spectral type and the near-ir extent of the sources.

0907.5199	massive galaxies in cosmos: evolution of black hole versus bulge mass  but not versus total stellar mass over the last 9 gyrs?	we constrain the ratio of black hole (bh) mass to total stellar mass oftype-1 agn in the cosmos survey at 1&lt;z&lt;2. for 10 agn at mean redshift z~1.4with both hst/acs and hst/nicmos imaging data we are able to compute totalstellar mass m_(*,total), based on restframe uv-to-optical host galaxy colorswhich constrain mass-to-light ratios. all objects have virial bh mass-estimatesavailable from the cosmos magellan/imacs and zcosmos surveys. we find zerodifference between the m_bh--m_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation in the local universe.  our interpretation is: (a) if our objects were purely bulge-dominated, them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. however, (b) since wehave evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies(logm_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logm_bh~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. since allnecessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation oraddition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. merging, inaddition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both bh andstellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final m_bh/m_(*,bulge)ratio.  since the overall cosmic stellar and bh mass buildup trace each other tightlyover time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independentof any strong bh-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling bh and bulgemass until the present is very indirect.

0912.4267	x-ray constraints on the agn properties in spitzer-irs identified z~2  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we report x-ray constraints for 20 of 52 high-z ulirgs identified in thespitzer xfls to constrain their obscuration. notably, decomposition ofspitzer-irs spectra for the 52 objects already indicates that most are weak-pahulirgs dominated by hot-dust continua, characteristic of agn. given theirredshifts, they have agn bolometric luminosities of ~1e45-1e47 erg/s comparableto powerful qsos. this, coupled with their high ir-to-optical ratios and oftensignificant silicate absorption, strongly argues in favor of these mid-irobjects being heavily obscured qsos. at x-ray energies, we marginally detecttwo ulirgs, while the rest have only upper limits. using the irs-derived 5.8umagn continuum luminosity as a proxy for the expected x-ray luminosities, wefind that all of the observed sources must individually be highly obscured,while x-ray stacking limits on the undetected sources suggest that themajority, if not all, are likely to be at least mildly compton-thick (nh&gt;1e24cm-2). with a space density of ~1.4e-7 mpc-3 at z~2, such objects imply a lowerlimit on the obscured agn fraction (i.e., the ratio of agn above and belownh=1e22 cm-2) of &gt;~1.7:1 even among luminous qsos. our findings, which arebased on extensive multi-wavelength constraints including spitzer irs spectra,should aid in the interpretation of similar objects from larger or deepermid-ir surveys, where considerable uncertainty about the source propertiesremains and comparable follow-up is not yet feasible.

0704.1765	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared luminous galaxies at z~2  ii: diagnostics	we present mid-ir spectral decomposition of a sample of 48 spitzer-selectedulirgs spanning z~1-3 and likely l_ir~10^12-10^13lsun. our study aims atquantifying the star-formation and agn processes in these sources which recentresults suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. todo this, we study the mid-ir contribution of pah emission, continuum, andextinction. about 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. agn) dominatedsources, but ~60% of these show pah emission, suggesting the presence ofstar-formation activity. these sources have redder mid-ir colors than typicaloptically-selected quasars. about 25% of our sample have strong pah emission,but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high5um hot dust continua. however, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest thatstar-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. six of our z~2sources have ew6.2&gt;~0.3um and l_14um&gt;~10^12lsun (implying l_ir&gt;~10^13lsun). atthese luminosities, such high ew6.2 ulirgs do not exist in the local universe.we find a median optical depth at 9.7um of &lt;tau_9.7&gt;=1.4. this is consistentwith local iras-selected ulirgs, but differs from early results onscuba-selected z~2 ulirgs. similar to local ulirgs about 25% of our sample showextreme obscuration (tau_9.7&gt;~3) suggesting buried nuclei. in general, we findthat our sources are similar to local ulirgs, but are an order of magnitudemore luminous. it is not clear whether our z~2 ulirgs are simply scaled-upversions of local ulirgs, or subject to fundamentally different physicalprocesses.

0708.0407	discovery of radio jets in z~2 ulirgs with deep 9.7um silicate  absorption	recent spitzer observations have revealed a substantial population of z~2ulirgs with deep silicate absorption (\tau_{9.7}&gt;1). this paper reports a 20cmradio study of such a sample to elucidate their physical nature. we discoverthat a substantial fraction (40%) of deep silicate absorption ulirgs at z~2 aremoderately radio-loud with l_{1.4ghz}=10^{25}--10^{26}whz^{-1}. this is instrong contrast with z&lt;1 radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars where none ofthe sources with available irs spectra have \tau_{9.7}&gt;1. in addition, weobserve radio jets in two of our sources where one has a double lobe structure~200kpc in extent, and another shows a one-sided jet extending ~90kpc from thenucleus. the likely high inclination of the latter, coupled with its deepsilicate absorption, implies the mid-ir obscuration does not share an axis withthe radio jets. these sources are highly obscured quasars, observed in thetransition stage after the birth of the radio source, but before feedbackeffects dispel the ism and halt the black hole accretion and starburstactivity.

0708.0885	massive lyman break galaxies at z~3 in the spitzer extragalactic first  look survey	we investigate the properties of 1088 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3selected from a ~2.63$ deg2 sub-region of the first look survey field using theground-based multi-color data and the spitzer space telescope mid-infrared dataat 3--8 and 24 um. with the wide area and the broad wavelength coverage, wesample a large number of ``rare'' u-band dropouts which are massive (m* &gt; 10^11msun), allowing us to perform a statistical analysis of these subsets of lbgsthat have not been studied in detail. optically bright (r(ab) &lt; 24.5 mag) lbgsdetected in mid-infrared (s_{3.6um} &gt; 6 ujy) reside at the most massive anddusty end of the lbg population, with relatively high and tight $m/l$ inrest-frame near-infrared. most infrared-luminous lbgs (s_{24um} &gt; 100 ujy) aredusty star-forming galaxies with star formation rates of 100--1000 msun/yr,total infrared luminosity of &gt; 10^12 lsun. by constructing the uv luminosityfunction of massive lbgs, we estimate that the lower limit for the starformation rate density from lbgs more massive than 10^11 msun at z~3 is &gt; 3.3 x10^-3 msun/yr/mpc^3, showing for the first time that the uv-bright populationof massive galaxies alone contributes significantly to the global starformation rate density at z~3. when combined with the star formation ratedensities at z &lt; 2, our result reveals a steady increase in the contribution ofmassive galaxies to the global star formation from z=0 to z=3, providing strongsupport to the downsizing of galaxy formation.

1008.2932	decomposing star formation and active galactic nucleus with spitzer  mid-infrared spectra: luminosity functions and co-evolution	we present spitzer 7-38um spectra for a 24um flux limited sample of galaxiesat z~0.7 in the cosmos field. the detailed high-quality spectra allow us tocleanly separate star formation (sf) and active galactic nucleus (agn) inindividual galaxies. we first decompose mid-infrared luminosity functions(lfs). we find that the sf 8um and 15um lfs are well described by schechterfunctions. agns dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads tothe shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared lfs. the totalinfrared (8-1000um) lf from 70um selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-endslope than the bolometrically corrected sf 15um lf, owing to the intrinsicdispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. we thenstudy the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes(bhs). seven of the 31 luminous infrared galaxies with spitzer spectra hostluminous agns, implying an agn duty cycle of 23+/-9%. the time-averaged ratioof bh accretion rate and sf rate matches the local m_bh-m_bulge relation andthe m_bh-m_host relation at z ~ 1. these results favor co-evolution scenariosin which bh growth and intense sf happen in the same event but the former spansa shorter lifetime than the latter. finally, we compare our mid-infraredspectroscopic selection with other agn identification methods and discusscandidate compton-thick agns in the sample. while only half of the mid-infraredspectroscopically selected agns are detected in x-ray, ~90% of them can beidentified with their near-infrared spectral indices.

1009.0445	mid-infrared spectroscopy of spitzer-selected ultra-luminous starbursts  at z~2	we want to study the mid-infrared properties and the starburst and agncontributions, of 24um sources at z~2, through analysis of mid-infrared spectracombined with millimeter, radio, and infrared photometry. mid-infraredspectroscopy allows us to recover accurate redshifts. a complete sample of 16spitzer-selected sources (ulirgs) believed to be starbursts at z~2("5.8um-peakers") was selected in the (0.5 sq.deg.) j1064+56 swire lockman holefield. these sources have s(24um)&gt;0.5mjy, a stellar emission peak redshifted to5.8um, and r'(vega)&gt;23. the entire sample was observed with the low resolutionunits of the spitzer/irs infrared spectrograph. these sources have 1.2mmobservations with iram 30m/mambo and very deep 20cm observations from the vla.nine of our sources also benefit from 350um observation and detection fromcso/sharc-ii. the entire sample shows good quality irs spectra dominated bystrong pah features. the main pah features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um havehigh s/n average luminosities of 2.90, 10.38, 3.62, and 2.29x10^{10}lsun,respectively. we derived accurate redshifts spanning from 1.75 to 2.28. theaverage of these redshifts is 2.017. this result confirms that the selectioncriteria of "5.8um-peakers" associated with a strong detection at 24um arereliable to select sources at z~2. we have analyzed the different correlationsbetween pah emission and infrared, millimeter, and radio emission. practicallyall our sources are strongly dominated by starburst emission. we have alsodefined two subsamples based on the equivalent width at 7.7um to investigateagn contributions. our sample contains strong starbursts and represents aparticularly 24um-bright class of smgs. the very good correlation between pahand far-ir luminosities is now confirmed in high-z starburst ulirgs. thesesources show a small agn contribution to the mid-ir, around ~20% in most cases.

1009.0767	mergers in double-peaked [o iii] active galactic nuclei	as a natural consequence of galaxy mergers, binary active galactic nuclei(agns) should be commonplace. nevertheless, observational confirmations arerare, especially for binaries with separations less than ten kpc. such a systemmay show two sets of narrow emission lines in a single spectrum owing to theorbital motion of the binary. we have obtained high-resolution near-infraredimages of 50 double-peaked [o iii] 5007 agns with the keck ii laser guide staradaptive optics system. the sloan digital sky survey sample is compiled fromthe literature and consists of 17 type-1 agns between 0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.56 and 33type-2 agns between 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.24. the new images reveal eight type-1 andeight type-2 sources that are apparently undergoing mergers. these are strongcandidates of kpc-scale binary agns, because they show multiple componentsseparated between 0.6 and 12 kpc and often disturbed morphologies. because mostof the type-1s are at higher redshifts than the type-2s, the higher mergerfraction of type-1s (47+/-20%) compared to that of type-2s (24+/-10%) can beattributed to the general evolution of galaxy merger fraction with redshift.furthermore, we show that agn mergers are outliers of the m_bh-sigma relationbecause of over-estimated stellar velocity dispersions, illustrating theimportance of removing mergers from the samples defining the m_bh-sigmarelations. finally, we find that the emission-line properties areindistinguishable for spatially resolved and unresolved sources, emphasizingthat scenarios involving a single agn can produce the same double-peaked lineprofiles and they account for at least 70% of the double-peaked [o iii] agns.

1103.3711	extended schmidt law: role of existing stars in current star formation	we propose an "extended schmidt law" with explicit dependence of the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) on the stellar mass surface density. thisrelation has a power-law index of 0.48+-0.04 and an 1-sigma observed scatter onthe sfe of 0.4 dex, which holds over 5 orders of magnitude in the stellardensity for individual global galaxies including various types especially thelow-surface-brightness (lsb) galaxies that deviate significantly from thekennicutt-schmidt law. when applying it to regions at sub-kpc resolution of asample of 12 spiral galaxies, the extended schmidt law not only holds for lsbregions but also shows significantly smaller scatters both within and acrossgalaxies compared to the kennicutt-schmidt law. we argue that this new relationpoints to the role of existing stars in regulating the sfe, thus encodingbetter the star formation physics. comparison with physical models of starformation recipes shows that the extended schmidt law can be reproduced by somemodels including gas free-fall in a stellar-gravitational potential andpressure-supported star formation. by implementing this new law into theanalytic model of gas accretion in lambda cdm, we show that it can re-producethe observed main sequence of star-forming galaxies (a relation between the sfrand stellar mass) from z=0 up to z=2.

1107.3564	the nature of double-peaked [o iii] active galactic nuclei	active galactic nuclei (agns) with double-peaked [o iii] lines are suspectedto be sub-kpc or kpc-scale binary agns. however, pure gas kinematics canproduce the same double-peaked line profile in spatially integrated spectra.here we combine integral-field spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging of 42double-peaked [o iii] agns from sloan digital sky survey to investigate theconstituents of the population. we find two binary agns where theline-splitting is driven by the orbital motion of the merging nuclei. suchobjects account for only ~2% of the double-peaked agns. almost all (~98%) ofthe double-peaked agns were selected because of gas kinematics; and half ofthose show spatially resolved narrow-line regions that extend 4-20 kpc from thenuclei. serendipitously, we find two spectrally unresolved binary agns wheregas kinematics produced the double-peaked [o iii] lines. the relativelyfrequent serendipitous discoveries indicate that only ~1% of binary agns wouldappear double-peaked in sloan spectra and 2.2_{-0.8}^{+2.5}% of all sloan agnsare binary agns. therefore, the double-peaked sample does not offer muchadvantage over any other agn samples in finding binary agns. the binary agnfraction implies an elevated agn duty cycle (8_{-3}^{+8}%), suggesting galaxyinteractions enhance nuclear accretion. we illustrate that integral-fieldspectroscopy is crucial for identifying binary agns: several objects previouslyclassified as "binary agns" with long-slit spectra are most likely single agnswith extended narrow-line regions. the formation of extended narrow-lineregions driven by radiation pressure is also discussed.

1109.0008	a kiloparsec-scale binary active galactic nucleus confirmed by the  expanded very large array	we report the confirmation of a kpc-scale binary active galactic nucleus(agn) with high-resolution radio images from the expanded very large array(evla). sdss j150243.1+111557 is a double-peaked [o iii] agn at z = 0.39selected from the sloan digital sky survey. our previous near-infrared adaptiveoptics imaging reveals two nuclei separated by 1.4" (7.4 kpc), and our opticalintegral-field spectroscopy suggests that they are a type-1--type-2 agn pair.however, these data alone cannot rule out the single agn scenario where thenarrow emission-line region associated with the secondary is photoionized bythe broad-line agn in the primary. our new evla images at 1.4, 5.0, and 8.5 ghzshow two steep-spectrum compact radio sources spatially coincident with theoptical nuclei. the radio power of the type-2 agn is an order-of-magnitude inexcess of star-forming galaxies with similar extinction-corrected [o ii] 3727luminosities, indicating that the radio emission is powered by accretion.therefore, sdss j150243.1+111557 is one of the few confirmed kpc-scale binaryagn systems. spectral-energy-distribution modeling shows that sdssj150243.1+111557 is a merger of two ~10^{11} m_sun galaxies. with both blackhole masses around 10^8 msun, the agns are accreting at ~10 times below theeddington limit.

1201.2943	origin of the 12um emission across galaxy populations from wise and sdss  surveys	we cross-matched wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) sources brighterthan 1 mjy at 12um with the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxyspectroscopic catalog to produce a sample of ~10^5 galaxies at &lt;z&gt;=0.08, thelargest of its kind. this sample is dominated (70%) by star-forming (sf)galaxies from the blue sequence, with total ir luminosities in the range~10^8-10^12 l_sun. we identify which stellar populations are responsible formost of the 12um emission. we find that most (~80%) of the 12um emission in sfgalaxies is produced by stellar populations younger than 0.6 gyr. in contrast,the 12um emission in weak agn (l[oiii]&lt;10^7 l_sun) is produced by older stars,with ages of ~1-3 gyr. we find that l_[12um] linearly correlates with stellarmass for sf galaxies. at fixed 12um luminosity, weak agn deviate toward highermasses since they tend to be hosted by massive, early-type galaxies with olderstellar populations. star-forming galaxies and weak agn follow differentl_[12um]-sfr (star formation rate) relations, with weak agn showing excess 12umemission at low sfr (~0.02-1 m_sun/yr). this is likely due to dust grainsheated by older stars. while the specific star formation rate (ssfr) of sfgalaxies is nearly constant, the ssfr of weak agn decreases by ~3 orders ofmagnitude, reflecting the very different star formation efficiencies between sfgalaxies and massive, early-type galaxies. stronger type ii agn in our sample(l_[oiii]&gt;10^7 l_sun), act as an extension of massive sf galaxies, connectingthe sf and weak agn sequences. this suggests a picture where galaxies formstars normally until an agn (possibly after a starburst episode) starts togradually quench the sf activity. we also find that 4.6-12um color is a usefulfirst-order indicator of sf activity in a galaxy when no other data areavailable.

1204.2020	the infrared properties of sources matched in the wise all-sky and  herschel-atlas surveys	we describe the infrared properties of sources detected over ~36 deg^2 of skyin the gama 15-hr equatorial field, using data from both the herschelastrophysical terahertz large-area survey (h-atlas) and wide-field infraredsurvey (wise). with 5-sigma point-source depths of 34 and 0.048 mjy at 250micron and 3.4 micron, respectively, we are able to identify 50.6% of theh-atlas sources in the wise survey, corresponding to a surface density of ~630deg^{-2}. approximately two-thirds of these sources have measured spectroscopicor optical/near-ir photometric redshifts of z&lt;1. for sources with spectroscopicredshifts at z&lt;0.3, we find a linear correlation between the infraredluminosity at 3.4 micron and that at 250 micron, with +-50% scatter over ~1.5orders of magnitude in luminosity, ~10^9 - 10^{10.5} l_sun. by contrast, thematched sources without previously measured redshifts (r&gt;~20.5) have 250-350micron flux density ratios that suggest either high-redshift galaxies (z&gt;~1.5)or optically faint low-redshift galaxies with unusually low temperatures(t&lt;~20). their small 3.4-250 micron flux ratios favor a high-redshift galaxypopulation, as only the most actively star-forming galaxies at low redshift(e.g., arp 220) exhibit comparable flux density ratios. furthermore, we find arelatively large agn fraction (~30%) in a 12 micron flux-limited subsample ofh-atlas sources, also consistent with there being a significant population ofhigh-redshift sources in the no-redshift sample.

1205.0811	mid-infrared selection of agn with the wide-field infrared survey  explorer. i. characterizing wise-selected agn in cosmos	the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) is an extremely capable andefficient black hole finder. we present a simple mid-infrared color criterion,w1-w2 \geq 0.8 (i.e., [3.4]-[4.6] \geq 0.8, vega), which identifies 61.9 \pm5.4 agn candidates per deg2 to a depth of w2 = 15.0. this implies a much largercensus of luminous agn than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable tothe fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) andobscured (type 2) agn. optical and soft x-ray surveys alone are highly biasedtowards only unobscured agn, while this simple wise selection likely identifieseven heavily obscured, compton-thick agn. using deep, public data in the cosmosfield, we explore the properties of wise-selected agn candidates. at themid-infrared depth considered, 160 ujy at 4.6 microns, this simple criterionidentifies 78% of spitzer mid-infrared agn candidates according to the criteriaof stern et al. (2005) and the reliability is 95%. we explore the demographics,multiwavelength properties and redshift distribution of wise-selected agncandidates in the cosmos field.

1208.5517	the first hyper-luminous infrared galaxy discovered by wise	we report the discovery by the wide-field infrared survey explorer of the z =2.452 source wise j181417.29+341224.9, the first hyperluminous source found inthe wise survey. wise 1814+3412 is also the prototype for an all-sky sample of~1000 extremely luminous "w1w2-dropouts" (sources faint or undetected by wiseat 3.4 and 4.6 microns and well detected at 12 or 22 microns). the wise dataand a 350 micron detection give a minimum bolometric luminosity of 3.7 x 10^13lsun, with ~10^14 lsun plausible. followup images reveal four nearby sources: aqso and two lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z = 2.45, and an m dwarf star. thebrighter lbg dominates the bolometric emission. gravitational lensing isunlikely given the source locations and their different spectra and colors. thedominant lbg spectrum indicates a star formation rate ~300 msun/yr, accountingfor &lt; 10% of the bolometric luminosity. strong 22 micron emission relative to350 microns implies that warm dust contributes significantly to the luminosity,while cooler dust normally associated with starbursts is constrained by anupper limit at 1.1 mm. radio emission is ~10x above the far-infrared/radiocorrelation, indicating an active galactic nucleus is present. an obscured agncombined with starburst and evolved stellar components can account for theobservations. if the black hole mass follows the local m_bh-bulge massrelation, the implied eddington ratio is &gt;~4. wise 1814+3412 may be a heavilyobscured object where the peak agn activity occurred prior to the peak era ofstar formation.

1208.5518	submillimeter follow-up of wise-selected hyperluminous galaxies	we have used the caltech submillimeter observatory (cso) to follow-up asample of wise-selected, hyperluminous galaxies, so called w1w2-dropoutgalaxies. this is a rare (~ 1000 all-sky) population of galaxies at highredshift (peaks at z=2-3), that are faint or undetected by wise at 3.4 and 4.6um, yet are clearly detected at 12 and 22 um. the optical spectra of most ofthese galaxies show significant agn activity. we observed 14 high-redshift (z &gt;1.7) w1w2-dropout galaxies with sharc-ii at 350 to 850 um, with 9 detections;and observed 18 with bolocam at 1.1 mm, with five detections. warm spitzerfollow-up of 25 targets at 3.6 and 4.5 um, as well as optical spectra of 12targets are also presented in the paper. combining wise data with observationsfrom warm spitzer and cso, we constructed their mid-ir to millimeter spectralenergy distributions (seds). these seds have a consistent shape, showingsignificantly higher mid-ir to submm ratios than other galaxy templates,suggesting a hotter dust temperature. we estimate their dust temperatures to be60-120 k using a single-temperature model. their infrared luminosities are wellover 10^{13} lsun. these seds are not well fitted with existing galaxytemplates, suggesting they are a new population with very high luminosity andhot dust. they are likely among the most luminous galaxies in the universe. weargue that they are extreme cases of luminous, hot dust-obscured galaxies(dogs), possibly representing a short evolutionary phase during galaxy mergingand evolution. a better understanding of their long-wavelength properties needsalma as well as herschel data.

1209.1855	spitzer photometry of wise-selected brown dwarf and hyper-luminous  infrared galaxy candidates	we present spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry and positions for a sampleof 1510 brown dwarf candidates identified by the wise all-sky survey. of these,166 have been spectroscopically classified as objects with spectral types m(1),l(7), t(146), and y(12); sixteen other objects are non-(sub)stellar in nature.the remainder are most likely distant l and t dwarfs lacking spectroscopicverification, other y dwarf candidates still awaiting follow-up, and assortedother objects whose spitzer photometry reveals them to be background sources.we present a catalog of spitzer photometry for all astrophysical sourcesidentified in these fields and use this catalog to identify 7 fainter (4.5$\mu$m $\sim$ 17.0 mag) brown dwarf candidates, which are possibly wide-fieldcompanions to the original wise sources. to test this hypothesis, we use asample of 919 spitzer observations around wise-selected high-redshifthyper-luminous infrared galaxy (hylirg) candidates. for this control sample wefind another 6 brown dwarf candidates, suggesting that the 7 companioncandidates are not physically associated. in fact, only one of these 7 spitzerbrown dwarf candidates has a photometric distance estimate consistent withbeing a companion to the wise brown dwarf candidate. other than this there isno evidence for any widely separated ($&gt;$ 20 au) ultra-cool binaries. as anadjunct to this paper, we make available a source catalog of $\sim$ 7.33$\times 10^5$ objects detected in all of these spitzer follow-up fields for useby the astronomical community. the complete catalog includes the spitzer 3.6and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry, along with positionally matched $b$ and $r$photometry from usno-b; $j$, $h$, and $k_s$ photometry from 2mass; and $w1$,$w2$, $w3$, and $w4$ photometry from the wise all-sky catalog.

1209.2065	characterizing the mid-ir extragalactic sky with wise and sdss	the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) has completed its all-skysurvey at 3.4-22 micron. we merge the wise data with optical sdss data andprovide a phenomenological characterization of mid-ir, extragalactic sources.wise is most sensitive at 3.4micron(w1) and least at 22micron(w4). the w1 bandprobes massive early-type galaxies out to z\gtrsim1. this is more distant thansdss identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of3.4micron sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r&gt;22.2). in contrast,92-95% of 12 and 22micron sources have sdss optical counterparts with r&lt;22.2.wise 3.4micron detects 89.8% of the entire sdss qso catalog at snr(w1)&gt;7, butonly 18.9% at 22micron with snr(w4)&gt;5. we show that wise colors alone areeffective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forminggalaxies and strong agn/qsos at z&lt;3. we highlight three major applications ofwise colors: (1) selection of strong agn/qsos at z&lt;3 using w1-w2&gt;0.8 andw2&lt;15.2 criteria, producing a census of this population. the surface density ofthese strong agn/qso candidates is 67.5+-0.14/deg^2. (2) selection ofdust-obscured, type-2 agn/qso candidates. we show that wise w1-w2&gt;0.8, w2&lt;15.2combined with r-w2&gt;6 (vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 agncandidates. the fraction of these type-2 agn candidates is 1/3rd of all wisecolor-selected agns. (3) selection of ulirgs at z\sim2 with extremely redcolors, r-w4&gt;14 or well-detected 22micron sources lacking detections in the 3.4and 4.6micron bands. the surface density of z~2 r-w4&gt;14 ulirgs is0.9+-0.07/deg^2 at snr(w4)&gt;5 (flux(w4)&gt;=2.5mjy), which is consistent with thatinferred from smaller area spitzer surveys. optical spectroscopy of a smallnumber of these high-redshift ulirgs confirms our selection, and reveals apossible trend that optically fainter or r-w4 redder candidates are at higherredshifts.

1209.6055	mid-infrared selection of active galactic nuclei with the wide-field  infrared survey explorer. ii. properties of wise-selected active galactic  nuclei in the ndwfs bo\"otes field	stern et al.(2012) presented a study of wise selection of agn in the 2 deg^2cosmos field, finding that a simple criterion w1-w2&gt;=0.8 provides a highlyreliable and complete agn sample for w2&lt;15.05, where the w1 and w2 passbandsare centered at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, respectively. here we extend this studyusing the larger 9 deg^2 noao deep wide-field survey bootes field which alsohas considerably deeper wise observations than the cosmos field, and find thatthis simple color-cut significantly loses reliability at fainter fluxes. wedefine a modified selection criterion combining the w1-w2 color and the w2magnitude to provide highly reliable or highly complete agn samples for fainterwise sources. in particular, we define a color-magnitude cut that finds 130+/-4deg^-2 agn candidates for w2&lt;17.11 with 90% reliability. using the extensive uvthrough mid-ir broad-band photometry available in this field, we study thespectral energy distributions of wise agn candidates. as expected, the wise agnselection is biased towards objects where the agn dominates the bolometricluminosity output, and that it can identify highly obscured agn. we study thedistribution of reddening in the agn sample and discuss a formalism to accountfor sample incompleteness based on the step-wise maximum-likelihood method ofefstathiou et al.(1988). the resulting dust obscuration distributions dependstrongly on agn luminosity, consistent with the trend expected for a simpson(2005) receding torus. at l_agn~3x10^44 erg/s, 29+/-7% of agn are observed astype 1, while at ~4x10^45 erg/s the fraction is 64+/-13%. the distribution ofobscuration values suggests that dust in the torus is present as both a diffusemedium and in optically thick clouds.

1210.6347	modeling mid-infrared diagnostics of obscured quasars and starbursts	we analyze the link between active galactic nuclei (agn) and mid-infraredflux using dust radiative transfer calculations of starbursts realized inhydrodynamical simulations. focusing on the effects of galaxy dust, we evaluatediagnostics commonly used to disentangle agn and star formation inultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we examine these quantities as afunction of time, viewing angle, dust model, agn spectrum, and agn strength inmerger simulations representing two possible extremes of the ulirg population:one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other is characteristic ofextremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2 to 4. this highly obscured burst beginsstar-formation-dominated with significant pah emission, and ends with a ~10^9yr period of red near-ir colors. at coalescence, when the agn is most luminous,dust obscures the near-infrared agn signature, reduces the relative emissionfrom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), and enhances the 9.7 micronabsorption by silicate grains. although generally consistent with previousinterpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguouslyestimate the agn luminosity fraction in all cases. motivated by thesimulations, we show that a combination of the extinction feature at 9.7micron, the pah strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneouslyconstrain the agn fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range ofobscuration. we find that this indicator, accessible to the james webb spacetelescope, may estimate the agn power as tightly as the hard x-ray flux alone,thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for largesamples of distant ulirgs.

1303.2152	connection between mid-infrared emission properties and narrow line  region outflows in type 1 active galactic nuclei	the location of warm dust producing the mid-infrared (mir) emission in type 1active galactic nuclei (agns) is complex and not yet fully known. we explorethis problem by studying how the mir covering factor (cf_{mir}=l_{mir}/l_{bol}) correlates with the fundamental parameters of agn accretionprocess (such as l_{bol}, black hole mass mbh, and eddington ratio l/ledd) andthe properties of narrow emission lines (as represented by [o iii] 5007), usinglarge data sets derived from the sloan digital sky spectroscopic survey (sdss)and the wide infrared sky survey (wise). firstly we find that the luminosity ofthe [o iii] wing component (lwing) correlates more tightly with the continuumluminosity (l5100) than the luminosity of the line core component (lcore) does,which is in line with our previous conclusion that the wing component,generally blueshifted, originates from the polar outflows in the innernarrow-line region (nlr). we then find that the mir cf shows the strongestcorrelation with lwing/l_{bol} rather than with lcore/l_{bol} or the abovefundamental agn parameters, and the correlation becomes stronger as theinfrared wavelength increases. we also confirm the anti-correlations ofcf_{mir} with l_{bol} and mbh, and the lack of dependence of cf_{mir} on theeddington ratio. these results suggest that a large fraction of the warm dustproducing mir emission in agns is likely embedded in polar outflows in the nlrinstead of in the torus.

1309.2277	the angular clustering of wise-selected agn: different haloes for  obscured and unobscured agn	we calculate the angular correlation function for a sample of 170,000 agnextracted from the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) catalog, selectedto have red mid-ir colors (w1 - w2 &gt; 0.8) and 4.6 micron flux densitiesbrighter than 0.14 mjy). the sample is expected to be &gt;90% reliable atidentifying agn, and to have a mean redshift of z=1.1. in total, the angularclustering of wise-agn is roughly similar to that of optical agn. wecross-match these objects with the photometric sdss catalog and distinguishobscured sources with (r - w2) &gt; 6 from bluer, unobscured agn. obscured sourcespresent a higher clustering signal than unobscured sources. since the hostgalaxy morphologies of obscured agn are not typical red sequence ellipticalgalaxies and show disks in many cases, it is unlikely that the increasedclustering strength of the obscured population is driven by a host galaxysegregation bias. by using relatively complete redshift distributions from thecosmos survey, we find obscured sources at mean redshift z=0.9 have a bias of b= 2.9 \pm 0.6 and are hosted in dark matter halos with a typical mass oflog(m/m_odot)~13.5. in contrast, unobscured agn at z~1.1 have a bias of b = 1.6\pm 0.6 and inhabit halos of log(m/m_odot)~12.4. these findings suggest thatobscured agn inhabit denser environments than unobscured agn, and are difficultto reconcile with the simplest agn unification models, where obscuration isdriven solely by orientation.

0802.1050	hst nicmos imaging of z~2, 24 micron-selected ultraluminous infrared  galaxies	we present hubble space telescope nicmos h-band imaging of 33 ultraluminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2 that were selected from the 24 micron catalogof the spitzer extragalactic first look survey. the images reveal that at least17 of the 33 objects are associated with interactions. up to one fifth of thesources in our sample could be minor mergers whereas only 2 systems are mergingbinaries with luminosity ratio &lt;=3:1, which is characteristic of local ulirgs.the rest-frame optical luminosities of the sources are of the order 10^10-10^11l_sun and their effective radii range from 1.4 to 4.9 kpc. the most compactsources are either those with a strong active nucleus continuum or those with aheavy obscuration in the mid-infrared regime, as determined from spitzerinfra-red spectrograph data. the luminosity of the 7.7 micron feature producedby polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules varies significantly among compactsystems whereas it is typically large for extended systems. a bulge-to-diskdecomposition performed for the 6 brightest (m_h&lt;20) sources in our sampleindicates that they are best fit by disk-like profiles with small or negligiblebulges, unlike the bulge-dominated remnants of local ulirgs. our resultsprovide evidence that the interactions associated with ultraluminous infraredactivity at z~2 can differ from those at z~0.

1404.7159	alma imaging of gas and dust in a galaxy protocluster at redshift 5.3:  [cii] emission in "typical" galaxies and dusty starbursts ~1 billion years  after the big bang	we report interferometric imaging of [cii] and oh emission toward the centerof the galaxy protocluster associated with the z=5.3 submillimeter galaxy (smg)aztec-3, using the atacama large (sub)millimeter array (alma). we detect strong[cii], oh, and rest-frame 157.7 um continuum emission toward the smg. the [cii]emission is distributed over a scale of 3.9 kpc, implying a dynamical mass of9.7 x 10^10 msun, and a star formation rate (sfr) surface density of sigma_sfr= 530 msun/yr/kpc2. this suggests that aztec-3 forms stars at sigma_sfrapproaching the eddington limit for radiation pressure supported disks. we findthat the oh emission is slightly blueshifted relative to the [cii] line, whichmay indicate a molecular outflow associated with the peak phase of thestarburst. we also detect and dynamically resolve [cii] emission over a scaleof 7.5 kpc toward a triplet of lyman-break galaxies with moderate uv-based sfrsin the protocluster at ~95kpc projected distance from the smg. these galaxiesare not detected in the continuum, suggesting far-infrared sfrs of &lt;18-54msun/yr, consistent with a uv-based estimate of 22 msun/yr. the spectral energydistribution of these galaxies is inconsistent with nearby spiral and starburstgalaxies, but resembles those of dwarf galaxies. this is consistent withexpectations for young starbursts without significant older stellarpopulations. this suggests that these galaxies are significantlymetal-enriched, but not heavily dust-obscured, "normal" star-forming galaxiesat z&gt;5, showing that alma can detect the interstellar medium in "typical"galaxies in the very early universe.

1410.1751	the most luminous galaxies discovered by wise	we present 20 wise-selected galaxies with bolometric luminosities l_bol &gt;10^14 l_sun, including five with infrared luminosities l_ir = l(rest 8-1000micron) &gt; 10^14 l_sun. these "extremely luminous infrared galaxies," or elirgs,were discovered using the "w1w2-dropout" selection criteria which requiresmarginal or non-detections at 3.4 and 4.6 micron (w1 and w2, respectively) butstrong detections at 12 and 22 micron in the wise survey. their spectral energydistributions are dominated by emission at rest-frame 4-10 micron, suggestingthat hot dust with t_d ~ 450k is responsible for the high luminosities. thesegalaxies are likely powered by highly obscured agns, and there is no evidencesuggesting these systems are beamed or lensed. we compare this wise-selectedsample with 116 optically selected quasars that reach the same l_bol level,corresponding to the most luminous unobscured quasars in the literature. wefind that the rest-frame 5.8 and 7.8 micron luminosities of the wise-selectedelirgs can be 30-80% higher than that of the unobscured quasars. the existenceof agns with l_bol &gt; 10^14 l_sun at z &gt; 3 suggests that these supermassiveblack holes are born with large mass, or have very rapid mass assembly. forblack hole seed masses ~ 10^3 m_sun, either sustained super-eddington accretionis needed, or the radiative efficiency must be &lt;15%, implying a black hole withslow spin, possibly due to chaotic accretion.

1411.0685	radio-selected binary active galactic nuclei from the very large array  stripe 82 survey	galaxy mergers play an important role in the growth of galaxies and theirsupermassive black holes. simulations suggest that tidal interactions couldenhance black hole accretion, which can be tested by the fraction of binaryactive galactic nuclei (agns) among galaxy mergers. but determining thefraction requires a statistical sample of binaries. we have identifiedkpc-scale binary agns directly from high-resolution radio imaging. inside the92 square deg covered by the high-resolution very large array survey of thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82 field, we identified 22 grade a and30 grade b candidates of binary radio agns with angular separations less than5" (10 kpc at z = 0.1). eight of the candidates have optical spectra for bothcomponents from the sdss spectroscopic surveys and our keck program. two gradeb candidates are projected pairs, but the remaining six candidates are allcompelling cases of binary agns based on either emission line ratios or theexcess in radio power compared to the h-alpha-traced star formation rate. onlytwo of the six binaries were previously discovered by an optical spectroscopicsearch. based on these results, we estimate that ~60% of our binary candidateswould be confirmed once we obtain complete spectroscopic information. weconclude that wide-area high-resolution radio surveys offer an efficient methodto identify large samples of binary agns. these radio-selected binary agnscomplement binaries identified at other wavelengths and are useful forunderstanding the triggering mechanisms of black hole accretion.

0805.0263	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared luminous galaxies at z~2  iii: far-ir to radio properties and optical spectral diagnostics	we present the far-ir, millimeter, and radio photometry as well as opticaland near-ir spectroscopy of a sample of 48 z~1-3 spitzer-selected ulirgs withirs mid-ir spectra. our goals are to compute their bolometric emission, and todetermine both the presence and relative strength of their agn and starburstcomponents. we find that strong-pah sources tend to have higher 160um and 1.2mmfluxes than weak-pah sources. the depth of the 9.7um silicate feature does notaffect mambo detectability. we fit the far-ir seds of our sample and find anaverage &lt;l_{ir}&gt;~7x10^{12}lsun for our z&gt;1.5 sources. spectral decompositionsuggests that strong-pah sources typically have ~20-30% agn fractions. weak-pahsources by contrast tend to have &gt;~70% agn fractions, with a few sources havingcomparable contributions of agn and starbursts. the optical line diagnosticssupport the presence of agn in the bulk of the weak-pah sources. with oneexception, our sources are narrow-line sources, show no obvious correspondencebetween the optical extinction and the silicate feature depth, and, in twocases, show evidence for outflows. radio agn are present in both strong-pah andweak-pah sources. this is supported by our sample's far-ir-to-radio ratios (q)being consistently below the average value of 2.34 for local star-forminggalaxies. we use survival analysis to include the lower-limits given by theradio-undetected sources, arriving at &lt;q&gt;=2.07+/-0.01 for our z&gt;1.5 sample. intotal, radio and, where available, optical line diagnostics support thepresence of agn in 57% of the z&gt;1.5 sources, independent of ir-baseddiagnostics. for higher-z sources, the agn luminosities alone are estimated tobe &gt;10^{12}lsun, which, supported by the [oiii] luminosities, implies that thebulk of our sources host obscured quasars.

1508.04420	detection of broad h$\alpha$ emission lines in the late-time spectra of  a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova	iptf13ehe is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=0.3434, witha slow-evolving light curve and spectral features similar to sn2007bi. it riseswithin (83-148)days (rest-frame) to reach a peak bolometric luminosity of1.3x$10^{44}$erg/s, then decays very slowly at 0.015mag. per day. the measuredejecta velocity is 13000km/s. the inferred explosion characteristics, such asthe ejecta mass (67-220$m_\odot$), the total radiative and kinetic energy($10^{51}$ &amp; 2x$10^{53}$erg respectively), is typical of a slow-evolving h-poorslsn event. however, the late-time spectrum taken at +251days reveals a balmerhalpha emission feature with broad and narrow components, which has never beendetected before among other h-poor slsne. the broad component has a velocitywidth of ~4500km/s and has a ~300km/s blue-ward shift relative to the narrowcomponent. we interpret this broad h$\alpha$ emission with luminosity of$\sim$2$\times10^{41}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ as resulting from the interaction betweenthe supernova ejecta and a discrete h-rich shell, located at a distance of$\sim4\times10^{16}$\,cm from the explosion site. this ejecta-csm interactioncauses the rest-frame r-band lc to brighten at late times. the fact that thelate-time spectra are not completely absorbed by the shock ionized csm shellimplies that its thomson scattering optical depth is likely &lt;1, thus settingupper limits on the csm mass &lt;30$m_\odot$ and the volume number density&lt;4x$10^8cm^{-3}$. of the existing models, a pulsational pair instabilitysupernova model can naturally explain the observed 30$m_\odot$ h-shell, ejectedfrom a progenitor star with an initial mass of (95-150)$m_\odot$ about 40 yearsago. we estimate that at least $\sim$15\%\ of all slsne-i may have late-timebalmer emission lines.

1510.02806	the role of star-formation and agn in dust heating of z = 0.3-2.8  galaxies - i. evolution with redshift and luminosity	we characterize infrared spectral energy distributions of 343 (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies from $z=0.3-2.8$. we diagnose the presence of an agnby decomposing individual spitzer mid-ir spectroscopy into emission fromstar-formation and an agn-powered continuum; we classify sources asstar-forming galaxies (sfgs), agn, or composites. composites comprise 30% ofour sample and are prevalent at faint and bright $s_{24}$, making them animportant source of ir agn emission. we combine spectroscopy withmultiwavelength photometry, including herschel imaging, to create threelibraries of publicly available templates (2-1000 $\mu$m). we fit the far-iremission using a two temperature modified blackbody to measure cold and warmdust temperatures ($t_c$ and $t_w$). we find that $t_c$ does not depend onmid-ir classification, while $t_w$ shows a notable increase as the agn growsmore luminous. we measure a quadratic relationship between mid-ir agn emissionand total agn contribution to $l_{\rm ir}$. agn, composites, and sfgs separatein $s_8/s_{3.6}$ and $s_{250}/s_{24}$, providing a useful diagnostic forestimating relative amounts of these sources. we estimate that &gt;40% of irselected samples host an agn, even at faint selection thresholds ($s_{24}$&gt;100$\mu$jy). our decomposition technique and color diagnostics are relevant givenupcoming observations with the james webb space telescope.

1511.03283	binary active galactic nuclei in stripe 82: constraints on synchronized  black hole accretion in major mergers	representing simultaneous black hole accretion during a merger, binary activegalactic nuclei (agns) could provide valuable observational constraints tomodels of galaxy mergers and agn triggering. high-resolution radiointerferometer imaging offers a promising method to identify a large anduniform sample of binary agns, because it probes a generic feature of nuclearactivity and is free from dust obscuration. our previous search yielded 52strong candidates of kpc-scale binaries over the 92 deg$^2$ of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82 area with 2"-resolution very large array(vla) images. here we present 0.3"-resolution vla 6 ghz observations for sixcandidates that have complete optical spectroscopy. the new data confirm thebinary nature of four candidates and identify the other two as line-of-sightprojections of radio structures from single agns. the four binary agns at $z\sim 0.1$ reside in major mergers with projected separations of 4.2-12 kpc.optical spectral modeling shows that their hosts have stellar masses between$10.3 &lt; log(m_\star/m_\odot) &lt; 11.5$ and velocity dispersions between $120 &lt;\sigma_\star &lt; 320$ km/s. the radio emission is compact ($&lt;$0.4") and showsteep spectrum ($-1.8 &lt; \alpha &lt; -0.5$) at 6 ghz. the host galaxy propertiesand the eddington-scaled accretion rates broadly correlate with the excitationstate, similar to the general radio-agn population at low redshifts. ourestimated binary agn fraction indicates that simultaneous accretion occurs$&gt;23^{+15}_{-8}$% of the time when a kpc-scale galaxy pair is detectable as aradio-agn. the high duty cycle of the binary phase strongly suggests that majormergers can trigger and synchronize black hole accretion.

astro-ph;0108161	probing the evolution of galaxies using redshifted h-alpha emission	in this paper we review the present status and implications of h-alphasurveys at various redshifts. with the advent of sensitive wide-formatnear-infrared detectors on large telescopes, deep and extensive h-alpha surveysare now feasible to redshift z~2.5. the cosmic star formation history cantherefore be traced out to this redshift using h-alpha alone, avoidingcomplications arising from the comparison of different tracers at differentredshifts. the h-alpha surveys to date confirm the rapid increase in luminositydensity from z=0 out to z=1, and show that this increase flattens off at higherredshifts, remaining approximately constant out to at least z~2.2. we alsodiscuss the prospects for determining the masses of high redshift galaxiesbased on emission lines. a set of high-quality h-alpha rotation curves ofsamples of disk galaxies at a number of different redshifts would allow a studyof the evolution of the tully-fisher relation and address fundamental issues indisk galaxy formation. such a program remains challenging even with present-daylarge telescopes.

astro-ph;0109205	the corals survey i: new estimates of the number density and gas content  of damped lyman alpha systems free from dust bias	(abridged) we present the first results from the complete optical and radioabsorption line system (corals) survey. we have compiled a homogeneous sampleof radio-selected qsos from the parkes catalogue and searched for damped lymanalpha systems (dlas) towards every target, irrespective of its opticalmagnitude. this approach circumvents selection effects -- particularly fromintervening dust -- which have long been suspected to affect dla surveys inoptically-selected, magnitude-limited qso samples. the corals data set consistsof 66 z_em &gt; 2.2 qsos in which 22 dlas with absorption redshifts 1.8 &lt; z_abs &lt;z_em have been identified over a total redshift interval delta z = 55.46. inthis first paper of the corals series we describe the sample, presentintermediate resolution spectroscopy and determine the population statistics ofdlas. we deduce a value of the neutral gas mass density traced by dlas(expressed as a fraction of the closure density) log omega_dla h =-2.59^{+0.17}_{-0.24}, and a number density of dlas per unit redshift n(z) =0.31^{+0.09}_{-0.08}, both at a mean redshift &lt;z&gt; = 2.37. taking into accountthe errors, we conclude that dust-induced bias in previous surveys may have ledto an underestimate of these quantities by at most a factor of two and we havenot uncovered a previously unrecognised population of high column density dlasin front of faint qsos.

astro-ph;0112135	the corals survey ii: clues to galaxy clustering around qsos from z_abs  ~ z_em damped lyman alpha systems	we present a list of z_abs ~ z_em (delta v &lt; 3000 km/s) dlas discoveredduring the corals survey for absorbers in a radio-selected qso sample. on theassumption that z_abs ~ z_em dlas are neither ejecta from the qso, nor part ofthe host galaxy itself, we use the number density statistics of these dlas toinvestigate galaxy clustering near the qso redshift. we find that n(z) of z_abs\~z_em dlas in our radio-selected qso sample is ~4 times larger than the numberdensity of intervening dlas, implying an excess of galaxies near the qso. thisresult is further supported with the inclusion of the radio-loud qsos in thefirst survey, although the total number of dlas is still small (4) and theresult is currently only significant at approximately the 2 sigma level. sinceall of the z_abs ~ z_em dlas we identify in corals are found towards opticallybright (b &lt; 20) qsos, there is no strong evidence (based on these limitedstatistics) that this population suffers from a severe dust bias. we compareour results with those from an optically-selected, radio-quiet qso sample inorder to determine whether there is evidence for an excess of galaxies aroundradio-loud versus radio-quiet qsos. we find that the n(z) of z_abs ~ z_em dlastowards radio-quiet qsos is in agreement with the number density of interveningabsorbers. this result, although currently limited by the small numberstatistics of our survey, supports the conclusion that radio-loud quasars arefound preferentially in rich galaxy environments at high redshift. finally, wereport that one of the new z_abs ~ z_em dlas discovered by corals has someresidual flux in the base of the lya trough which may be due to lya emission,either from star formation in the dla galaxy or from gas photoionised by theqso.

(2) the 12 emission line systems have the samenumber of disk and bulge galaxies as in the remaining 12 pure absorption linesystems. we conclude that spectral classes do not have a simple, directcorrespondence with morphological types. (3) three eros could be isolated, purepassively evolving early-type galaxies at $z\sim 1$. this implies that only asmall fraction (10%--15%) of early-type galaxies are formed in a rapid burst ofstar formation at high redshifts and evolved passively since then.

(2) 2% of the sample(85/sq.degrees) have colors similar to dust reddened agns, like mrk231 atz~0.6-3. (3) we anticipate that some of these sources with extremely red colorsmay be new types of sources, since they can not be modelled with any familiartype of spectral energy distribution. we find that 17% of the 24um sources haveno detectable optical counterparts brighter than r limit of 25.5mag. opticalspectroscopy of these optical extremely faint 24um sources would be verydifficult, and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the spitzer would be critical forunderstanding their physical nature (abridged).

astro-ph;0701283	the infrared luminosity function of galaxies at redshifts z=1 and z~2 in  the goods fields	we present the rest-frame 8 micron luminosity function (lf) at redshifts z=1and ~2, computed from spitzer 24 micron-selected galaxies in the goods fieldsover an area of 291 sq. arcmin. using classification criteria based on x-raydata and irac colours, we identify the agn in our sample. the rest-frame 8micron lf for star-forming galaxies at redshifts z=1 and ~2 have the same shapeas at z~0, but with a strong positive luminosity evolution. the number densityof star-forming galaxies with log_{10}(nu l_nu(8 micron))&gt;11 increases by afactor &gt;250 from redshift z~0 to 1, and is basically the same at z=1 and ~2.the resulting rest-frame 8 micron luminosity densities associated with starformation at z=1 and ~2 are more than four and two times larger than at z~0,respectively. we also compute the total rest-frame 8 micron lf for star-forminggalaxies and agn at z~2 and show that agn dominate its bright end, which iswell-described by a power-law. using a new calibration based on spitzerstar-forming galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;0.6 and validated at higher redshifts throughstacking analysis, we compute the bolometric infrared (ir) lf for star-forminggalaxies at z=1 and ~2. we find that the respective bolometric ir luminositydensities are (1.2+/-0.2) x 10^9 and (6.6^{+1.2}_{-1.0}) x 10^8 l_sun mpc^{-3},in agreement with previous studies within the error bars. at z~2, around 90% ofthe ir luminosity density associated with star formation is produced byluminous and ultraluminous ir galaxies (lirg and ulirg), with the twopopulations contributing in roughly similar amounts. finally, we discuss theconsistency of our findings with other existing observational results on galaxyevolution.

astro-ph;9506095	deep optical galaxy counts with the keck telescope	we present faint galaxy counts from deep $vri$ images obtained with the kecktelescope. these images reach $r\sim27$ in median seeing fwhm $\sim 0.5$--0.6arcsec and we detect a integrated galaxy number density of $7\times 10^{5}$degree$^{-2}$, equivalent to $3\times 10^{10}$ galaxies in the observableuniverse. in addition we present median galaxy colors as a function ofmagnitude; bluing trends are visible in all colors to $r\sim 24.5$. fainterthan $r\sim24.5$, however, the typical \vr\ color becomes redder again, \vi\remains constant, and \ri\ becomes yet bluer. these trends are consistent withthe $vri$ count slopes, implying a decrease in the $v$ slope at the faintestlevels, which our data supports. taking advantage of our good seeing we alsopresent median half-light radii for faint galaxies, these show a steady declineat fainter magnitudes, leading to an intrinsic half-light radius of $\sim 0.2$arcsec for a typical $r\sim25.5$--26 galaxy. irrespective of the redshiftdistribution, the extremely high galaxy surface densities and their smallintrinsic sizes are consistent with a scenario in which the majority of thevery faint field population are dwarf galaxies or sub-galactic units.

astro-ph;9607033	starcounts redivivus ii: deep starcounts with keck and hst and the  luminosity function of the galactic halo	we have combined deep starcount data with galaxy model predictions toinvestigate how effectively such measurements probe the faint end of the haloluminosity function. we have tested a number of star/galaxy classificationtechniques using images taken in 0.5 arcsecond seeing with lris on the kecktelescope, and we find that different combinations of these techniques canproduce variations of 10 \% in the inferred starcounts at r=22.5 and 30 \% atr=24.5 magnitudes. the decreasing average angular size of galaxies with faintermagnitude effectively limits ground-based work to r $&lt;$ 25.5 magnitudes. thehigher angular resolution provided by hst allows one to probe at least 2magnitudes fainter, but the small field-size is a significant limitation. ineither case, our models show that the contribution from halo subdwarfs iseffectively limited to colours of (r-i) $&lt;$ 1.0, with the redder stars beingmembers of the galactic disk. the apparent increase in number density for m$_v&gt; 10$ in the derived luminosity function is a result of contributions from diskstars at fainter absolute magnitudes and does not provide evidence for anupturn in the halo subdwarf mass function. indeed, starcount data alone are{\it not} an effective method of probing the shape of the halo luminosityfunction close to the hydrogen-burning limit. finally, we examine how thehubble deep field observations can be used to constrain the contribution ofvarious stellar components to the dark-matter halo.

astro-ph;9607116	a spectroscopic survey for binary stars in the globular cluster ngc5053	we carried out a radial velocity survey for spectroscopic binaries in the lowdensity globular cluster ngc5053. our sample contains a total of 77 clustermember giant and subgiant stars with visual magnitudes of 14.5-18.6. of these77 stars, 66 stars have on average of 3-4 measurements with a total of 236velocities. a typical velocity error per measurement is about 3 km/s. the starsin our sample are spatially distributed from the cluster center out to 10arcminutes in radius (4.5 core radii). among these 66 stars with multiplevelocity measurements, we discovered 6 spectroscopic binary candidates. ofthese six candidates, one was discovered as a binary previously by pryor et al.(1991) and candidate st is a binary with a very short-period of three to fivedays. we obtained three possible orbital solutions for binary candidate st byfitting its radial velocity data. these orbital solutions are consistent withstar st being a cluster member, although its spectrum has much stronger mgitriplet absorption line than that of a typical low-metallicity giant star. weestimated the fraction of binary systems which may have been missed from ourdetection due to unfavorable binary orbital configurations. our survey has abinary discovery efficiency of 29% for systems with 3d &lt; p &lt; 10yr, 0.125 &lt; q &lt;1.75 and eccentric orbits (0 &lt; e &lt; 1). this yields a binary frequency of 29%.with kolmogorov-smirnov (k-s) tests, the hypothesis of a frequency in ngc5053higher than 50% is rejected with a confidence level higher than 85%. weconclude that the binary frequency in ngc5053 is 21-29% with 3d &lt; p &lt; 10yr,0.125 &lt; q &lt; 1.75. this value is somewhat higher than estimates for otherclusters by various surveys. this is perhaps related to the fact that ngc5053is relatively dynamically young compared to other clusters.

astro-ph;9809044	studying the evolution of field galaxies using nicmos/hst parallel  imaging and grism data	we present results from our analysis of f160w nicmos parallel images. thesedata cover $\sim$~9~sq. arcminutes and reach 3$\sigma$ depths of h$=$ 24.3 $-$25.5 in a $0.6''$ diameter aperture with integration times of 2,000 to 13,000seconds. we derive the first deep h band galaxy counts. the slope of the countsfor h$&lt;$ 20 is 0.31, consistent with various k-band measurements from the kecktelescopes. the measured number counts vs. magnitude relation is reasonablywell fitted with no-evolution models with a low $\omega$ value. the half-lightradii of the galaxies declines steeply with apparent magnitude and reaches thenic3 resoltion limit at h$=$23.5. deep ground-based vri imaging of one nicmosfield has revealed an extremely red galaxy with r$-$h $=$ 6 and h of 18.8. ouranalyses of the grism data show that we can reach 3$\sigma$ flux limits of of$1\times 10^{-16}$ to $2\times10^{-17}$ ergs/sec/cm$^2$ for integration timesof 2,000 to 21,000~seconds. we have detected a total of 33 emission linegalaxies. the comoving number density is $\rm \sim 2\times 10^{-4} mpc^{-3}$.the detected emission lines are probably h$_\alpha$~6563\aa. thus, the derivedstar formation rates, without extinction correction, are $10 - 163 m\odot$ peryear for galaxies at redshifts between 0.7 and 1.9.

astro-ph;9904427	the h$\alpha$ luminosity function and global star formation rate from  redshifts of one to two	we present a luminosity function for h$\alpha$ emission from galaxies atredshifts between 0.7 and 1.9 based on slitless spectroscopy with nicmos onhst. the luminosity function is well fit by a schechter function over the range$6 \times 10^{41} &lt; l(h\alpha) &lt; 2 \times 10^{43} erg/sec$ with $l^* = 7 \times10^{42} erg/sec$ and $\phi^* = 1.7 \times 10^{-3} mpc^{-3}$ for $h_0=50 km/smpc^{-1}$ and $q_0=0.5$. we derive a volume averaged star formation rate at $z= 1.3 \pm 0.5$ of 0.13 m_{\odot} yr^{-1} mpc^{-3} without correction forextinction. the sfr that we derive at $\sim 6500 \aa is a factor of 3 higherthan that deduced from 2800 \aa continua. if this difference is due entirely toreddening, the extinction correction at 2800 \aa is quite significant. theprecise magnitude of the total extinction correction at rest-frame uvwavelengths (e.g. 2800 \aa and 1500 \aa) is sensitive to the relative spatialdistribution of the stars, gas and dust, as well as on the extinction law. inthe extreme case of a homogeneous foreground dust screen and a mw or lmcextinction law, we derive a total extinction at 2800 \aa of 2.1 magnitudes, ora factor of 7 correction to the uv luminosity density. if we use the calzettireddening curve, which was derived for the model where stars, gas and dust arewell mixed and nebular gas suffers more extinction than stars, our estimate ofa$_{2800}$ is increased by more than one magnitude.

astro-ph;9906461	the results from the nicmos parallel imaging and grism survey	we present the results of a survey which utilizes the nicmos camera 3parallel grism and imaging observations of random fields. we have identified 33h$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies at 0.75&lt;z&lt;1.9. the inferred co-moving numberdensity of these objects is $3.3\times10^{-4} h_{50}^{3} mpc^{-3}$, verysimilar to that of the bright lyman break objects at $z \sim 3$. the mean starformation rate of these galaxies 21 m$_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ for h_0=50 km/s/mpc.using this sample, we derived the h$\alpha$ luminosity function (lf) at z=1.3.the integrated h$\alpha$ luminosity density at $z \sim 1.3$ is $1.64\times10^{40} h_{50} erg/s mpc^{-3}$, approximately 14 times greater than the localvalue reported by gallego et al. (1995). the volume averaged star formationrate at $z=1.3 \pm 0.5$ is 0.13 m_{\odot} yr^{-1} mpc^{-3}$ without correctionfor extinction. the sfr derived at $\sim 6500$~\aa is a factor of 3 higher thanthat deduced from 2800~\aa continua. we believe that this difference is largelydue to dust extinction. the implied total extinction at 2800\aa is in the rangeof 2 - 4 magnitude. however, the precise determination of the total extinctionis sensitive to the model assumptions.  deep ground-based vri images of the nicmos fields have revealed roughly adozen of extremely red objects (eros) with $r - h &gt; 5$ and $h$ brighter than20.6. the surface density of these objects is around 0.6 per square arcminutes.
