0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

0910.3702	fuzzy supernova templates i: classification	modern supernova (sn) surveys are now uncovering stellar explosions at ratesthat far surpass what the world's spectroscopic resources can handle. in orderto make full use of these sn datasets, it is necessary to use analysis methodsthat depend only on the survey photometry. this paper presents two methods forutilizing a set of sn light curve templates to classify sn objects. in thefirst case we present an updated version of the bayesian adaptive templatematching program (batm). to address some shortcomings of that strictly bayesianapproach, we introduce a method for supernova ontology with fuzzy templates(soft), which utilizes fuzzy set theory for the definition and combination ofsn light curve models. for well-sampled light curves with a modest signal tonoise ratio (s/n&gt;10), the soft method can correctly separate thermonuclear(type ia) sne from core collapse sne with 98% accuracy. in addition, the softmethod has the potential to classify supernovae into sub-types, providingphotometric identification of very rare or peculiar explosions. the accuracyand precision of the soft method is verified using monte carlo simulations aswell as real sn light curves from the sloan digital sky survey and thesupernova legacy survey. in a subsequent paper the soft method is extended toaddress the problem of parameter estimation, providing estimates of redshift,distance, and host galaxy extinction without any spectroscopy.

1002.3637	sky variability in the y band at the lsst site	we have measured spatial and temporal variability in the y band skybrightness over the course of four nights above cerro tololo near cerro pachon,chile, the planned site for the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst). ourwide-angle camera lens provided a 41 deg field of view and a 145 arcsec pixelscale. we minimized potential system throughput differences by deploying a deepdepletion ccd and a filter that matches the proposed lsst y_3 band (970 nm-1030nm). images of the sky exhibited coherent wave structure, attributable toatmospheric gravity waves at 90 km altitude, creating 3%-4% rms spatial skyflux variability on scales of about 2 degrees and larger. over the course of afull night the y_3 band additionally showed highly coherent temporalvariability of up to a factor of 2 in flux. we estimate the mean absolute skylevel to be approximately y_3 = 17.8 mag (vega), or y_3 = 18.3 mag (ab). whileour observations were made through a y_3 filter, the relative sky brightnessvariability should hold for all proposed y bands, whereas the absolute levelsshould more strongly depend on spectral response. the spatial variabilitypresents a challenge to wide-field cameras that require illumination correctionstrategies that make use of stacked sky flats. the temporal variability maywarrant an adaptive y band imaging strategy for lsst, to take advantage oftimes when the sky is darkest.

1003.3465	precise throughput determination of the panstarrs telescope and the  gigapixel imager using a calibrated silicon photodiode and a tunable laser:  initial results	we have used a precision calibrated photodiode as the fundamental metrologyreference in order to determine the relative throughput of the panstarrstelescope and the gigapixel imager, from 400 nm to 1050 nm. our technique usesa tunable laser as a source of illumination on a transmissive flat-fieldscreen. we determine the full-aperture system throughput as a function ofwavelength, including (in a single integral measurement) the mirrorreflectivity, the transmission functions of the filters and the correctoroptics, and the detector quantum efficiency, by comparing the light seen byeach pixel in the ccd array to that measured by a precision-calibrated siliconphotodiode. this method allows us to determine the relative throughput of theentire system as a function of wavelength, for each pixel in the instrument,without observations of celestial standards. we present promising initialresults from this characterization of the panstarrs system, and we usesynthetic photometry to assess the photometric perturbations due to throughputvariation across the field of view.

1003.5724	fuzzy supernova templates ii: parameter estimation	wide field surveys will soon be discovering type ia supernovae (sne) at ratesof several thousand per year. spectroscopic follow-up can only scratch thesurface for such enormous samples, so these extensive data sets will only beuseful to the extent that they can be characterized by the survey photometryalone. in a companion paper (rodney and tonry, 2009) we introduced the softmethod for analyzing sne using direct comparison to template light curves, anddemonstrated its application for photometric sn classification. in this work weextend the soft method to derive estimates of redshift and luminosity distancefor type ia sne, using light curves from the sdss and snls surveys as avalidation set. redshifts determined by soft using light curves alone areconsistent with spectroscopic redshifts, showing a root-mean-square scatter inthe residuals of rms_z=0.051. soft can also derive simultaneous redshift anddistance estimates, yielding results that are consistent with the currentlyfavored lambda-cdm cosmological model. when soft is given spectroscopicinformation for sn classification and redshift priors, the rms scatter inhubble diagram residuals is 0.18 mags for the sdss data and 0.28 mags for thesnls objects. without access to any spectroscopic information, and even withoutany redshift priors from host galaxy photometry, soft can still measurereliable redshifts and distances, with an increase in the hubble residuals to0.37 mags for the combined sdss and snls data set. using monte carlosimulations we predict that soft will be able to improve constraints ontime-variable dark energy models by a factor of 2-3 with each new generation oflarge-scale sn surveys.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

1009.3270	surface brightness fluctuations in the hubble space telescope acs/wfc  f814w bandpass and an update on galaxy distances	we measure surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes in the f814wfilter and g-i colors for nine bright early-type fornax cluster galaxies imagedwith the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs). the goal isto achieve the first systematic sbf calibration for the acs/f814w bandpass.because of its much higher throughput, f814w is more efficient for sbf studiesof distant galaxies than the acs/f850lp bandpass that has been used to studynearby systems. over the color range spanned by the sample galaxies,1.06&lt;g-i&lt;1.32 (ab mag), the dependence of sbf magnitude mbar_i on g-i is linearto a good approximation, with slope $\sim2$. when the f850lp sbf distancemeasurements from the acs fornax cluster survey are used to derive absolutembar_i magnitudes, the dependence on g-i becomes extremely tight, with a slopeof $1.8\pm0.2$ and scatter of 0.03 mag. the small observed scatter indicatesboth that the estimated random errors are correct, and that the intrinsicdeviations from the sbf-color relation are strongly correlated between thef814w and f850lp bandpasses, as expected. the agreement with predictions fromstellar population models is good, both in slope and zero point, indicatingthat our mean fornax distance of 20 mpc is accurate. the models predictcurvature in the relation beyond the color limits of our sample; thus, thelinear calibration should not be extrapolated naively. in the appendices, wereconsider the tonry ground-based and jensen nicmos sbf distance catalogues; weprovide a correction formula to ameliorate the small apparent bias in theformer, and the offset needed to make the latter consistent with other sbfstudies. we also tabulate two new sbf distances to galaxies observed in the acsvirgo cluster survey.

1011.1028	an early warning system for asteroid impact	earth is bombarded by meteors, occasionally by one large enough to cause asignificant explosion and possible loss of life. although the odds of a deadlyasteroid strike in the next century are low, the most likely impact is by arelatively small asteroid, and we suggest that the best mitigation strategy inthe near term is simply to move people out of the way. we describe an "earlywarning" system that could provide a week's notice of most sizable asteroids orcomets on track to hit the earth. this system, dubbed "asteroidterrestrial-impact last alert system" (atlas), comprises two observatoriesseparated by about 100km that simultaneously scan the visible sky twice anight, and can be implemented immediately for relatively low cost. thesensitivity of atlas permits detection of 140m asteroids (100 mton impactenergy) three weeks before impact, and 50m asteroids a week before arrival. anatlas alarm, augmented by other observations, should result in a determinationof impact location and time that is accurate to a few kilometers and a fewseconds. in addition to detecting and warning of approaching asteroids, atlaswill continuously monitor the changing universe around us: most of the variablestars in our galaxy, many micro-lensing events from stellar alignments,luminous stars and novae in nearby galaxies, thousands of supernovae, nearly amillion quasars and active galactic nuclei, tens of millions of galaxies, and abillion stars. with two views per day atlas will make the variable universe asfamiliar to us as the sunrise and sunset.

1012.0306	the acs fornax cluster survey. iv. deprojection of the surface  brightness profiles of early-type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters:  investigating the "core/power-law dichotomy"	although early observations with the hubble space telescope (hst) pointed toa sharp dichotomy among early-type galaxies in terms of the logarithmic slopegamma' of their central surface brightness profiles, several studies in thepast few years have called this finding into question. in particular, recentimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the virgo and fornaxclusters using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board hst have notfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from centralluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of thebest-fitting global sersic model. given that earlier studies also found thatthe dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity densityprofiles of the acs virgo and fornax cluster survey galaxies. having fitted thesurface brightness profiles with modified sersic models, we then deproject thegalaxies using an abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3d of theresulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effectiveradius r_e. we find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuousvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.we introduce a parameter, delta_3d, that measures the central deviation of thedeprojected luminosity profiles from the global sersic fit, showing that thisparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

0709.4488	determining the type, redshift, and age of a supernova spectrum	we present an algorithm to identify the type of an sn spectrum and todetermine its redshift and age. this algorithm, based on the correlationtechniques of tonry &amp; davis, is implemented in the supernova identification(snid) code. it is used by members of ongoing high-redshift sn searches todistinguish between type ia and type ib/c sne, and to identify "peculiar" sneia. we develop a diagnostic to quantify the quality of a correlation betweenthe input and template spectra, which enables a formal evaluation of theassociated redshift error. furthermore, by comparing the correlation redshiftsobtained using snid with those determined from narrow lines in the sn hostgalaxy spectrum, we show that accurate redshifts (with a typical error lessthan 0.01) can be determined for sne ia without a spectrum of the host galaxy.last, the age of an input spectrum is determined with a typical 3-day accuracy,shown here by using high-redshift sne ia with well-sampled light curves. thesuccess of the correlation technique confirms the similarity of some sne ia atlow and high redshifts. the snid code, which is available to the community, canalso be used for comparative studies of sn spectra, as well as comparisonsbetween data and models.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1407.2938	wide, cool and ultracool companions to nearby stars from pan-starrs1	we present the discovery of 61 wide (&gt;5 arcsecond) separation, low-mass(stellar and substellar) companions to stars in the solar neighborhoodidentified from pan-starrs\,1 (ps1) data and the spectral classification of 27previously known companions. our companions represent a selective subsample ofpromising candidates and span a range in spectral type of k7-l9 with theaddition of one da white dwarf. these were identified primarily from adedicated common proper motion search around nearby stars, along with a few asserendipitous discoveries from our pan-starrs1 brown dwarf search. ourdiscoveries include 24 new l dwarf companions and one known l dwarf notpreviously identified as a companion. the primary stars around which wesearched for companions come from a list of bright stars with well-measuredparallaxes and large proper motions from the hipparcos catalog (8583 stars,mostly a-k~dwarfs) and fainter stars from other proper motion catalogues (79170stars, mostly m~dwarfs). we examine the likelihood that our companions arechance alignments between unrelated stars and conclude that this is unlikelyfor the majority of the objects that we have followed-up spectroscopically. wealso examine the entire population of ultracool (&gt;m7) dwarf companions andconclude that while some are loosely bound, most are unlikely to be disruptedover the course of $\sim$10 gyr. our search increases the number of ultracool mdwarf companions wider than 300 au by 88% and increases the number of l dwarfcompanions in the same separation range by 96%. finally, we resolve our new ldwarf companion to hip 6407 into a tight (0.13 arcsecond, 7.4 au) l1+t3 binary,making the system a hierarchical triple. our search for these key benchmarksagainst which brown dwarf and exoplanet atmosphere models are tested hasyielded the largest number of discoveries to date.

1503.02083	a periodically varying luminous quasar at z=2 from the pan-starrs1  medium deep survey: a candidate supermassive black hole binary in the  gravitational wave-driven regime	supermassive black hole binaries (smbhbs) should be an inevitable consequenceof the hierarchical growth of massive galaxies through mergers, and thestrongest sirens of gravitational waves (gws) in the cosmos. and yet, theirdirect detection has remained elusive due to the compact (sub-parsec) orbitalseparations of gravitationally bound smbhbs. here we exploit a theoreticallypredicted signature of a smbhb in the time domain: periodic variability causedby a mass accretion rate that is modulated by the binary's orbital motion. wereport our first significant periodically varying quasar detection from thesystematic search in the pan-starrs1 (ps1) medium deep survey. our smbhbcandidate, pso j334.2028+01.4075, is a luminous radio-loud quasar at $z=2.060$,with extended baseline photometry from the catalina real-time transient survey,as well as archival spectroscopy from the first bright quasar survey. theobserved period ($542 \pm 15$ days) and estimated black hole mass ($\log(m_{\rm bh}/m_\odot) = 9.97 \pm 0.50$), correspond to an orbital separation of$7^{+8}_{-4}$ schwarzschild radii ($\sim 0.006^{+0.007}_{-0.003}$ pc), assumingthe rest-frame period of the quasar variability traces the orbital period ofthe binary. this smbhb candidate, discovered at the peak redshift for smbhmergers, is in a physically stable configuration for a circumbinary accretiondisk, and within the regime of gw-driven orbital decay. our search with ps1 isa benchmark study for the exciting capabilities of lsst, which will have ordersof magnitude larger survey power, and will potentially pinpoint the locationsof thousands of smbhbs in the variable night sky.

astro-ph;0011223	the sbf survey of galaxy distances. iv. sbf magnitudes, colors, and  distances	we report data for $i$ band surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes,v-i colors, and distance moduli for 300 galaxies. the survey contains e, s0 andearly-type spiral galaxies in the proportions of 49:42:9, and is essentiallycomplete for e galaxies to hubble velocities of 2000 km/s, with a substantialsampling of e galaxies out to 4000 km/s. the median error in distance modulusis 0.22 mag.  we also present two new results from the survey. (1) we compare the meanpeculiar flow velocity (bulk flow) implied by our distances with predictions oftypical cold dark matter transfer functions as a function of scale, and findvery good agreement with cold, dark matter cosmologies if the transfer functionscale parameter $\gamma$, and the power spectrum normalization $\sigma_8$ arerelated by $\sigma_8 \gamma^{-0.5} \approx 2\pm0.5$. derived directly fromvelocities, this result is independent of the distribution of galaxies ormodels for biasing. the modest bulk flow contradicts reports of large-scale,large-amplitude flows in the $\sim200$ mpc diameter volume surrounding oursurvey volume. (2) we present a distance-independent measure of absolute galaxyluminosity, \nbar, and show how it correlates with galaxy properties such ascolor and velocity dispersion, demonstrating its utility for measuring galaxydistances through large and unknown extinction.

astro-ph;0011288	the infrared surface brightness fluctuation hubble constant	we measured infrared surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) distances to anisotropically-distributed sample of 16 distant galaxies with redshifts reaching10,000 km/s using the near-ir camera and multi-object spectrometer (nicmos) onthe hubble space telescope (hst). the excellent spatial resolution, very lowbackground, and brightness of the ir fluctuations yielded the most distant sbfmeasurements to date. twelve nearby galaxies were also observed and used tocalibrate the f160w (1.6 micron) sbf distance scale. of these, three havecepheid variable star distances measured with hst and eleven have opticali-band sbf distance measurements. a distance modulus of 18.5 mag to the largemagellanic cloud was adopted for this calibration. we present the f160w sbfhubble diagram and find a hubble constant ho=76 +/- 1.3 (1-sigma statistical)+/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result is insensitive to the velocity modelused to correct for local bulk motions. restricting the fit to the six mostdistant galaxies yields the smallest value of ho=72 +/- 2.3 km/s/mpc consistentwith the data. this 6% decrease in the hubble constant is consistent with thehypothesis that the local group inhabits an under-dense region of the universe,but is also consistent with the best-fit value of ho=76 km/s/mpc at the1.5-sigma level.

astro-ph;0105366	reconciliation of the surface brightness fluctuations and type ia  supernovae distance scales	we present hubble space telescope measurements of surface brightnessfluctuations (sbf) distances to early-type galaxies that have hosted type iasupernovae (snia). the agreement in the relative sbf and snia multicolor lightcurve shape and delta-m_15 distances is excellent. there is no systematic scaleerror with distance, and previous work has shown that sbf and snia giveconsistent ties to the hubble flow. however, we confirm a systematic offset ofabout 0.25 mag in the distance zero points of the two methods, and we tracethis offset to their respective cepheid calibrations. sbf has in the past beencalibrated with cepheid distances from the h_0 key project team, while sniahave been calibrated with cepheid distances from the team composed of sandage,saha, and collaborators. when the two methods are calibrated in a consistentway, their distances are in superb agreement. until the conflict over the``long'' and ``short'' extragalactic cepheid distances among many galaxies isresolved, we cannot definitively constrain the hubble constant to better thanabout 10%, even leaving aside the additional uncertainty in the distance to thelarge magellanic cloud, common to both cepheid scales. however, recenttheoretical sbf predictions from stellar population models favor the keyproject cepheid scale, while the theoretical snia calibration lies between thelong and short scales. in addition, while the current sbf distance to m31/m32is in good agreement with the rr lyrae and red giant branch distances,calibrating sbf with the longer cepheid scale would introduce a 0.3 mag offsetwith respect to the rr lyrae scale.

astro-ph;0108194	a synthesis of data from fundamental plane and surface brightness  fluctuation surveys	we perform a series of comparisons between distance-independent photometricand spectroscopic properties used in the surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)and fundamental plane (fp) methods of early-type galaxy distance estimation.the data are taken from two recent surveys: the sbf survey of galaxy distancesand the streaming motions of abell clusters (smac) fp survey. we derive arelation between v-i colour and mg_2 index using nearly 200 galaxies anddiscuss implications for galactic extinction estimates and early-type galaxystellar populations. we find that the reddenings from schlegel et al (1998) forgalaxies with $e(b{-}v) \gta 0.2$ mag appear to be overestimated by 5--10%, butwe do not find significant evidence for large-scale dipole errors in theextinction map. in comparison to stellar population models having solarelemental abundance ratios, the galaxies in our sample are generally too blueat a given mg_2; we ascribe this to the well-known enhancement of the$\alpha$-elements in luminous early-type galaxies. we confirm a tight relationbetween stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and the sbf `fluctuation count'parameter \nbar, which is a luminosity-weighted measure of the total number ofstars in a galaxy. the correlation between \nbar and $\sigma$ is even tighterthan that between mg_2 and $\sigma$. finally, we derive fp photometricparameters for 280 galaxies from the sbf survey data set. comparisons withexternal sources allow us to estimate the errors on these parameters and derivethe correction necessary to bring them onto the smac system. the data are usedin a companion paper which compares the distances derived from the fp and sbfmethods.

astro-ph;0111183	early-type galaxy distances from the fundamental plane and surface  brightness fluctuations	we compare two methods for deriving distances to early-type galaxies:fundamental plane (fp) and surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) distances for170 galaxies. a third set of distances is provided by predictions derived fromthe density field of the iras redshift survey. overall there is good agreement.however, several nearby, low-luminosity, mainly s0 galaxies have systematicallylow fp distances; we conclude that this is at least partly due to recent starformation and consequently low mass-to-light ratios. the tie between thecepheid-calibrated sbf distances (mpc) and the far-field calibrated fpdistances (km/s) yields a hubble constant h_0 = 68 +/- 3 km/s/mpc, while thecomparison between sbf and the iras-reconstructed distances yields h_0 = 74 +/-2 (internal errorbars). possible explanations for the marginal inconsistencyinclude systematic errors in the redshift survey completeness estimates or inthe fp aperture corrections, but at this point, the best estimate of h_0 fromearly-type galaxies may be a simple average of the above two estimates. afterrevising the sbf distances to be in agreement with the final set of key projectcepheid distances, we conclude h_0 = 73 +/- 4 +/- 11, where the second errorbarrepresents the total systematic uncertainty in the distance zero point. we alsodiscuss the recently introduced "fluctuation star count" parameter nbar as aless demanding alternative to (v-i) for calibrating sbf distances. thenbar-calibrated sbf method is akin to a hybrid sbf-fp distance indicator, andwe find that the use of nbar actually improves the sbf distances. further studyof nbar would provide useful constraints for elliptical galaxy formationmodels.

(1998a) and perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernovaluminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. more importantly, theyextend the redshift range of consistently observed sn ia to z~1, where thesignature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausiblesystematic effects. consequently, these measurements not only provide anotherquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitutea powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.we find a rate for sn ia of 1.4+/-0.5e-04 h^3/mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of0.5. we present distances and host extinctions for 230 sn ia. these place thefollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then h0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and o_l - 1.4o_m = 0.35+/-0.14. including the constraint of a flat universe, we find o_m =0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. adopting aprior based on the 2df redshift survey constraint on o_m and assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy liesin the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. if we further assume that w&gt;-1,we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence. these constraints are similar in precisionand in value to recent results reported using the wmap satellite, also incombination with the 2df redshift survey.

astro-ph;0506314	the acs virgo cluster survey v: sbf calibration for giant and dwarf  early-type galaxies	as part of the advanced camera for survey (acs) virgo cluster survey, we havemeasured surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 100 early-typevirgo galaxies. distances derived from these measurements are needed to explorethe three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster, study the intrinsicparameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, andcompare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosityfunctions. our sbf measurements have been performed in the f850lp bandpass ofthe wide field channel of the acs on the hubble space telescope. these are thefirst measurements of this kind, and we present the first sbf calibration forthis bandpass. the measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar populationvariations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 andz_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the f475w and f850lp acsfilters. we derive the following calibration for the absolute sbf magnitudem_850: m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in therange 1.3 &lt;(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.6, and m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 &lt;=(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.3. physically,the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giantellipticals and s0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. forthe first time in sbf studies, we are able to provide a firm empiricalcalibration of sbf in early-type dwarf galaxies. our results agree with stellarpopulation model predictions from bruzual &amp; charlot (2003).

astro-ph;0507584	the nn2 flux difference method for constructing variable object light  curves	we present a new method for optimally extracting point-source timevariability information from a series of images. differential photometry isgenerally best accomplished by subtracting two images separated in time, sincethis removes all constant objects in the field. by removing background sourcessuch as the host galaxies of supernovae, such subtractions make possible themeasurement of the proper flux of point-source objects superimposed on extendedsources. in traditional difference photometry, a single image is designated asthe ``template'' image and subtracted from all other observations. thisprocedure does not take all the available information into account and forsub-optimal template images may produce poor results. given n totalobservations of an object, we show how to obtain an estimate of the vector offluxes from the individual images using the antisymmetric matrix of fluxdifferences formed from the n(n-1)/2 distinct possible subtractions and providea prescription for estimating the associated uncertainties. we then demonstratehow this method improves results over the standard procedure of designating oneimage as a ``template'' and differencing against only that image.

astro-ph;0509558	a search for variable stars and planetary occultations in ngc 2301 ii:  variability	we performed r-band time series observations of the young, metal rich opencluster ngc 2301 for 12 nights in feb. 2004. b images were also obtained andcolor magnitude diagrams, having limits of r=19.5 and b=21.5, were produced.only asmall effort was made to determine cluster membership as our magnitudelimits are far deeper than previously published values. our photometricprecision, for the brightest 5 magnitudes of sources, is 1-2 mmag. we determinethat for the $\sim$4000 stars which have time-series data, 56% are variable andof these, approximately 13% are observed to exhibit periodic light curvesranging from tens of minutes to days. we present some examples of the lightcurves obtained and produce cuts in variability space based on parameters suchas color and amplitude. the percentage of variability is approximately equalacross all colors with the majority of variables having amplitudes of 0.15magnitudes or less. in general, redder stars show larger variabilityamplitudes. we find a smooth decline in the number of periodic variables towardlonger period. this decline is probably due to a transition from intrinsic toextrinsic variability and, in part, to our limited observing period of 12nights. essentially all the a and f main sequence stars in our sample arevariable ($\sim$2 mmag and larger) and most present complex light curvescontaining multiple periods suggestive of their inclusion in the $\delta$sctand $\gamma$dor classes. a variable non-cluster member giant and two variablewhite dwarf candidates are discussed. our equational description of variabilityis shown to be an excellent predictive tool for determining the cumulativefraction of variables that will be observed in a photometric survey. our entiredataset is available electronically.

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0509655	the rate of type ia supernovae at high redshift	we derive the rates of type ia supernovae (snia) over a wide range ofredshifts using a complete sample from the ifa deep survey. this sample of morethan 100 snia is the largest set ever collected from a single survey, andtherefore uniquely powerful for a detailed supernova rate (snr) calculation.measurements of the snr as a function of cosmological time offer a glimpse intothe relationship between the star formation rate (sfr) and type ia snr, and mayprovide evidence for the progenitor pathway. we observe a progressivelyincreasing type ia snr between redshifts z~0.3-0.8. the type ia snrmeasurements are consistent with a short time delay (t~1 gyr) with respect tothe sfr, indicating a fairly prompt evolution of snia progenitor systems. wederive a best-fit value of sfr/snr 580 h_70^(-2) m_solar/snia for theconversion factor between star formation and snia rates, as determined for adelay time of t~1 gyr between the sfr and the type ia snr. more completemeasurements of the type ia snr at z&gt;1 are necessary to conclusively determinethe sfr--snr relationship and constrain snia evolutionary pathways.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0602297	the acs virgo cluster survey. vi. isophotal analysis and the structure  of early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the morphology, isophotalparameters and surface brightness profiles for 100 early-type members of thevirgo cluster, from dwarfs (m_b = -15.1 mag) to giants (m_b = -21.8 mag). eachgalaxy has been imaged in two filters, closely resembling the sloan g and zpassbands, using the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope.  dust and complex morphological structures are common, with kiloparsec-scalestellar disks, bars, and nuclear stellar disks seen in 60% of galaxies withintermediate luminosity (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -17), and dust seen in 42% of galaxiesbrighter than m_b = -18.9 mag. dust morphologies range from faint wisps andpatches on tens of parsec scales, to regular, highly organized kpc-scale dustdisks, often showing evidence of recent star formation.  surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters are derived typicallywithin 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for thefaintest systems, with a resolution (fwhm) of 7 pc. based on a parametrizationof the surface brightness profiles in terms of a sersic or core-sersic model,we find that 1) there is no evidence of a bimodal behavior of the slope, gamma,of the profile in the innermost regions; 2) although the brightest galaxieshave shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles (lowest gamma values) arefound in faint dwarf systems; 3) the widely adopted separation of early-typegalaxies between "core" and "power-law" types, which had originally beenprompted by the claim of a clear bimodal distribution of gamma values, isuntenable; and 4) there is no evidence of a structural dichothomy between dwarfand regular ellipticals.

astro-ph;0603252	the acs virgo cluster survey. viii. the nuclei of early-type galaxies	(abridged) the acs virgo cluster survey is an hst program to obtainhigh-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the virgocluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. based on this large,homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency ofnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -15 (66 &lt; f_n &lt; 82%), andfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center ofvirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. resolved stellar nuclei are notpresent in galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -20.5, however, there is no clearevidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence ofnucleation, for a change at m_b ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point betweendwarf and giant galaxies. on average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than atypical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. nuclearluminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than m_b ~-17.6, nuclear colors. comparing the nuclei to the "nuclear clusters" found inlate-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosityand overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is ratherinsensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. the meannuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the meansbh-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detectedsupermassive black holes (sbhs). we argue that compact stellar nuclei might bethe low-mass counterparts of the sbhs detected in the bright galaxies, and thatone should think in terms of "central massive objects" -- either sbhs orcompact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-typegalaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.

astro-ph;0603840	a fundamental relation between compact stellar nuclei, supermassive  black holes, and their host galaxies	imaging surveys with the hubble space telescope (hst) have shown that roughly50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellarnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. wecombine hst imaging for early-type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster surveywith ground-based long-slit spectra from kpno to show that the masses ofcompact stellar nuclei in virgo cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation withthe masses of the host galaxies. the same correlation is obeyed by thesupermassive black holes (sbhs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. thecompact stellar nuclei in the local group galaxies m33 and ngc205 are alsofound to fall along this same scaling relation. these results indicate that ageneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a central massiveobject (cmo) -- either a sbh or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains amean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. in galaxies with massesgreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, sbhs appear to be the dominantmode of cmo formation.

astro-ph;0604285	toward 1% photometry: end-to-end calibration of astronomical telescopes  and detectors	we review the systematic uncertainties that have plagued attempts to obtainhigh precision and high accuracy from ground-based photometric measurementsusing ccds. we identify two main challenges in breaking through the 1%precision barrier: 1) fully characterizing atmospheric transmission, along theinstrument's line of sight, and 2) properly identifying, measuring and removinginstrumental artifacts. we discuss approximations and limitations inherent inthe present methodology, and we estimate their contributions to systematicphotometric uncertainties. we propose an alternative conceptual scheme for therelative calibration of astronomical apparatus: the availability of calibrateddetectors whose relative spectral sensitivity is known to better than one partin $10^3$ opens up the possibility of in situ relative throughput measurements,normalized to a precision calibrated detector, using a stable but uncalibratednarrowband light source. an implementation scheme is outlined, which exploitsthe availability of tunable lasers to map out the relative wavelength responseof an imaging system, using a flatfield screen and a calibrated referencephotodiode. the merits and limitations of this scheme are discussed. in tandemwith careful measurements of atmospheric transmission, this approach couldpotentially lead to reliable ground-based photometry with fractionaluncertainties below the percent level.

astro-ph;0605707	the discovery of cepheids and a distance to ngc 5128	we discuss a new distance to ngc 5128 (centaurus a) based on cepheidvariables observed with the hubble space telescope. twelve f555w (v) and sixf814w (i) epochs of cosmic-ray-split wide field planetary camera 2 observationswere obtained. a total of 56 bona-fide cepheids were discovered, with periodsranging from 5 to ~50 days; five of these are likely population ii cepheids ofthe w virginis class, associated with the bulge or halo of ngc 5128. based onthe period and v and i-band luminosities of a sub-sample of 42 classical (popi) cepheids, and adopting a large magellanic cloud distance modulus andextinction of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and e(b-v)=0.10 mag, respectively, the truereddening-corrected distance modulus to ngc 5128 is mu_0 = 27.67 +/- 0.12(random)+/- 0.16 (systematic) mag, corresponding to a distance of 3.42 +/- 0.18(random) +/- 0.25 (systematic) mpc. the random uncertainty in the distance isdominated by the error on the assumed value for the ratio of total to selectiveabsorption, r_v, in ngc 5128, and by the possible metallicity dependence of thecepheid period-luminosity relation at v and i. this represent the firstdetermination of a cepheid distance to an early-type galaxy.

astro-ph;0609079	the acs virgo cluster survey. xiv. analysis of color-magnitude relations  in globular cluster systems	we examine the correlation between globular cluster (gc) color and magnitudeusing hst/acs imaging for a sample of 79 early-type galaxies (-21.7&lt;m_b&lt;-15.2mag) with accurate sbf distances from the acs virgo cluster survey. using thekmm mixture modeling algorithm, we find a highly significant correlation,d(g-z)/dz = -0.037 +- 0.004, between color and magnitude for the subpopulationof blue gcs in the co-added gc color-magnitude diagram of the three brightestvirgo galaxies (m49, m87 and m60): brighter gcs are redder than their faintercounterparts. for the single gc systems of m87 and m60, we find similarcorrelations; m49 does not appear to show a significant trend. there is nocorrelation between (g-z) and m_z for gcs of the red subpopulation. thecorrelation d(g-z)/dg for the blue subpopulation is much weaker than d(g-z)/dz.using monte carlo simulations, we attribute this to the fact that the bluesubpopulation in m_g extends to higher luminosities than the red subpopulation,which biases the kmm fits. the correlation between color and m_z thus is a realeffect. this conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same colordistributions. we identify two environmental dependencies of thecolor-magnitude relation: (1) the slope decreases in significance withdecreasing galaxy luminosity; and (2) the slope is stronger for gcs at smallergalactocentric distances. we examine several mechanisms that might give rise tothe observed color-magnitude relation: (1) presence of contaminators; (2)accretion of gcs from low-mass galaxies; (3) stochastic effects; (4) capture offield stars by individual gcs; and (5) gc self-enrichment. we conclude thatself-enrichment and field-star capture, or a combination of these processes,offer the most promising means of explaining our observations.

astro-ph;0609371	trends in the globular cluster luminosity function of early-type  galaxies	we present results from a study of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) in a sample of 89 early-type galaxies observed as part of the acs virgocluster survey. using a gaussian parametrization of the gclf, we find a highlysignificant correlation between the gclf dispersion, sigma, and the galaxyluminosity, m_b, in the sense that the gc systems in fainter galaxies havenarrower luminosity functions. the gclf dispersions in the milky way and m31are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation betweensigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions thatgclf shape is a function of galaxy hubble type. we show that the sigma - m_brelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)cluster masses in fainter galaxies. we further show that this behavior ismirrored by a steepening of the gc mass function for relatively high masses, m&gt;~ 3 x 10^5 m_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the gclf is not stronglyaffected by dynamical evolution over a hubble time. we argue that this trendarises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation bytheories of cluster formation. finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, thegclf "turns over" at the canonical mass scale of m_to ~ 2 x 10^5 m_sun.however, we find that m_to scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 m_sun) ingalaxies fainter than m_b &gt;~ -18.5, an important consideration if the gclf isto be used as a distance indicator for dwarf ellipticals.

astro-ph;0702496	the acs virgo cluster survey. xii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in early type galaxies	we analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (gcs) belongingto the early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. we haveobtained estimates for a gaussian representation of the gc luminosity function(gclf) for 89 galaxies. we have also fit the gclfs with an "evolved schechterfunction", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-massgcs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initialschechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. we find asignificant trend of the gclf dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sensethat smaller galaxies have narrower gclfs. we show that this narrowing of thegclf in a gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the gc massfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. weargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the gc mass function is mostlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster massfunction. the gclf turnover mass m_to is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5m_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with m_b &gt;~ -18.we show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamicalfriction timescales in smaller galaxies. we probe the variation of the gclf toprojected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the virgo giants m49 and m87,finding that m_to is essentially constant over these spatial scales. our fitsof evolved schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (delta) overa hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 &lt;~ (delta/m_sun) &lt; 10^6 per gc.we agree with previous suggestions that if the full gclf is to be understood inmore detail gclf models will have to include self-consistent treatments ofdynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.

astro-ph;9604168	globular clusters in fornax: does $m^0$ depend on environment?	we present the $v$-band globular cluster luminosity functions (gclfs) of thefornax cluster galaxies ngc 1344, ngc 1380, ngc 1399, and ngc 1404. ourobservations reach to $v = 24.8$, roughly one magnitude beyond the gclfturnover $m^0_v$, with $\sim90\%$ completeness. from the amplitude of thegalaxy surface brightness fluctuations, we also estimate the number of globularclusters fainter than this cutoff magnitude. the gclfs of these galaxies arewell fitted by gaussians; the weighted means of their turnover magnitudes anddispersions are $\langle m^0_v\rangle = 23.88 \pm 0.10$ mag and$\langle\sigma\rangle = 1.35\pm 0.07$ mag. the assumption of a universal valuefor the absolute magnitude of the turnover $m^0_v$ places the fornax cluster$0.13 \pm 0.11$ mag more distant than virgo. however, in light of recentcepheid and other high-precision distance measurements, as well as ongoing hstobservations of gclfs for the purpose of determining the extra-galacticdistance scale, we choose to re-examine the universal gclf hypothesis. based ondata from groups and clusters of galaxies, we find evidence that $m^0_v$becomes fainter as the local density of galaxies increases. we speculate on thepossible cause of this trend; if it is confirmed, gclf observations will beless useful for determining distances, but may provide important informationfor constraining theories of star formation in primordial galaxy halos.

astro-ph;9609113	the sbf survey of galaxy distances. i. sample selection, photometric  calibration, and the hubble constant	we describe a program of surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) measurementsfor determining galaxy distances. this paper presents the photometriccalibration of our sample and of sbf in general. basing our zero point onobservations of cepheid variable stars, we find that the absolute sbf magnitudein the kron-cousins i band correlates well with the mean (v-i)o color of agalaxy according to  m_ibar = (-1.74 +/- 0.07) + (4.5 +/- 0.25) [ (v-i)o - 1.15 ]  for 1.0 &lt; (v-i) &lt; 1.3. this agrees well with theoretical estimates fromstellar population models. comparisons between sbf distances and a variety ofother estimators, including cepheid variable stars, the planetary nebulaluminosity function (pnlf), tully-fisher (tf), dn-sigma, snii, and snia,demonstrate that the calibration of sbf is universally valid and that sbf errorestimates are accurate. the zero point given by cepheids, pnlf, tf (bothcalibrated using cepheids), and snii is in units of mpc; the zero point givenby tf (referenced to a distant frame), dn-sigma and snia is in terms of ahubble expansion velocity expressed in km/s. tying together these two zeropoints yields a hubble constant of h_0 = 81 +/- 6 km/s/mpc. as part of thisanalysis, we present sbf distances to 12 nearby groups of galaxies wherecepheids, snii, and snia have been observed.

astro-ph;9705129	globular clusters in 19 northern abell clusters	we study the globular cluster (gc) populations of 21 giant ellipticalgalaxies in 19 abell clusters. this method, applied here primarily in the rband, is based on the surface brightness fluctuations technique ofextragalactic distance measurement. the sample galaxies range in redshift from5000 to 10,000 \kms, and were selected primarily from the lauer &amp; postman(1994) survey of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs).  we find a tight correlation between the gc specific frequency s_n of thecentral bright galaxy in the cluster and the cluster velocity dispersion. s_nalso correlates well with the cluster x-ray temperature and with the number ofbright neighboring galaxies, less well with the galaxy profile, and onlymarginally with galaxy luminosity and overall cluster richness. it does notcorrelate with cluster morphology class. thus, unlike galaxy luminosity, s_n isdetermined by the cluster mass, or density. to account for this situation, wepropose that the gcs formed early and in proportion to the available mass,while the luminosity growth of the galaxy was later halted, yielding theobserved correlations of s_n with density. we introduce a quantity called$\eta_{gc}$, the number of gcs per unit local cluster mass. for a simplecluster mass model, $\eta_{gc}$ is found to be constant, indicating a uniformgc production rate per unit available mass.  a measurement of the gaussian width $\sigma$ of the gc luminosity function(gclf) is one of the byproducts of our analysis. in the cosmic microwavebackground frame, the mean width for this sample is $&lt; \sigma &gt; = 1.43$ mag,virtually identical to the hst value for m87, the galaxy used to calibrate themean of the gclf in this analysis.

astro-ph;9705165	the orthogonal transfer ccd	we have designed and built a new type of ccd that we call an orthogonaltransfer ccd (otccd), which permits parallel clocking horizontally as well asvertically. the device has been used successfully to remove image motion causedby atmospheric turbulence at rates up to 100 hz, and promises to be a better,cheaper way to carry out image motion correction for imaging than by using fasttip/tilt mirrors. we report on the device characteristics, and find that thelarge number of transfers needed to track image motion does not significantlydegrade the image either because of charge transfer inefficiency or because ofcharge traps. for example, after 100 sec of tracking at 100 hz approximately 3%of the charge would diffuse into a skirt around the point spread function. fournights of data at the michigan-dartmouth-mit (mdm) 2.4-m telescope alsoindicate that the atmosphere is surprisingly benign, in terms of both the speedand coherence angle of image motion. image motion compensation improved imagesharpness by about 0.5 arcsec in quadrature with no degradation over a field ofat least 3 arcminutes.

astro-ph;9708252	the far field hubble constant	we used hst to obtain surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) observations offour nearby brightest cluster galaxies (bcg) to calibrate the bcg hubblediagram of lauer &amp; postman (1992). this bcg hubble diagram contains 114galaxies covering the full celestial sphere and is volume limited to 15,000km/s, providing excellent sampling of the far field hubble flow. the sbf zeropoint is based on the cepheid calibration of the ground i_kc method (tonry etal. 1997) as extended to the wfpc2 f814w filter by ajhar et al. (1997). the bcgglobular cluster luminosity functions give distances essentially identical tothe sbf results. using the velocities and sbf distances of the four bcg alonegives h_0 = 82 +/- 8 km/s/mpc in the cmb frame, valid on ~4,500 km/s scales.use of bcg as photometric redshift estimators allows the bcg hubble diagram tobe calibrated independently of recession velocities, yielding a far field h_0 =89 +/- 10 km/s/mpc with an effective depth of ~11,000 km/s. the error in thiscase is dominated by the photometric cosmic scatter in using bcg as distanceestimators. the concordance of the present results with other recent h_0determinations, and a review of theoretical treatments on perturbations in thenear field hubble flow, argue that going to the far field removes an importantsource of uncertainty, but that there is not a large systematic error to becorrected for to begin with. further improvements in h_0 depend more onunderstanding nearby calibrators than on improved sampling of the distant flow.

astro-ph;9804169	measuring distances using infrared surface brightness fluctuations	surface brightness fluctuations (sbfs) are much brighter in the ir than theyare at optical wavelengths, making it possible to measure greater distancesusing ir sbfs. we report new k' (2.1 micron) sbf measurements of 9 galaxies inthe fornax and eridanus clusters using a 1024^2-pixel hgcdte array. we usedimproved analysis techniques to remove contributions from globular clusters andbackground galaxies, and we assess the relative importance of other sources ofresidual variance. we applied the improved methodology to fornax and eridanusimages and to previously published virgo cluster data. apparent fluctuationmagnitudes were used in conjunction with cepheid distances to m31 and the virgocluster to calibrate the k' sbf distance scale. we find the absolutefluctuation magnitude mk'= -5.61+/-0.12, with an intrinsic scatter to thecalibration of 0.06 mag. no statistically significant change in mk' is detectedas a function of (v-i). our calibration is consistent with constant age andmetallicity stellar population models. the lack of a correlation with (v-i) inthe context of the stellar population models implies that elliptical galaxiesbluer than (v-i)=1.2 have sbfs dominated by younger (5-8 gyr) populations. k'sbfs prove to be a reliable distance indicator as long as the residual variancefrom globular clusters and background galaxies is properly removed. also, it isimportant that a sufficiently high s/n ratio be achieved to allow reliable skysubtraction because residual spatial variance can bias the measurement of thesbf power spectrum.

astro-ph;9809064	velocity dispersion of the gravitational lens 0957+561	0957+561 is the first gravitational lens system to be discovered and firstfor which a time delay was measured. because the system is unusually rich inobservables such as image positions, fluxes, vlbi structure, and polarizationit has been modelled quite extensively. however, since it resides in a clusterproviding substantial convergence, the velocity dispersion of the lensinggalaxy is an important component to models. we have measured this dispersion tobe 288+/-9 kms (1-sigma), which implies a hubble constant of 72+/-7 kms/mpc(1-sigma) according to the preferred fgs model of grogin and narayan, and70+/-7 kms/mpc (1-sigma) using the spls model. the unknown velocity dispersionanisotropy of the central galaxy produces an additional uncertainty of perhaps15% or more. we see no variation in dispersion with position to a radius of+/-3". in addition to a galaxy from the background cluster at z=0.5, our slitserendiptously picked up a galaxy at z = 0.448, and two galaxies which may bepart of a background cluster at a redshift of z=0.91.

astro-ph;9903007	a tully fisher relation for s0 galaxies	we present an i-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) for 18 nearby s0 galaxiesusing kinematics derived from long slit spectroscopy of stellar absorptionlines. our estimates of the circular velocity, v_c, at 2-3 exponential diskscale lengths account for line-of-sight projection and for the stellar randommotions through an asymmetric drift correction. uniform and accurate distancecalibration for all objects is available from surface brightness fluctuationmeasurements of tonry et al. (1998). despite the care taken in estimating bothv_c and m_i, the tfr shows an intrinsic scatter, $\sim 0.7$ mag in m_i, or 0.15in log_10(v_c). this result is surprising, as s0 galaxies appear to have boththe simple kinematics of disk galaxies, and the simple stellar populations ofearly-type galaxies. remarkably, in this sample of overall rotation-dominatedgalaxies, the central stellar velocity dispersion is a better predictor of thetotal i-band luminosity (through the fundamental plane relations) than thecircular speed at several exponential scale lengths. furthermore, the tfrzeropoint, or the mean stellar i-band luminosity at a given v_c, differs byonly $\sim 0.5$ mag between our sample of s0s and mathewson et al.'s (1992)sample of late-type spirals, once both data sets are brought onto a consistentdistance scale. this offset is less than expected if s0s are former spiralgalaxies with prematurely truncated star-formation ($\gtorder 4$ gyrs ago).

astro-ph;9907062	the sbf survey of galaxy distances. ii. local and large-scale flows	we present analysis of local large scale flows using the surface brightnessfluctuation (sbf) survey for the distances to 300 early-type galaxies. ourmodels of the distribution function of mean velocity and velocity dispersion ateach point in space include a uniform thermal velocity dispersion and sphericalattractors whose position, amplitude, and radial shape are free to vary. ourfitting procedure performs a maximum likelihood fit of the model to theobservations. we obtain a hubble constant of ho = 77 +/- 4 +/- 7 km/s/mpc, buta uniform hubble flow is not acceptable fit to the data. inclusion of twoattractors, one of whose fit location coincides with the virgo cluster and theother whose fit location is slightly beyond the centaurus clusters nearlyexplain the peculiar velocities, but the quality of the fit can be furtherimproved by the addition of a quadrupole correction to the hubble flow.although the dipole and quadrupole may be genuine manifestations of moredistant density fluctuations, we find evidence that they are more likely due tonon-spherical attractors. we find no evidence for bulk flows which include ourentire survey volume (r &lt; 3000 km/s); our volume is at rest with respect to thecmb. the fits to the attractors both have isothermal radial profiles (v ~ 1/r)over a range of overdensity between about 10 and 1, but fall off more steeplyat larger radius. the best fit value for the small scale, cosmic thermalvelocity is 180 +/- 14 km/s.

astro-ph;9909222	the extragalactic distance scale key project xxvii. a derivation of the  hubble constant using the fundamental plane and dn-sigma relations in leo i,  virgo, and fornax	using published photometry and spectroscopy, we construct the fundamentalplane and d_n-sigma relations in leo i, virgo and fornax. the published cepheidp-l relations to spirals in these clusters fixes the relation between angularsize and metric distance for both the fundamental plane and d_n-sigmarelations. using the locally calibrated fundamental plane, we infer distancesto a sample of clusters with a mean redshift of cz \approx 6000 \kms, andderive a value of h_0=78+- 5+- 9 km/s/mpc (random, systematic) for the localexpansion rate. this value includes a correction for depth effects in thecepheid distances to the nearby clusters, which decreased the deduced value ofthe expansion rate by 5% +- 5%. if one further adopts the metallicitycorrection to the cepheid pl relation, as derived by the key project, the valueof the hubble constant would decrease by a further 6%+- 4%. these two sourcesof systematic error, when combined with a +- 6% error due to the uncertainty inthe distance to the large magellanic cloud, a +- 4% error due to uncertaintiesin the wfpc2 calibration, and several small sources of uncertainty in thefundamental plane analysis, combine to yield a total systematic uncertainty of+- 11%. we find that the values obtained using either the cmb, or a flow-fieldmodel, for the reference frame of the distant clusters, agree to within 1%. thedn-sigma relation also produces similar results, as expected from thecorrelated nature of the two scaling relations. a complete discussion of thesources of random and systematic error in this determination of the hubbleconstant is also given, in order to facilitate comparison with the othersecondary indicators being used by the key project.
