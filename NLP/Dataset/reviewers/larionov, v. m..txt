0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0903.1754	a third red supergiant rich cluster in the scutum-crux arm	we aim to characterise the properties of a third massive, red supergiantdominated galactic cluster. to accomplish this we utilised a combination ofnear/mid-ir photometry and spectroscopy to identify and classify the propertiesof cluster members, and statistical arguments to determine the mass of thecluster. we found a total of 16 strong candidates for cluster membership, forwhich formal classification of a subset yields spectral types from k3-m4 ia andluminosities between log(l/l_sun)~4.5-4.8 for an adopted distance of 6+/-1 kpc.for an age in the range of 16-20 myr, the implied mass is 2-4x10^4 m_sun,making it one of the most massive young clusters in the galaxy. this discoverysupports the hypothesis that a significant burst of star formation occurred atthe base of scutum-crux arm between 10-20 myr ago, yielding a stellar complexcomprising at least ~10^5m_sun of stars (noting that since the clusteridentification criteria rely on the presence of rsgs, we suspect that the truestellar yield will be significantly higher). we highlight the apparent absenceof x-ray binaries within the star formation complex and finally, given thephysical association of at least two pulsars with this region, discuss theimplications of this finding for stellar evolution and the production andproperties of neutron stars.

0903.3934	synchronous optical and radio polarization variability in the blazar  oj287	we explore the variability and cross-frequency correlation of the fluxdensity and polarization of the blazar oj287, using imaging at 43 ghz with thevery long baseline array, as well as optical and near-infrared polarimetry. thepolarization and flux density in both the optical waveband and the 43 ghzcompact core increased by a small amount in late 2005, and increasedsignificantly along with the near-ir polarization and flux density over thecourse of 10 days in early 2006. furthermore, the values of the electric vectorposition angle (evpa) at the three wavebands are similar. at 43 ghz, the evpaof the blazar core is perpendicular to the flow of the jet, while the evpas ofemerging superluminal knots are aligned parallel to the jet axis. the corepolarization is that expected if shear aligns the magnetic field at theboundary between flows of disparate velocities within the jet. using variationsin flux density, percentage polarization, and evpa, we model the inner jet as aspine-sheath system. the model jet contains a turbulent spine of half-width 1.2degrees and maximum lorentz factor of 16.5, a turbulent sheath with lorentzfactor of 5, and a boundary region of sheared field between the spine andsheath. transverse shocks propagating along the fast, turbulent spine canexplain the superluminal knots. the observed flux density and polarizationvariations are then compatible with changes in the direction of the inner jetcaused by a temporary change in the position of the core if the spine containswiggles owing to an instability. in addition, we can explain a stable offset ofoptical and near-ir percentage polarization by a steepening of spectral indexwith frequency, as supported by the data.

0905.1616	the correlated optical and radio variability of bl lacertae. webt data  analysis 1994-2005	since 1997, bl lacertae has undergone a phase of high optical activity, withthe occurrence of several prominent outbursts. starting from 1999, the wholeearth blazar telescope (webt) consortium has organized various multifrequencycampaigns on this blazar, collecting tens of thousands of data points. one ofthe main issues in the study of this huge dataset has been the search forcorrelations between the optical and radio flux variations, and for possibleperiodicities in the light curves. the analysis of the data assembled duringthe first four campaigns (comprising also archival data to cover the period1968-2003) revealed a fair optical-radio correlation in 1994-2003, with a delayof the hard radio events of ~100 days. moreover, various statistical methodssuggested the existence of a radio periodicity of ~8 years. in 2004 the webtstarted a new campaign to extend the dataset to the most recent observingseasons, in order to possibly confirm and better understand the previousresults. in this campaign we have collected and assembled about 11000 newoptical observations from twenty telescopes, plus near-ir and radio data atvarious frequencies. here, we perform a correlation analysis on the long-termr-band and radio light curves. in general, we confirm the ~100-day delay of thehard radio events with respect to the optical ones, even if longer (~200-300days) time lags are also found in particular periods. the radioquasi-periodicity is confirmed too, but the "period" seems to progressivelylengthen from 7.4 to 9.3 years in the last three cycles. the optical and radiobehaviour in the last forty years suggests a scenario where geometric effectsplay a major role. in particular, the alternation of enhanced and suppressedoptical activity (accompanied by hard and soft radio events, respectively) can

0707.0967	an infrared view of the exor variables: on the case of v1118 ori	we investigate the relationship between the ir observed properties of theexor variables and the mechanisms active during their evolutionary stage. tothis aim, we have constructed a catalog of all the ir (1-100 micron)photometric and spectroscopic observations appearing during the last 30 yearsin the literature. new results of our monitoring program based on near- andmid-ir photometry and near-ir spectroscopy and polarimetry of one object (v1118ori) are presented, complementing those given in a previous paper and relatedto a different activity period. our catalog indicates how the databaseaccumulated so far is inadequate for any statistical study of the exor events.nevertheless, all the observational evidence can be interpreted into a coherentscheme. the sources that present the largest brightness variations tend tobecome bluer while brightening. the scenario of disk accretion based on viscousfriction between particles agrees with the observations. the new results onv1118 ori confirm such a general view. the striking novelty is represented by anear-ir spectrum of v1118 ori taken 1 yr after the last monitored outburst: anyemission line previously detected has now totally disappeared at oursensitivity. for the same source, mid-ir photometry is provided here for thefirst time and allows us to construct a meaningful sed. the first polarimetricdata show that v1118 ori is intrinsically polarized and its spotted, magnetizedsurface becomes recognizable during the less active phases.

0909.4160	bolometric luminosity variations in the luminous blue variable afgl2298	we characterise the variability in the physical properties of the luminousblue variable afgl2298 between 1989-2008. in conjunction with published datafrom 1989-2001, we have undertaken a long term (2001-2008) near-irspectroscopic and photometric observational campaign for this star and utilisea non-lte model atmosphere code to interpret these data. we find afgl2298 tohave been highly variable during the two decades covered by the observationaldatasets. photometric variations of &gt;1.6 mag have been observed in the jhkwavebands; however, these are not accompanied by correlated changes in near-ircolour. non-lte model atmosphere analysis of 4 epochs of k band spectroscopyobtained between 2001-7 suggests that the photometric changes were driven byexpansion and contraction of the stellar photosphere accompanied bycomparatively small changes in the stellar temperature. unclumped mass lossrates throughout this period were modest and directly comparable to those ofother highly luminous lbvs. however, the bolometric luminosity of afgl2298appears to have varied by at least a factor of ~2 between 1989-2008, with itbeing one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy during maximum. comparisonto other lbvs that have undergone non bolometric luminosity conserving`eruptions' shows such events to be heterogeneous, with afgl2298 the leastextreme example. these results - and the diverse nature of both the quiescentlbvs and associated ejecta - may offer support to the suggestion that more thanone physical mechanism is responsible for such behaviour.

0708.2793	webt and xmm-newton observations of 3c 454.3 during the post-outburst  phase. detection of the little and big blue bumps	the blazar 3c 454.3 underwent an unprecedented optical outburst in spring2005. this was first followed by a mm and then by a cm radio outburst, whichpeaked in february 2006. we report on follow-up observations by the webt tostudy the multiwavelength emission in the post-outburst phase. xmm-newtonobservations on july and december 2006 added information on the x-ray and uvfluxes. the source was in a faint state. the radio flux at the higherfrequencies showed a fast decreasing trend, which represents the tail of thebig radio outburst. it was followed by a quiescent state, common at all radiofrequencies. in contrast, moderate activity characterized the nir and opticallight curves, with a progressive increase of the variability amplitude withincreasing wavelength. we ascribe this redder-when-brighter behaviour to thepresence of a "little blue bump" due to line emission from the broad lineregion, which is clearly visible in the source sed during faint states.moreover, the data from the xmm-newton om reveal a rise of the sed in the uv,suggesting the existence of a "big blue bump" due to thermal emission from theaccretion disc. the x-ray spectra are well fitted with a power-law model withphotoelectric absorption, possibly larger than the galactic one. however, thecomparison with previous x-ray observations would imply that the amount ofabsorbing matter is variable. alternatively, the intrinsic x-ray spectrumpresents a curvature, which may depend on the x-ray brightness. in this case,two scenarios are possible.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1103.0183	simultaneous monitoring of the photometric and polarimetric activity of  the young star pv cep in the optical/near-infrared bands	we present the results of a simultaneous monitoring, lasting more than 2years, of the optical and near-infrared photometric and polarimetric activityof the variable protostar pv cep. during the monitoring period, an outburst hasoccurred in all the photometric bands, whose declining phase ($\delta$j$\approx$ 3 mag) lasted about 120 days. a time lag of $\sim$ 30 days betweenoptical and infrared light curves has been measured and interpreted in theframework of an accretion event. this latter is directly recognizable in thesignificant variations of the near-infrared colors, that appear bluer in theoutburst phase, when the star dominates the emission, and redder in decliningphase, when the disk emission prevails. all the observational data have beencombined to derive a coherent picture of the complex morphology of the whole pvcep system, that, in addition to the star and the accretion disk, is composedalso by a variable biconical nebula. in particular, the mutual interactionbetween all these components is the cause of the high value of the polarization($\approx$ 20%) and of its fluctuations. the observational data concur toindicate that pv cep is not a genuine exor star, but rather a more complexobject; moreover the case of pv cep leads to argue about the classification ofother recently discovered young sources in outburst, that have been considered,maybe over-simplifying, as exor.

1110.6463	gamma-ray flaring emission in blazar oj287 located in the jet &gt;14 pc  from the black hole	we combine the fermi-lat light curve of the bl lacertae type blazar oj287with time-dependent multi-waveband flux and linear polarization observationsand submilliarcsecond-scale polarimetric images at lambda=7mm to locate thegamma-ray emission in prominent flares in the jet of the source &gt;14pc from thecentral engine. we demonstrate a highly significant correlation between thestrongest gamma-ray and millimeter-wave flares through monte carlo simulations.the two reported gamma-ray peaks occurred near the beginning of two majormillimeter-wave outbursts, each of which is associated with a linearpolarization maximum at millimeter wavelengths. our very long baseline arrayobservations indicate that the two millimeter-wave flares originated in thesecond of two features in the jet that are separated by &gt;14pc. the simultaneityof the peak of the higher-amplitude gamma-ray flare and the maximum inpolarization of the second jet feature implies that the gamma-ray andmillimeter-wave flares are cospatial and occur &gt;14pc from the central engine.we also associate two optical flares, accompanied by sharp polarization peaks,with the two gamma-ray events. the multi-waveband behavior is most easilyexplained if the gamma-rays arise from synchrotron self compton scattering ofoptical photons from the flares. we propose that flares are triggered byinteraction of moving plasma blobs with a standing shock.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

0801.1236	radio-to-uv monitoring of ao 0235+164 by the webt and swift during the  2006--2007 outburst	the blazar ao 0235+164 was claimed to show a quasi-periodic behaviour in theradio and optical bands. moreover, an extra emission component contributing tothe uv and soft x-ray flux was detected, whose nature is not yet clear. apredicted optical outburst was observed in late 2006/early 2007. we herepresent the radio-to-optical webt light curves during the outburst, togetherwith uv data acquired by swift in the same period. we found the opticaloutburst to be as strong as the big outbursts of the past: starting from lateseptember 2006, a brightness increase of 5 mag led to the outburst peak infebruary 19-21, 2007. we also observed an outburst at mm and then at cmwavelengths, with an increasing time delay going toward lower frequenciesduring the rising phase. cross-correlation analysis indicates that the 1 mm and37 ghz flux variations lagged behind the r-band ones by about 3 weeks and 2months, respectively. these short time delays suggest that the correspondingjet emitting regions are only slightly separated and/or misaligned. incontrast, during the outburst decreasing phase the flux faded contemporaneouslyat all cm wavelengths. this abrupt change in the emission behaviour may suggestthe presence of some shutdown mechanism of intrinsic or geometric nature. thebehaviour of the uv flux closely follows the optical and near-ir one. byseparating the synchrotron and extra component contributions to the uv flux, wefound that they correlate, which suggests that the two emissions have a commonorigin.

1309.1282	the awakening of bl lacertae: observations by fermi, swift, and the  gasp-webt	since the launch of the fermi satellite, bl lacertae has been moderatelyactive at gamma-rays and optical frequencies until may 2011, when the sourcestarted a series of strong flares. the exceptional optical sampling achieved bythe glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) in collaboration with the steward observatory allows us to perform adetailed comparison with the daily gamma-ray observations by fermi. discretecorrelation analysis between the optical and gamma-ray emission revealscorrelation with a time lag of 0 +- 1 d, which suggests cospatiality of thecorresponding jet emitting regions. a better definition of the time lag ishindered by the daily gaps in the sampling of the extremely fast fluxvariations. in general, optical flares present more structure and develop onlonger time scales than corresponding gamma-ray flares. observations at x-raysand at millimetre wavelengths reveal a common trend, which suggests that theregion producing the mm and x-ray radiation is located downstream from theoptical and gamma-ray-emitting zone in the jet. the mean optical degree ofpolarisation slightly decreases over the considered period and in general it ishigher when the flux is lower. the optical electric vector polarisation angle(evpa) shows a preferred orientation of about 15 deg, nearly aligned with theradio core evpa and mean jet direction. oscillations around it increase duringthe 2011-2012 outburst. we investigate the effects of a geometricalinterpretation of the long-term flux variability on the polarisation. a helicalmagnetic field model predicts an evolution of the mean polarisation that is inreasonable agreement with the observations. these can be fully explained byintroducing slight variations in the compression factor in a transverse shockwaves model.

1501.05287	a long-lasting quiescence phase of the eruptive variable v1118 ori	v1118 ori is an eruptive variable belonging to the exor class of pre-mainsequence stars whose episodic outbursts are attributed to disk accretionevents. since 2006, v1118 ori is in the longest quiescence stage ever observedbetween two subsequent outbursts of its recent history. we presentnear-infrared photometry of v1118 ori carried out during the last eight years,along with a complete spectroscopic coverage from 0.35 to 2.5 um. a longtermsampling of v1118 ori in quiescence has never been done, hence we can benefitfrom the current circumstance to determine the lowest values (i.e. the zeroes)of the parameters to be used as a reference for evaluating the physical changestypical of more active phases. a quiescence mass accretion rate between 1--3$\times$ 10$^{-9}$ m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ can be derived and the difference withprevious determinations is discussed. from line emission and ir colors analysisa visual extinction of 1-2 mag is consistently derived, confirming that v1118ori (at least in quiescence) is a low-extinction t tauri star with a bolometricluminosity of about 2.1 l$_{\sun}$. an anti-correlation exists between theequivalent width of the emission lines and the underlying continuum. wesearched the literature for evaluating whether or not such a behaviour is acommon feature of the whole class. the anti-correlation is clearly recognizablefor all the available exors in the optical range (h$\beta$ and h$\alpha$lines), while it is not as much evident in the infrared (pa$\beta$ andbr$\gamma$ lines). the observed anti-correlation supports the accretion-drivenmechanism as the most likely to account for continuum variations.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

0805.1983	the high activity of 3c 454.3 in autumn 2007. monitoring by the webt  during the agile detection	the quasar-type blazar 3c 454.3 underwent a phase of high activity in summerand autumn 2007, which was intensively monitored in the radio-to-optical bandsby the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). the gamma-ray satellite agiledetected this source first in late july, and then in november-december 2007. inthis letter we present the multifrequency data collected by the webt andcollaborators during the second agile observing period, complemented by a fewcontemporaneous data from uvot onboard the swift satellite. the aim is to tracein detail the behaviour of the synchrotron emission from the blazar jet, and toinvestigate the contribution from the thermal emission component. optical datafrom about twenty telescopes have been homogeneously calibrated and carefullyassembled to construct an r-band light curve containing about 1340 data pointsin 42 days. this extremely well-sampled optical light curve allows us to followthe dramatic flux variability of the source in detail. in addition, we showradio-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) at different epochs, whichrepresent different brightness levels. in the considered period, the sourcevaried by 2.6 mag in a couple of weeks in the r band. many episodes of fast(i.e. intranight) variability were observed, most notably on december 12, whena flux increase of about 1.1 mag in 1.5 hours was detected, followed by a steepdecrease of about 1.2 mag in 1 hour. the contribution by the thermal componentis difficult to assess, due to the uncertainties in the galactic, and possiblyalso intrinsic, extinction in the uv band. however, polynomial fitting ofradio-to-uv seds reveals an increasing spectral bending going towards fainterstates, suggesting a uv excess likely due to the thermal emission from theaccretion disc.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

0808.2194	correlated multi-waveband variability in the blazar 3c~279 from 1996 to  2007	we present the results of extensive multi-waveband monitoring of the blazar3c~279 between 1996 and 2007 at x-ray energies (2-10 kev), optical r band, and14.5 ghz, as well as imaging with the very long baseline array (vlba) at 43ghz. in all bands the power spectral density corresponds to "red noise" thatcan be fit by a single power law over the sampled time scales. variations influx at all three wavebands are significantly correlated. the time delaybetween high and low frequency bands changes substantially on time scales ofyears. a major multi-frequency flare in 2001 coincided with a swing of the jettoward a more southerly direction, and in general the x-ray flux is modulatedby changes in the position angle of the jet near the core. the flux density inthe core at 43 ghz--increases in which indicate the appearance of newsuperluminal knots--is significantly correlated with the x-ray flux.  we decompose the x-ray and optical light curves into individual flares,finding that x-ray leads optical variations (xo) in 6 flares, the reverseoccurs in 3 flares (ox), and there is essentially zero lag in 4 flares. uponcomparing theoretical expectations with the data, we conclude that (1) xoflares can be explained by gradual acceleration of radiating electrons to thehighest energies; (2) ox flares can result from either light-travel delays ofthe seed photons (synchrotron self-compton scattering) or gradients in maximumelectron energy behind shock fronts; and (3) events with similar x-ray andoptical radiative energy output originate well upstream of the 43 ghz core,while those in which the optical radiative output dominates occur at ordownstream of the core.

0810.4261	results of webt, vlba and rxte monitoring of 3c 279 during 2006-2007	we present radio-to-optical data taken by the webt, supplemented by vlba andrxte observations, of 3c 279. our goal is to use this extensive database todraw inferences regarding the physics of the relativistic jet. we assemblemultifrequency light curves with data from 30 ground-based observatories andthe space-based instruments, along with linear polarization vs. time in theoptical r band. in addition, we present a sequence of 22 images (withpolarization vectors) at 43 ghz at resolution 0.15 milliarcsec, obtained withthe vlba. we analyse the light curves and polarization, as well as the spectralenergy distributions at different epochs, corresponding to different brightnessstates. the ir-optical-uv continuum spectrum of the variable componentcorresponds to a power law with a constant slope of -1.6, while in the 2.4-10kev x-ray band it varies in slope from -1.1 to -1.6. the steepest x-rayspectrum occurs at a flux minimum. during a decline in flux from maximum inlate 2006, the optical and 43 ghz core polarization vectors rotate by ~300degrees. the continuum spectrum agrees with steady injection of relativisticelectrons with a power-law energy distribution of slope -3.2 that is steepenedto -4.2 at high energies by radiative losses. the x-ray emission at fluxminimum comes most likely from a new component that starts in an upstreamsection of the jet where inverse compton scattering of seed photons fromoutside the jet is important. the rotation of the polarization vector impliesthat the jet contains a helical magnetic field that extends ~20 pc past the 43ghz core.

0811.1164	near infrared spectroscopic monitoring of exor variables: first results	we present low resolution (r approximately 250) spectroscopy in the near-ir(0.8 to 2.5um) of the exor variables. these are the initial results (obtainedduring the period 2007-2008) from a long term photometric and spectroscopicprogram aimed to study the variability in the accretion processes of pre-mainsequence (pms) stars, by correlating the continuum fluctuations with thespectroscopical properties. eight sources have been observed in differentepochs, for a total of 25 acquired spectra. exor spectra show a wide variety ofemission features dominated by hi recombination (paschen and brackett series).we have investigated whether line and continuum variability could be due to avariable extinction, but such hypothesis is applicable only to the peculiarsource pv cep. by comparing the observed spectra with a wind model, mass lossrates in the range (2-10)x10^(-8) m_sun} yr^(-1) are derived, along with otherwind parameters. consistent results are also obtained by assuming that hi linesare due to accretion. co overtone is also detected in the majority of thesources both in absorption and in emission. it appears to come from regionsmore compact than winds, likely the stellar photosphere (when in absorption)and the circumstellar disk (when in emission). nai and cai ir lines behave asthe co does, thus they are thought to arise in the same locations. for sometargets multiple spectra correspond to different activity stages of the source.those exhibiting the largest continuum variation at 2um (deltak &gt; 1 mag)present a significant line flux fading during the continuum declining phases.in particular, co absorption (emission) appears associated to inactive (active)stages, respectively.
