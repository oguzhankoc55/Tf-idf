0905.1042	metal-enriched plasma in protogalactic halos: a survey of n v absorption  in high-z damped &amp; sub-damped lyman-alpha systems	we continue our recent work to characterize the plasma content ofhigh-redshift damped and sub-damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas/sub-dlas), whichrepresent multi-phase gaseous (proto)galactic disks and halos seen toward abackground source. we survey n v absorption in a sample of 91 dlas and 18sub-dlas in the redshift range 1.67&lt;z&lt;4.28 with unblended coverage of the n vdoublet, using data from vlt/uves, keck/hires, and keck/esi. in dlas, we findeight secure n v detections, four marginal detections, and 79 non-detections.the detection rate of n v in dlas is therefore 13^{+5}_{-4}%. two sub-dla n vdetections are found among a sample of 18, at a similar detection rate of11^{+15}_{-7}%. we show that the n v detection rate is a strong function ofmetallicity, increasing by a factor of ~4 at [n/h]=[ni/hi]&gt;-2.3. the n v andciv component b-value distributions in dlas are statistically similar, but themedian b(n v) of 18 km/s is lower than the median b(o vi) of 25 km/s. some ~20%of the n v components have b&lt;10 km/s and thus arise in warm photoionized plasmaat log (t/k)&lt;4.92; local sources of ionizing radiation (as opposed to theextragalactic background) are required to keep the cloud sizes physicallyreasonable. the nature of the remaining ~80% of (broad) n v components isunclear; models of radiatively-cooling collisionally-ionized plasma atlog(t/k)=5.2-5.4 are fairly successful in reproducing the observed integratedhigh-ion column density ratios and the component line widths, but we cannotrule out photoionization by local sources. finally, we identify several unusualdlas with extremely low metallicity (&lt;0.01 solar) but strong high-ionabsorption [log n(n v)&gt;14 or log n(o vi)&gt;14.2] that present challenges toeither galactic inflow or outflow models.

0906.3269	statistics and characteristics of mgii absorbers along grb lines of  sight observed with vlt-uves	we analyse the properties of mgii absorption systems detected along thesightlines toward grbs using a sample of 10 grb afterglow spectra obtained withvlt-uves over the past six years. the s/n ratio is sufficiently high that wecan extend previous studies to smaller equivalent widths (typically wr&gt;0.3a).over a pathlength of delta(z)~14 the number of weak absorbers detected issimilar along grb and qso lines of sight, while the number of strong systems islarger along grb lines of sight with a 2-sigma significance. using intermediateand low resolution observations reported in the literature, we increase theabsorption length for strong systems to delta(z)=31.5 (about twice the pathlength of previous studies) and find that the number density of strong mgiisystems is a factor of 2.1+/-0.6 higher (about 3-sigma significance) towardgrbs as compared to qsos, about twice smaller however than previously reported.we divide the sample in three redshift bins and we find that the number densityof strong mgii is larger in the low redshift bins. we investigate in detail theproperties of strong mgii systems observed with uves. both the estimated dustextinction in strong grb mgii systems and the equivalent width distribution areconsistent with what is observed for standard qso systems. we find also thatthe number density of (sub)-dlas per unit redshift in the uves sample isprobably twice larger than what is expected from qso sightlines which confirmsthe peculiarity of grb lines of sight. these results indicate that neither adust extinction bias nor different beam sizes of the sources are viableexplanations for the excess. it is still possible that the current sample ofgrb lines of sight is biased by a subtle gravitational lensing effect. moredata and larger samples are needed to test this hypothesis.

0707.4065	c iv absorption in damped and sub-damped lyman-alpha systems:  correlations with metallicity and implications for galactic winds at z~2-3	we present a study of c iv absorption in a sample of 63 damped lyman-alpha(dla) systems and 11 sub-dlas in the redshift range 1.75&lt;z_abs&lt;3.61, using adataset of high-resolution (6.6 km/s fwhm), high signal-to-noise vlt/uvesspectra. narrow and broad c iv absorption line components indicate the presenceof both warm, photoionized and hot, collisionally ionized gas. we report newcorrelations between the metallicity (measured in the neutral-phase) and eachof the c iv column density, the c iv total line width, and the maximum c ivvelocity. we explore the effect on these correlations of the sub-dlas, theproximate dlas (defined as those within 5 000 km/s of the quasar), thesaturated absorbers, and the metal line used to measure the metallicity, and wefind the correlations to be robust. there is no evidence for any differencebetween the measured properties of dla c iv and sub-dla c iv. in 25 dlas and 4sub-dlas, covering 2.5 dex in [z/h], we directly observe c iv moving above theescape speed, where v_esc is derived from the total line width of the neutralgas profiles. these high-velocity c iv clouds, unbound from the centralpotential well, can be interpreted as highly ionized outflowing winds, whichare predicted by numerical simulations of galaxy feedback. the distribution ofc iv column density in dlas and sub-dlas is similar to the distribution inlyman break galaxies, where winds are directly observed, supporting the ideathat supernova feedback creates the ionized gas in dlas. the unbound c ivabsorbers show a median mass flow rate of ~22(r/40 kpc) solar masses per year,where r is the characteristic c iv radius. their kinetic energy fluxes arelarge enough that a star formation rate (sfr) of ~2 solar masses per year isrequired to power them.

0708.3018	multiphase plasma in sub-damped lyman alpha systems: a hidden metal  reservoir	we present a vlt/uves spectrum of a proximate sub-damped lyman-alpha(sub-dla) system at z=2.65618 toward the quasar q0331-4505(z_qso=2.6785+/-0.0030). absorption lines of o i, si ii, si iii, si iv, c ii, ciii, c iv, fe ii, al ii, and o vi are seen in the sub-dla, which has a neutralhydrogen column density log n(h i)=19.82+/-0.05. the absorber is at a velocityof 1820+/-250 km/s from the quasar; however, its low metallicity[o/h]=-1.64+/-0.07, lack of partial coverage, lack of temporal variationsbetween observations taken in 2003 and 2006, and non-detection of n v imply theabsorber is not a genuine intrinsic system. by measuring the o vi columndensity and assuming equal metallicities in the neutral and ionized gas, wedetermine the column density of hot ionized hydrogen in this sub-dla, and intwo other sub-dlas with o vi drawn from the literature. coupling this withdeterminations of the typical amount of warm ionized hydrogen in sub-dlas, weconfirm that sub-dlas are a more important metal reservoir than dlas, in totalcomprising at least 6-22% of the metal budget at z~2.5.

1008.4132	revisiting the he ii to h i ratio in the intergalactic medium	we estimate the he ii to h i column density ratio, \eta = n(he ii)/n(h i), inthe intergalactic medium towards the high redshift (z_{em} = 2.885) brightquasar qso he 2347-4342 using voigt-profile fitting of the h i transitions inthe lyman series and the he ii lyman-$\alpha$ transition as observed by thefuse satellite. in agreement with previous studies, we find that $\eta &gt; 50$ inmost of the lyman-$\alpha$ forest except in four regions where it is muchsmaller ($\eta \sim 10-20$) and therefore inconsistent with photo-ionization bythe uv background flux. we detect o vi and c iv absorption lines associatedwith two of these regions ($z_{\rm abs}$ = 2.6346 and 2.6498). we show that ifwe constrain the fit of the h i and/or he ii absorption profiles with thepresence of metal components, we can accommodate $\eta$ values in the range15-100 in these systems assuming broadening is intermediate between purethermal and pure turbulent. while simple photo-ionization models reproduce theobserved n(o vi)/n(c iv) ratio, they fail to produce low $\eta$ values contraryto models with high temperature (i.e t $\ge 10^5$ k). the doppler parametersmeasured for different species suggest a multiphase nature of the absorbingregions. therefore, if low $\eta$ values were to be confirmed, we would favor amulti-phase model in which most of the gas is at high temperature ($&gt;$ 10$^5$k) but the metals and in particular c iv are due to lower temperature ($\sim$few $10^4$ k) photo-ionized gas.

0708.3819	line shift, line asymmetry, and the 6li/7li isotopic ratio determination	context: line asymmetries are generated by convective doppler shifts instellar atmospheres, especially in metal-poor stars, where convective motionspenetrate to higher atmospheric levels. such asymmetries are usually neglectedin abundance analyses. the determination of the 6li/7li isotopic ratio is proneto suffering from such asymmetries, as the contribution of 6li is a slightblending reinforcement of the red wing of each component of the corresponding7li line, with respect to its blue wing. aims: the present paper studies thehalo star hd 74000 and estimates the impact of convection-related asymmetrieson the li isotopic ratio determination. method: two methods are used to meetthis aim. the first, which is purely empirical, consists in deriving a templateprofile from another element that can be assumed to originate in the samestellar atmospheric layers as li i, producing absorption lines of approximatelythe same equivalent width as individual components of the 7li i resonance line.the second method consists in conducting the abundance analysis based on nlteline formation in a 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere, taking into account theeffects of photospheric convection. results: the results of the first methodshow that the convective asymmetry generates an excess absorption in the redwing of the 7li absorption feature that mimics the presence of 6li at a levelcomparable to the hitherto published values. this opens the possibility thatonly an upper limit on 6li/7li has thus far been derived. the second methodconfirms these findings. conclusions: from this work, it appears that asystematic reappraisal of former determinations of 6li abundances in halo starsis warranted.

1104.5244	the lyman-alpha forest in three dimensions: measurements of large scale  flux correlations from boss 1st-year data	using a sample of approximately 14,000 z&gt;2.1 quasars observed in the firstyear of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), we measure thethree-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the lyman-alpha forest.the angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (f = exp(-tau)) issecurely detected out to comoving separations of 60 mpc/h, the first detectionof flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. a quadrupoledistortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities,the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in thelyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. we obtain a good fitto the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias ofthe transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard lcdmcosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmologicalconstant). at 95% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16&lt;b&lt;0.24 andredshift-distortion parameter 0.44&lt;beta&lt;1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, witha well constrained combination b(1+\beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. the errors on betaare asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. thevalue of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and ourtests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectationsfor the lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column densitysystems and metal line absorption. these results set the stage for cosmologicalparameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the lyman-alphaforest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acousticoscillations.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1209.4596	the large-scale cross-correlation of damped lyman alpha systems with the  lyman alpha forest: first measurements from boss	we present the first measurement of the large-scale cross-correlation oflyman alpha forest absorption and damped lyman alpha systems (dla), using the9th data release of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). thecross-correlation is clearly detected on scales up to 40 mpc/h and is wellfitted by the linear theory prediction of the standard cold dark matter modelof structure formation with the expected redshift distortions, confirming itsorigin in the gravitational evolution of structure. the amplitude of thedla-lyman alpha cross-correlation depends on only one free parameter, the biasfactor of the dla systems, once the lyman alpha forest bias factors are knownfrom independent lyman alpha forest correlation measurements. we measure thedla bias factor to be b_d = (2.17 +/- 0.20) beta_f^{0.22}, where the lymanalpha forest redshift distortion parameter beta_f is expected to be aboveunity. this bias factor implies a typical host halo mass for dlas that is muchlarger than expected in present dla models, and is reproduced if the dla crosssection scales with halo mass as m_h^alpha, with alpha= 1.1 +/- 0.1 forbeta_f=1. matching the observed dla bias factor and rate of incidence requiresthat atomic gas remains extended in massive halos over larger areas thanpredicted in present simulations of galaxy formation, with typical dla propersizes larger than 20 kpc in host halos of masses ~ 10^12 solar masses. we inferthat typical galaxies at z ~ 2 to 3 are surrounded by systems of atomic cloudsthat are much more extended than the luminous parts of galaxies and contain ~10% of the baryons in the host halo.

1210.6389	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: the quasar  luminosity function from data release nine	we present a new measurement of the optical quasar luminosity function (qlf),using data from the sloan digital sky survey-iii: baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (sdss-iii: boss). from the sdss-iii data release nine(dr9), we select a uniform sample of 22,301 i&lt;=21.8 quasars over an area of2236 sq. deg with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts between 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5, fillingin a key part of the luminosity-redshift plane for optical quasar studies. wederive the completeness of the survey through simulated quasar photometry, andcheck this completeness estimate using a sample of quasars selected by theirphotometric variability within the boss footprint. we investigate the level ofsystematics associated with our quasar sample using the simulations, in theprocess generating color-redshift relations and a new quasar k-correction. weprobe the faint end of the qlf to m_i(z=2.2) = -24.5 and see a clear break inthe qlf at all redshifts up to z=3.5. we find that a log-linear relation (inlog[phi*] - m*) for a luminosity and density evolution (lede) model adequatelydescribes our data within the range 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5; across this interval the breakluminosity increases by a factor of ~2.3 while phi* declines by a factor of ~6.at z&lt;2.2 our data is reasonably well fit by a pure luminosity evolution (ple)model. we see only a weak signature of "agn downsizing", in line with recentstudies of the hard x-ray luminosity function. we compare our measured qlf to anumber of theoretical models and find that models making a variety ofassumptions about quasar triggering and halo occupation can fit our data over awide range of redshifts and luminosities.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1211.5146	the boss lyman-alpha forest sample from sdss data release 9	we present the boss lyman-alpha (lya) forest sample from sdss data release 9,comprising 54,468 quasar spectra with zqso &gt; 2.15 suitable for lya forestanalysis. this data set probes the intergalactic medium with absorptionredshifts 2.0 &lt; z_alpha &lt; 5.7 over an area of 3275 square degrees, andencompasses an approximate comoving volume of 20 h^-3 gpc^3. with eachspectrum, we have included several products designed to aid in lya forestanalysis: improved sky masks that flag pixels where data may be unreliable,corrections for known biases in the pipeline estimated noise, masks for thecores of damped lya systems and corrections for their wings, and estimates ofthe unabsorbed continua so that the observed flux can be converted to afractional transmission. the continua are derived using a principal componentfit to the quasar spectrum redwards of restframe lya (lambda &gt; 1216 ang),extrapolated into the forest region and normalized by a linear function to fitthe expected evolution of the lya forest mean-flux. the estimated continuumerrors are ~5% rms. we also discuss possible systematics arising from uncertainspectrophotometry and artifacts in the flux calibration; global corrections forthe latter are provided. our sample provides a convenient starting point forusers to analyze clustering in boss lya forest data, and it provides a fiducialdata set that can be used to compare results from different analyses of baryonacoustic oscillations in the lya forest. the full data set is available fromthe sdss-iii dr9 web site.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

0712.2760	the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the neutral gas at high redshift	we study the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in the interstellar medium ofhigh-redshift galaxies. we use high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratiospectra of damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems detected along the line-of-sight toquasars to derive robust abundance measurements from unsaturated metalabsorption lines. we present results for a sample of 16 high-redshift dlas andstrong sub-dlas (log n(hi)&gt;19.5, 2.4&lt;zabs&lt;3.6) including 13 new measurements.we find that the oxygen to iron abundance ratio is pretty much constant with[o/fe]=+0.32+-0.10 for -2.5&lt;[o/h]&lt;-1.0 with a small scatter around this value.the oxygen abundance follows quite well the silicon abundance within 0.2dexalthough the silicon abundance could be slightly smaller for [o/h]&lt;-2. thedistribution of the [n/o] abundance ratio, measured from components that aredetected in both species, is somehow double peaked: five systems have [n/o]&gt;-1and nine systems have [n/o]&lt;-1.15. in the diagram [n/o] versus [o/h], a looseplateau is possibly present at [n/o]=-0.9 that is below the so-called primaryplateau as seen in local metal-poor dwarf galaxies ([n/o] in the range -0.57 to-0.74). no system is seen above this primary plateau whereas the majority ofthe systems lie well below with a large scatter. all this suggests a picture inwhich dlas undergo successive star-bursts. during such an episode, the [n/o]ratio decreases sharply because of the rapid release of oxygen by massive starswhereas inbetween two bursts, nitrogen is released by low and intermediate-massstars with a delay and the [n/o] ratio increases.

1303.0029	elt-mos white paper: science overview &amp; requirements	the workhorse instruments of the 8-10m class observatories have become theirmulti-object spectrographs (mos), providing comprehensive follow-up to bothground-based and space-borne imaging. with the advent of deeper imaging surveysfrom, e.g., the hst and vista, there are a plethora of spectroscopic targetswhich are already beyond the sensitivity limits of current facilities. thiswealth of targets will grow even more rapidly in the coming years, e.g., afterthe completion of alma, the launch of the jwst and euclid, and the advent ofthe lsst. thus, one of the key requirements underlying plans for the nextgeneration of ground-based telescopes, the extremely large telescopes (elts),is for even greater sensitivity for optical and infrared spectroscopy. here werevisit the scientific motivation for a mos capability on the european elt,combining updated elements of science cases advanced from the phase ainstrument studies with new science cases which draw on the latest results anddiscoveries. these science cases address key questions related to galaxyevolution over cosmic time, from studies of resolved stellar populations innearby galaxies out to observations of the most distant galaxies, and are usedto identify the top-level requirements on an 'e-elt/mos'. we argue that severalof the most compelling elt science cases demand mos observations, in highlycompetitive areas of modern astronomy. recent technical studies havedemonstrated that important issues related to e.g. sky subtraction andmulti-object ao can be solved, making fast- track development of a mosinstrument feasible. to ensure that eso retains world leadership in exploringthe most distant objects in the universe, galaxy evolution and stellarpopulations, we are convinced that a mos should have high priority in theinstrumentation plan for the e-elt.

1303.1937	the large-scale quasar-lyman \alpha\ forest cross-correlation from boss	we measure the large-scale cross-correlation of quasars with the lyman\alpha\ forest absorption in redshift space, using ~ 60000 quasar spectra fromdata release 9 (dr9) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). thecross-correlation is detected over a wide range of scales, up to comovingseparations r of 80 mpc/h. for r &gt; 15 mpc/h, we show that the cross-correlationis well fitted by the linear theory prediction for the mean overdensity arounda quasar host halo in the standard \lambda cdm model, with the redshiftdistortions indicative of gravitational evolution detected at high confidence.using previous determinations of the lyman \alpha\ forest bias factor obtainedfrom the lyman \alpha\ autocorrelation, we infer the quasar bias factor to beb_q = 3.64^+0.13_-0.15 at a mean redshift z=2.38, in agreement with previousmeasurements from the quasar auto-correlation. we also obtain a new estimate ofthe lyman \alpha\ forest redshift distortion factor, \beta_f = 1.1 +/- 0.15,slightly larger than but consistent with the previous measurement from thelyman \alpha\ forest autocorrelation. the simple linear model we use fails atseparations r &lt; 15 mpc/h, and we show that this may reasonably be due to theenhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars. we also provide theexpected correction that the mass overdensity around the quasar implies formeasurements of the ionizing radiation background from the line-of-sightproximity effect.

1306.5896	the one-dimensional ly-alpha forest power spectrum from boss	we have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensionalpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. the firstmethod is based on a fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihoodestimator. the two methods are independent and have different systematicuncertainties. the determination of the noise level in the data spectra wassubject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derivedpower spectrum.  we applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from sdss-iii/boss dr9selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their highquality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. the powerspectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelveredshift bins from $&lt;z&gt; = 2.2$ to $&lt;z&gt; = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. we determine the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.  we provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurementsusing available hydrodynamical simulations. the improvement in precision overpreviously published results from sdss is a factor 2--3 for constraints onrelevant cosmological parameters. for a $\lambda$cdm model and using aconstraint on $h_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distanceladder and on cmb anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{h}{i} absorption in the range $2.1&lt;z&lt;3.7$.

1307.3403	detection of ly\beta auto-correlations and ly\alpha-ly\beta  cross-correlations in boss data release 9	the lyman-$\beta$ forest refers to a region in the spectra of distant quasarsthat lies between the rest-frame lyman-$\beta$ and lyman-$\gamma$ emissions.the forest in this region is dominated by a combination of absorption due toresonant ly$\alpha$ and ly$\beta$ scattering. when considering the 1d ly$\beta$forest in addition to the 1d ly$\alpha$ forest, the full statisticaldescription of the data requires four 1d power spectra: ly$\alpha$ andly$\beta$ auto-power spectra and the ly$\alpha$-ly$\beta$ real and imaginarycross-power spectra. we describe how these can be measured using an optimalquadratic estimator that naturally disentangles ly$\alpha$ and ly$\beta$contributions. using a sample of approximately 60,000 quasar sight-lines fromthe boss data release 9, we make the measurement of the one-dimensional powerspectrum of fluctuations due to the ly$\beta$ resonant scattering. while wehave not corrected our measurements for resolution damping of the power andother systematic effects carefully enough to use them for cosmologicalconstraints, we can robustly conclude the following: i) ly$\beta$ powerspectrum and ly$\alpha$-ly$\beta$ cross spectra are detected with highstatistical significance; ii) the cross-correlation coefficient is $\approx 1$on large scales; iii) the ly$\beta$ measurements are contaminated by theassociated ovi absorption, which is analogous to the siiii contamination of thely$\alpha$ forest. measurements of the ly$\beta$ forest will allow extension ofthe usable path-length for the ly$\alpha$ measurements while allowing a betterunderstanding of the physics of intergalactic medium and thus more robustcosmological constraints.

1308.2685	a glance at the host galaxy of high-redshift quasars using strong damped  lyman-alpha systems as coronagraphs	we searched quasar spectra from the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) for the rare occurrences where a strong damped lyman-alphaabsorber (dla) blocks the broad line region emission from the quasar and actsas a natural coronagraph to reveal narrow ly\alpha\ emission from the hostgalaxy. we define a statistical sample of 31 dlas in data release 9 (dr9) withlog n(hi) &gt; 21.3 cm^-2 located at less than 1500 km s^-1 from the quasarredshift. in 25% (8) of these dlas, a strong narrow ly\alpha\ emission line isobserved with flux ~25 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 on average. for dlas withoutthis feature in their troughs, the average 3-\sigma\ upper limit is &lt; 0.8 x10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. our statistical sample is nearly 2.5 times larger thanthe anticipated number of intervening dlas in dr9 within 1500 km s^-1 of thequasar redshift. we also define a sample of 26 dlas from dr9 and dr10 withnarrow ly\alpha\ emission detected and no limit on the hi column density tobetter characterize properties of the host galaxy emission. analyzing thestatistical sample, we do not find substantial differences in the kinematics,metals, or reddening for the two populations with and without emissiondetected. the highly symmetric narrow ly\alpha\ emission line profile centeredin the hi trough indicates that the emitting region is separate from theabsorber. the luminosity of the narrow ly\alpha\ emission peaks is intermediatebetween that of lyman-alpha emitters and radio galaxies, implying that thely\alpha\ emission is predominantly due to ionizing radiation from the agn.galaxies neighboring the quasar host are likely responsible for the majority (&gt;75%) of these dlas, with only a minority (&lt; 25%) arising from hi clouds locatedin the agn host galaxy.

1309.2954	characterizing unknown systematics in large scale structure surveys	photometric large scale structure (lss) surveys probe the largest volumes inthe universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. imperfectphotometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the densityfields of lss tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result incosmological parameter estimation. earlier studies have proposed usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlationsbetween different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. in thispaper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. we demonstratethat while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknownsystematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. wedefine a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discardingbins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contaminationtolerance level. we show that this method improves estimates of the bias usingsimulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in thesloan digital sky survey as a case study.

1309.7660	the large-scale distribution of cool gas around luminous red galaxies	we present a measurement of the correlation function between luminous redgalaxies and cool gas traced by mg ii \lambda \lambda 2796, 2803 absorption, onscales ranging from about 30 kpc to 20 mpc. the measurement is based oncross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z~0.5 andthe flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10^5 background quasarsfrom the sloan digital sky survey. we find that: (i) this galaxy-gascorrelation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 mpc, consistent withthe expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to aregime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. assuming that,on average, the distribution of mg ii gas follows that of dark matter up to agas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accuratedescription of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale.within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous redgalaxies to be about 10^{13.5} m_solar, in agreement with other methods. wealso find the mg ii gas-to-mass ratio around lrgs to be consistent with thecosmic value estimated on mpc scales. combining our galaxy-gas correlation andthe galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we candirectly measure the mg ii gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reachthe same conclusion. (ii) from line-width estimates, we show that the velocitydispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors.on large scales the gas distribution follows the hubble flow, whereas on smallscales we observe the velocity dispersion of the mg ii gas clouds to be lowerthan that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. thisis in line with the fact that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of thevirialized hot gas.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1402.1342	the cross-correlation of mgii absorption and galaxies in boss	we present a measurement of the cross-correlation of mgii absorption andmassive galaxies, using the dr11 main galaxy sample of the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey of sdss-iii (cmass galaxies), and the dr7 quasar spectraof sdss-ii. the cross-correlation is measured by stacking quasar absorptionspectra shifted to the redshift of galaxies that are within a certain impactparameter bin of the quasar, after dividing by a quasar continuum model. thisresults in an average mgii equivalent width as a function of impact parameterfrom a galaxy, ranging from 50 kpc to more than 10 mpc in proper units, whichincludes all mgii absorbers. we show that special care needs to be taken to usean unbiased quasar continuum estimator, to avoid systematic errors in themeasurement of the mean stacked mgii equivalent width. the measuredcross-correlation follows the expected shape of the galaxy correlationfunction, although measurement errors are large. we use the cross-correlationamplitude to derive the bias factor of mgii absorbers, finding bmgii = 2.33\pm? 0.19, where the error accounts only for the statistical uncertainty inmeasuring the mean equivalent width. this bias factor is larger than thatobtained in previous studies and may be affected by modeling uncertainties thatwe discuss, but if correct it suggests that mgii absorbers at redshift z \simeq0:5 are spatially distributed on large scales similarly to the cmass galaxiesin boss.  keywords: galaxies: haloes, galaxies: formation, quasars: absorption lines,large-scale structure of universe

1404.1801	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly{\alpha} forest of boss dr11  quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in theflux-correlation function of the ly{\alpha} forest of high-redshift quasarswith a statistical significance of five standard deviations. the study uses137,562 quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the data release11 (dr11) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of sdss-iii.this sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previousstudies. the measured position of the bao peak determines the angular distance,$d_a(z=2.34)$ and expansion rate, $h(z=2.34)$, both on a scale set by the soundhorizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$. we find$d_a/r_d=11.28\pm0.65(1\sigma)^{+2.8}_{-1.2}(2\sigma)$ and$d_h/r_d=9.18\pm0.28(1\sigma)\pm0.6(2\sigma)$ where $d_h=c/h$. the optimalcombination, $\sim d_h^{0.7}d_a^{0.3}/r_d$ is determined with a precision of$\sim2\%$. for the value $r_d=147.4~{\rm mpc}$, consistent with the cmb powerspectrum measured by planck, we find $d_a(z=2.34)=1662\pm96(1\sigma)~{\rm mpc}$and $h(z=2.34)=222\pm7(1\sigma)~{\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$. tests with mockcatalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematicuncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. our results agree with thepreviously reported bao measurement at the same redshift using thequasar-ly{\alpha} forest cross-correlation. the auto-correlation andcross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite differentimpact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. the combinedconstraints from the two correlation functions imply values of $d_a/r_d$ and$d_h/r_d$ that are, respectively, 7% low and 7% high compared to thepredictions of a flat $\lambda$cdm cosmological model with the best-fit planckparameters. with our estimated statistical errors, the significance of thisdiscrepancy is $\approx 2.5\sigma$.

1408.0829	a glimpse at quasar host galaxy far-uv emission, using dlas as natural  coronagraphs	in merger-driven models of massive galaxy evolution, the luminous quasarphase is expected to be accompanied by vigorous star formation in quasar hostgalaxies. in this paper, we use high column density damped lyman alpha (dla)systems along quasar sight lines as natural coronagraphs to directly study thefar-uv (fuv) radiation from the host galaxies of luminous background quasars.we have stacked the spectra of $\sim$2,000 dla systems (n_hi&gt;10^{20.6} cm^{-2})with a median absorption redshift &lt; z &gt; = 2.6 selected from quasars observed inthe sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we detect residual fluxin the dark troughs of the composite dla spectra. the level of this residualflux significantly exceeds systematic errors in the sdss fiber sky subtraction;furthermore, the residual flux is strongly correlated with the continuumluminosity of the background quasar, while uncorrelated with dla column densityor metallicity. we conclude that the flux could be associated with the averagefuv radiation from the background quasar host galaxies (with medium redshift &lt;z &gt; = 3.1) that is not blocked by the intervening dla. assuming all of thedetected flux originates from quasar hosts, for the highest quasar luminositybin (&lt; l &gt;= 2.5x 10^{13} l_sun), the host galaxy has a fuv intensity of 1.5 +/-0.2 x 10^{40} erg s^{-1} a^{-1}; this corresponds to an unobscured uv starformation rate of 9 m_sun/yr.

1408.5970	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: technical  overview	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project (sdss-rm) is adedicated multi-object rm experiment that has spectroscopically monitored asample of 849 broad-line quasars in a single 7 deg$^2$ field with the sdss-iiiboss spectrograph. the rm quasar sample is flux-limited to i_psf=21.7 mag, andcovers a redshift range of 0.1&lt;z&lt;4.5. optical spectroscopy was performed during2014 jan-jul dark/grey time, with an average cadence of ~4 days, totaling morethan 30 epochs. supporting photometric monitoring in the g and i bands wasconducted at multiple facilities including the cfht and the steward observatorybok telescopes in 2014, with a cadence of ~2 days and covering all lunarphases. the rm field (ra, dec=14:14:49.00, +53:05:00.0) lies within the cfht-lsw3 field, and coincides with the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) medium deep field md07,with three prior years of multi-band ps1 light curves. the sdss-rm 6-monthbaseline program aims to detect time lags between the quasar continuum andbroad line region (blr) variability on timescales of up to several months (inthe observed frame) for ~10% of the sample, and to anchor the time baseline forcontinued monitoring in the future to detect lags on longer timescales and athigher redshift. sdss-rm is the first major program to systematically explorethe potential of rm for broad-line quasars at z&gt;0.3, and will investigate theprospects of rm with all major broad lines covered in optical spectroscopy.sdss-rm will provide guidance on future multi-object rm campaigns on largerscales, and is aiming to deliver more than tens of blr lag detections for ahomogeneous sample of quasars. we describe the motivation, design andimplementation of this program, and outline the science impact expected fromthe resulting data for rm and general quasar science.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1501.04726	the science case for multi-object spectroscopy on the european elt	this white paper presents the scientific motivations for a multi-objectspectrograph (mos) on the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the moscase draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,to the study of the halo of the milky way and its satellites, and from resolvedstellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised universe. the materialpresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over thepast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a commonstrategy toward realising a mos capability on the e-elt. the cases have beendistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define themosaic instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and'high definition'). when combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of thee-elt, mosaic will be the world's leading mos facility. in analysing therequirements we also identify a high-multiplex mos for the longer-term plansfor the e-elt, with an even greater multiplex (&gt;1000 targets) to enable studiesof large-scale structures in the high-redshift universe. following the greenlight for the construction of the e-elt the mos community, structured throughthe mosaic consortium, is eager to realise a mos on the e-elt as soon aspossible. we argue that several of the most compelling cases for elt science,in highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. forexample, mos observations in the early stages of e-elt operations will beessential for follow-up of sources identified by the james webb space telescope(jwst). in particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate skysubtraction with fibres have both recently been demonstrated on sky, makingfast-track development of mosaic feasible.

1502.01034	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: no evidence  for evolution in the m-sigma relation to z~1	we present host stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 88broad-line quasars at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1 (46 at z&gt;0.6) from the sloan digital sky surveyreverberation mapping (sdss-rm) project. high signal-to-noise ratio coaddedspectra (average s/n~30 per 69 km/s pixel) from sdss-rm allowed decompositionof the host and quasar spectra, and measurement of the host stellar velocitydispersions and black hole (bh) masses using the single-epoch (se) virialmethod. the large sample size and dynamic range in luminosity(l5100=10^(43.2-44.7) erg/s) lead to the first clear detection of a correlationbetween se virial bh mass and host stellar velocity dispersion far beyond thelocal universe. however, the observed correlation is significantly flatter thanthe local relation, suggesting that there are selection biases in high-zluminosity-threshold quasar samples for such studies. our uniform sample andanalysis enable an investigation of the redshift evolution of the m-sigmarelation free of caveats by comparing different samples/analyses at disjointredshifts. we do not observe evolution of the m-sigma relation in our sample,up to z~1, but there is an indication that the relation flattens towards higherredshifts. coupled with the increasing threshold luminosity with redshift inour sample, this again suggests certain selection biases are at work, andsimple simulations demonstrate that a constant m-sigma relation is favored toz~1. our results highlight the scientific potential of deep coaddedspectroscopy from quasar monitoring programs, and offer a new path to probe theco-evolution of bhs and galaxies at earlier times.

1504.04088	large-scale clustering of lyman-alpha emission intensity from sdss/boss	(abridged) we detect the large-scale structure of lya emission in theuniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of lya surfacebrightness with quasars in sdss/boss. we use a million spectra targetingluminous red galaxies at z&lt;0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxyspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift lya surfacebrightness. the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shapeconsistent with a lambdacdm model with omega_m =0.30^+0.10-0.07. the predictedamplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the meanlya surface brightness, &lt;mu_alpha&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and thequasar and lya emission bias factors. using known values, we infer&lt;mu_alpha&gt;(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 a^-1 arcsec^-2,where b_alpha is the lya emission bias factor. if the dominant sources of lyaemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_sfr = (0.28 +/- 0.07)(3/b_alpha) /yr/mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. for b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected lya emitters,although consistent with the total rho_sfr derived from dust-corrected,continuum uv surveys. 97% of the lya emission in the universe at theseredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of lya emitters. ourmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halossurrounding previously detected lya emitters, but we speculate that it arisesfrom similar lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. we alsodetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation,finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (zheng et al.(2011)). our measurements represent the first application of the intensitymapping technique to optical observations.

1508.04472	the sdss-iv extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar  target selection	as part of the sloan digital sky survey iv the extended baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (eboss) will improve measurements of the cosmologicaldistance scale by applying the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) method toquasar samples. eboss will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq.deg. first, a "core" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugrizusing a likelihood-based routine called xdqsoz, with a mid-ir-opticalcolor-cut. eboss core selection (to g &lt; 22 or r &lt; 22) should return ~ 70quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 and ~7 z &gt; 2.1 quasars per sq.deg. second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from thepalomar transient factory should recover an additional ~3-4 z &gt; 2.1 quasars persq. deg. to g &lt; 22.5. a linear model of how imaging systematics affect targetdensity recovers the angular distribution of eboss core quasars over 96.7%(76.7%) of the sdss north (south) galactic cap area. the eboss core quasarsample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 toyield the first few-percent-level bao constraint near z~1.5. eboss quasars at z&gt; 2.1 will be used to improve bao measurements in the lyman-alpha forest.beyond its key cosmological goals, eboss should be the next-generation quasarsurvey, comprising &gt; 500,000 new quasars and &gt; 500,000 uniformly selectedspectroscopically confirmed 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 quasars. at the conclusion of eboss,the sdss will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.

1508.06513	a coronagraphic absorbing cloud reveals the narrow-line region and  extended lyman-$\alpha$ emission of qso j0823+0529	we report long-slit spectroscopic observations of the quasar sdssj082303.22+052907.6 ($z_{\rm civ}$$\sim$3.1875), whose broad line region (blr)is partly eclipsed by a strong damped lyman-$\alpha$ (dla; log$n$(hi)=21.7)cloud. this allows us to study the narrow line region (nlr) of the quasar andthe lyman-$\alpha$ emission from the host galaxy. using cloudy models thatexplain the presence of strong nv and pv absorption together with the detectionof siii$^*$ and oi$^{**}$ absorption in the dla, we show that the density andthe distance of the cloud to the quasar are in the ranges 180 $&lt;$ $n_{\rm h}$$&lt;$ 710 cm$^{-3}$ and 580 $&gt;$ $r_0$ $&gt;$230 pc, respectively. sizes of theneutral($\sim$2-9pc) and highly ionized phases ($\sim$3-80pc) are consistentwith the partial coverage of the civ broad line region by the civ absorptionfrom the dla (covering factor of $\sim$0.85). we show that the residuals areconsistent with emission from the nlr with civ/lyman-$\alpha$ ratios varyingfrom 0 to 0.29 through the profile. remarkably, we detect extendedlyman-$\alpha$ emission up to 25kpc to the north and west directions and 15kpcto the south and east. we interpret the emission as the superposition of strongemission in the plane of the galaxy up to 10kpc with emission in a wind ofprojected velocity $\sim$500kms$^{-1}$ which is seen up to 25kpc. the lowmetallicity of the dla (0.27 solar) argues for at least part of this gas beingin-falling towards the agn and possibly being located where accretion from coldstreams ends up.

0806.0318	a study of quasar proximity in o vi absorbers at z=2-3	(abridged) with the goal of investigating the nature of ovi absorbers at highredshifts, we study the effects of proximity to the background quasar. in asample of sixteen quasars at z(qso) between 2.14 and 2.87 observed at 6.6 km/sresolution with vlt/uves, we detect 35 ovi absorption-line systems lying within8000 km/s of z(qso). the systems can be categorized into 9 strong and 26 weakovi absorbers. the strong absorbers are defined by the presence of eitherbroad, fully saturated ovi absorption or partial coverage of the continuumsource, and have log n(ovi)&gt;~15.0; these systems are intrinsic to the agn. theweak (narrow) systems show no partial coverage or saturation, and arecharacterized by log n(ovi)&lt;14.5 and have a median total velocity width of only42 km/s. the incidence dn/dz of weak ovi systems within 2000 km/s of the quasaris 42+/-12. between 2000 and 8000 km/s, dn/dz falls to 14+/-4, equal to theincidence of intervening ovi absorbers. whereas the accompanying h i and c ivcolumn densities are significantly lower (by a mean of ~1 dex) in the weak oviabsorbers within 2000 km/s of z(qso) than in those at larger velocities, theovi column densities display no dependence on proximity. furthermore,significant offsets between the hi and ovi centroids in ~50% of the weakabsorbers imply that (at least in these cases) the hi and ovi are not formed inthe same phase of gas. in summary, we find no firm evidence that quasarradiation influences the ovi-bearing gas, suggesting the ovi is collisionallyionized rather than photoionized, possibly in the multi-phase halos offoreground galaxies. non-equilibrium collisional ionization models are neededto explain the low temperatures in the absorbing gas, which are implied bynarrow line widths (b&lt;14 km/s) in over half of the observed ovi components.

astro-ph;0011437	molecular hydrogen and the nature of damped lyman-alpha systems	we report results from our mini-survey for molecular hydrogen in eight highredshift damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems using the eso ultra-violet andvisible spectrograph on the vlt. in addition, we investigate two systems usingeso public data. we include in the sample the only system where h2 waspreviously detected and studied at high-spectral resolution. altogether oursample consists of eleven absorbers with 1.85&lt;z_abs&lt;3.4. we confirm thepresence of h2 in the z_abs = 2.3377, metal-poor ([si/h] = -1.20) system towardpks 1232+082. the derived molecular fraction, f = 2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(hi)) = 410-4, is two orders of magnitude less than what has been claimed previouslyfrom low-resolution data. the physical conditions within the cloud can beconstrained directly from observation. the kinetic temperature and particledensity are in the ranges, respectively, 100&lt;t&lt;300 k and 30&lt;nh&lt;50 cm-3. inaddition, uv pumping is of the same order of magnitude than in our galaxy. theupper limits on the molecular fraction derived in nine of the systems are inthe range 1.2 10-7 - 1.6 10-5. the molecular abundance in a few dla systems(and in particular in the two systems where h2 is detected) is consistent withwhat is seen in the magellanic clouds. but most of the dla measurements arewell below these values. this is probably partly due to small amounts of dustand/or high uv flux. we argue however that the lack of molecules is a directconsequence of high kinetic temperature (t&gt;3000 k) implying a low formationrate of h2 onto dust grains. therefore, most of the dla systems arise in warmand diffuse neutral gas.

astro-ph;0012222	the microwave background temperature at the redshift of 2.33771	the cosmic microwave background radiation is a fundamental prediction of hotbig bang cosmology. the temperature of its black-body spectrum has beenmeasured at the present time, $t_{\rm cmbr,0}$ = 2.726$\pm$ 0.010 k, and ispredicted to have been higher in the past. at earlier time, the temperature canbe measured, in principle, using the excitation of atomic fine structure levelsby the radiation field. all previous measurements however give only upperlimits as they assume that no other significant source of excitation ispresent. here we report the detection of absorption from the first {\sl and}second fine-structure levels of neutral carbon atoms in an isolated remotecloud at a redshift of 2.33771. in addition, the unusual detection of molecularhydrogen in several rotational levels and the presence of ionized carbon in itsexcited fine structure level make the absorption system unique to constrain,directly from observation, the different excitation processes at play. it isshown for the first time that the cosmic radiation was warmer in the past. wefind 6.0 &lt; t_{\rm cmbr} &lt; 14 k at z = 2.33771 when 9.1 k is expected in the hotbig bang cosmology.

astro-ph;0102491	inhomogeneous metal enrichment at z \sim 1.9: the lyman limit systems in  the spectrum of the hdf-s quasar	we present a detailed analysis of three metal absorption systems observed inthe spectrum of the hdf-south quasar j2233-606 (z_em = 2.238), taking advantageof new vlt-uves high resolution data (r=45000, s/n = 40-60, \lambda\lambda3050-10000 \aa). three main components, spanning about 300 km/s, can beindividuated in the lyman limit system at z~1.92. they show a surprisinglylarge variation in metallicities, respectively ~1/500, 1/8 and 1/100 solar. thelarge value found for the second component at z=1.9259, suggests that the lineof sight crosses a star-forming region. in addition, there is a definitecorrelation between velocity position and ionisation state in this component,which we interpret as a possible signature of an expanding h ii region. thesystems at z~1.94 and z~1.87 have also high metallicity, ~1/4 and 1/3 solar. wefind that photoionisation and collisional ionisation are equal alternatives toexplain the high excitation phase revealed by o vi absorption, seen in thesetwo systems. from the width of the si iv, c iv, si iii and c iii lines in thesystem at z~1.87, we can estimate the temperature of the gas to be log t ~ 4.7,excluding collisional ionisation. finally, we compute the si iv/c iv ratio forall voigt profile components in a sample of log n(c iv) &gt; 14 systems at z &lt; 2.the values show a dispersion of more than an order of magnitude and most ofthem are much larger than what is observed for weaker systems. this is probablyan indication that high column density systems preferably originate in galactichalos and are mostly influenced by local ionising sources.

astro-ph;0201477	molecular hydrogen at z=1.973 toward q0013-004: dust depletion pattern  in damped lyman-alpha systems	we study the dust depletion pattern in eight well separated components of thez=1.973, logn(hi)=20.83, damped lyman-alpha system toward q0013-004, four ofwhich have detectable h2 absorption. the apparent correlation between theabundance ratios [fe/s] and [si/s] in the components indicates that theabundance pattern is indeed due to dust-depletion. in particular, we findevidence for depletion similar to what is observed in cold gas of the galacticdisk ([fe/zn]=-1.59, fe/s=-1.74, zn/s=-0.15, [si/s]=-0.85) in one of theweakest components in which molecular hydrogen is detected with logn(h2)=16.5.this is the first time such a large depletion is seen in a dla system. thisobservation supports the possibility that current samples of dla systems mightbe biased against the presence of cold and dusty gas along the line of sight.the overall metallicities of this peculiar dla system in which oi and cii arespread over 1050 km/s are [p/h]=-0.64, [zn/h]=-0.74 and [s/h]=-0.82 relative tosolar. the sub-dla system at z=1.96753 has [p/h]&gt;0.06, [zn/h]&gt;-0.02 and[s/h]&gt;-0.18. the overall molecular fraction is in the range -2.7&lt;logf&lt;-0.6. cois not detected (logn(co)/n(hi)&lt;-8) and hd could be present at z=1.97380. weshow that the presence of h2 is closely related to the physical conditions ofthe gas: high particle density together with low temperature. the observedexcitation of high j h2 levels and the molecular fraction show large variationsfrom one component to the other suggesting that the uv radiation field ishighly inhomogeneous throughout the system. gas pressure, estimated from ciabsorptions, is larger than what is observed in the ism of our galaxy. all thisis probably a consequence of intense star-formation activity in the vicinity ofthe absorbing gas.

astro-ph;0205472	the abundances of nitrogen and oxygen in damped lyman alpha systems	we take a fresh look at the abundance of nitrogen in dlas with oxygenabundances between 1/10 and 1/100 of solar. this is a metallicity regime poorlysampled in the local universe and where qso absorbers may hold clues to boththe nucleosynthetic origin of n and the chemical evolution of high redshiftgalaxies. we combine new vlt uves observations with others from the literatureto form a sample of 10 dlas in which the abundances of n and of one of the twoalpha-capture elements o or s have been measured. we confirm earlier reportsthat the (n/o) ratio exhibits a larger range of values than other ratios ofheavy elements in dlas; however, all 10 dlas fall in the region of the (n/o)vs. (o/h) plot delimited by the primary and secondary levels of nitrogenproduction. our results provide empirical evidence in support of the proposalthat intermediate mass stars (with masses less than 7 solar masses) are themain source of primary nitrogen, so that its release into the ism lags behindthat of oxygen, which is produced by type ii snae. a high proportion (40%) ofthe dlas in our sample have apparently not yet attained the full primary levelof n enrichment; this finding may be an indication that the metallicity regimewe are studying preferentially picks out galaxies which have only recentlycondensed out of the igm and begun forming stars. alternatively, the delay inthe release of n following an episode of star formation may increase withdecreasing metallicity, if stars of progressively lower masses than 4 solarmasses can synthesize n in their hotter interiors.

astro-ph;0305124	outflowing material in the zem = 4.92 bal qso sdss~j160501.21-011220.0	we present the analysis of two bals seen in the spectrum of the qso sdssj160501.21-011220.0. our uves spectrum shows two well detached bals at z(abs)=4.685 and 4.855. the system at z(abs)= 4.855 covers the background sourcecompletely suggesting that the gas is located outside the blr. on the contrarythe system at z(abs)= 4.685 has a covering factor of ~0.9. the observed h iabsorption line together with the limits on c ii and si ii absorptions suggestthat 16&lt;log n(h i) (cm^{-2})&lt;~17 in z(abs) = 4.855 absorption system.comparison with models show that the observed column densities of n v, si ivand c iv in this system require that n is underabundant by more than a factor 3compared to si if the ionizing radiation is similar to a typical qso spectrum.this is contrary to what is usually derived for the emission line gas in qsos.we show that the relative suppression in the n v column density can beexplained for solar abundance ratios or abundance ratios typical of starburstabundances if an ionizing spectrum devoid of x-rays is used instead. thus, ifthe composition of bal is like that of blr then it is most likely that thecloud sees a spectrum devoid of x-rays similar to what we observe from thisqso. this is consistent with the fact that none of our models have high comptonoptical depth to remove x-rays from the qso. similar arguments lead to theconclusion that the system at z(abs)= 4.685 as well is not compton thick. theestimated black hole mass is 8 10^8 solar mass suggesting the accretion ontothe seed black hole must have started as early as z = 11.

astro-ph;0402177	limits on the time variation of the electromagnetic fine-structure  constant in the low energy limit from absorption lines in the spectra of  distant quasars	most of the successful physical theories rely on the constancy of fewfundamental quantities (such as the speed of light, $c$, the fine-structureconstant, \alpha, the proton to electron mass ratio, \mu, etc), andconstraining the possible time variations of these fundamental quantities is animportant step toward a complete physical theory. time variation of \alpha canbe accurately probed using absorption lines seen in the spectra of distantquasars. here, we present the results of a detailed many-multiplet analysisperformed on a new sample of mg ii systems observed in high quality quasarspectra obtained using the very large telescope. the weighted mean value of thevariation in \alpha derived from our analysis over the redshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.3is \delta\alpha/\alpha = (-0.06+/-0.06) x 10^{-5}. the median redshift of oursample (z=1.55) corresponds to a look-back time of 9.7 gyr in the most favoredcosmological model today. this gives a 3\sigma limit, -2.5 x 10^{-16} yr^-1&lt;(\delta\alpha/\alpha\delta t) &lt;+1.2x10^{-16} yr^-1, for the time variation of\alpha, that forms the strongest constraint obtained based on high redshiftquasar absorption line systems.

astro-ph;0506555	the vlt-uves survey for molecular hydrogen in high-redshift damped  lyman-alpha systems: physical conditions in the neutral gas	we study the physical conditions in dlas, using a sample of 33 systems toward26 qsos acquired for a recently completed survey of h_2 by ledoux et al.(2003). we use the column densities of h_2 in different rotational levels,together with those of c i, c i*, c i**, c ii* and singly ionized atomicspecies to discuss the kinetic temperature, the density of hydrogen and theelectronic density in the gas together with the ambient uv radiation field.detailed comparisons are made between the observed properties in dlas, theinterstellar medium (ism) of the galaxy, lmc and smc. the mean kinetictemperature of the gas corresponding to dla subcomponents in which h_2absorption line is detected, derived from the ortho-to-para ratio (153+/-78 k),is higher than that measured in the ism (77+/-17 k) and the magellanic clouds(82+/-21 k). typical pressure in these components (corresponding to t = 100-300k and n = 10-200 cm^-3), measured using c i fine-structure excitation, arehigher than what is measured along ism sightlines. this is consistent with thecorresponding higher values for n(h_2,j=2)/n(h_2,j=0) seen in dlas. from thecolumn densities of the high-j rotational levels, we derive that the typicalradiation field in the h_2 bearing components is of the order of or slightlyhigher than the mean uv field in the galactic ism. determination of electrondensity in the gas with h_2 and c i show the ionization rate is similar to thatof a cold neutral medium (cnm) in a moderate radiation field. this, togetherwith the fact that we see h_2 in 13-20% of the dlas, can be used to concludethat dlas at z&gt;1.9 could contribute as much as 50% star formation rate densityseen in lyman break galaxies (lbgs).

astro-ph;0506556	molecular hydrogen in the diffuse interstellar medium at high redshift	physical conditions within dlas can reveal the star formation history,determine the chemical composition of the associated ism, and hence documentthe first steps in the formation of present day galaxies. here we presentcalculations that self-consistently determine the gas ionization, levelpopulations (atomic fine-structure levels and rotational levels of h_2), grainphysics, and chemistry. we show that for a low-density gas (n&lt; 0.1 cm^-3) themeta-galactic uv background due to quasars is sufficient to maintain h_2 columndensities below the detection limit (i.e n(h_2)&lt; 10^14 cm^-2) irrespective ofthe metallicity and dust content in the gas. such a gas will have a 21 cm spintemperature in excess of 7000 k and very low c i and c ii* column densities forh i column densities typically observed in dlas. we show that the observedproperties of the ~15% per cent of the dlas that do show detectable h_2absorption cannot be reproduced with only the quasar dominated meta-galactic uvradiation field. gas with higher densities (n&gt;10 cm^-3), a moderate radiationfield (flux density one to ten times that of the background radiation of thegalactic ism), the observed range of metallicity and dust-to-gas ratioreproduce all the observed properties of the dlas that show h_2 absorptionlines. this favors the presence of ongoing star formation in dlas with h_2. theabsence of detectable h_2 and c i absorption in a large fraction of dlas can beexplained if they originate either in a low-density gas or in a high-densitygas with a large ambient radiation field. the absence of 21 cm absorption and cii* absorption will be consistent with the first possibility. the presence of21 cm absorption and strong c ii* without h_2 and c i absorption will suggestthe second alternative.

astro-ph;0702369	evidence for overdensity around z_em &gt; 4 quasars from the proximity  effect	we study the density field around z_em &gt; 4 quasars using high quality mediumspectral resolution esi-keck spectra (r~4300, snr &gt; 25) of 45 high-redshiftquasars selected from a total of 95 spectra. this large sample considerablyincreases the statistics compared to previous studies. the redshift evolutionof the mean photo-ionization rate and the median optical depth of theintergalactic medium (igm) are derived statistically from the observedtransmitted flux and the pixel optical depth probability distribution functionrespectively. this is used to study the so-called proximity effect, that is,the observed decrease of the median optical depth of the igm in the vicinity ofthe quasar caused by enhanced photo-ionization rate due to photons emitted bythe quasar. we show that the proximity effect is correlated with the luminosityof the quasars, as expected. by comparing the observed decrease of the medianoptical depth with the theoretical expectation we find that the optical depthdoes not decrease as rapidly as expected when approaching the quasar if the gasin its vicinity is part of the standard igm. we interpret this effect asrevealing gaseous overdensities on scales as large as ~15 mpc/h. the meanoverdensity is of the order of two and five within, respectively, 10 and 3mpc/h. if true, this would indicate that high redshift quasars are located inthe center of overdense regions that could evolve with time into massiveclusters of galaxies. the overdensity is correlated with luminosity: brighterquasars show higher overdensities.

astro-ph;9508097	the metal line systems in hs1700+6416: evidence for inhomogeneities	we present a high s/n ratio optical spectrum of the bright quasarhs1700+6416. these data usefully complement the uv hst data from vogel andreimers (1995). we analyse the metal line systems using photo-ionization modelsallowing for inhomogeneities in the gas. the models are able to reproducewithin a factor of two the large n(hei)/n(hi) ratio together with the meancolumn densities of the heavy element species observed in the z=2 systems. thedensity contrast between low and high density regions is of the order of 30.although the [o/c] abundance ratio seems slighly larger than solar, firmconclusion should await higher spectral resolution data. a break at the heiiionization limit of a factor of ten is acceptable in the ionizing spectrum.abundances are found to be about 0.08 solar. this together with otherdeterminations from the literature indicates that there is evolution in themetal content of metal line systems with redshift: [mg/h] is slighly belowsolar at z=0.7 and [c/h]=0.1-0.01 at z=2. we detect an associated civ system atz=2.7126 in which there is some evidence for the presence of neviii, probablynevi, nevii, and possibly sixii.

astro-ph;9508129	evolution of the ly$\alpha$ forest: a consistent picture	we study the evolution with redshift of the number density of ly$\alpha$clouds in a cdm model using numerical simulations including photo-ionizationand cooling of the baryonic component. the photo-ionizing flux is consistentlytaken as proportional to the rate at which material cools below 5000~k in thesimulation. the number density of lines with $n$(hi)~$&gt;$~10$^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$given by the simulation can be approximated asd$n$/d$z$~$\sim$~16.8(1+$z$)$^{0.8}$+0.687(1+z)$^{2.5}$ which fits well thedata at any redshift. the number of weaker lines is reproduced within a factorof two and does not decrease with time as fast as the number of strong lines.for $n$(hi)~$&gt;$~10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$, we findd$n$/d$z$~$\propto$~(1+$z$)$^{0.7}$. \par at $z$~=~0, the two-point correlationfunction for lyman$\alpha$ clouds with $n$(hi)~$&gt;$~10$^{13}$ and$&gt;$~10$^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$ has a slope $\sim$~-1.75 comparable to the slope of thetwo point correlation function for the galaxy distribution. the signal ishigher for stronger lines for separations smaller than 1~mpc. part of thelyman$\alpha$ forest is indeed associated with galaxies however the overallpicture is that ly$\alpha$ absorption lines originate in the warm gas thattraces the potential wells of filamentary structures defined by the darkmatter.

astro-ph;9606037	physical conditions in metal line systems toward q1037-2704: evidence  for superclustering at z=2	we present a high spectral resolution optical spectrum of the bright quasarq~1037-2704. the large number of absorption systems suggests the presence of anintervening supercluster, but the issue remains controversial.\par wedemonstrate that the strong civ system at z=2.08 spanning more than 1500 km/sis made up of narrow components with typical doppler parameter b=8 km/s. thegas is probably photo-ionized in which case the photo-ionizing spectrum shouldbe dominated by stellar radiation. analysis of hi, siiv, nv and civ absorptionsshows that the gas has a fairly large metal content, z&gt;0.1zsolar. we detectcii*1335 absorption in subcomponents of the z=2.133 system, which have moderatetotal cii column densities implying an electronic density of ne=3/cm3. inaddition, the weakness of the oi1302, siii1304 and feii1608 lines allows adetailed analysis of the line profiles. the results are that the system hasfour narrow (b=10km/s) components; the oxygen abundance is of the order of 0.03solar; the iron abundance is surprisingly large [fe/o]=[fe/o]solar+0.3. ifphoto-ionized by the uv flux from the quasar, the distance between the absorberand the quasar should be larger than 0.3 mpc. this demontrates that the gas isnot associated with the quasar and, together with the detection of eightmultiple metal systems between z=1.91 and 2.13, suggests the presence of acoherent structure extended over 80 mpc along the line of sight.

astro-ph;9804242	hst observations of the qso pair q1026-0045a,b	the spatial distribution of the ly$\alpha$ forest is studied using new hstdata for the quasar pair q~1026--0045 a and b at $z_{em}$ = 1.438 and 1.520respectively. the angular separation is 36 arcsec and corresponds to transverselinear separations between lines of sight of $\sim300h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc ($q_{o}$= 0.5) over the redshift range 0.833 &lt; z &lt; 1.438. from the observed numbers ofcoincident and anti-coincident ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, we conclude that,at this redshift, the ly$\alpha$ structures have typical dimensions of$\sim500h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc, larger than the mean separation of the two lines ofsight. the velocity difference, $\delta v$, between coincident lines issurprisingly small (4 and 8 pairs with $\delta v &lt; 50 and 200 km/srespectively).  metal line systems are present at $z_{abs}$ = 1.2651 and 1.2969 in a,$z_{abs}$ = 0.6320, 0.7090, 1.2651 and 1.4844 in b. in addition we tentativelyidentify a weak mg ii system at $z_{abs}$ = 0.11 in b. it is remarkable thatthe $z_{abs}$ = 1.2651 system is common to both lines of sight. the system at$z_{abs}$ = 1.4844 %is probably associated and has strong o~vi absorption.  there is a metal-poor associated system at $z_{abs}$ = 1.4420 along the lineof sight to a with complex velocity profile. we detect a strong ly$\alpha$absorption along the line of sight to b redshifted by only 300 km/s relativelyto the associated system. it is tempting to interpret this as the presence of adisk of radius larger than 300$h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc surrounding quasar a.

astro-ph;9902070	the zabs=zem absorption line systems toward qso j2233-606 in the hubble  deep field south: neviii770,780 absorption and partial coverage	results of a careful analysis of the highly ionized absorption systems,observed over the redshift range 2.198--2.2215 in the zem=2.24 hdfs-qsoj2233-606, are presented. strong ovi and neviii absorptions are detected. mostof the lines show signature of partial coverage which varies from species tospecies. this can be understood if the clouds cover the continuum emissionregion completely and only a fraction of the broad emission line region. usingphoto-ionization models we analyze in more detail the component at zabs =2.198. absolute abundances are close to solar but the [n/c] abundance ratio islarger than solar. this result, which is consistent with the analysis of high-zqso broad emission-lines, confirms the physical association of the absorbinggas with the agn. the observed column densities of niv, nv and neviii favor atwo-zone model for the absorbing region where neviii is predominantly producedin the highly ionized zone. it is most likely that in qso j2233-606, the regionproducing the neviii absorption can not be a warm absorber. one of the lyalphaabsorption lines at zabs = 2.2215 has a flat bottom typical of saturated linesand non-zero residual intensity in the core, consistent with partial coverage.there is no metal-line from this lyalpha cloud detectable in the spectrum whichsuggests either large chemical inhomogeneities in the gas or that the gas isvery highly ionized. if the latter is true the cloud could have a totalhydrogen column density consistent with that of x-ray absorbers. it istherefore of first importance to check whether or not there is an x-raywarm-absorber in front of this qso.
