0706.1997	hst photometry for the halo stars in the leo elliptical ngc 3377	we have used the acs camera on hst to obtain (v,i) photometry for 57,000red-giant stars in the halo of the leo elliptical ngc 3377. we use this sampleof stars to derive the metallicity distribution function (mdf) for its halofield stars, and comment on its chemical evolution history compared with bothlarger and smaller e galaxies. our acs/wfc field spans a radial range extendingfrom 4 to 18 kpc projected distance from the center of ngc 3377 and thus coversa significant portion of this galaxy's halo. we find that the mdf is broad,reaching a peak at [m/h] ~ -0.6$, but containing virtually no stars moremetal-poor than log [m/h] = -1.5$. it may, in addition, have relatively fewstars more metal-rich than [m/h] = -0.3$, although interpretation of thehigh-metallicity end of the mdf is limited by photometric completeness thataffects the detection of the reddest, most metal-rich stars. ngc 3377 appearsto have an enrichment history intermediate between those of normal dwarfellipticals and the much larger giants. as yet, we find no clear evidence thatthe halo of ngc 3377 contains a significant population of ``young'' (&lt; 3 gy)stars.

0706.2962	variable stars in the open cluster ngc 6791 and its surrounding field	aims: this work presents a high--precision variability survey in the field ofthe old, super metal-rich open cluster ngc 6791.  methods: the data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision ccd timeseries measurements in the v band obtained mainly at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, with additional data from s. pedro martir and loiano observatories,over a time span of ten nights. the field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.  results: we have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods andamplitudes of 70 known variable stars. by means of a photometric evaluation ofthe membership in ngc 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the propermotions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster andsurrounding field in the range 16&lt;v&lt;23.5. accurate periods can be given for thevariables with p&lt;4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limitedtime-baseline hampered precise determinations. we categorized the entire sampleas follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variablesand 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables forwhich we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longerthan our time baseline.  conclusions: on the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positionsof the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 newvariable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membershipis doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. we also detected an outburst ofabout 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to thecluster and we suggest that this star could be a new u gem (dwarf nova)cataclysmic variable.

0908.1650	the influence of the c+n+o abundances on the determination of the  relative ages of globular clusters: the case of ngc 1851 and ngc 6121 (m4)	the color magnitude diagram (cmd) of ngc 1851 presents two subgiant branches(sgb), probably due the presence of two populations differing in total cnocontent. we test the idea that a difference in total cno may simulate an agedifference when comparing the cmd of clusters to derive relative ages. wecompare ngc 1851 with ngc 6121 (m4), a cluster of very similar [fe/h]. we findthat, with a suitable shift of the cmds that brings the two red horizontalbranches at the same magnitude level, the unevolved main sequence and red giantbranch match, but the sgb of ngc 6121 and its red giant branch "bump" arefainter than in ngc 1851. in particular, the sgb of ngc 6121 is even slightlyfainter than the the faint sgb in ngc 1851. both these features can beexplained if the total cno in ngc 6121 is larger than that in ngc 1851, even ifthe two clusters are coeval. we conclude by warning that different initialc+n+o abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicity andage, may lead to differences in the turnoff morphology that can be easilyattributed to an age difference.

0707.1019	stroemgren photometry of galactic globular clusters. i. new calibrations  of the metallicity index	we present a new calibration of the stroemgren metallicity index m1 using redgiant (rg) stars in 4 globular clusters (gcs:m92,m13,ngc1851,47tuc) withmetallicity ranging from [fe/h]=-2.2 to -0.7, marginally affected by reddening(e(b-v)&lt;0.04) and with accurate u,v,b,y photometry.the main difference betweenthe new metallicity-index-color (mic) relations and similar relations availablein the literature is that we adopted the u-y/v-y colors instead of theb-y.these colors present a stronger sensitivity to effective temperature, andthe mic relations show a linear slope. the difference between photometricestimates and spectroscopic measurements for rgs in m71,ngc288,ngc362,ngc6397,and ngc6752 is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sigma=0.11dex). we also apply the mic relationsto 85 field rgs with metallicity raning from [fe/h]=-2.4 to -0.5 and accuratereddening estimates. we find that the difference between photometric estimatesand spectroscopic measurements is-0.14+/-0.01dex (sig=0.17dex). we also providetwo sets of mic relations based on evolutionary models that have beentransformed into the observational plane by adopting either semi-empirical ortheoretical color-temperature relations. we apply the semi-empirical relationsto the 9 gcs and find that the difference between photometric and spectroscopicmetallicities is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sig=0.10dex).a similar agreement is found forthe sample of field rgs, with a difference of -0.09+/-0.03dex (sig=0.19dex).thedifference between metallicity estimates based on theoretical relations andspectroscopic measurements is -0.11+/-0.03dex (sig=0.14dex) for the 9 ggcs and-0.24+/-0.03dex (sig=0.15dex) for the field rgs. current evidence indicatesthat new mic relations provide metallicities with an intrinsic accuracy betterthan 0.2dex.

0704.1668	a new search for planet transits in ngc 6791	context. searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.  aims. considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster ngc 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  methods. a ten-night observational campaign was performed using thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (3.6m), the san pedro m\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the loiano telescope (1.5m). to increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

0912.0824	on a new near-infrared method to estimate the absolute ages of star  clusters: ngc3201 as a first test case	we present a new method to estimate the absolute ages of stellar systems.this method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequenceturn-off (msto) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence(msk). this feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption ofmolecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (nir) andin optical-nir color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. we took advantageof deep and accurate nir images collected with the multi-conjugate adaptiveoptics demonstrator temporarily available on the very large telescope and ofoptical images collected with the advanced camera for surveys wide field cameraon the hubble space telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate theabsolute age of the globular ngc3201 using both the msto and thedelta(msto-msk). we have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we foundthat the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.however, the errors of the ages based on the delta(msto-msk) method arepotentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected byuncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.current isochrones appear topredict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) nir and optical-nir colors than observed formagnitudes fainter than the msk.

1002.2074	on the delta v_hb_bump parameter in globular clusters	we present new empirical estimates of the delta v_hb_bump parameter for 15galactic globular clusters (ggcs) using accurate and homogeneous ground-basedoptical data. together with similar evaluations available in the literature, weended up with a sample of 62 ggcs covering a very broad range in metal content(-2.16&lt;=[m/h]&lt;=-0.58 dex). adopting the homogeneous metallicity scale providedeither by kraft &amp; ivans (2004) or by carretta et al. (2009), we found that theobserved delta v_hb_bump parameters are larger than predicted. in themetal-poor regime ([m/h]&lt;=-1.7, -1.6 dex) 40% of gcs show discrepancies of2sigma (~0.40 mag) or more. evolutionary models that account either for alpha-and cno-enhancement or for helium enhancement do not alleviate the discrepancybetween theory and observations. the outcome is the same if we use the newsolar heavy-element mixture. the comparison between alpha- and cno-enhancedevolutionary models and observations in the carretta et al. metallicity scalealso indicates that observed delta v_hb_bump parameters, in the metal-richregime ([m/h]=&gt;0), might be systematically smaller than predicted.

1002.4300	the acs lcid project. iii. the star formation history of the cetus dsph  galaxy: a post-reionization fossil	we use deep hst/acs observations to calculate the star formation history(sfh) of the cetus dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. our photometry reaches belowthe oldest main sequence turn-offs, which allows us to estimate the age andduration of the main episode of star formation in cetus. this is wellapproximated by a single episode that peaked roughly 12+/-0.5 gyr ago andlasted no longer than about 1.9+/-0.5 gyr (fwhm). our solution also suggeststhat essentially no stars formed in cetus during the past 8 gyrs. this makescetus' sfh comparable to that of the oldest milky way dsphs. given the currentisolation of cetus in the outer fringes of the local group, this implies thatcetus is a clear outlier in the morphology-galactocentric distance relationthat holds for the majority of milky way dwarf satellites. our results alsoshow that cetus continued forming stars through z ~ 1, long after the universewas reionized, and that there is no clear signature of the epoch ofreionization in cetus' sfh. we discuss briefly the implications of theseresults for dwarf galaxy evolution models. finally, we present a comprehensiveaccount of the data reduction and analysis strategy adopted for all galaxiestargeted by the lcid (local cosmology from isolated dwarfs) project. we employtwo different photometry codes (daophot/allframe and dolphot), three differentsfh reconstruction codes (iac-pop/minniac, match, cole), and two stellarevolution libraries (basti and padova/girardi), allowing for a detailedassessment of the modeling and observational uncertainties.

1004.2559	on the stellar content of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present u,b,v,i photometry of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based onmore than 4,000 ccd images. special attention was given to the photometriccalibration, and the precision for the b,v,i bands is better than 0.01 mag. wecompared in the v,b-v and v,b-i color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) carina withthree globular clusters (gcs, m53, m55, m79). we find that only the moremetal-poor gcs (m55, [fe/h]=-1.85; m53, [fe/h]=-2.02 dex) provide a good matchwith the carina giant branch. we performed a similar comparison in the v,v-icmd with three smc intermediate-age clusters (iacs, kron3, ngc339, lindsay38).we find that the color extent of the sgb of the two more metal-rich iacs(kron3, [fe/h]=-1.08; ngc339, [fe/h]=-1.36 dex) is smaller than the range amongcarina's intermediate-age stars. however, the ridge line of the more metal-pooriac (lindsay38, [fe/h]=-1.59 dex) agrees quite well with the carinaintermediate-age stars. these findings indicate that carina's old stellarpopulation is metal-poor and seems to have a limited spread in metallicity(delta [fe/h]=0.2--0.3 dex). carina intermediate-age stars can hardly be moremetal-rich than lindsay38 and its spread in metallicity appears modest. we alsofind that the synthetic cmd constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5dex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported byobservations. the above results are at odds with recent spectroscopicinvestigations suggesting that carina stars cover a broad range in metallicity(delta [fe/h]~1--2 dex). we present a new method to estimate the metallicity ofcomplex stellar systems using the difference in color between the red clump andthe middle of the rr lyrae instability strip. the observed colors of carina'sevolved stars indicate a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.70+-0.19 dex, which agreesquite well with spectroscopic measurements.

1006.5217	on the absolute age of the globular cluster m92	we present precise and deep optical photometry of the globular m92. data werecollected in three different photometric systems: sloan digital sky survey(g',r',i',z'; megacam@cfht), johnson-kron-cousins (b, v, i; variousground-based telescopes) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) vegamag (f475w,f555w, f814w; hubble space telescope). special attention was given to thephotometric calibration, and the precision of the ground-based data isgenerally better than 0.01 mag. we computed a new set of {\alpha}-enhancedevolutionary models accounting for the gravitational settling of heavy elementsat fixed chemical composition ([{\alpha}/fe]=+0.3, [fe/h]=-2.32 dex, y=0.248).the isochrones -- assuming the same true distance modulus ({\mu}=14.74 mag),the same reddening (e(b-v)=0.025+-0.010 mag), and the same reddening law --account for the stellar distribution along the main sequence and the red giantbranch in different color-magnitude diagrams (i',g'-i' ; i',g'-r' ; i',g'-z' ;i,b-i ; f814w,f475w-f814w). the same outcome applies to the comparison betweenthe predicted zero-age-horizontal-branch (zahb) and the hb stars. we also founda cluster age of 11 +/- 1.5 gyr, in good agreement with previous estimates. theerror budget accounts for uncertainties in the input physics and thephotometry. to test the possible occurrence of cno-enhanced stars, we alsocomputed two sets of {\alpha}- and cno-enhanced (by a factor of three) modelsboth at fixed total metallicity ([m/h]=-2.10 dex) and at fixed iron abundance.we found that the isochrones based on the former set give the same cluster age(11 +/- 1.5 gyr) as the canonical {\alpha}-enhanced isochrones. the isochronesbased on the latter set also give a similar cluster age (10 +/- 1.5 gyr). theseindings support previous results concerning the weak sensitivity of clusterisochrones to cno-enhanced chemical mixtures.

1012.4931	sodium-oxygen anticorrelation among horizontal branch stars in the  globular cluster m4	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gc) is mainlygoverned by metallicity. the second parameter problem, well known since the60's, states that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the observed hbmorphology of many gcs. despite many efforts to resolve this issue, the secondparameter phenomenon still remains without a satisfactory explanation. we haveanalyzed blue, red-hb, and rr-lyrae stars in the gc m4 and studied their fe,na, and o abundances. our goal is to investigate possible connections betweenthe bimodal hb of m4 and the chemical signatures of the two stellar populationsrecently discovered among red giants of this cluster. we obtainedflames-uves/giraffe spectra of a sample of 22 stars covering the hb from thered to the blue region. while iron has the same abundance in both the red andblue-hb segment, the red-hb is composed of stars with scaled-solar sodiumabundances, while the blue-hb stars are all sodium enhanced and oxygendepleted. the rr-lyrae are na-poor, as the red-hb stars, and o-rich. this iswhat we expect if the blue-hb consists of a second generation of stars formedfrom the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar population throughhigh-temperature hydrogen-burning processes that include the cno, nena, andmgal cycles and are therefore expected to be he-rich. according to thisscenario, the sodium and oxygen pattern detected in the blue and red-hbsegments suggests helium as the second parameter that rules the hb morphologyin m4.

1102.3916	the gradients in the 47 tuc red giant branch bump and horizontal branch  are consistent with a centrally-concentrated, helium-enriched second stellar  generation	we combine ground and space-based photometry of the galactic globular cluster47 tuc to measure four independent lines of evidence for a helium gradient inthe cluster, whereby stars in the cluster outskirts would have a lower initialhelium abundance than stars in and near the cluster core. first and second, weshow that the red giant branch bump (rgbb) stars exhibit gradients in theirnumber counts and brightness. with increased separation from the clustercenter, they become more numerous relative to the other red giant (rg) stars.they also become fainter. for our third and fourth lines of evidence, we showthat the horizontal branch (hb) of the cluster becomes both fainter and redderfor sightlines farther from the cluster center. these four results arerespectively detected at the 2.3$\sigma$, 3.6$\sigma$, 7.7$\sigma$ and4.1$\sigma$ levels. each of these independent lines of evidence is found to besignificant in the cluster-outskirts; closer in, the data are more compatiblewith uniform mixing. our radial profile is qualitatively consistent with butquantitatively tighter than previous results based on cn absorption. theseobservations are qualitatively consistent with a scenario wherein a secondgeneration of stars with modestly enhanced helium and cno abundance formed deepwithin the gravitational potential of a cluster of previous generation starshaving more canonical abundances.

1106.2734	on a new parameter to estimate the helium content in old stellar systems	we introduce a new parameter {\delta}{\xi} - the difference in magnitudebetween the red giant branch (rgb) bump and a point on the main sequence (ms)at the same color as the bump, the "benchmark" - to estimate the helium contentin old stellar systems. its sensitivity to helium is linear over the entiremetallicity range, it is minimally affected by age, uncertainties in thephotometric zero-point, reddening or the effects of evolution on the horizontalbranch. the two main drawbacks are the need for precise and large photometricdata sets, and a strong dependence of the {\delta}y/{\delta}{\xi} slope onmetallicity. to test the {\delta}{\xi} parameter we selected 22 galacticglobular clusters (ggcs) with low foreground reddening, a broad range of ironabundance and precise, relatively deep, and homogeneous multi-band (b,v,i)photometry. we found that the observed {\delta}{\xi} and those predicted from{\alpha}-enhanced models agree quite well if we assume y=0.20. comparison withcanonical primordial helium content models (y=0.245, {\delta}y/{\delta}z=1.4)indicates that the observed {\delta}{\xi} values are systematically smallerthan predicted. the outcome is the same if predicted parameters are based onmodels that take into account also cno enhancements and becomes even larger ifwe consider he-enhanced models. these findings suggest that current stellarevolutionary models overestimate the luminosity of the rgb bump. we also foundthat including envelope overshooting can eliminate the discrepancy, asoriginally suggested by alongi et al. (1993, aaps, 97, 851). the {\delta}{\xi}parameter of ggcs, in spite of the possible limitations concerning the inputphysics of current evolutionary models, provides an independent detection ofpre-stellar helium at least at the 5{\sigma} level.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1109.6875	the acs lcid project vii: the blue stragglers population in the isolated  dsph galaxies cetus and tucana	we present the first investigation of the blue straggler star (bss)population in two isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group, cetusand tucana. deep hst/acs photometry allowed us to identify samples of 940 and1214 candidates, respectively. the analysis of the star formation histories ofthe two galaxies suggests that both host a population of bsss. specifically, ifthe bss candidates are interpreted as young main sequence stars, they do notconform to their galaxy's age-metallicity relationship. the analysis of theluminosity function and the radial distributions support this conclusion, andsuggest a non-collisional mechanism for the bss formation, from the evolutionof primordial binaries. this scenario is also supported by the results of newdynamical simulations presented here. both galaxies coincide with therelationship between the bss frequency and the absolute visual magnitude mvfound by momany et al (2007). if this relationship is confirmed by largersample, then it could be a valuable tool to discriminate between the presenceof bsss and galaxies hosting truly young populations.

1110.0484	structure and dynamics of the globular cluster palomar 13	we present keck/deimos spectroscopy and cfht/megacam photometry for the milkyway globular cluster palomar 13. we triple the number of spectroscopicallyconfirmed members, including many repeat velocity measurements. palomar 13 isthe only known globular cluster with possible evidence for dark matter, basedon a keck/hires 21 star velocity dispersion of sigma=2.2+/-0.4 km/s. wereproduce this measurement, but demonstrate that it is inflated by unresolvedbinary stars. for our sample of 61 stars, the velocity dispersion issigma=0.7(+0.6/-0.5) km/s. combining our deimos data with literature values,our final velocity dispersion is sigma=0.4(+0.4/-0.3) km/s. we determine aspectroscopic metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.6+/-0.1 dex, placing a 1-sigma upperlimit of sigma_[fe/h]~0.2 dex on any internal metallicity spread. we determinepalomar 13's total luminosity to be m_v=-2.8+/-0.4, making it among the leastluminous known globular clusters. the photometric isophotes are regular out tothe half-light radius and mildly irregular outside this radius. the outersurface brightness profile slope is shallower than typical globular clusters(eta=-2.8+/-0.3). thus at large radius, tidal debris is likely affecting theappearance of palomar 13. combining our luminosity with the intrinsic velocitydispersion, we find a dynamical mass of of m_1/2=1.3(+2.7/-1.3)x10^3 m_sun anda mass-to-light ratio of m/l_v=2.4(+5.0/-2.4) m_sun/l_sun. within ourmeasurement errors, the mass-to-light ratio agrees with the theoreticalpredictions for a single stellar population. we conclude that, while there issome evidence for tidal stripping at large radius, the dynamical mass ofpalomar 13 is consistent with its stellar mass and neither significant darkmatter, nor extreme tidal heating, is required to explain the cluster dynamics.

1201.2821	variable stars in the cetus dsph galaxy: population gradients and  connections with the star formation history	we investigate the variable star content of the isolated, local group, dwarfspheroidal galaxy (dsph) cetus. multi-epoch, wide-field images collected withthe vlt/vimos camera allowed us to detect 638 variable stars (630 rr lyraestars and 8 anomalous cepheids), 475 of which are new detections. we present afull catalogue of periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes. motivated by therecent discovery that the pulsational properties of the rr lyrae stars in thetucana dsph revealed the presence of a metallicity gradient within the oldest(&gt;10 gyr old) stellar populations, we investigated the possibility of ananalogous effect in cetus. we found that, despite the obvious radial gradientin the horizontal branch (hb) and red giant branch (rgb) morphologies, bothbecoming bluer on average for increasing distance from the center of cetus, theproperties of the rr lyrae stars are homogeneous within the investigated area(out to r~15'), with no significant evidence of a radial gradient. we discussthis in connection with the star formation history (sfh) previously derived forthe two galaxies. the observed differences between these two systems show thateven systems this small show a variety of early evolutionary histories. thesedifferences could be due to different merger or accretion histories.

1202.2825	the double sub-giant branch of ngc 6656 (m22): a chemical  characterization	we present an abundance analysis of 101 subgiant branch (sgb) stars in theglobular cluster m22. using low resolution flames/giraffe spectra we havedetermined abundances of the neutron-capture strontium and barium and the lightelement carbon. with these data we explore relationships between the observedsgb photometric split in this cluster and two stellar groups characterized bydifferent contents of iron, slow neutron-capture process (s-process) elements,and the alpha element calcium, that we previously discovered in m22's red-giantstars. we show that the sgb stars correlate in chemical composition andcolor-magnitude diagram position: the stars with higher metallicity andrelative s-process abundances define a fainter sgb, while stars with lowermetallicity and s-process content reside on a relatively brighter sgb. thisresult has implications for the relative ages of the two stellar groups of m22.in particular, it is inconsistent with a large spread in ages of the two sgbs.by accounting for the chemical content of the two stellar groups, isochronefitting of the double sgb suggests that their ages are not different by morethan 300 myr.

1204.4612	the carina project. v. the impact of nlte effects on the iron content	we have performed accurate iron abundance measurements for 44 red giants(rgs) in the carina dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. we used archival,high-resolution spectra (r~38,000) collected with uves at eso/vlt either inslit mode (5) or in fiber mode (39, flames/giraffe-uves). the sample is morethan a factor of four larger than any previous spectroscopic investigation ofstars in dsphs based on high-resolution (r&gt;38,000) spectra. we did not imposethe ionization equilibrium between neutral and singly-ionized iron lines. theeffective temperatures and the surface gravities were estimated by fittingstellar isochrones in the v, b-v color-magnitude diagram. to measure the ironabundance of individual lines we applied the lte spectrum synthesis fittingmethod using marcs model atmospheres of appropriate metallicity. we foundevidence of nlte effects between neutral and singly-ionized iron abundances.assuming that the feii abundances are minimally affected by nlte effects, wecorrected the fei stellar abundances using a linear fit between fei and feiistellar abundance determinations.  we found that the carina metallicity distribution based on the corrected feiabundances (44 rgs) has a weighted mean metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.80 and aweighted standard deviation of sigma=0.24 dex. the carina metallicitydistribution based on the feii abundances (27 rgs) gives similar estimates([fe/h]=-1.72, sigma=0.24 dex). the current weighted mean metallicities areslightly more metal poor when compared with similar estimates available in theliterature. furthermore, if we restrict our analysis to stars with the mostaccurate iron abundances, ~20 fei and at least three feii measurements (15stars), we found that the range in iron abundances covered by carina rgs (~1dex) agrees quite well with similar estimates based on high-resolution spectra.

1205.4071	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. ii. age dependencies and new insights	models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuringaccurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. multiplebinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these oldstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. in the firstpaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsingbinaries in the old open cluster ngc6791 sets tighter constraints on theproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, therebypotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. herewe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison todetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employingas many observational constraints as possible. we improve our photometry andcorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. we then perform anextensive comparison of the cmds and eclipsing binary measurements to victoriaand dsep isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. we also reanalyse aspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [fe/h] constraints. we find a bestestimate of the age of ~8.3 gyr while demonstrating that remaining ageuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the cno abundances. the heliummass fraction is well constrained at y = 0.30 \pm 0.01 resulting in dy/dz ~ 1.4assuming that such a relation exists. during the analysis we firmly identifyblue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for thepresence of their evolved counterparts. our analysis supports the rgb mass-lossfound from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass ofstars on the lower rgb, 1.15\pm0.02msun. this will be an important consistencycheck for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.

1209.4901	an empirical measure of the rate of white dwarf cooling in 47 tucanae	we present an empirical determination of the white dwarf cooling sequence inthe globular cluster 47 tucanae. using spectral models, we determinetemperatures for 887 objects from wide field camera 3 data, as well as 292objects from data taken with the advanced camera for surveys. we make theassumption that the rate of white dwarf formation in the cluster is constant.stellar evolution models are then used to determine the rate at which objectsare leaving the main sequence, which must be the same as the rate at whichobjects are arriving on the white dwarf sequence in our field. the result is anempirically derived relation between temperature ($t_{eff}$) and time ($t$) onthe white dwarf cooling sequence. comparing this result to theoretical coolingmodels, we find general agreement with the expected slopes between 20,000k and30,000k and between 6,000k and 20,000k, but the transition to the mestelcooling rate of $t_{eff} \propto t^{-0.4}$ is found to occur at hottertemperatures, and more abruptly than is predicted by any of these models.

1209.6496	on the central helium-burning variable stars of the leoi dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we present a study of short period, central helium-burning variable stars inthe local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy leoi, including 106 rr lyrae stars and51 cepheids. so far, this is the largest sample of cepheids and the largestcepheids to rr lyrae ratio found in such a kind of galaxy. the comparison withother local group dwarf spheroidals, carina and fornax, shows that the perioddistribution of rr lyrae stars is quite similar, suggesting similar propertiesof the parent populations, whereas the cepheid period distribution in leoipeaks at longer periods (p \sim 1.26d instead of ~0.5d) and spans over abroader range, from 0.5 to 1.78d.  evolutionary and pulsation predictions indicate, assuming a mean metallicitypeaked within -1.5&lt;= [fe/h]&lt;=-1.3, that the current sample of leoi cepheidstraces a unique mix of anomalous cepheids (blue extent of the red--clump,partially electron degenerate central helium-burning stars) and short-periodclassical cepheids (blue-loop, quiescent central helium-burning stars). currentevolutionary prescriptions also indicate that the transition mass between thetwo different groups of stars is mhef \sim 2.1 mo, and it is constant for starsmetal-poorer than [fe/h]\sim-0.7. finally, we briefly outline the differentimplications of the current findings on the star formation history of leoi.

0712.0603	on the white dwarf cooling sequence of the globular cluster omega  centauri	we present deep and precise photometry (f435, f625w, f658n) of omega cencollected with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board the hubble spacetelescope (hst). we have identified ~ 6,500 white dwarf (wd) candidates, andthe ratio of wd and main sequence (ms) star counts is found to be at least afactor of two larger than the ratio of co-core wd cooling and ms lifetimes.this discrepancy is not explained by the possible occurrence of a he-enhancedstellar population, since the ms lifetime changes by only 15% when changingfrom a canonical (y=0.25) to a he-enhanced composition (y=0.42). the presenceof some he-core wds seems able to explain the observed star counts. thefraction of he wds required ranges from 10% to 80% depending on their mean massand it is at least five times larger than for field wds. the comparison in thecolor magnitude diagram between theory and observations also supports thepresence of he wds. empirical evidence indicates that he wds have been detectedin stellar systems hosting a large sample of extreme horizontal branch stars,thus suggesting that a fraction of red giants might avoid the he-core flash.

1302.1714	on the density profile of the globular cluster m92	we present new number density and surface brightness profiles for theglobular cluster m92 (ngc 6341). these profiles are calculated from opticalimages collected with the ccd mosaic camera megacam at thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope and with the advanced camera for surveys on thehubble space telescope. the ground-based data were supplemented with the sloandigital sky survey photometric catalog. special care was taken to discriminatecandidate cluster stars from field stars and to subtract the backgroundcontamination from both profiles. by examining the contour levels of the numberdensity, we found that the stellar distribution becomes clumpy at radialdistances larger than about 13 arcminutes, and there is no preferredorientation of contours in space. we performed detailed fits of king and wilsonmodels to the observed profiles. the best-fit models underestimate the numberdensity inside the core radius. wilson models better represent theobservations, in particular in the outermost cluster regions: the good globalagreement of these models with the observations suggests that there is no needto introduce an extra-tidal halo to explain the radial distribution of stars atlarge radial distances. the best-fit models for the number density and thesurface brightness profiles are different, even though they are based on thesame observations. additional tests support the evidence that this factreflects the difference in the radial distribution of the stellar tracers thatdetermine the observed profiles (main sequence stars for the number density,bright evolved stars for the surface brightness).

1303.5187	the sumo project i. a survey of multiple populations in globular  clusters	we present a general overview and the first results of the sumo project (asurvey of multiple populations in globular clusters). the objective of thissurvey is the study of multiple stellar populations in the largest sample ofglobular clusters homogeneously analysed to date. to this aim we obtained highsignal-to-noise (s/n&gt;50) photometry for main sequence stars with mass down to~0.5 m_sun in a large sample of clusters using both archival and proprietary u,b, v, and i data from ground-based telescopes. in this paper, we focus on theoccurrence of multiple stellar populations in twenty three clusters. we havedefined a new photometric index cubi= (u-b)-(b-i), that turns out to be veryeffective for identifying multiple sequences along the red giant branch (rgb).we found that in the v-cubi diagram all clusters presented in this paper showbroadened or multimodal rgbs, with the presence of two or more components. wefound a direct connection with the chemical properties of different sequences,that display different abundances of light elements (o, na, c, n, and al). thecubi index is also a powerful tool to identify distinct sequences of starsalong the horizontal branch and, for the first time in the case of ngc104 (47tuc), along the asymptotic giant branch. our results demonstrate that i) thepresence of more than two stellar populations is a common feature amongglobular clusters, as already highlighted in previous work; ii) multiplesequences with different chemical contents can be easily identified by usingstandard johnson photometry obtained with ground-based facilities; iii) in thestudy of gc multiple stellar populations the cubi index is alternative tospectroscopy, and has the advantage of larger statistics.

1307.3858	the carina project. vi. the helium burning variable stars	we present new optical (bvi) time-series data for the evolved variable starsin the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the quality of the data and theobserving strategy allowed us to identify 14 new variable stars. eight out ofthe 14 are rr lyrae (rrl) stars, four are anomalous cepheids (acs) and two aregeometrical variables. comparison of the period distribution for the entiresample of rrls with similar distributions in nearby dsphs and in the largemagellanic cloud indicates that the old stellar populations in these systemsshare similar properties. this finding is also supported by the rrldistribution in the bailey diagram. on the other hand, the period distributionand the bailey diagram of acs display significant differences among the abovestellar systems. this evidence suggests that the properties of intermediate-agestellar populations might be affected both by environmental effects andstructural parameters. we use the bv period--wesenheit (pw) relation of rrlstogether with evolutionary prescriptions and find a true distance modulus of20.09+/-0.07(intrinsic)+/-0.1(statistical) mag that agrees quite well withsimilar estimates available in the literature. we identified four peculiarvariables. taking into account their position in the bailey diagram and in thebv pw relation, two of them (v14, v149) appear to be candidate acs, while two(v158, v182) might be peculiar rrls. in particular, the variable v158 has aperiod and a v-band amplitude very similar to the low-mass rrl---rrlr-02792---recently identified by pietrzynski at al.

1308.0032	an age difference of 2 gyr between a metal-rich and a metal-poor  globular cluster	globular clusters trace the formation history of the spheroidal components ofboth our galaxy and others, which represent the bulk of star formation over thehistory of the universe. they also exhibit a range of metallicities, withmetal-poor clusters dominating the stellar halo of the galaxy, and highermetallicity clusters found within the inner galaxy, associated with the stellarbulge, or the thick disk. age differences between these clusters can indicatethe sequence in which the components of the galaxy formed, and in particularwhich clusters were formed outside the galaxy and later swallowed along withtheir original host galaxies, and which were formed in situ. here we present anage determination of the metal-rich globular cluster 47 tucanae by fitting theproperties of the cluster white dwarf population, which implies an absolute ageof 9.9 (0.7) gyr at 95% confidence. this is about 2.0 gyr younger than inferredfor the metal-poor cluster ngc 6397 from the same models, and providesquantitative evidence that metal-rich clusters like 47 tucanae formed laterthan the metal-poor halo clusters like ngc 6397.

1410.8378	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. v. ngc 6723	we used flames+giraffe (medusa mode) at the vlt to obtain moderately highresolution spectra for 30 red horizontal branch (rhb) stars, 4 rr lyraevariables, and 17 blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars in the low-concentration,moderately metal-rich globular cluster ngc6723 ([fe/h]=-1.22+/-0.08 from ourpresent sample). the spectra were optimized to derive o and na abundances. inaddition, we obtained abundances for other elements, including n, fe, mg, ca,ni, and ba. we used these data to discuss the evidence of a connection betweenthe distribution of stars along the horizontal branch (hb) and the multiplepopulations that are typically present in globular clusters. we found that allrhb and most (13 out of 17) bhb stars are o-rich, na-poor, and n-poor; thesestars probably belong to the first stellar generation in this cluster. only thefour warmest observed stars are (moderately) o-poor, na-rich, and n-rich, andthey probably belong to the second generation. while our sample is not fullyrepresentative of the whole hb population in ngc6723, our data suggest that inthis cluster only hb stars warmer than ~9000 k, that is one fourth of thetotal, belong to the second generation, if at all. since in many other clustersthis fraction is about two thirds, we conclude that the fraction offirst/second generation in globular clusters may be strongly variable. inaddition, the wide range in colour of chemically homogeneous first-generationhb stars requires a considerable spread in mass loss (&gt;0.10 mo). the reason forthis spread is yet to be understood. finally, we found a high ba abundance,with a statistically significant radial abundance gradient.

1411.6826	on the distance of the globular cluster m4 (ngc 6121) using rr lyrae  stars: i. optical and near-infrared period-luminosity and period-wesenheit  relations	we present new distance determinations to the nearby globular m4 (ngc~6121)based on accurate optical and near infrared (nir) mean magnitudes forfundamental (fu) and first overtone (fo) rr lyrae variables (rrls), and newempirical optical and nir period-luminosity (pl) and period-wesenheit (pw)relations. we have found that optical-nir and nir pl and pw relations areaffected by smaller standard deviations than optical relations. the differenceis the consequence of a steady decrease in the intrinsic spread of cluster rrlapparent magnitudes at fixed period as longer wavelengths are considered. theweighted mean visual apparent magnitude of 44 cluster rrls is$\left&lt;v\right&gt;=13.329\pm0.001$ (standard error of the mean) $\pm$0.177(weighted standard deviation) mag. distances were estimated using rr lyr itselfto fix the zero-point of the empirical pl and pw relations. using the entiresample (fu$+$fo) we found weighted mean true distance moduli of11.35$\pm$0.03$\pm$0.05 mag and 11.32$\pm$0.02$\pm$0.07 mag. distances werealso evaluated using predicted metallicity dependent plz and pwz relations. wefound weighted mean true distance moduli of 11.283$\pm$0.010$\pm$0.018 mag (nirplz) and 11.272$\pm$0.005$\pm$0.019 mag (optical--nir and nir pwz). the aboveweighted mean true distance moduli agree within 1$\sigma$. the same result isfound from distances based on pwz relations in which the color index isindependent of the adopted magnitude (11.272$\pm$0.004$\pm$0.013 mag). thesedistances agree quite well with the geometric distance provided by\citep{kaluzny2013} based on three eclipsing binaries. the available evidenceindicates that this approach can provide distances to globulars hosting rrlswith a precision better than 2--3\%.

1502.07438	iron and s-elements abundance variations in ngc5286: comparison with  anomalous globular clusters and milky way satellites	we present a high resolution spectroscopic analysis of 62 red giants in themilky way globular cluster ngc5286. we have determined abundances ofrepresentative light proton-capture, alpha, fe-peak and neutron-capture elementgroups, and combined them with photometry of multiple sequences observed alongthe colour-magnitude diagram. our principal results are: (i) a broad, bimodaldistribution in s-process element abundance ratios, with two main groups, thes-poor and s-rich groups; (ii) substantial star-to-star fe variations, with thes-rich stars having higher fe, e.g. &lt;[fe/h]&gt;_s-rich - &lt;[fe/h]&gt;_s-poor ~0.2~dex; and (iii) the presence of o-na-al (anti-)correlations in both stellargroups. we have defined a new photometric index, c_{bvi}=(b-v)-(v-i), tomaximise the separation in the colour-magnitude diagram between the two stellargroups with different fe and s-element content, and this index is notsignificantly affected by variations in light elements (such as the o-naanticorrelation). the variations in the overall metallicity present in ngc5286add this object to the class of "anomalous" gcs. furthermore, the chemicalabundance pattern of ngc5286 resembles that observed in some of the anomalousgcs, e.g. m22, ngc1851, m2, and the more extreme omega centauri, that also showinternal variations in s-elements, and in light elements within stars withdifferent fe and s-elements content. in view of the common variations ins-elements, we propose the term s-fe-anomalous gcs to describe this sub-classof objects. the similarities in chemical abundance ratios between these objectsstrongly suggest similar formation and evolution histories, possibly associatedwith an origin in tidally disrupted dwarf satellites.

1505.06597	the carina project. viii. the {\alpha}-element abundances	we have performed a new abundance analysis of carina red giant (rg) starsfrom spectroscopic data collected with uves (high resolution) andflames/giraffe (high and medium resolution) at eso/vlt. the former sampleincludes 44 rgs, while the latter consists of 65 (high) and ~800 (mediumresolution) rgs, covering a significant fraction of the galaxy's rg branch(rgb), and red clump stars. to improve the abundance analysis at the faintmagnitude limit, the flames/giraffe data were divided into ten surface gravityand effective temperature bins. the spectra of the stars belonging to the samegravity/temperature bin were stacked. this approach allowed us to increase byat least a factor of five the signal-to-noise ratio in the faint limit(v&gt;20.5mag). we took advantage of the new photometry index cu,b,i introduced bymonelli et al. (2014), as an age and probably a metallicity indicator, to splitstars along the rgb. these two stellar populations display distinct [fe/h] and[mg/h] distributions: their mean fe abundances are -2.15$\pm$0.06dex(sig=0.28), and -1.75$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.21), respectively. the two irondistributions differ at the 75% level. this supports preliminary results bylemasle et al. (2012) and by monelli et al. (2014). moreover, we found that theold and intermediate-age stellar populations have mean [mg/h] abundances of-1.91$\pm$0.05dex (sig=0.22) and -1.35$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.22); these differ atthe 83% level. carina's {\alpha}-element abundances agree, within 1sigma, withsimilar abundances for field halo stars and for cluster (galactic, magellanic)stars. the same outcome applies to nearby dwarf spheroidals and ultra-faintdwarf galaxies, in the iron range covered by carina stars. finally, we foundevidence of a clear correlation between na and o abundances, thus suggestingthat carina's chemical enrichment history is quite different than in theglobular clusters.

1507.01596	a chemical trompe-l'\oe{}il: no iron spread in the globular cluster m22	we present the analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with uves anduves-flames at the very large telescope of 17 giants in the globular clusterm22, a stellar system suspected to have an intrinsic spread in the ironabundance. we find that when surface gravities are derived spectroscopically(by imposing to obtain the same iron abundance from fei and feii lines) the[fe/h] distribution spans ~0.5 dex, according to previous analyses. however,the gravities obtained in this way correspond to unrealistic low stellar masses(0.1-0.5 msun) for most of the surveyed giants. instead, when photometricgravities are adopted, the [feii/h] distribution shows no evidence of spread atvariance with the [fei/h] distribution. this difference has been recentlyobserved in other clusters and could be due to non-local thermodynamicalequilibrium effects driven by over-ionization mechanisms, that mainly affectthe neutral species (thus providing lower [fei/h]) but leave [feii/h]unaltered. we confirm that the s-process elements show significant star-to-starvariations and their abundances appear to be correlated with the differencebetween [fei/h] and [feii/h]. this puzzling finding suggests that the peculiarchemical composition of some cluster stars may be related to effects able tospuriously decrease [fei/h]. we conclude that m22 is a globular cluster with noevidence of intrinsic iron spread, ruling out that it has retained thesupernovae ejecta in its gravitational potential well.

1507.08350	the acs lcid project: on the origin of dwarf galaxy types: a  manifestation of the halo assembly bias?	we discuss how knowledge of the whole evolutionary history of dwarf galaxies,including details on the early star formation events, can provide insight onthe origin of the different dwarf galaxy types. we suggest that these types maybe imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only theresult of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmentaleffects. we present precise star formation histories of a sample of local groupdwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldestmain-sequence turnoffs. we argue that these galaxies can be assigned to twobasic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and shortstar formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of theirstars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (oralmost). these two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto thepresent-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). slow and fastdwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the milky wayand/or m31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lowerdensity environments than fast dwarfs. we propose that the distinction betweena fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density ofthe environment where they form. at a later stage, interaction with a largehost galaxy may play a role in the final gas removal and ultimate terminationof star formation.

1508.06942	variable stars in local group galaxies. i: tracing the early chemical  enrichment and radial gradients in the sculptor dsph with rr lyrae stars	we identified and characterized the largest (536) rr lyrae (rrl) sample in amilky way dsph satellite (sculptor) based on optical photometry data collectedover $\sim$24 years.  the rrls display a spread in v-magnitude ($\sim$0.35 mag) which appearslarger than photometric errors and the horizontal branch (hb) luminosityevolution of a mono-metallic population. using several calibrations of twodifferent reddening free and metal independent period-wesenheit relations weprovide a new distance estimate $\mu$=19.62 mag ($\sigma_{\mu}$=0.04 mag) thatagrees well with literature estimates. we constrained the metallicitydistribution of the old population, using the $m_i$ period-luminosity relation,and we found that it ranges from -2.3 to -1.5 dex. the current estimate isnarrower than suggested by low and intermediate spectroscopy of rgbs($\delta$[fe/h] $\le$ 1.5).  we also investigated the hb morphology as a function of the galactocentricdistance. the hb in the innermost regions is dominated by red hb stars and byrrls, consistent with a more metal-rich population, while in the outermostregions it is dominated by blue hb stars and rrls typical of a metal-poorpopulation. our results suggest that fast chemical evolution occurred insculptor, and that the radial gradients were in place at an early epoch.

1509.01764	towards precision photometry with extremely large telescopes: the double  subgiant branch of ngc 1851	the extremely large telescopes currently under construction have a collectingarea that is an order of magnitude larger than the present largest opticaltelescopes. for seeing-limited observations the performance will scale as thecollecting area but, with the successful use of adaptive optics, for manyapplications it will scale as $d^4$ (where $d$ is the diameter of the primarymirror). central to the success of the elts, therefore, is the successful useof multi-conjugate adaptive optics (mcao) that applies a high degree correctionover a field of view larger than the few arcseconds that limits classicaladaptive optics systems. in this letter, we report on the analysis of crowdedfield images taken on the central region of the galactic globular cluster ngc1851 in $k_s$ band using gems at the gemini south telescope, the onlyscience-grade mcao system in operation. we use this cluster as a benchmark toverify the ability to achieve precise near-infrared photometry by presentingthe deepest $k_s$ photometry in crowded fields ever obtained from the ground.we construct a colour-magnitude diagram in combination with the f606w band fromhst/acs. as well as detecting the "knee" in the lower main sequence at$k_s\simeq20.5$, we also detect the double subgiant branch of ngc 1851, thatdemonstrates the high photometric accuracy of gems in crowded fields.

1509.02687	the carina project ix: on hydrogen and helium burning variables	we present new multi-band (ubvi) time-series data of helium burning variablesin the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the current sample includes 92 rrlyrae-six of them are new identifications-and 20 anomalous cepheids, one ofwhich is new identification. the analysis of the bailey diagram shows that theluminosity amplitude of the first overtone component in double-mode variablesis located along the long-period tail of regular first overtone variables,while the fundamental component is located along the short-period tale ofregular fundamental variables. this evidence further supports the transitionalnature of these objects. moreover, the distribution of carina double-modevariables in the petersen diagram (p_1/p_0 vs p_0) is similar to metal-poorglobulars (m15, m68), to the dwarf spheroidal draco and to the galactic halo.this suggests that the carina old stellar population is metal-poor and affectedby a small spread in metallicity. we use trigonometric parallaxes for fivefield rr lyrae stars to provide an independent estimate of the carina distanceusing the observed reddening free period--wesenheit [pw, (bv)] relation. theoryand observations indicate that this diagnostic is independent of metallicity.we found a true distance modulus of \mu=20.01\pm0.02 (standard error of themean) \pm0.05 (standard deviation) mag. we also provided independent estimatesof the carina true distance modulus using four predicted pw relations (bv, bi,vi, bvi) and we found: \mu=(20.08\pm0.007\pm0.07) mag,\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag, \mu=(20.07\pm0.008\pm0.08) mag and\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag. finally, we identified more than 100 new sxphoenicis stars that together with those already known in the literature (340)make carina a fundamental laboratory to constrain the evolutionary andpulsation properties of these transitional variables.

1511.05714	clear evidence for the presence of second-generation asymptotic giant  branch stars in metal-poor galactic globular clusters	galactic globular clusters (gcs) are known to host multiple stellarpopulations: a first generation with a chemical pattern typical of halo fieldstars and a second generation (sg) enriched in na and al and depleted in o andmg. both stellar generations are found at different evolutionary stages (e.g.,the main-sequence turnoff, the subgiant branch, and the red giant branch). thenon detection of sg asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in several metal-poor([fe/h] &lt; -1) gcs suggests that not all sg stars ascend the agb phase, and thatfailed agb stars may be very common in metal-poor gcs. this observationrepresents a serious problem for stellar evolution and gc formation/evolutiontheories. we report fourteen sg-agb stars in four metal-poor gcs (m 13, m 5, m3, and m 2) with different observational properties: horizontal branch (hb)morphology, metallicity, and age. by combining the h-band al abundancesobtained by the apogee survey with ground-based optical photometry, we identifysg al-rich agb stars in these four gcs and show that al-rich rgb/agb gc starsshould be na-rich. our observations provide strong support for present,standard stellar models, i.e., without including a strong mass-loss efficiency,for low-mass hb stars. in fact, current empirical evidence is in agreement withthe predicted distribution of fg and and sg stars during the he-burning stagesbased on these standard stellar models.

1512.03194	gems mcao observations of the galactic globular cluster ngc 2808: the  absolute age	globular clusters are the oldest stellar systems in the milky way and probethe early epoch of the galaxy formation. however, the uncertainties on theirabsolute age are still too large to soundly constrain how the galacticstructures have assembled. the aim of this work is to obtain an accurateestimate of the absolute age of the globular cluster ngc 2808 using deep irdata obtained with the multi conjugate adaptive optics system operating at thegemini south telescope (gems). this exquisite photometry, combined with thatobtained in v and i bands with hst, allowed us the detection of the faint mainsequence knee feature in ngc 2808 colour magnitude diagram. the differencebetween this point and the main sequence turn off is a good age estimator andprovides ages with unprecedented accuracy. we found that ngc 2808 has an age oft=10.9\pm0.7 (intrinsic) \pm0.45 (metallicity term) gyr. a possiblecontamination by he-enhanced population could make the cluster up to 0.25 gyrolder. although this age estimate agrees with the age coming from the classicalturn off method (t=11.0 gyr), its uncertainty is a factor ~3 better, since itavoids systematics in reddening, distance assumptions and photometric zeropoints determination. the final absolute age indicates that ngc 2808 isslightly younger than other galactic globular clusters with similarmetallicity.

0806.3669	outside-in disk evolution in the lmc	from the analysis of the color-magnitude diagrams and color functions of fourwide lmc fields located from ~2 to 6 kpc from the kinematic center of the lmcwe present evidence that, while the oldest population is coeval in all fields,the age of the youngest component of the dominant stellar population graduallyincreases with galactocentric distance, from currently active star formation ina field at 2.3 deg, to 100 myr, 0.8 gyr, and 1.5 gyr in fields at 4.0 deg, 5.5deg, and 7.1 deg, respectively. this outside-in quenching of the star formationin the lmc disk is correlated with the decreasing hi column density (which is &lt;2x 10^{20} cm^{-2} in the two outermost fields with little or no current starformation. other work in the literature hints at similar behavior in thestellar populations of irregular galaxies, and in m33. this is observationalevidence against the inside-out disk formation scenario in low-mass spirals andirregular galaxies. alternatively, it could be that the age distribution withradius results from interplay between the evolution with time of thestar-forming area of the lmc and the subsequent outward migration of the stars.

(2001)to have [fe/h] =-1.68+/-0.11 dex. in draco, we find eight nonmembers, confirmthe membership of one known carbon star, and find two new members. one of thesestars is a carbon star, while the other shows no evidence for c2 bands orstrong atomic bands, although the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is low.thus, we find no evidence for a population of stars more metal-rich than [fe/h]\~ -1.45 dex in either of these galaxies. indeed, our spectroscopic surveysuggests that every candidate suspected of having a metallicity in excess ofthis value based on its position in the color-magnitude diagram is, inactuality, a carbon star. based on the census of 13 known carbon stars in thesetwo galaxies, we estimate of the carbon star specific frequency to be e(dsph) ~2.4e-5/lsolarv, 25-100 times higher than that of galactic globular clusters.

astro-ph;0401440	hst observations of the main sequence of m4	this paper presents new results from a photometric study of the main-sequencestars in m4, the closest globular cluster to the sun. multi-field, multi-epochobservations at approximately 1, 2, and 6 core-radii were obtained with thewfpc2 camera on the hst. the multi-epoch observations allowed us to clean thedata on the basis of proper motion. in all the fields the cluster main sequencecan be traced to at least v = 27.0 but there remains a trail of stars to thelimit of the data near v = 30 in the deepest outer field. there is no evidencethat we have reached the end of the hydrogen burning main sequence in any ofour fields, however, there is some indication that very few stars remain to bedetected in the deepest data.  the scatter about the cluster main sequence yields a surprisingly small andvariable binary fraction; f_b = 2% in the inner parts of the cluster falling tothe 1% range outside. for the currently visible main sequence stars, thecluster mass function is very flat (alpha =0.1) in the outer field and flattensfurther in the inner fields suggesting well developed mass segregation. theobserved variation in the mass function is broadly consistent with isotropic,multi-mass michie-king models. because we have a large sample of white dwarfsin the outer field we are able to show that the cluster imf above 0.8msun wasconsiderably steeper than the present day mass function for low mass stars.  two appendicies are included in this contribution; a detailed discussion ofthe techniques used to reduce the data and a direct comparison between thecluster stars and those belonging to the inner spheroid of the galaxy yieldinga galactocentric distance of 7.5+/-0.6 kpc.

astro-ph;0402400	the variable star population in phoenix: coexistence of anomalous and  short-period classical cepheids, and detection of rr lyrae variables	we present the results of a search for variable stars in the local groupdwarf galaxy phoenix. nineteen cepheids, six candidate long-period variables,one candidate eclipsing binary and a large number of candidate rr lyrae starshave been identified. periods and light curves have been obtained for all thecepheid variables. their distribution in the period-luminosity diagram revealsthat both anomalous cepheids (ac) and short-period classical cepheids s-pcc arefound in our sample. this is the first time that both types of variable starare identified in the same system even though they likely coexist, but havegone unnoticed so far, in other low-metallicity galaxies like leo a and sextansa. we argue that the conditions for the existence of both types of variablestar in the same galaxy are a low metallicity at all ages, and the presence ofboth young and intermediate-age (or old, depending on the nature of ac) stars.the rr lyrae candidates trace, together with the well developed horizontalbranch, the existence of an important old population in phoenix. the differentspatial distributions of s-pcc, ac and rr lyrae variables in the phoenix fieldare consistent with the stellar population gradients found in phoenix, in thesense that the younger population is concentrated in the central part of thegalaxy. the gradients in the distribution of the young population within thecentral part of phoenix, which seem to indicate a propagation of the recentstar formation, are also reflected in the spatial distribution of the s-pcc.

astro-ph;0502585	on the anomalous red giant branch of the globular cluster omega cen	we present three different optical and near-infrared (nir) data sets forevolved stars in the galactic globular cluster omega cen the comparison betweenobservations and homogeneous sets of stellar isochrones and zero-age horizontalbranches provides two reasonable fits. both of them suggest that the so-calledanomalous branch has a metal-intermediate chemical composition (-1.1 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-0.8) and is located ~500 pc beyond the bulk of omega cen stars. these findingsare mainly supported by the shape of the subgiant branch in four differentcolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds). the most plausible fit requires a higherreddening, e(b-v)=0.155 vs. 0.12, and suggests that the anomalous branch iscoeval, within empirical and theoretical uncertainties, to the bulk of omegacen stellar populations. this result is supported by the identification of asample of faint horizontal branch stars that might be connected with theanomalous branch. circumstantial empirical evidence seems to suggest that thestars in this branch form a clump of stars located beyond the cluster.

(2004). these observations also support thenon-variable status of candidates v5, v9, and v15. the union of our light-curvedata with those of newburn (1957), mannino (1957) and arellano ferro et al.(op. cit.) permits the derivation of significantly improved periods. the meanperiods and the bailey period-amplitude diagrams support the classification ofthe cluster as oosterhoff i despite its predominantly blue horizontal branch.the number ratio of c- to ab-type rr lyrae stars, on the other hand, isunusually high for an oosterhoff i cluster. the calibrated results have beenmade available through the first author's web site.

astro-ph;0702646	leo a: a late-blooming survivor of the epoch of reionization in the  local group	as part of a major program to use isolated local group dwarf galaxies asnear-field probes of cosmology, we have obtained deep images of the dwarfirregular galaxy leo a with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope. from these images we have constructed a color-magnitudediagram (cmd) reaching apparent [absolute] magnitudes of (m475, m814) &gt; (29.0[+4.4], 27.9 [+3.4]), the deepest ever achieved for any irregular galaxy beyondthe magellanic clouds. we derive the star-formation rate (sfr) as a function oftime over the entire history of the galaxy. we find that over 90% of all thestar formation that ever occurred in leo a happened more recently than 8 gyrago. the cmd shows only a very small amount of star formation in the first fewbillion years after the big bang; a possible burst at the oldest ages cannot beclaimed with high confidence. the peak sfr occurred ~1.5-4 gyr ago, at a level5-10 times the current value. our modelling indicates that leo a hasexperienced very little metallicity evolution; the mean inferred metallicity isconsistent with measurements of the present-day gas-phase oxygen abundance. wecannot exclude a scenario in which all of the ancient star formation occurredprior to the end of the era of reionization, but it seems unlikely that thelack of star formation prior to ~8 gyr ago was due to early loss or exhaustionof the in situ gas reservoir.
