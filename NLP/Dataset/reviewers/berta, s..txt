0903.3972	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z ~ 2. iv. the variety of  dust populations	the properties of dust attenuation at rest-frame uv wavelengths are inferredfrom very high-quality fors2 spectra of 78 galaxies from the gmass survey at1&lt;z&lt;2.5. these objects complement a previously investigated sample of 108uv-luminous galaxies at similar redshifts, selected from the fdf spectroscopicsurvey, the k20 survey, and the gdds. the shape of the uv extinction curve isconstrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame uv continuum. the uvbump is further characterised by fitting lorentzian-like profiles. spectraexhibit a significant 2175a feature in at least 30% of the cases. ifattenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body viasuperwinds, uv extinction curves in-between those of the smc and lmccharacterise the sample galaxies. the fraction of galaxies with extinctioncurves differing from the smc one increases, if more dust resides in thegalactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. on average, thewidth of the manifested uv bumps is about 60% of the values typical of the lmcand milky way. this suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in thelmc2 supershell close to 30dor. the presence of the carriers of the uv bump at1&lt;z&lt;2.5 argues for outflows from agb stars being copious then. consistent withtheir higher sfrs, the gmass galaxies with a manifested uv bump are moreluminous at rest-frame 8mum, where the emission is dominated by pahs (alsoproducts of agb stars). in addition, they exhibit stronger uv absorptionfeatures, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolvedstellar populations. we conclude that diversification of the small-size dustcomponent has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at1&lt;z&lt;2.5.

0707.0028	the spectral energy distribution of quiescent black hole x-ray binaries:  new constraints from spitzer	(abridged) among the various issues that remain open in the field ofaccretion onto black hole x-ray binaries (bhbs) is the way the gas accretes atvery low eddington ratios, in the so-called quiescent regime. while there isgeneral agreement that the x-rays are produced by a population of high-energyelectrons near to the bh, the controversy comes about in modeling thecontribution from inflowing vs. outflowing particles, and their relative energybudget. recent spitzer observations of three quiescent bhbs have shown evidencefor excess emission with respect to the tail of the companion star between 8-24micron. we suggest that synchrotron emission from a partially self-absorbedoutflow might be responsible for the observed mid-ir excess, in place of, or inaddition to, thermal emission from circumbinary material. if so, then the jetsynchrotron luminosity exceeds the measured 2-10 kev luminosity by a factor ofa few in these systems. in turn, the mechanical power stored in the jet exceedsthe bolometric x-ray luminosity at least by 4 orders of magnitude. we thencompile the broadband spectral energy distribution (sed) of a0620-00, thelowest eddington-ratio stellar mass bh with a known radio counterpart, by meansof simultaneous radio, optical and x-ray observations, and the archival spitzerdata. we are able to fit the sed of a0620-00 with a `maximally jet-dominated'model in which the radio through the soft x-rays are dominated by synchrotronemission, while the hard x-rays are dominated by inverse compton at the jetbase. the fitted parameters land in a range of values that is reminiscent ofthe galactic center super-massive bh sgr a*. most notably, the inferred ratioof the jet acceleration rate to local cooling rates is two orders of magnitudeweaker with respect to higher luminosity, hard state sources.

0906.4489	witnessing the assembly at z=1.6 of a galaxy cluster (gmass ultradeep  spectroscopy of galaxies at z~2 - v)	we present a study of a galaxy overdensity at z=1.6, cl 0332-2742, uncoveredin the galaxy mass assembly ultra-deep spectroscopic survey (gmass). weconservatively estimate the overdensity in redshift space for the spike,containing 42 galaxies at z=1.6, to be 8.3+/-1.5 and find a velocity dispersionof 500 km/s. a map of the surface density of galaxies at z=1.6 in the gmassfield shows that its structure is irregular. the differences in the physicalproperties of cl 0332-2742 member and field galaxies agree with the latesthierarchical galaxy formation models: for overdensity members, the starformation rate (sfr), and specific sfr, is approximately 50% lower than for thefield galaxies; overdensity galaxies are twice the age, on average, of fieldgalaxies; and there is a higher proportion of both massive (m&gt;10^{10.7} m_sol),and early-type galaxies, inside cl 0332-2742 than in the field. among the 42members, 7 have spectra consistent with being passively evolving, massivegalaxies. in a z-j colour-magnitude diagram, the photometric data of theseearly-type galaxies are in close agreement with a theoretical red sequence of agalaxy cluster at redshift z=1.6, which formed most of its stars in a shortburst of star formation at z~3. we conclude that the redshift spike at z=1.6 inthe gmass field represents a sheet-like structure in the cosmic web and thearea with the highest surface density within this structure, containing alreadyseven passively evolving galaxies, will evolve into a cluster of galaxies at alater time.

0910.3097	multi-wavelength properties of spitzer-selected starbursts at z~2	a complete sample of 33 sources believed to be starbursts("5.8micron-peakers") was selected in the (0.5 sq. deg.) j1046+56 field withselection criteria f_(24micron)&gt;400mujy, the presence of a redshifted stellaremission peak at 5.8um, and r'(vega)&gt;23. the field, part of the swire lockmanhole field, benefits from very deep vla/gmrt 20cm, 50cm, and 90cm radio data(all 33 sources are detected at 50cm), and deep 160micron and 70micron spitzerdata. the 33 sources, with photometric redshifts ~1.5-2.5, were observed at1.2mm with iram-30m/mambo to an rms ~0.7-0.8mjy in most cases. theirmillimeter, radio, 7-band spitzer, and near-ir properties were jointlyanalyzed. the entire sample of 33 sources has an average 1.2mm flux density of1.56+/-0.22mjy and a median of 1.61mjy, so the majority of the sources can beconsidered smgs. four sources have confirmed 4sigma detections, and nine weretentatively detected at the 3sigma level. because of its 24micron selection,our sample shows systematically lower f_(1.2mm)/f_(24micron) flux ratios thanclassical smgs, probably because of enhanced pah emission. a median fir sed wasbuilt by stacking images at the positions of 21 sources in the region ofdeepest spitzer coverage. its parameters are t_(dust)=37+/-8k,l_(fir)=2.5x10^{12}lo, and sfr=450mo/yr. the fir-radio correlation providesanother estimate of l_(fir) for each source, with an average value of4.1x10^{12}lo; however, this value may be overestimated because of some agncontribution. most of our targets are also luminous star-forming bzk galaxieswhich constitute a significant fraction of weak smgs at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.3.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1102.4329	the redshift and nature of aztec/cosmos 1: a starburst galaxy at z=4.6	based on broad/narrow-band photometry and keck deimos spectroscopy we reporta redshift of z=4.64-0.08+0.06 for aztec/cosmos 1, the brightest sub-mm galaxyin the aztec/cosmos field. in addition to the cosmos-survey x-ray to radiodata, we report observations of the source with herschel/pacs (100, 160micron), cso/sharc ii (350 micron), carma and pdbi (3 mm). we do not detectco(5-4) line emission in the covered redshift ranges, 4.56-4.76 (pdbi/carma)and 4.94-5.02 (carma). if the line is within this bandwidth, this sets 3sigmaupper limits on the gas mass to &lt;~8x10^9 m_sol and &lt;~5x10^10 m_sol,respectively (assuming similar conditions as observed in z~2 smgs). this couldbe explained by a low co-excitation in the source. our analysis of the uv-irspectral energy distribution of aztec 1 shows that it is an extremely young(&lt;~50 myr), massive (m*~10^11 m_sol), but compact (&lt;~2 kpc) galaxy formingstars at a rate of ~1300 m_sol/yr. our results imply that aztec 1 is formingstars in a 'gravitationally bound' regime in which gravity prohibits theformation of a superwind, leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy andfurther generations of star formation.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

0710.0300	the contribution of very massive high-redshift swire galaxies to the  stellar mass function	(abridged) we selected high-z massive galaxies at 5.8 microns, in the swireelais-s1 field (1 sq. deg.). galaxies with the 1.6 microns stellar peakredshifted into the irac bands (z~1-3, called ``ir-peakers'') were identified.stellar masses were derived by means of spectro-photometric fitting and used tocompute the stellar mass function (mf) at z=1-2 and 2-3. a parametric fit tothe mf was performed, based on a bayesian formalism, and the stellar massdensity of massive galaxies above z=2 determined. we present the firstsystematic study of the very-massive tail of the galaxy stellar mass functionat high redshift. a total of 326 sources were selected. the majority of thesegalaxies have stellar masses in excess of 1e11 msun and lie at z&gt;1.5. theavailability of mid-ir data turned out to be a valuable tool to constrain thecontribution of young stars to galaxy seds, and thus their m(stars)/l ratio.the influence of near-ir data and of the chosen stellar library on the sedfitting are also discussed. a significant evolution is found not only forgalaxies with m~1e11 msun, but also in the highest mass bins considered. thecomoving number density of these galaxies was lower by more than a factor of 10at z=2-3, with respect to the local estimate. swire 5.8 micron peakers moremassive than 1.6x1e11 msun provide 30-50% of the total stellar mass density ingalaxies at z=2-3.

1107.2129	disk, merger, or outflow ? molecular gas kinematics in two powerful  obscured qsos at z&gt;3.4	we report on the detection of bright co(4-3) line emission in two powerful,obscured quasars discovered in the swire survey, sw022513 and sw022550 atz&gt;3.4. we analyze the line strength and profile to determine the gas mass,dynamical mass and the gas dynamics for both galaxies. in sw022513 we may havefound the first evidence for a molecular, agn-driven wind in the earlyuniverse. the line profile in sw022513 is broad (fwhm = 1000 km/s) andblueshifted by -200 km/s relative to systemic (where the systemic velocity isestimated from the narrow components of ionized gas lines, as is commonly donefor agn at low and high redshifts). sw022550 has a more regular, double-peakedprofile, which is marginally spatially resolved in our data, consistent witheither a merger or an extended disk. the molecular gas masses, 4x10^10 msun,are large and account for &lt;30% of the stellar mass, making these obscured qsosas gas rich as other powerful co emitting galaxies at high redshift, i.e.,submillimeter galaxies. our sources exhibit relatively lower star-formationefficiencies compared to other dusty, powerful starburst galaxies at highredshift. we speculate that this could be a consequence of the agn perturbingthe molecular gas.

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1111.4402	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z ~ 2 - vii. star formation,  extinction, and gas outflows from uv spectra	we use rest-frame uv spectroscopy to investigate the properties related tolarge-scale gas outflows, and to the dust extinction and star-formation ratesof a sample of z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies from the galaxy mass assemblyultradeep spectroscopic survey (gmass). dust extinction is estimated from therest-frame uv continuum slope and used to obtain dust-corrected star-formationrates for the galaxies of the sample. for the entire sample, a mean value ofthe continuum slope &lt;\beta&gt; = -1.11 \pm 0.44 (r.m.s.) was derived, while theaverage sfr was found to be &lt;sfr&gt; = 52 \pm 48 m_sun/yr (r.m.s.). a positivecorrelation between sfr and stellar mass was observed, in agreement with otherworks, the logarithmic slope of the relation being 1.10 \pm 0.10.low-ionization absorption lines, associated with the interstellar medium, werefound to be blueshifted, with respect to the rest frame of the system, whichindicates that there is outflowing gas with typical velocities of the order of~ 100 km/s. finally, investigating correlations between galaxy uv spectralcharacteristics and galaxy general properties, we report a possible correlationbetween the equivalent width of the interstellar absorption lines and sfr,stellar mass, and colour excess similar to that seen to hold at differentredshifts.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

1205.2045	clustering of star-forming galaxies detected in mid-infrared with the  spitzer wide-area survey	we discuss the clustering properties of galaxies with signs of ongoing starformation detected by the spitzer space telescope at 24mum band in the swirelockman hole field. the sample of mid-ir-selected galaxies includes ~20,000objects detected above a flux threshold of s24mum=310mujy. we adoptoptical/near-ir color selection criteria to split the sample into thelower-redshift and higher-redshift galaxy populations. we measure the angularcorrelation function on scales of theta=0.01-3.5 deg, from which, using thelimber inversion along with the redshift distribution established for similarlyselected source populations in the goods fields (rodighiero et al. 2010), weobtain comoving correlation lengths of r0=4.98+-0.28 h^-1 mpc and r0=8.04+-0.69 h^-1 mpc for the low-z (&lt;z&gt;=0.7) and high-z (&lt;z&gt;=1.7) subsamples,respectively. comparing these measurements with the correlation functions ofdark matter halos identified in the bolshoi cosmological simulation (klypin etal. 2011}, we find that the high-redshift objects reside in progressively moremassive halos reaching mtot&gt;3e12 h^-1 msun, compared to mtot&gt;7e11 h^-1 msun forthe low-redshift population. approximate estimates of the ir luminosities basedon the catalogs of 24mum sources in the goods fields show that our high-zsubsample represents a population of "distant ulirgs" with lir&gt;10^12lsun, whilethe low-z subsample mainly consists of "lirgs", lir~10^11lsun. the comparisonof number density of the 24mum selected galaxies and of dark matter halos withderived minimum mass mtot shows that only 20% of such halos may hoststar-forming galaxies.

1206.2319	herschel observations of a z~2 stellar mass selected galaxy sample drawn  from the goods nicmos survey	we present a study of the far-ir properties of a stellar mass selected sampleof 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 galaxies with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 9.5 drawn from the goods nicmossurvey (gns), the deepest h-band hubble space telescope survey of its typeprior to the installation of wfc3. we use far-ir and sub-mm data from the pacsand spire instruments on-board herschel, taken from the pacs evolutionary probe(pep) and herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key projectsrespectively. we find a total of 22 gns galaxies, with median log(m_*/m_sun) =10.8 and z = 2.0, associated with 250 um sources detected with snr &gt; 3. wederive mean total ir luminosity log l_ir (l_sun) = 12.36 +/- 0.05 andcorresponding star formation rate sfr_(ir+uv) = (280 +/- 40) m_sun/yr for theseobjects, and find them to have mean dust temperature t_dust ~ 35 k. we findthat the sfr derived from the far-ir photometry combined with uv-basedestimates of unobscured sfr for these galaxies is on average more than a factorof 2 higher than the sfr derived from extinction corrected uv emission alone,although we note that the ir-based estimate is subject to substantial malmquistbias. to mitigate the effect of this bias and extend our study to fainterfluxes, we perform a stacking analysis to measure the mean sfr in bins ofstellar mass. we obtain detections at the 2-4 sigma level at spire wavelengthsfor samples with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 10. in contrast to the herschel detected gnsgalaxies, we find that estimates of sfr_(ir+uv) for the stacked samples arecomparable to those derived from extinction corrected uv emission, although theuncertainties are large. we find evidence for an increasing fraction of dustobscured star formation with stellar mass, finding sfr_ir/sfr_uv \proptom_*^{0.7 +/- 0.2}, which is likely a consequence of the mass--metallicityrelation.

1206.2642	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei in the xmm-cosmos survey	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of both x-ray selectedbroad-line (type-1) and narrow-line (type-2) agn from the xmm-newton survey inthe cosmos field are presented. the sample is composed by 929 agn (382 type-1agn and 547 type-2 agn) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, x-rayluminosities and absorbing column densities. about 65% of the sources arespectroscopically identified as either type-1 or type-2 agn (83% and 52%respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the restof the sample. the study of such a large sample of x-ray selected agn with ahigh quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with theinclusion of herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron) to the optical-uvallows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections and eddington ratios. the kbol-lbol relations derived in thepresent work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable agn sample,and rely on observed redshifts, x-ray luminosities and column densitydistributions. we find that kbol is significantly lower at high lbol withrespect to previous estimates by marconi et al. (2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1207.2795	deep observations of co line emission from star-forming galaxies in a  cluster candidate at z=1.5	we report results from a deep jansky very large array (jvla) search for co1-0 line emission from galaxies in a candidate galaxy cluster at z~1.55 in thecosmos field. we target 4 galaxies with optical spectroscopic redshifts in therange z=1.47-1.59. two of these 4 galaxies, id51613 and id51813, are nominallydetected in co line emission at the 3-4 sigma level. we find co luminosities of2.4x10^10 k km/s pc^2 and 1.3x10^10 k km/s pc^2, respectively. taking advantagefrom the clustering and 2-ghz bandwidth of the jvla, we perform a search foremission lines in the proximity of optical sources within the field of view ofour observations. we limit our search to galaxies with k&lt;23.5 (ab) andz_phot=1.2-1.8. we find 2 bright optical galaxies to be associated withsignificant emission line peaks (&gt;4 sigma) in the data cube, which we identifywith the co line emission. to test the reliability of the line peaks found, weperformed a parallel search for line peaks using a bayesian inference method.monte carlo simulations show that such associations are statisticallysignificant, with probabilities of chance association of 3.5% and 10.7% for id51207 and id 51380, respectively. modeling of their optical/ir seds indicatesthat the co detected galaxies and candidates have stellar masses and sfrs inthe range (0.3-1.1)x10^11 m_sun and 60-160 m_sun/yr, with sfes comparable tothat found in other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. by comparingthe space density of co emitters derived from our observations with the spacedensity derived from previous co detections at z~1.5, and with semi-analyticpredictions for the co luminosity function, we suggest that the latter tend tounderestimate the number of co galaxies detected at high-redshift. finally, weargue about the benefits of future blind co searches in clustered fields withupcoming submm/radio facilities.

1209.1640	accreting smbhs in the cosmos field and the connection to their host  galaxies	using the wide multi-band photometry available in the cosmos field we explorethe host galaxy properties of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (agn)obtained by combining x-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. based on acareful study of their spectral energy distribution (sed), which has beenparametrized using a 2-component (agn+galaxy) model fit, we deriveddust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formationrates (sfrs). we find that agn hosts span a large range of stellar masses andsfrs. no color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the agn hosts, which arefound to be mainly massive, red galaxies. once accounting for the color-massdegeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginalenhancement of agn incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific starformation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of ourability to properly account for agn light contamination and dust extinction.interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black holegrowing at any given "specific accretion rate" (i.e. the ratio of x-rayluminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxymass, while it decreases as a power-law with lx/m. by analyzing thenormalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence ofagn increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance withthe overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxypopulation. although agn activity and star formation in galaxies do appear tohave a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within thecosmos sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signalingpowerful agn influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1210.2760	dust temperature and co-to-h2 conversion factor variations in the sfr-m*  plane	deep herschel imaging and 12co(2-1) line luminosities from the iram pdbi arecombined for a sample of 17 galaxies at z&gt;1 from the goods-n field. the sampleincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (ms) traced bystar-forming galaxies in the sfr-m* plane. the far-infrared data are used toderive dust masses, mdust. combined with an empirical prescription for thedependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (gdr), the co luminositiesand mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the co-to-h2 conversionfactor, alpha_co. like in the local universe, the value of alpha_co is a factorof ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs). wealso uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (tdust; alpha_codecreasing with increasing tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits tothe far-infrared data. while the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(tdust)relation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematicbiases in the determination of mdust, gdr or metallicity. although we cannotformally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with thedust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, acritical value of tdust=30k can be used to determine whether the appropriatealpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 msun(k kms pc^2)^-1, iftdust&gt;30k) or closer to the galactic value (4.35 msun (k kms pc^2)^-1, iftdust&lt;30k). this indicator has the great advantage of being less subjectivethan visual morphological classifications of mergers/sfgs, which can bedifficult at high z because of the clumpy nature of sfgs. in the absence offar-infrared data, the offset of a galaxy from the main sequence (i.e.,log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]) can be used to identify galaxies requiring theuse of an alpha_co conversion factor lower than the galactic value.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1211.5770	the far-infrared, uv and molecular gas relation in galaxies up to z=2.5	we use the infrared excess (irx) fir/uv luminosity ratio to study therelation between the effective uv attenuation (a_irx) and the uv spectral slope(beta) in a sample of 450 1&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxies. the fir data is from very deepherschel observations in the goods fields that allow us to detect galaxies withsfrs typical of galaxies with log(m)&gt;9.3. thus, we are able to study galaxieson and even below the main sfr-stellar mass relation (main sequence). we findthat main sequence galaxies form a tight sequence in the irx--beta plane, whichhas a flatter slope than commonly used relations. this slope favors a smc-likeuv extinction curve, though the interpretation is model dependent. the scatterin the irx-beta plane, correlates with the position of the galaxies in thesfr-m plane. using a smaller sample of galaxies with co gas masses, we studythe relation between the uv attenuation and the molecular gas content. we finda very tight relation between the scatter in the irx-beta plane and thespecific attenuation (s_a), a quantity that represents the attenuationcontributed by the molecular gas mass per young star. s_a is sensitive to boththe geometrical arrangement of stars and dust, and to the compactness of thestar forming regions. we use this empirical relation to derive a method forestimating molecular gas masses using only widely available integratedrest-frame uv and fir photometry. the method produces gas masses with anaccuracy between 0.12-0.16 dex in samples of normal galaxies between z~0 andz~1.5. major mergers and sub-millimeter galaxies follow a different s_arelation.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1301.4496	panchromatic spectral energy distributions of herschel sources	(abridged) far-infrared herschel photometry from the pep and hermes programsis combined with ancillary datasets in the goods-n, goods-s, and cosmos fields.based on this rich dataset, we reproduce the restframe uv to fir ten-colorsdistribution of galaxies using a superposition of multi-variate gaussian modes.the median sed of each mode is then fitted with a modified version of themagphys code that combines stellar light, emission from dust heated by starsand a possible warm dust contribution heated by an agn. the defined gaussiangrouping is also used to identify rare sources. the zoology of outliersincludes herschel-detected ellipticals, very blue z~1 ly-break galaxies,quiescent spirals, and torus-dominated agn with star formation. out of thesegroups and outliers, a new template library is assembled, consisting of 32 sedsdescribing the intrinsic scatter in the restframe uv-to-submm colors ofinfrared galaxies. this library is tested against l(ir) estimates with andwithout herschel data included, and compared to eight other popular methodsoften adopted in the literature. when implementing herschel photometry, theseapproaches produce l(ir) values consistent with each other within a medianabsolute deviation of 10-20%, the scatter being dominated more by fine tuningof the codes, rather than by the choice of sed templates. finally, the libraryis used to classify 24 micron detected sources in pep goods fields. agn appearto be distributed in the stellar mass (m*) vs. star formation rate (sfr) spacealong with all other galaxies, regardless of the amount of infrared luminositythey are powering, with the tendency to lie on the high sfr side of the "mainsequence". the incidence of warmer star-forming sources grows for objects withhigher specific star formation rates (ssfr), and they tend to populate the"off-sequence" region of the m*-sfr-z space.

1302.1202	nuclear activity is more prevalent in star-forming galaxies	we explore the question of whether low and moderate luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially found in galaxies that are undergoinga transition from active star formation to quiescence. this notion has beensuggested by studies of the uv-to-optical colors of agn hosts, which find themto be common among galaxies in the so-called "green valley", a region of galaxycolor space believed to be composed mostly of galaxies undergoingstar-formation quenching. combining the deepest current x-ray and herschel.pacs far-infrared (fir) observations of the two chandra deep fields (cdfs) withredshifts, stellar masses and rest-frame photometry derived from the extensiveand uniform multi-wavelength data in these fields, we compare the rest-frameu-v color distributions and sfr distributions of agns and carefully constructedsamples of inactive control galaxies. the uv-to-optical colors of agns areconsistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z~2, butwe show that such colors are poor tracers of star formation. while the firdistributions of both star-forming agns and star-forming inactive galaxies arestatistically similar, we show that agns are preferentially found instar-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, agns are less likely to befound in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. we postulate that, amongx-ray selected agns of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply ofcold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclearblack holes.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1304.7771	molecular gas mass functions of normal star forming galaxies since z~3	we use deep far-infrared data from the pep/goods-herschel surveys and restframe ultraviolet photometry to study the evolution of the molecular gas massfunction of normal star forming galaxies. computing the molecular gas mass,m(mol), by scaling star formation rates (sfr) through depletion timescales, orcombining ir luminosity and obscuration properties as in nordon et al., weobtain m(mol) for roughly 700, z=0.2-3.0 galaxies near the star forming "mainsequence". the number density of galaxies follows a schechter function ofm(mol). the characteristic mass m* is found to strongly evolve up to z~1, andthen to flatten at earlier epochs, resembling the infrared luminosity evolutionof similar objects. at z~1, our result is supported by an estimate based on thestellar mass function of star forming galaxies and gas fraction scalings fromthe phibss survey. we compare our measurements to results from current models,finding better agreement with those that are treating star formation lawsdirectly rather than in post-processing. integrating the mass function, westudy the evolution of the m(mol) density and its density parameter omega(mol).

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.3556	herschel reveals the obscured star formation in hizels h\alpha\ emitters  at z=1.47	we describe the far-infrared (fir; rest-frame 8--1000\mu m) properties of asample of 443 h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the cosmos and udsfields detected by the hizels imaging survey. sources are identified usingnarrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformlyselect h\alpha\ (and [oii] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice atz = 1.47+/-0.02. we use a stacking approach in spitzer, herschel (from pep andhermes surveys) and aztec images to describe their typical fir properties. wefind that hizels galaxies with observed h\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}lo have bolometric fir luminosities of typical lirgs, l_fir ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}lo. combining the h\alpha\ and fir luminosities, we derive median sfr = 32+/-5mo/yr and h\alpha\ extinctions of a(h\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. perhapssurprisingly, little difference is seen in typical hizels extinction levelscompared to local star-forming galaxies. we confirm previous empirical stellarmass (m*) to a(h\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =1.47. for hizels galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the sfras a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. we find that theobserved h\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant sfr tracer when (u-z)_rest ~&lt; 0.9mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry &gt; 22 mag (vega) or when m* &lt; 10^9.7 mo. we donot find any correlation between the [oii]/h\alpha\ and fir luminosity,suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of themost obscured star-forming regions. the luminosity-limited hizels sample tendsto lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,especially at low m*. this work suggests that obscured star formation is linkedto the assembly of m*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxiesproviding dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

1308.2199	cosmological model dependence of the galaxy luminosity function:  far-infrared results in the lemaitre-tolman-bondi model	this is the first paper of a series aiming at investigating galaxy formationand evolution in the giant-void class of the lemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) modelsthat best fits current cosmological observations. here we investigate theluminosity function (lf) methodology, and how its estimates would be affectedby a change on the cosmological model assumed in its computation. are thecurrent observational constraints on the allowed cosmology enough to yieldrobust lf results? we use the far-infrared source catalogues built on theobservations performed with the herschel/pacs instrument, and selected as partof the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey. schechter profiles are obtained inredshift bins up to z approximately 4, assuming comoving volumes in both thestandard model, that is, friedmann-lemaitre-robertson-walker metric with aperfect fluid energy-momentum tensor, and non-homogeneous ltb dust models,parametrized to fit the current combination of results stemming from theobservations of supernovae ia, the cosmic microwave background, and baryonicacoustic oscillations. we find that the luminosity functions computed assumingboth the standard model and ltb void models show in general good agreement.however, the faint-end slope in the void models shows a significant departurefrom the standard model up to redshift 0.4. we demonstrate that this result isnot artificially caused by the used lf estimator which turns out to be robustunder the differences in matter-energy density profiles of the models. thedifferences found in the lf slopes at the faint end are due to variation in theluminosities of the sources, which depend on the geometrical part of the model.it follows that either the standard model is over-estimating the number densityof faint sources or the void models are under-estimating it.

1309.4223	serendipitous detection of an overdensity of herschel-spire 250 micron  sources south of mrc1138-26	we report the serendipitous detection of a significant overdensity ofherschel-spire 250 micron sources in the vicinity of mrc1138-26. we use anadaptive kernel density estimate to quantify the significance, including acomparison with other fields. the overdensity has a size of ~3.5-4' and standsout at ~5sigma with respect to the background estimate. no features withsimilar significance were found in four extragalactic control fields:goods-north, lockman, cosmos and uds. the chance of having a similaroverdensity in a field with the same number but randomly distributed sources isless than 2%. the clump is also visible as a low surface brightness feature inthe planck 857 ghz map. we detect 76 sources at 250 micron (with asignal-to-noise ratio greater than 3), in a region of 4' radius; 43 of thoseare above a flux density limit of 20 mjy. this is a factor of 3.6 in excessover the average in the four control fields, considering only the sources above20 mjy. we also find an excess in the number counts of sources with 250 micronflux densities between 30 and 40 mjy, compared to deep extragalacticblank-field number counts. assuming a fixed dust temperature (30 k) andemissivity (beta=1.5) a crude, blackbody-derived redshift distribution, zbb, ofthe detected sources is significantly different from the distributions in thecontrol fields and exhibits a significant peak at zbb ~ 1.5, although theactual peak redshift is highly degenerate with the temperature. we tentativelysuggest, based on zbb and the similar s250/s350 colours of the sources withinthe peak, that a significant fraction of the sources in the clump may be at asimilar redshift. since the overdensity lies ~7' south of the z=2.16 spiderwebprotocluster mrc1138-26, an intriguing possibility (that is presentlyunverifiable given the data in hand) is that it lies within the samelarge-scale structure.(abridged)

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1401.1510	sub-millimeter galaxies as progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies	three billion years after the big bang (at redshift z=2), half of the mostmassive galaxies were already old, quiescent systems with little to no residualstar formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least anorder of magnitude larger than in low redshift ellipticals, their descendants.little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellarpopulations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 gyrearlier (at 3&lt;z&lt;6). simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give riseto such starbursts which produce dense remnants. sub-millimeter selectedgalaxies (smgs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich, starbursts. with anew, representative spectroscopic sample of compact quiescent galaxies at z=2and a statistically well-understood sample of smgs, we show that z=3-6 smgs areconsistent with being the progenitors of z=2 quiescent galaxies, matching theirformation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses andinternal velocities. assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densitiesalso match if the mean duty cycle of smg starbursts is 42 (+40/-29) myr(consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of starsin these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge ofstar-formation. these results suggests a coherent picture of the formationhistory of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burstof violent star-formation through their appearance as high stellar-densitygalaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1403.3615	herschel far-ir counterparts of sdss galaxies: analysis of commonly used  star formation rate estimates	we study a hundred of galaxies from the spectroscopic sloan digital skysurvey with individual detections in the far-infrared herschel pacs bands (100or 160 $\mu$m) and in the galex far-ultraviolet band up to z$\sim$0.4 in thecosmos and lockman hole fields. the galaxies are divided into 4 spectral and 4morphological types. for the star forming and unclassifiable galaxies wecalculate dust extinctions from the uv slope, the h$\alpha$/h$\beta$ ratio andthe $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm uv}$ ratio. there is a tight correlation between thedust extinction and both $l_{\rm ir}$ and metallicity. we calculatesfr$_{total}$ and compare it with other sfr estimates (h$\alpha$, uv, sdss)finding a very good agreement between them with smaller dispersions thantypical sfr uncertainties. we study the effect of mass and metallicity, findingthat it is only significant at high masses for sfr$_{h\alpha}$. for the agn andcomposite galaxies we find a tight correlation between sfr and l$_{ir}$($\sigma\sim$0.29), while the dispersion in the sfr - l$_{uv}$ relation islarger ($\sigma\sim$0.57). the galaxies follow the prescriptions of thefundamental plane in the m-z-sfr space.

1404.7014	the pep survey: infrared properties of radio-selected agn	by exploiting the vla-cosmos and the herschel-pep surveys, we investigate thefar infrared (fir) properties of radio-selected agn. to this purpose, fromvla-cosmos we considered the 1537, f[1.4 ghz]&gt;0.06 mjy sources with a reliableredshift estimate, and sub-divided them into star-forming galaxies and agnsolely on the basis of their radio luminosity. the agn sample is complete withrespect to radio selection at all z&lt;~3.5. 832 radio sources have a counterpartin the pep catalogue. 175 are agn. their redshift distribution closelyresembles that of the total radio-selected agn population, and exhibits twomarked peaks at z~0.9 and z~2.5. we find that the probability for aradio-selected agn to be detected at fir wavelengths is both a function ofradio power and redshift, whereby powerful sources are more likely to be firemitters at earlier epochs. this is due to two distinct effects: 1) at allradio luminosities, fir activity monotonically increases with look-back timeand 2) radio activity of agn origin is increasingly less effective atinhibiting fir emission. radio-selected agn with fir emission arepreferentially located in galaxies which are smaller than those hostingfir-inactive sources. furthermore, at all z&lt;~2, there seems to be apreferential (stellar) mass scale m ~[10^{10}-10^{11}] msun which maximizes thechances for fir emission. we find such fir (and mir) emission to be due toprocesses indistinguishable from those which power star-forming galaxies. itfollows that radio emission in at least 35% of the entire agn population is thesum of two contributions: agn accretion and star-forming processes within thehost galaxy.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

1406.1189	a multiwavelength consensus on the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies at z~2	we compare various star formation rate (sfr) indicators for star-forminggalaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5$ in the cosmos field. the main focus is on the sfrs fromthe far-ir (pacs-herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxiesselected according to the bzk criterion. fir-selected samples lead to a vastlydifferent slope of the sfr-stellar mass ($m_*$) relation, compared to that ofthe dominant main sequence population as measured from the uv, since the firselection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. however, there isoverall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two sfrindicators, when stacking on the pacs maps the bzk-selected galaxies. theresulting logarithmic slope of the sfr-{$m_*$} relation is $\sim0.8-0.9$, inagreement with that derived from the dust-corrected uv-luminosity. exploitingdeeper 24$\mu$m-spitzer data we have characterized a sub-sample of galaxieswith reddening and sfrs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the $b$band. the combination of herschel with spitzer data have allowed us to largelybreak the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, bydistinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in b-z because of being heavilydust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being)quenched. finally, we have compared our sfr(uv) to the sfrs derived by stackingthe radio data and to those derived from the h$\alpha$ luminosity of a sampleof star-forming galaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the two sets of sfrs are broadlyconsistent as they are with the sfrs derived from the uv and by stacking thecorresponding pacs data in various mass bins.

1407.1863	large scale clustering measurements with photometric redshifts:  comparing the dark matter halos of x-ray agn, star-forming and passive  galaxies at z~1	we combine multiwavelength data in the aegis-xd and c-cosmos surveys tomeasure the typical dark matter halo mass of x-ray selected agn[lx(2-10kev)&gt;1e42 erg/s] in comparison with far-infrared selected star-forminggalaxies detected in the herschel/pep survey (pacs evolutionary probe; lir&gt;1e11solar) and quiescent systems at z~1. we develop a novel method to measure theclustering of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions in addition to any spectroscopy. this isadvantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clusteringanalysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. the method works bestfor large samples. the loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy isbalanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering. wefind that x-ray agn, far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies and passivesystems in the redshift interval 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 are found in halos of similar mass,$\log m_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. we argue that this is becausethe galaxies in all three samples (agn, star-forming, passive) have similarstellar mass distributions, approximated by the j-band luminosity. thereforeall galaxies that can potentially host x-ray agn, because they have stellarmasses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes of $\logm_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formationrates. this suggests that the stellar mass of x-ray agn hosts is driving theobserved clustering properties of this population. we also speculate thattrends between agn properties (e.g. luminosity, level of obscuration) and largescale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of the hostgalaxies.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1409.1171	combined co &amp; dust scaling relations of depletion time and molecular gas  fractions with cosmic time, specific star formation rate and stellar mass	we combine molecular gas masses inferred from co emission in 500 star forminggalaxies (sfgs) between z=0 and 3, from the iram-coldgass, phibss1/2 and othersurveys, with gas masses derived from herschel far-ir dust measurements in 512galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. we constrain thescaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas tostellar mass ratio (mmolgas/m*) of sfgs near the star formation main-sequencewith redshift, specific star formation rate (ssfr) and stellar mass (m*). theco- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. this suggests thatthe co-h2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the mainsequence (ssfr(ms,z,m*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.this study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. we find thattdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(ssfr/ssfr(ms,z,m*))^-0.5, with little dependenceon m*. the resulting steep redshift dependence of mmolgas/m* ~(1+z)^3 mirrorsthat of the ssfr and probably reflects the gas supply rate. the decreasing gasfractions at high m* are driven by the flattening of the sfr-m* relation.throughout the redshift range probed a larger ssfr at constant m* is due to acombination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale. as a result galaxy integrated samples of the mmolgas-sfr rate relationexhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of ssfr. withthese new relations it is now possible to determine mmolgas with an accuracy of0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1409.5122	the host galaxies of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5:  structure, star-formation and their relationships from candels and  herschel/pacs	we study the relationship between the structure and star-formation rate (sfr)of x-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe two chandra deep fields, using hubble space telescope imaging from thecosmic assembly near infrared extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and deepfar-infrared maps from the pep+goods-herschel survey. we derive detaileddistributions of structural parameters and fir luminosities from carefullyconstructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of theagns. at z~1, agns show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive(non-agn) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxydisturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpystructure). in contrast, at z~2, agns show similar levels of galaxy disturbanceas inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which mayarise due to a more pronounced bulge in agn hosts or due to extinguishednuclear light. we undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but ourresults do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. the mean sfrand its distribution among agns and inactive galaxies are similar at z&gt;1.5. atz&lt;1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the sfrs of agnswith bulge-dominated light profiles. these trends suggest an evolution in therelation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards aminor role for mergers and interactions at z&gt;1.5.

1409.5795	the evolution of star formation activity in galaxy groups	we study the evolution of the total star formation (sf) activity, totalstellar mass and halo occupation distribution in massive halos by using one ofthe largest x-ray selected sample of galaxy groups with secure spectroscopicidentification in the major blank field surveys (ecdfs, cdfn, cosmos, aegis).we provide an accurate measurement of sfr for the bulk of the star-forminggalaxies using very deep mid-infrared spitzer mips and far-infrared herschelpacs observations. for undetected ir sources, we provide a well-calibrated sfrfrom sed fitting. we observe a clear evolution in the level of sf activity ingalaxy groups. the total sf activity in the high redshift groups (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1) ishigher with respect to the low redshift (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5) sample at any mass by0.8+/-0.12 dex. a milder difference (0.35+/-0.1 dex) is observed between thelow redshift bin and the groups at z~0. we show that the level of sf activityis declining more rapidly in the more massive halos than in the more commonlower mass halos. we do not observe any evolution in the halo occupationdistribution and total stellar mass- halo mass relations in groups. the pictureemerging from our findings suggests that the galaxy population in the mostmassive systems is evolving faster than galaxies in lower mass halos,consistently with a "halo downsizing" scenario.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

1501.07602	mapping the average agn accretion rate in the sfr-m* plane for herschel  selected galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation of agn accretion, star formation rate (sfr), andstellar mass (m$_*$) using a sample of $\approx$ 8600 star-forming galaxies upto z=2.5 selected with \textit{herschel} imaging in the goods and cosmosfields. for each of them we derive sfr and m$_*$, both corrected, whennecessary, for emission from an active galactic nucleus (agn), through thedecomposition of their spectral energy distributions (seds). about 10 per centof the sample are detected individually in \textit{chandra} observations of thefields. for the rest of the sample we stack the x-ray maps to get average x-rayproperties. after subtracting the x-ray luminosity expected from star formationand correcting for nuclear obscuration, we derive the average agn accretionrate for both detected sources and stacks, as a function of m$_{*}$, sfr andredshift. the average accretion rate correlates with sfr and with m$_*$. thedependence on sfr becomes progressively more significant at z$&gt;$0.8. this maysuggest that sfr is the original driver of these correlations. we find thataverage agn accretion and star formation increase in a similar fashion withoffset from the star-forming "main-sequence". our interpretation is thataccretion onto the central black hole and star formation broadly trace eachother, irrespective of whether the galaxy is evolving steadily on themain-sequence or bursting.

0805.0705	the contribution of agn and star-forming galaxies to the mid-infrared as  revealed by their spectral energy distributions	we present the broad-band spectral energy distributions (seds) of the largestavailable highly (72%) complete spectroscopic sample of mid-infrared (mir)selected galaxies and agn at intermediate redshift. the sample contains 203extragalactic sources from the 15-micron survey in the elais-swire field s1,all with measured spectroscopic redshift. most of these sources have fullmulti-wavelength coverage from the far-uv to the far-infrared and lie in theredshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3. due to its size, this sample allows us for the firsttime to characterise the spectral properties of the sources responsible for thestrong evolution observed in the mir. based on sed-fitting technique we haveclassified the mir sources, identifying agn signatures in about 50% of them.this fraction is significantly higher than that derived from opticalspectroscopy (~29%) and is due in particular to the identification of agnactivity in objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies. it is likely thatin most of our objects, the agn is either obscured or of low-luminosity, andthus it does not dominate the energetic output at any wavelength, except in themir, showing up just in the range where the host galaxy sed has a minimum. thefraction of agn strongly depends on the flux density, with that derived throughthe sed-fitting being about 20% at s(15)~0.5-1 mjy and gradually increasing upto 100% at s(15)&gt;10 mjy, while that obtained from optical spectroscopy neverbeing &gt;30%, even at the higher flux densities. the results of this work will bevery useful for updating all the models aimed at interpreting the deep infraredsurvey data and, in particular, for constraining the nature and the role ofdust-obscured systems in the intermediate/high-redshift universe.

1505.01153	the most obscured agn in the cosmos field	highly obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) are common in nearby galaxies,but are difficult to observe beyond the local universe, where they are expectedto significantly contribute to the black hole accretion rate density.furthermore, compton-thick (ct) absorbers (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) suppress even thehard x-ray (2-10 kev) agn nuclear emission, and therefore the column densitydistribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. we present theidentification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (nh&gt;~10^25cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (l(2-10kev)&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn at z=0.353 inthe cosmos field. several independent indicators, such as the shape of thex-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution andx-ray/[nev] and x-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that thenuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. the hostgalaxy properties show that this highly obscured agn is hosted in a massivestar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlatewith the presence of ct absorbers. finally, asymmetric and blueshiftedcomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate thepresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense agn activity(l(bol)/l(edd) = 0.3-0.5). such highly obscured, highly accreting agn areintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be muchmore common at the peak of the star formation and bh accretion history, atz~2-3. we demonstrate that a fully multi-wavelength approach can recover asizable sample of such peculiar sources in large and deep surveys such ascosmos.

1505.04977	a higher efficiency of converting gas to stars push galaxies at z ~ 1.6  well above the star-forming main sequence	local starbursts have a higher efficiency of converting gas into stars, ascompared to typical star-forming galaxies at a given stellar mass, possiblyindicative of different modes of star formation. with the peak epoch of galaxyformation occurring at z &gt; 1, it remains to be established whether such anefficient mode of star formation is occurring at high-redshift. to address thisissue, we measure the molecular gas content of seven high-redshift (z ~ 1.6)starburst galaxies with the atacama large (sub-)millimeter array andiram/plateau de bure interferometer. our targets are selected from the sampleof herschel far-infrared detected galaxies having star formation rates(~300-800 msolar/yr) elevated (&gt;4x) above the star-forming `main sequence', andincluded in the fmos-cosmos near-infrared spectroscopic survey of star-forminggalaxies at z ~ 1.6 with subaru. we detect co emission in all cases at highlevels of significance, indicative of high gas fractions (~30-50%). even morecompelling, we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection thatstarbursts, identified as main-sequence outliers, at high redshift generallyhave a lower ratio of co to total infrared luminosity as compared to typicalmain-sequence star-forming galaxies, although with a smaller offset thanexpected based on past studies of local starbursts. we put forward a hypothesisthat there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency withelevation from the main sequence with galaxy mergers as a possible physicaldriver. along with a heightened star formation efficiency, our high-redshiftsample is similar in other respects to local starbursts such as being metalrich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium.

1506.05475	the composite nature of dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) at z~2-3 in the  cosmos field: i. a far-infrared view	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are bright 24 um-selected sources with extremeobscuration at optical wavelengths. they are typically characterized by arising power-law continuum of hot dust (t_d ~ 200-1000k) in the near-irindicating that their mid-ir luminosity is dominated by an an active galacticnucleus (agn). dogs with a fainter 24 um flux display a stellar bump in thenear-ir and their mid-ir luminosity appears to be mainly powered by dusty starformation. alternatively, it may be that the mid-ir emission arising from agnactivity is dominant but the torus is sufficiently opaque to make the near-iremission from the agn negligible with respect to the emission from the hostcomponent. in an effort to characterize the astrophysical nature of theprocesses responsible for the ir emission in dogs, this paper exploits herscheldata (pacs + spire) on a sample of 95 dogs within the cosmos field. we derive awealth of far-ir properties (e.g., total ir luminosities; mid-to-far ir colors;dust temperatures and masses) based on sed fitting. of particular interest arethe 24 um-bright dogs (f_24um &gt; 1mjy). they present bluer far-ir/mid-ir colorsthan the rest of the sample, unveiling the potential presence of an agn. theagn contribution to the total 8-1000 um flux increases as a function of therest-frame 8 um-luminosity irrespective of the redshift. this confirms thatfaint dogs (l_8 um&lt; 10^12 l_sun) are dominated by star-formation while brighterdogs show a larger contribution from an agn.

1507.00005	dust attenuation in z $\sim$ 1 galaxies from herschel and 3d-hst  h$\alpha$ measurements	we combined the spectroscopic information from the 3d-hst survey with\textit{herschel} data to characterize the h$\alpha$ dust attenuationproperties of a sample of 79 main sequence star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$in the goods-s field. the sample was selected in the far-ir, at $\lambda$=100and/or 160 $\mu$m, and only includes galaxies with a secure h$\alpha$ detection(s/n$&gt;$3). from the low resolution 3d-hst spectra we measured the redshifts andthe h$\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to theobserved fluxes to remove the [nii] contamination). the stellar masses(m$_{\star}$), infrared (l$_{ir}$) and uv luminosities (l$_{uv}$) were derivedfrom the seds by fitting multi-band data from galex near-uv to spire 500$\mu$m. we estimated the continuum extinction e$_{star}$(b-v) from both theirx=l$_{ir}$/l$_{uv}$ ratio and the uv-slope, $\beta$, and found an excellentagreement between the two. the nebular extinction was estimated from comparisonof the observed sfr$_{h\alpha}$ and sfr$_{uv}$. we obtained\emph{f}=e$_{star}$(b-v)/e$_{neb}$(b-v)=0.93$\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than thecanonical value of \emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local universe. our deriveddust correction produces good agreement between the h$\alpha$ and ir+uv sfrsfor galaxies with sfr$\gtrsim$ 20 m$_{\odot}$/yr and m$_{\star} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, while objects with lower sfr and m$_{\star}$ seemto require a smaller \emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher h$\alpha$ extinctioncorrection). our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sampleis comparable to that in the optical-uv continuum and suggest that the\emph{f}-factor is a function of both m$_{\star}$ and sfr, in agreement withprevious studies.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

1508.07884	sinfoni spectra of heavily obscured agns in cosmos: evidence of outflows  in a mir/o target at z$\sim2.5$	we present new data for four candidate obscured compton-thick (ct) quasars atz $\sim$1-2.5 observed with sinfoni vlt spectrograph in ao mode. these sourceswere selected from a 24$\mu$m spitzer mips survey of the cosmos field, on thebasis of red mid-infrared-to-optical and optical-to-near-infrared colours, withthe intention of identifying active galactic nuclei (agns) in dust enshroudedenvironments, where most of the black hole mass is assembled in dust enshroudedenvironments. near infrared spectra were analyzed in order to check foremission line features and to search for broad components in the[oiii]-h$\beta$ and h$\alpha$-[nii] regions. x-ray spectral analysis, radio andmir diagnostics, and sed fitting have also been employed to study the nature ofthe sources. we successfully identified three objects for which we had only aphotometric redshift estimate. based on their emission line diagnostics and onancillary multi-wavelength constraints, we find that all four targets harborobscured agns. broad profiles that could be attributed to the effects ofoutflows are revealed in only one target, miro20581. in particular, we clearlyresolved a fast ($\sim$1600 km/s) and extended ($\sim$5 kpc) outflow in the[oiii]5007 emission line. this feature, the commonly used indicator for ionisedoutflowing gas, was sampled and detected only for this target; hence, we cannot exclude the presence of outflows in the other sources. overall, theconstraints we obtain from our targets and from other comparative samples fromthe literature suggest that these optically faint luminous infrared galaxies,hosting obscured agns, may represent a brief evolutionary phase between thepost-merger starburst and the unobscured qso phases.

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

astro-ph;0412706	nir spectroscopy of luminous infrared galaxies and the hydrogen  recombination photon deficit	we report on near-infrared medium-resolution spectroscopy of a sample ofluminous and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs-ulirgs), carried out withsofi at the eso 3.5m new technology telescope. because of wavelength dependenceof the attenuation, the detection of the pa_alfa or br_gamma line in the ksband should provide relevant constraints on sfr and the contribution of an agn.we find, however, that the intensities of the pa_alfa and br_gamma lines, evencorrected for slit losses, are on average only 10% and 40%, respectively, ofthat expected from a normal starburst of similar bolometric luminosity. thecorresponding star formation rates, after correcting for the attenuationderived from the nir-optical emission line ratios, are 14% and 60% of thatexpected if the far infrared luminosity were entirely powered by the starburst.this confirms the existence of a recombination photon deficit, particularly inthe case of the pa_alfa line, already found in the br_gamma line in otherinfrared galaxies of similar luminosity. in discussing the possible causes ofthe discrepancy, we find unlikely that it is due to the presence of an agn,though two objects show evidence of broadening of the pa_alfa line and of thepresence of coronal line emission. in fact, from our own observations and datacollected from the literature we argue that the studied galaxies appear to bepredominantly powered by a nuclear starburst. two scenarios compatible with thepresent data are that either there exists a highly attenuated nuclear starforming region, and/or that a significant fraction of the ionizing photons areabsorbed by dust within the hii regions. we suggest that observations in thebr_alpha spectral region could constitute a powerful tool to disentangle thesetwo possibilities.

astro-ph;0703214	keck spectroscopy of z=1-3 ulirgs from the spitzer swire survey	(abridged) high-redshift ultra luminous infrared galaxies contribute the bulkof the cosmic ir background and are the best candidates for very massivegalaxies in formation at z&gt;1.5. we present keck/lris optical spectroscopy of 35z&gt;1.4 luminous ir galaxies in the spitzer wide-area infra-red extragalacticsurvey (swire) northern fields (lockman hole, elais-n1, elais-n2). the primarytargets belong to the ``ir-peak'' class of galaxies, having the 1.6 micron(restframe) stellar feature detected in the irac spitzer channels.the spectralenergy distributions of the main targets are thoroughly analyzed, by means ofspectro-photometric synthesis and multi-component fits (stars + starburst dust+ agn torus). the ir-peak selection technique is confirmed to successfullyselect objects above z=1.4, though some of the observed sources lie at lowerredshift than expected. among the 16 galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, 62%host an agn component, two thirds being type-1 and one third type-2 objects.the selection, limited to r'&lt;24.5, is likely biased to optically-bright agns.the seds of non-agn ir-peakers resemble those of starbursts (sfr=20-500msun/yr) hosted in massive (m&gt;1e11 msun) galaxies. the presence of an agncomponent provides a plausible explanation for the spectroscopic/photometricredshift discrepancies, as the torus produces an apparent shift of the peak tolonger wavelengths. these sources are analyzed in irac and optical-ir colorspaces. in addition to the ir-peak galaxies, we present redshifts and spectralproperties for 150 objects, out of a total of 301 sources on slits.

0810.1293	mambo 1.2mm observations of luminous starbursts at z~2 in the swire  fields	we report on--off pointed mambo observations at 1.2 mm of 61 spitzer-selectedstar-forming galaxies from the swire survey. the sources are selected on thebasis of bright 24um fluxes (f_24um&gt;0.4mjy) and of stellar dominatednear-infrared spectral energy distributions in order to favor z~2 starburstgalaxies. the average 1.2mm flux for the whole sample is 1.5+/-0.2 mjy. ouranalysis focuses on 29 sources in the lockman hole field where the average1.2mm flux (1.9+/-0.3 mjy) is higher than in other fields (1.1+/-0.2 mjy). theanalysis of the sources multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionsindicates that they are starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities~10^12-10^13.3 lsun, and stellar masses of ~0.2-6 x10^11 m_sun. compared tosub-millimeter selected galaxies (smgs), the swire-mambo sources are amongthose with the largest 24um/millimeter flux ratios. the origin of such largeratios is investigated by comparing the average mid-infrared spectra and thestacked far-infrared spectral energy distributions of the swire-mambo sourcesand of smgs. the mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong pah features, and a warmdust continuum. the warm dust continuum contributes to ~34% of the mid-infraredemission, and is likely associated with an agn component. this constribution isconsistent with what is found in smgs. the large 24um/1.2mm flux ratios arethus not due to agn emission, but rather to enhanced pah emission compared tosmgs. the analysis of the stacked far-infrared fluxes yields warmer dusttemperatures than typically observed in smgs. our selection favors warmultra-luminous infrared sources at high-z, a class of objects that is rarelyfound in smg samples. our sample is the largest spitzer-selected sampledetected at millimeter wavelengths currently available.

0810.2518	obscured and powerful agn and starburst activities at z~3.5	we report the discovery of two sources at z=3.867 and z=3.427 that exhibitpowerful starburst and agn activities. they benefit from data from radio to xrays from the cfhtls-d1/swire/xmds surveys. follow-up optical and near-infraredspectroscopy, and millimeter iram/mambo observations are also available. weperformed an analysis of their spectral energy distributions to understand theorigin of their emission and constrain their luminosities. a comparison withother composite systems at similar redshifts from the literature is alsopresented. the agn and starburst bolometric luminosities are ~10^13 lsun. theagn emission dominates at x ray, optical, mid-infrared wavelengths, andprobably in the radio. the starburst emission dominates in the far-infrared.the estimated star formation rates range from 500 to 3000msun/yr. the agnnear-infrared and x ray emissions are heavily obscured in both sources with anestimated dust extinction av&gt;4, and compton-thick gas column densities. the twosources are the most obscured and most luminous agns detected at millimeterwavelengths currently known. the sources presented in this work are heavilyobscured qsos, but their properties are not fully explained by the standard agnunification model. in one source, the ultraviolet and optical spectra suggestthe presence of outflowing gas and shocks, and both sources show emission fromhot dust, most likely in the vicinity of the nucleus. evidence of moderateagn-driven radio activity is found in both sources. the two sources lie on thelocal m_bh-m_bulge relation. to remain on this relation, their star formationrate has to decrease. our results support evolutionary models that invoke radiofeedback as star formation quenching mechanism, and suggest that such amechanism might play a major role also in powerful agns.
