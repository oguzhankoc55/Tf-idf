0812.4889	statistical physics of signal estimation in gaussian noise: theory and  examples of phase transitions	we consider the problem of signal estimation (denoising) from a statisticalmechanical perspective, using a relationship between the minimum mean squareerror (mmse), of estimating a signal, and the mutual information between thissignal and its noisy version. the paper consists of essentially two parts. inthe first, we derive several statistical-mechanical relationships between a fewimportant quantities in this problem area, such as the mmse, the differentialentropy, the fisher information, the free energy, and a generalized notion oftemperature. we also draw analogies and differences between certain relationspertaining to the estimation problem and the parallel relations inthermodynamics and statistical physics. in the second part of the paper, weprovide several application examples, where we demonstrate how certain analysistools that are customary in statistical physics, prove useful in the analysisof the mmse. in most of these examples, the correspondingstatistical-mechanical systems turn out to consist of strong interactions thatcause phase transitions, which in turn are reflected as irregularities anddiscontinuities (similar to threshold effects) in the behavior of the mmse.

0902.3178	multiple multicasts with the help of a relay	the problem of simultaneous multicasting of multiple messages with the helpof a relay terminal is considered. in particular, a model is studied in which arelay station simultaneously assists two transmitters in multicasting theirindependent messages to two receivers. the relay may also have an independentmessage of its own to multicast. as a first step to address this general model,referred to as the compound multiple access channel with a relay (cmacr), thecapacity region of the multiple access channel with a "cognitive" relay ischaracterized, including the cases of partial and rate-limited cognition. then,achievable rate regions for the cmacr model are presented based ondecode-and-forward (df) and compress-and-forward (cf) relaying strategies.moreover, an outer bound is derived for the special case, called the cmacrwithout cross-reception, in which each transmitter has a direct link to one ofthe receivers while the connection to the other receiver is enabled onlythrough the relay terminal. the capacity region is characterized for a binarymodulo additive cmacr without cross-reception, showing the optimality of binarylinear block codes, thus highlighting the benefits of physical layer networkcoding and structured codes. results are extended to the gaussian channel modelas well, providing achievable rate regions for df and cf, as well as for astructured code design based on lattice codes. it is shown that the performancewith lattice codes approaches the upper bound for increasing power, surpassingthe rates achieved by the considered random coding-based techniques.

0906.3192	secured communication over frequency-selective fading channels: a  practical vandermonde precoding	in this paper, we study the frequency-selective broadcast channel withconfidential messages (bcc) in which the transmitter sends a confidentialmessage to receiver 1 and a common message to receivers 1 and 2. in the case ofa block transmission of n symbols followed by a guard interval of l symbols,the frequency-selective channel can be modeled as a n * (n+l) toeplitz matrix.for this special type of multiple-input multiple-output (mimo) channels, wepropose a practical vandermonde precoding that consists of projecting theconfidential messages in the null space of the channel seen by receiver 2 whilesuperposing the common message. for this scheme, we provide the achievable rateregion, i.e. the rate-tuple of the common and confidential messages, andcharacterize the optimal covariance inputs for some special cases of interest.it is proved that the proposed scheme achieves the optimal degree of freedom(d.o.f) region. more specifically, it enables to send l &lt;= l confidentialmessages and n-l common messages simultaneously over a block of n+l symbols.interestingly, the proposed scheme can be applied to secured multiuserscenarios such as the k+1-user frequency-selective bcc with k confidentialmessages and the two-user frequency-selective bcc with two confidentialmessages. for each scenario, we provide the achievable secrecy degree offreedom (s.d.o.f.) region of the corresponding frequency-selective bcc andprove the optimality of the vandermonde precoding. one of the appealingfeatures of the proposed scheme is that it does not require any specificsecrecy encoding technique but can be applied on top of any existing powerfulencoding schemes.

0707.1008	on cognitive interference networks	we study the high-power asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate capacity ofmulti-user interference networks with an equal number of transmitters andreceivers. we assume that each transmitter is cognizant of the message itwishes to convey to its corresponding receiver and also of the messages that asubset of the other transmitters wish to send. the receivers are assumed not tobe able to cooperate in any way so that they must base their decision on thesignal they receive only. we focus on the network's pre-log, which is definedas the limiting ratio of the sum-rate capacity to half the logarithm of thetransmitted power. we present both upper and lower bounds on the network'spre-log. the lower bounds are based on a linear partial-cancellation schemewhich entails linearly transforming gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate theinterference in a subset of the receivers. inter alias, the bounds give acomplete characterization of the networks and side-information settings thatresult in a full pre-log, i.e., in a pre-log that is equal to the number oftransmitters (and receivers) as well as a complete characterization of networkswhose pre-log is equal to the full pre-log minus one. they also fullycharacterize networks where the full pre-log can only be achieved if eachtransmitter knows the messages of all users, i.e., when the side-information is"full".

1004.2648	optimality and approximate optimality of source-channel separation in  networks	we consider the source-channel separation architecture for lossy sourcecoding in communication networks. it is shown that the separation approach isoptimal in two general scenarios, and is approximately optimal in a thirdscenario. the two scenarios for which separation is optimal complement eachother: the first is when the memoryless sources at source nodes are arbitrarilycorrelated, each of which is to be reconstructed at possibly multipledestinations within certain distortions, but the channels in this network aresynchronized, orthogonal and memoryless point-to-point channels; the second iswhen the memoryless sources are mutually independent, each of which is to bereconstructed only at one destination within a certain distortion, but thechannels are general, including multi-user channels such as multiple access,broadcast, interference and relay channels, possibly with feedback. the thirdscenario, for which we demonstrate approximate optimality of source-channelseparation, generalizes the second scenario by allowing each source to bereconstructed at multiple destinations with different distortions. for thiscase, the loss from optimality by using the separation approach can beupper-bounded when a "difference" distortion measure is taken, and in thespecial case of quadratic distortion measure, this leads to universal constantbounds.

1004.3332	estimation in gaussian noise: properties of the minimum mean-square  error	consider the minimum mean-square error (mmse) of estimating an arbitraryrandom variable from its observation contaminated by gaussian noise. the mmsecan be regarded as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) as well as afunctional of the input distribution (of the random variable to be estimated).it is shown that the mmse is concave in the input distribution at any givensnr. for a given input distribution, the mmse is found to be infinitelydifferentiable at all positive snr, and in fact a real analytic function in snrunder mild conditions. the key to these regularity results is that theposterior distribution conditioned on the observation through gaussian channelsalways decays at least as quickly as some gaussian density. furthermore, simpleexpressions for the first three derivatives of the mmse with respect to the snrare obtained. it is also shown that, as functions of the snr, the curves forthe mmse of a gaussian input and that of a non-gaussian input cross at mostonce over all snrs. these properties lead to simple proofs of the facts thatgaussian inputs achieve both the secrecy capacity of scalar gaussian wiretapchannels and the capacity of scalar gaussian broadcast channels, as well as asimple proof of the entropy power inequality in the special case where one ofthe variables is gaussian.

1007.4540	broadcast approach and oblivious cooperative strategies for the wireless  relay channel - part i: sequential decode-and-forward (sdf)	in this two part paper we consider a wireless network in which a sourceterminal communicates with a destination and a relay terminal is occasionallypresent in close proximity to the source without source's knowledge, suggestingoblivious protocols. the source-relay channel is assumed to be a fixed gainawgn due to the proximity while the source-destination and therelay-destination channels are subject to a block flat rayleigh fading. aperfect csi at the respective receivers only is assumed. with the averagethroughput as a performance measure, we incorporate a two-layer broadcastapproach into two cooperative strategies based on the decode-and-forward scheme- sequential decoded-and forward (sdf) in part i and the block-markov (bm) inpart ii. the broadcast approach splits the transmitted rate into superimposedlayers corresponding to a "bad" and a "good" channel states, allowing betteradaptation to the actual channel conditions in part i, the achievable rateexpressions for the sdf strategy are derived under the broadcast approach formultiple settings including single user, miso and the general relay settingusing successive decoding technique, both numerically and analytically.continuous broadcasting lower bounds are derived for the miso and an obliviouscooperation scenarios.

1008.1766	soft-decoding-based strategies for relay and interference channels:  analysis and achievable rates using ldpc codes	we provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of two communication strategies:soft decode-and-forward (soft-df) for relay channels, and soft partialinterference-cancelation (soft-ic) for interference channels. both strategiesinvolve soft estimation, which assists the decoding process. we consider ldpccodes, not because of their practical benefits, but because of their analytictractability, which enables an asymptotic analysis similar to random codingmethods of information theory. unlike some works on the closely-relateddemodulate-and-forward, we assume non-memoryless, code-structure-awareestimation. with soft-df, we develop {\it simultaneous density evolution} tobound the decoding error probability at the destination. this result applies toerasure relay channels. in one variant of soft-df, the relay applies wyner-zivcoding to enhance its communication with the destination, borrowing fromcompress-and-forward. to analyze soft-ic, we adapt existing techniques foriterative multiuser detection, and focus on binary-input additive whitegaussian noise (biawgn) interference channels. we prove that optimalpoint-to-point codes are unsuitable for soft-ic, as well as for all strategiesthat apply partial decoding to improve upon single-user detection (sud) andmultiuser detection (mud), including han-kobayashi (hk).

1104.1057	bounds on the capacity of the relay channel with noncausal state at  source	we consider a three-terminal state-dependent relay channel with the channelstate available non-causally at only the source. such a model may be ofinterest for node cooperation in the framework of cognition, i.e.,collaborative signal transmission involving cognitive and non-cognitive radios.we study the capacity of this communication model. one principal problem iscaused by the relay's not knowing the channel state. for the discretememoryless (dm) model, we establish two lower bounds and an upper bound onchannel capacity. the first lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme in whichthe source describes the state of the channel to the relay and destination,which then exploit the gained description for a better communication of thesource's information message. the coding scheme for the second lower boundremedies the relay's not knowing the states of the channel by first computing,at the source, the appropriate input that the relay would send had the relayknown the states of the channel, and then transmitting this appropriate inputto the relay. the relay simply guesses the sent input and sends it in the nextblock. the upper bound is non trivial and it accounts for not knowing the stateat the relay and destination. for the general gaussian model, we derive lowerbounds on the channel capacity by exploiting ideas in the spirit of those weuse for the dm model; and we show that these bounds are optimal for small andlarge noise at the relay irrespective to the strength of the interference.furthermore, we also consider a special case model in which the source inputhas two components one of which is independent of the state. we establish abetter upper bound for both dm and gaussian cases and we also characterize thecapacity in a number of special cases.

1105.4555	secure lossy source-channel wiretapping with side information at the  receiving terminals	the problem of secure lossy source-channel wiretapping with arbitrarilycorrelated side informations at both receivers is investigated. this scenarioconsists of an encoder (referred to as alice) that wishes to compress a sourceand send it through a noisy channel to a legitimate receiver (referred to asbob). in this context, alice must simultaneously satisfy the desiredrequirements on the distortion level at bob, and the equivocation rate at theeavesdropper (referred to as eve). this setting can be seen as a generalizationof the conventional problems of secure source coding with side information atthe decoders, and the wiretap channel. inner and outer bounds on therate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary channels and sideinformations are derived. in some special cases of interest, it is shown thatseparation holds. by means of an appropriate coding, the presence of anystatistical difference among the side informations, the channel noises, and thedistortion at bob can be fully exploited in terms of secrecy.

1105.5975	multiple access channel with states known noncausally at one encoder and  only strictly causally at the other encoder	we consider a two-user state-dependent multiaccess channel in which thestates of the channel are known non-causally to one of the encoders and onlystrictly causally to the other encoder. both encoders transmit a common messageand, in addition, the encoder that knows the states non-causally transmits anindividual message. we study the capacity region of this communication model.in the discrete memoryless case, we establish inner and outer bounds on thecapacity region. although the encoder that sends both messages knows the statesfully, we show that the strictly causal knowledge of these states at the otherencoder can be beneficial for this encoder, and in general enlarges thecapacity region. furthermore, we find an explicit characterization of thecapacity in the case in which the two encoders transmit only the commonmessage. in the gaussian case, we characterize the capacity region for themodel with individual message as well. our converse proof in this case showsthat, for this model, strictly causal knowledge of the state at one of theencoders does not increase capacity if the other is informed non-causally, aresult which sheds more light on the utility of conveying a compressed versionof the state to the decoder in recent results by lapidoth and steinberg on amultiacess model with only strictly causal state at both encoders andindependent messages.

0710.0116	distributed mimo receiver - achievable rates and upper bounds	in this paper we investigate the achievable rate of a system that includes anomadic transmitter with several antennas, which is received by multipleagents, exhibiting independent channel gains and additive circular-symmetriccomplex gaussian noise. in the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do nothave any decoding ability. these agents process their channel observations andforward them to the final destination through lossless links with a fixedcapacity. we propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression andalso on a wyner-ziv (ceo-like) processing, for both fast fading and blockfading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. the simpler twoagents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.limiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex gaussiansignalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, basedon the vector version of the entropy power inequality. these bounds are thencompared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. the asymptoticsetting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity isanalyzed. in addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight inseveral examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in afinite $2\times2$ setting. the advantage of the wyner-ziv approach overelementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the fulldiversity-multiplexing tradeoff. we also consider the non-nomadic setting, withagents that can decode. here we give an achievable rate, over fast fadingchannel, which combines broadcast with dirty paper coding and the decentralizedreception, which was introduced for the nomadic setting.

0710.2018	cognitive interference channels with confidential messages	the cognitive interference channel with confidential messages is studied.similarly to the classical two-user interference channel, the cognitiveinterference channel consists of two transmitters whose signals interfere atthe two receivers. it is assumed that there is a common message source (message1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent message source(message 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). thecognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode both messages, while thenon-cognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only the common message.furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs tobe kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as aneavesdropper with regard to message 2. the level of secrecy is measured by theequivocation rate. a single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocationregion of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is establishedand is further explicitly derived for the gaussian case. moreover,particularizing the capacity-equivocation region to the case without a secrecyconstraint, establishes a new capacity theorem for a class of interferencechannels, by providing a converse theorem.

1201.2315	secure transmission of sources over noisy channels with side information  at the receivers	this paper investigates the problem of source-channel coding for securetransmission with arbitrarily correlated side informations at both receivers.this scenario consists of an encoder (referred to as alice) that wishes tocompress a source and send it through a noisy channel to a legitimate receiver(referred to as bob). in this context, alice must simultaneously satisfy thedesired requirements on the distortion level at bob, and the equivocation rateat the eavesdropper (referred to as eve). this setting can be seen as ageneralization of the problems of secure source coding with (uncoded) sideinformation at the decoders, and the wiretap channel. a general outer bound onthe rate-distortion-equivocation region, as well as an inner bound based on apure digital scheme, is derived for arbitrary channels and side informations.in some special cases of interest, it is proved that this digital scheme isoptimal and that separation holds. however, it is also shown through a simplecounterexample with a binary source that a pure analog scheme can outperformthe digital one while being optimal. according to these observations andassuming matched bandwidth, a novel hybrid digital/analog scheme that aims togather the advantages of both digital and analog ones is then presented. in thequadratic gaussian setup when side information is only present at theeavesdropper, this strategy is proved to be optimal. furthermore, itoutperforms both digital and analog schemes, and cannot be achieved viatime-sharing. by means of an appropriate coding, the presence of anystatistical difference among the side informations, the channel noises, and thedistortion at bob can be fully exploited in terms of secrecy.

1201.3278	capacity region of multiple access channel with states known noncausally  at one encoder and only strictly causally at the other encoder	we consider a two-user state-dependent multiaccess channel in which thestates of the channel are known non-causally to one of the encoders and onlystrictly causally to the other encoder. both encoders transmit a common messageand, in addition, the encoder that knows the states non-causally transmits anindividual message. we find explicit characterizations of the capacity regionof this communication model in both discrete memoryless (dm) and memorylessgaussian cases. in particular the capacity region analysis demonstrates theutility of the knowledge of the states only strictly causally at the encoderthat sends only the common message in general. more specifically, in the dmsetting we show that such a knowledge is beneficial and increases the capacityregion in general. in the gaussian setting, we show that such a knowledge doesnot help, and the capacity is same as if the states were completely unknown atthe encoder that sends only the common message. the analysis also revealsoptimal ways of exploiting the knowledge of the state only strictly causally atthe encoder that sends only the common message when such a knowledge isbeneficial. the encoders collaborate to convey to the decoder a lossy versionof the state, in addition to transmitting the information messages through ageneralized gel'fand-pinsker binning. particularly important in this problemare the questions of 1) optimal ways of performing the state compression and 2)whether or not the compression indices should be decoded uniquely. we show thatboth compression \`a-la noisy network coding, i.e., with no binning andnon-unique decoding, and compression using wyner-ziv binning with backwarddecoding and non-unique or unique decoding are optimal.

1203.3659	cognitive wyner networks with clustered decoding	we study an interference network where equally-numbered transmitters andreceivers lie on two parallel lines, each transmitter opposite its intendedreceiver. we consider two short-range interference models: the "asymmetricnetwork," where the signal sent by each transmitter is interfered only by thesignal sent by its left neighbor (if present), and a "symmetric network," whereit is interfered by both its left and its right neighbors. each transmitter iscognizant of its own message, the messages of the $t_\ell$ transmitters to itsleft, and the messages of the $t_r$ transmitters to its right. each receiverdecodes its message based on the signals received at its own antenna, at the$r_\ell$ receive antennas to its left, and the $r_r$ receive antennas to itsright. for such networks we provide upper and lower bounds on the multiplexinggain, i.e., on the high-snr asymptotic logarithmic growth of the sum-ratecapacity. in some cases our bounds meet, e.g., for the asymmetric network. ourresults exhibit an equivalence between the transmitter side-informationparameters $t_\ell, t_r$ and the receiver side-information parameters $r_\ell,r_r$ in the sense that increasing/decreasing $t_\ell$ or $t_r$ by a positiveinteger $\delta$ has the same effect on the multiplexing gain asincreasing/decreasing $r_\ell$ or $r_r$ by $\delta$. moreover---even inasymmetric networks---there is an equivalence between the left side-informationparameters $t_\ell, r_\ell$ and the right side-information parameters $t_r,r_r$.

1206.3602	robust and efficient distributed compression for cloud radio access  networks	this work studies distributed compression for the uplink of a cloud radioaccess network where multiple multi-antenna base stations (bss) are connectedto a central unit, also referred to as cloud decoder, via capacity-constrainedbackhaul links. since the signals received at different bss are correlated,distributed source coding strategies are potentially beneficial, and can beimplemented via sequential source coding with side information. for the problemof compression with side information, available compression strategies based onthe criteria of maximizing the achievable rate or minimizing the mean squareerror are reviewed first. it is observed that, in either case, each bs requiresinformation about a specific covariance matrix in order to realize theadvantage of distributed source coding. since this covariance matrix depends onthe channel realizations corresponding to other bss, a robust compressionmethod is proposed for a practical scenario in which the information about thecovariance available at each bs is imperfect. the problem is formulated using adeterministic worst-case approach, and an algorithm is proposed that achieves astationary point for the problem. then, bs selection is addressed with the aimof reducing the number of active bss, thus enhancing the energy efficiency ofthe network. an optimization problem is formulated in which compression and bsselection are performed jointly by introducing a sparsity-inducing term intothe objective function. an iterative algorithm is proposed that is shown toconverge to a locally optimal point. from numerical results, it is observedthat the proposed robust compression scheme compensates for a large fraction ofthe performance loss induced by the imperfect statistical information.moreover, the proposed bs selection algorithm is seen to perform close to themore complex exhaustive search solution.

1208.5071	on the synergistic benefits of alternating csit for the miso bc	the degrees of freedom (dof) of the two-user multiple-input single-output(miso) broadcast channel (bc) are studied under the assumption that the form,i_i, i=1,2, of the channel state information at the transmitter (csit) for eachuser's channel can be either perfect (p), delayed (d) or not available (n),i.e., i_1 and i_2 can take values of either p, d or n, and therefore theoverall csit can alternate between the 9 resulting states, each state denotedas i_1i_2. the fraction of time associated with csit state i_1i_2 is denoted bythe parameter \lambda_{i_1i_2} and it is assumed throughout that\lambda_{i_1i_2}=\lambda_{i_2i_1}, i.e., \lambda_{pn}=\lambda_{np},\lambda_{pd}=\lambda_{dp}, \lambda_{dn}=\lambda_{nd}. under this assumption ofsymmetry, the main contribution of this paper is a complete characterization ofthe dof region of the two user miso bc with alternating csit. surprisingly, thedof region is found to depend only on the marginal probabilities (\lambda_p,\lambda_d,\lambda_n)=(\sum_{i_2}\lambda_{pi_2},\sum_{i_2}\lambda_{di_2},\sum_{i_2}\lambda_{ni_2}), i_2\in {p,d,n}, which represent the fraction of timethat any given user (e.g., user 1) is associated with perfect, delayed, or nocsit, respectively. as a consequence, the dof region with all 9 csit states,\mathcal{d}(\lambda_{i_1i_2}:i_1,i_2\in{p,d,n}), is the same as the dof regionwith only 3 csit states \mathcal{d}(\lambda_{pp}, \lambda_{dd}, \lambda_{nn}),under the same marginal distribution of csit states, i.e., (\lambda_{pp},\lambda_{dd},\lambda_{nn})=(\lambda_p,\lambda_d,\lambda_n). the resultshighlight the synergistic benefits of alternating csit and the tradeoffsbetween various forms of csit for any given dof value.

1211.4254	minimum csit to achieve maximum degrees of freedom for the miso bc	channel state information at the transmitter (csit) is a key ingredient inrealizing the multiplexing gain provided by distributed mimo systems. for adownlink multiple-input single output (miso) broadcast channel, with m antennasat the transmitters and k single antenna receivers, the maximum multiplexinggain or the maximum degrees of freedom (dof) is min(m,k). the optimal dof ofmin(m,k) is achievable if the transmitter has access to perfect, instantaneouscsit from all receivers. in this paper, we pose the question that what isminimum amount of csit required per user in order to achieve the maximum dof ofmin(m,k). by minimum amount of csit per user, we refer to the minimum fractionof time that the transmitter has access to perfect and instantaneous csit froma user. through a novel converse proof and an achievable scheme, it is shownthat the minimum fraction of time, perfect csit is required per user in orderto achieve the dof of min(m,k) is given by min(m,k)/k.

1212.4626	mac with action-dependent state information at one encoder	problems dealing with the ability to take an action that affects the statesof state-dependent communication channels are of timely interest andimportance. therefore, we extend the study of action-dependent channels, whichuntil now focused on point-to-point models, to multiple-access channels (mac).in this paper, we consider a two-user, state-dependent mac, in which one of theencoders, called the informed encoder, is allowed to take an action thataffects the formation of the channel states. two independent messages are to besent through the channel: a common message known to both encoders and a privatemessage known only to the informed encoder. in addition, the informed encoderhas access to the sequence of channel states in a non-causal manner. ourframework generalizes previously evaluated settings of state dependentpoint-to-point channels with actions and macs with common messages. we derive asingle letter characterization of the capacity region for this setting. usingthis general result, we obtain and compute the capacity region for the gaussianaction-dependent mac. the unique methods used in solving the gaussian case arethen applied to obtain the capacity of the gaussian action-dependentpoint-to-point channel; a problem was left open until this work. finally, weestablish some dualities between action-dependent channel coding and sourcecoding problems. specifically, we obtain a duality between the considered macsetting and the rate distortion model known as "successive refinement withactions". this is done by developing a set of simple duality principles thatenable us to successfully evaluate the outcome of one problem given the other.

1301.6938	robust uplink communications over fading channels with variable backhaul  connectivity	two mobile users communicate with a central decoder via two base stations.communication between the mobile users and the base stations takes place over agaussian interference channel with constant channel gains or quasi-staticfading. instead, the base stations are connected to the central decoder throughorthogonal finite-capacity links, whose connectivity is subject to randomfluctuations. there is only receive-side channel state information, and hencethe mobile users are unaware of the channel state and of the backhaulconnectivity state, while the base stations know the fading coefficients butare uncertain about the backhaul links' state. the base stations are obliviousto the mobile users' codebooks and employ compress-and-forward to relayinformation to the central decoder. upper and lower bounds are derived onaverage achievable throughput with respect to the prior distribution of thefading coefficients and of the backhaul links' states. the lower bounds areobtained by proposing strategies that combine the broadcast coding approach andlayered distributed compression techniques. the upper bound is obtained byassuming that all the nodes know the channel state. numerical results confirmthe advantages of the proposed approach with respect to conventional non-robuststrategies in both scenarios with and without fading.

1302.2167	information, estimation, and lookahead in the gaussian channel	we consider mean squared estimation with lookahead of a continuous-timesignal corrupted by additive white gaussian noise. we show that the mutualinformation rate function, i.e., the mutual information rate as function of thesignal-to-noise ratio (snr), does not, in general, determine the minimum meansquared error (mmse) with fixed finite lookahead, in contrast to the specialcases with 0 and infinite lookahead (filtering and smoothing errors),respectively, which were previously established in the literature. we alsoestablish a new expectation identity under a generalized observation modelwhere the gaussian channel has an snr jump at $t=0$, capturing the tradeoffbetween lookahead and snr.  further, we study the class of continuous-time stationary gauss-markovprocesses (ornstein-uhlenbeck processes) as channel inputs, and explicitlycharacterize the behavior of the minimum mean squared error (mmse) with finitelookahead and signal-to-noise ratio (snr). the mmse with lookahead is shown toconverge exponentially rapidly to the non-causal error, with the exponent beingthe reciprocal of the non-causal error. we extend our results to mixtures ofornstein-uhlenbeck processes, and use the insight gained to present lower andupper bounds on the mmse with lookahead for a class of stationary gaussianinput processes, whose spectrum can be expressed as a mixture ofornstein-uhlenbeck spectra.

1304.3179	joint precoding and multivariate backhaul compression for the downlink  of cloud radio access networks	this work studies the joint design of precoding and backhaul compressionstrategies for the downlink of cloud radio access networks. in these systems, acentral encoder is connected to multiple multi-antenna base stations (bss) viafinite-capacity backhaul links. at the central encoder, precoding is followedby compression in order to produce the rate-limited bit streams delivered toeach bs over the corresponding backhaul link. in current state-of-the-artapproaches, the signals intended for different bss are compressedindependently. in contrast, this work proposes to leverage joint compression,also referred to as multivariate compression, of the signals of different bssin order to better control the effect of the additive quantization noises atthe mobile stations (mss). the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate withrespect to both the precoding matrix and the joint correlation matrix of thequantization noises is formulated subject to power and backhaul capacityconstraints. an iterative algorithm is proposed that achieves a stationarypoint of the problem. moreover, in order to enable the practical implementationof multivariate compression across bss, a novel architecture is proposed basedon successive steps of minimum mean-squared error (mmse) estimation and per-bscompression. robust design with respect to imperfect channel state informationis also discussed. from numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposedjoint precoding and compression strategy outperforms conventional approachesbased on the separate design of precoding and compression or independentcompression across the bss.

1312.7135	multihop backhaul compression for the uplink of cloud radio access  networks	in cloud radio access networks (c-rans), the baseband processing of the radiounits (rus) is migrated to remote control units (cus). this is made possible bya network of backhaul links that connects rus and cus and that carriescompressed baseband signals. while prior work has focused mostly on single-hopbackhaul networks, this paper investigates efficient backhaul compressionstrategies for the uplink of c-rans with a general multihop backhaul topology.a baseline multiplex-and-forward (mf) scheme is first studied in which each ruforwards the bit streams received from the connected rus without anyprocessing. it is observed that this strategy may cause significant performancedegradation in the presence of a dense deployment of rus with a well connectedbackhaul network. to obviate this problem, a scheme is proposed in which eachru decompresses the received bit streams and performs linear in-networkprocessing of the decompressed signals. for both the mf and thedecompress-process-and-recompress (dpr) backhaul schemes, the optimal design isaddressed with the aim of maximizing the sum-rate under the backhaul capacityconstraints. recognizing the significant demands of the optimal solution of thedpr scheme in terms of channel state information (csi) at the rus,decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed under the assumption oflimited csi at the rus. numerical results are provided to compare theperformance of the mf and dpr schemes, highlighting the potential advantage ofin-network processing and the impact of csi limitations.

1401.4236	the impact of phase fading on the dirty paper channel	the impact of phase fading on the classical costa dirty paper coding channelis studied. we consider a variation of this channel model in which theamplitude of the interference sequence is known at the transmitter while itsphase is known at the receiver. although the capacity of this channel hasalready been established, it is expressed using an auxiliary random variableand as the solution of a maximization problem. to circumvent the difficultyevaluating capacity, we derive alternative inner and outer bounds and show thatthe two expressions are to within a finite distance. this provide anapproximate characterization of the capacity which depends only on the channelparameters. we consider, in particular, two distributions of the phase fading:circular binomial and circular uniform. the first distribution models thescenario in which the transmitter has a minimal uncertainty over the phase ofthe interference while the second distribution models complete uncertainty. forcircular binomial fading, we show that binning with gaussian signaling stillapproaches capacity, as in the channel without phase fading. in the case ofcircular uniform fading, instead, binning with gaussian signaling is no longereffective and novel interference avoidance strategies are developed to approachcapacity.

1404.0832	multiple access channels with combined cooperation and partial cribbing	in this paper we study the multiple access channel (mac) with combinedcooperation and partial cribbing and characterize its capacity region.cooperation means that the two encoders send a message to one another via arate-limited link prior to transmission, while partial cribbing means that eachof the two encoders obtains a deterministic function of the other encoder'soutput with or without delay. prior work in this field dealt separately withcooperation and partial cribbing. however, by combining these two methods wecan achieve significantly higher rates. remarkably, the capacity region doesnot require an additional auxiliary random variable (rv) since the purpose ofboth cooperation and partial cribbing is to generate a common message betweenthe encoders. in the proof we combine methods of block markov coding, backwarddecoding, double rate-splitting, and joint typicality decoding. furthermore, wepresent the gaussian mac with combined one-sided cooperation and quantizedcribbing. for this model, we give an achievability scheme that shows how manycooperation or quantization bits are required in order to achieve a gaussianmac with full cooperation/cribbing capacity region. after establishing our mainresults, we consider two cases where only one auxiliary rv is needed. the firstis a rate distortion dual setting for the mac with a common message, a privatemessage and combined cooperation and cribbing. the second is a state-dependentmac with cooperation, where the state is known at a partially cribbing encoderand at the decoder. however, there are cases where more than one auxiliary rvis needed, e.g., when the cooperation and cribbing are not used for the samepurposes. we present a mac with an action-dependent state, where the action isbased on the cooperation but not on the cribbing. therefore, in this case morethan one auxiliary rv is needed.

1404.6474	an information theoretic approach to secret sharing	a novel information theoretic approach is proposed to solve the secretsharing problem, in which a dealer distributes one or multiple secrets among aset of participants that for each secret only qualified sets of users canrecover it by pooling their shares together while non-qualified sets of usersobtain no information about the secret even if they pool their shares together.while existing secret sharing systems (implicitly) assume that communicationsbetween the dealer and participants are noiseless, this paper takes a morepractical assumption that the dealer delivers shares to the participants via anoisy broadcast channel. an information theoretic approach is proposed, whichexploits the channel as additional resources to achieve secret sharingrequirements. in this way, secret sharing problems can be reformulated asequivalent secure communication problems via wiretap channels, and can besolved by employing powerful information theoretic security techniques. thisapproach is first developed for the classic secret sharing problem, in whichonly one secret is to be shared. this classic problem is shown to be equivalentto a communication problem over a compound wiretap channel. the lower and upperbounds on the secrecy capacity of the compound channel provide thecorresponding bounds on the secret sharing rate. the power of the approach isfurther demonstrated by a more general layered multi-secret sharing problem,which is shown to be equivalent to the degraded broadcast multiple-inputmultiple-output (mimo) channel with layered decoding and secrecy constraints.the secrecy capacity region for the degraded mimo broadcast channel ischaracterized, which provides the secret sharing capacity region. furthermore,these secure encoding schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity region providean information theoretic scheme for sharing the secrets.

1409.0454	on cooperative multiple access channels with delayed csi at transmitters	we consider a cooperative two-user multiaccess channel in which thetransmission is controlled by a random state. both encoders transmit a commonmessage and, one of the encoders also transmits an individual message. we studythe capacity region of this communication model for different degrees ofavailability of the states at the encoders, causally or strictly causally. inthe case in which the states are revealed causally to both encoders but not tothe decoder we find an explicit characterization of the capacity region in thediscrete memoryless case. in the case in which the states are revealed onlystrictly causally to both encoders, we establish inner and outer bounds on thecapacity region. the outer bound is non-trivial, and has a relatively simpleform. it has the advantage of incorporating only one auxiliary random variable.we then introduce a class of cooperative multiaccess channels with states knownstrictly causally at both encoders for which the inner and outer bounds agree;and so we characterize the capacity region for this class. in this class ofchannels, the state can be obtained as a deterministic function of the channelinputs and output. we also study the model in which the states are revealed,strictly causally, in an asymmetric manner, to only one encoder. throughout thepaper, we discuss a number of examples; and compute the capacity region of someof these examples. the results shed more light on the utility of delayedchannel state information for increasing the capacity region of state-dependentcooperative multiaccess channels; and tie with recent progress in thisframework.

1502.05428	matched multiuser gaussian source-channel communications via uncoded  schemes	we investigate whether uncoded schemes are optimal for gaussian sources onmultiuser gaussian channels. particularly, we consider two problems: the firstis to send correlated gaussian sources on a gaussian broadcast channel whereeach receiver is interested in reconstructing only one source component (or onespecific linear function of the sources) under the mean squared errordistortion measure; the second is to send vector gaussian sources on a gaussianmultiple-access channel, where each transmitter observes a noisy combination ofthe source, and the receiver wishes to reconstruct the individual sourcecomponents (or individual linear functions) under the mean squared errordistortion measure. it is shown that when the channel parameters match certaingeneral conditions, the induced distortion tuples are on the boundary of theachievable distortion region, and thus optimal. instead of following theconventional approach of attempting to characterize the achievable distortionregion, we ask the question whether and how a match can be effectivelydetermined. this decision problem formulation helps to circumvent the difficultoptimization problem often embedded in region characterization problems, andalso leads us to focus on the critical conditions in the outer bounds that makethe inequalities become equalities, which effectively decouples the overallproblem into several simpler sub-problems.

0805.4620	uplink macro diversity of limited backhaul cellular network	in this work new achievable rates are derived, for the uplink channel of acellular network with joint multicell processing, where unlike previousresults, the ideal backhaul network has finite capacity per-cell. namely, thecell sites are linked to the central joint processor via lossless links withfinite capacity. the cellular network is abstracted by symmetric models, whichrender analytical treatment plausible. for this idealistic model family,achievable rates are presented for cell-sites that use compress-and-forwardschemes combined with local decoding, for both gaussian and fading channels.the rates are given in closed form for the classical wyner model and thesoft-handover model. these rates are then demonstrated to be rather close tothe optimal unlimited backhaul joint processing rates, already for modestbackhaul capacities, supporting the potential gain offered by the jointmulticell processing approach. particular attention is also given to thelow-snr characterization of these rates through which the effect of the limitedbackhaul network is explicitly revealed. in addition, the rate at which thebackhaul capacity should scale in order to maintain the original high-snrcharacterization of an unlimited backhaul capacity system is found.

1511.08084	layered downlink precoding for c-ran systems with full dimensional mimo	the implementation of a cloud radio access network (c-ran) with fulldimensional (fd)-mimo is faced with the challenge of controlling the fronthauloverhead for the transmission of baseband signals as the number of horizontaland vertical antennas grows larger. this work proposes to leverage the speciallow-rank structure of fd-mimo channel, which is characterized by atime-invariant elevation component and a time-varying azimuth component, bymeans of a layered precoding approach, so as to reduce the fronthaul overhead.according to this scheme, separate precoding matrices are applied for theazimuth and elevation channel components, with different rates of adaptation tothe channel variations and correspondingly different impacts on the fronthaulcapacity. moreover, we consider two different central unit (cu) - radio unit(ru) functional splits at the physical layer, namely the conventional c-ranimplementation and an alternative one in which coding and precoding areperformed at the rus. via numerical results, it is shown that the layeredschemes significantly outperform conventional non-layered schemes, especiallyin the regime of low fronthaul capacity and large number of vertical antennas.

cs;0504028	on extrinsic information of good codes operating over discrete  memoryless channels	we show that the extrinsic information about the coded bits of any good(capacity achieving) code operating over a wide class of discrete memorylesschannels (dmc) is zero when channel capacity is below the code rate andpositive constant otherwise, that is, the extrinsic information transfer (exit)chart is a step function of channel quality, for any capacity achieving code.it follows that, for a common class of iterative receivers where the errorcorrecting decoder must operate at first iteration at rate above capacity (suchas in turbo equalization, turbo channel estimation, parallel and serialconcatenated coding and the like), classical good codes which achieve capacityover the dmc are not effective and should be replaced by different new ones.another meaning of the results is that a good code operating at rate abovechannel capacity falls apart into its individual transmitted symbols in thesense that all the information about a coded transmitted symbol is contained inthe corresponding received symbol and no information about it can be inferredfrom the other received symbols. the binary input additive white gaussian noisechannel is treated in part 1 of this report. part 2 extends the results to thesymmetric binary channel and to the binary erasure channel and provides anheuristic extension to wider class of channel models.

cs;0607099	degrees of freedom region for the mimo x channel	we provide achievability as well as converse results for the degrees offreedom region of a mimo $x$ channel, i.e., a system with two transmitters, tworeceivers, each equipped with multiple antennas, where independent messagesneed to be conveyed over fixed channels from each transmitter to each receiver.with m=1 antennas at each node, we find that the total (sum rate) degrees offreedom are bounded above and below as $1 \leq\eta_x^\star \leq {4/3}$. if$m&gt;1$ and channel matrices are non-degenerate then the precise degrees offreedom $\eta_x^\star = {4/3}m$. simple zero forcing without dirty paperencoding or successive decoding, suffices to achieve the ${4/3}m$ degrees offreedom. with equal number of antennas at all nodes, we explore the increase indegrees of freedom when some of the messages are made available to atransmitter or receiver in the manner of cognitive radio. with a cognitivetransmitter we show that the number of degrees of freedom $\eta = {3/2}m$ (for$m&gt;1$) on the mimo $x$ channel. the same degrees of freedom are obtained on themimo $x$ channel with a cognitive receiver as well. in contrast to the $x$channel result, we show that for the mimo \emph{interference} channel, thedegrees of freedom are not increased even if both the transmitter and thereceiver of one user know the other user's message. however, the interferencechannel can achieve the full $2m$ degrees of freedom if \emph{each} user haseither a cognitive transmitter or a cognitive receiver. lastly, if the channelsvary with time/frequency then the $x$ channel with single antennas $(m=1)$ atall nodes has exactly 4/3 degrees of freedom with no shared messages andexactly 3/2 degrees of freedom with a cognitive transmitter or a cognitivereceiver.

cs;0608071	broadcast cooperation strategies for two colocated users	this work considers the problem of communication from a single transmitter,over a network with colocated users, through an independent block rayleighfading channel. the colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, whichincreases the overall achievable rate, from the transmitter to the destineduser. the transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivershave access to perfect channel state information (csi). this gives rise to themulti-layer broadcast approach used by the transmitter. the broadcast approachallows, in our network setting, to improve the cooperation between thecolocated users. that is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the betterthe channel quality, the more layers that can be decoded. the cooperationbetween the users is performed over an additive white gaussian channels (awgn),with a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. three commonly usedcooperation techniques are studied: amplify-forward (af), compress-forward(cf), and decode-forward (df). these methods are extended using the broadcastapproach, for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. for this case aseparated processing of the layers, which includes multi-session cooperation isshown to be beneficial. further, closed form expressions for infinitely many afsessions and recursive expressions for the more complex cf are given. numericalresults for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate the efficiency ofmulti-session cooperation.

cs;0701024	secure communication over fading channels	the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages (bcc) isinvestigated, where a source node has common information for two receivers(receivers 1 and 2), and has confidential information intended only forreceiver 1. the confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possiblefrom receiver 2. the broadcast channel from the source node to receivers 1 and2 is corrupted by multiplicative fading gain coefficients in addition toadditive gaussian noise terms. the channel state information (csi) is assumedto be known at both the transmitter and the receivers. the parallel bcc withindependent subchannels is first studied, which serves as aninformation-theoretic model for the fading bcc. the secrecy capacity region ofthe parallel bcc is established. this result is then specialized to give thesecrecy capacity region of the parallel bcc with degraded subchannels. thesecrecy capacity region is then established for the parallel gaussian bcc, andthe optimal source power allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecycapacity region are derived. in particular, the secrecy capacity region isestablished for the basic gaussian bcc. the secrecy capacity results are thenapplied to study the fading bcc. both the ergodic and outage performances arestudied.

0812.3709	minimum expected distortion in gaussian source coding with fading side  information	an encoder, subject to a rate constraint, wishes to describe a gaussiansource under squared error distortion. the decoder, besides receiving theencoder's description, also observes side information consisting ofuncompressed source symbol subject to slow fading and noise. the decoder knowsthe fading realization but the encoder knows only its distribution. therate-distortion function that simultaneously satisfies the distortionconstraints for all fading states was derived by heegard and berger. a layeredencoding strategy is considered in which each codeword layer targets a givenfading state. when the side-information channel has two discrete fading states,the expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the encoding ratebetween the two codeword layers. for multiple fading states, the minimumexpected distortion is formulated as the solution of a convex optimizationproblem with linearly many variables and constraints. through a limitingprocess on the primal and dual solutions, it is shown that single-layer rateallocation is optimal when the fading probability density function iscontinuous and quasiconcave (e.g., rayleigh, rician, nakagami, and log-normal).in particular, under rayleigh fading, the optimal single codeword layer targetsthe least favorable state as if the side information was absent.
