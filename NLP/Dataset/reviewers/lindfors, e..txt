0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

0912.0005	variability and stability in blazar jets on time scales of years:  optical polarization monitoring of oj287 in 2005-2009	(abridged) oj287 is a bl lac object that has shown double-peaked bursts atregular intervals of ~12 yr during the last ~40 yr. we analyse opticalphotopolarimetric monitoring data from 2005-2009, during which the latestdouble-peaked outburst occurred. the aim of this study is twofold: firstly, weaim to analyse variability patterns and statistical properties of the opticalpolarization light-curve. we find a strong preferred position angle in opticalpolarization. the preferred position angle can be explained by separating thejet emission into two components: an optical polarization core and chaotic jetemission. the optical polarization core is stable on time scales of years andcan be explained as emission from an underlying quiescent jet component. thechaotic jet emission sometimes exhibits a circular movement in the stokesplane. we interpret these events as a shock front moving forwards and backwardsin the jet, swiping through a helical magnetic field. secondly, we use our datato assess different binary black hole models proposed to explain the regularlyappearing double-peaked bursts in oj287. we compose a list of requirements amodel has to fulfil. the list includes not only characteristics of thelight-curve but also other properties of oj287, such as the black hole mass andrestrictions on accretion flow properties. we rate all existing models usingthis list and conclude that none of the models is able to explain allobservations. we discuss possible new explanations and propose a new approachto understanding oj287. we suggest that both the double-peaked bursts and theevolution of the optical polarization position angle could be explained as asign of resonant accretion of magnetic field lines, a 'magnetic breathing' ofthe disc.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1103.5677	a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission from scorpius x-1 with  the magic telescopes	the acceleration of particles up to gev or higher energies in microquasarshas been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts inthe past few years. sco x-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highlyenergetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-calledhorizontal branch (hb), a state when the radio and hard x-ray fluxes are higherand a powerful relativistic jet is present. here we present the first very highenergy gamma-ray observations of sco x-1 obtained with the magic telescopes. ananalysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% clflux upper limits above 300 gev at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.simultaneous rxte observations were conducted to search for tev emission duringparticular x-ray states of the source. a selection of the gamma-ray dataobtained during the hb based on the x-ray colors did not yield a signal either,with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. these upper limits place aconstraint on the maximum tev luminosity to non-thermal x-ray luminosity ofl_{vhe}/l_{ntx}&lt;0.02, that can be related to a maximum tev luminosity to jetpower ratio of l_{vhe}/l_{j}&lt;10^{-3}. our upper limits indicate that theunderlying high-energy emission physics in sco x-1 must be inherently differentfrom that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1106.5162	the brightest gamma-ray flaring blazar in the sky: agile and  multi-wavelength observations of 3c 454.3 during november 2010	since 2005, the blazar 3c 454.3 has shown remarkable flaring activity at allfrequencies, and during the last four years it has exhibited more than onegamma-ray flare per year, becoming the most active gamma-ray blazar in the sky.we present for the first time the multi-wavelength agile, swift, integral, andgasp-webt data collected in order to explain the extraordinary gamma-ray flareof 3c 454.3 which occurred in november 2010. on 2010 november 20 (mjd 55520),3c 454.3 reached a peak flux (e&gt;100 mev) of f_gamma(p) = (6.8+-1.0)e-5 ph/cm2/son a time scale of about 12 hours, more than a factor of 6 higher than the fluxof the brightest steady gamma-ray source, the vela pulsar, and more than afactor of 3 brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 december 2-3. themulti-wavelength data make a thorough study of the present event possible: thecomparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the onethat occurred in 2009. by comparing the broadband emission before, during, andafter the gamma-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical and x-ray emissionvaries within a factor 2-3, whereas the gamma-ray flux by a factor of 10. thisremarkable behavior is modeled by an external compton component driven by asubstantial local enhancement of soft seed photons.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1109.6124	phase-resolved energy spectra of the crab pulsar in the range of 50-400  gev measured with the magic telescopes	we use 73 h of stereoscopic data taken with the magic telescopes toinvestigate the very high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission of the crab pulsar.our data show a highly significant pulsed signal in the energy range from 50 to400 gev in both the main pulse (p1) and the interpulse (p2) phase regions. weprovide the widest spectra to date of the vhe components of both peaks, andthese spectra extend to the energy range of satellite-borne observatories. thegood resolution and background rejection of the stereoscopic magic systemallows us to cross-check the correctness of each spectral point of the pulsarby comparison with the corresponding (strong and well-known) crab nebula flux.the spectra of both p1 and p2 are compatible with power laws with photonindices of 4.0 \pm 0.8 (p1) and 3.42 \pm 0.26 (p2), respectively, and the ratiop1/p2 between the photon counts of the two pulses is 0.54 \pm 0.12. the vheemission can be understood as an additional component produced by the inversecompton scattering of secondary and tertiary e\pm pairs on ir-uv photons.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

(&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1401.7154	magic reveals a complex morphology within the unidentified gamma-ray  source hess j1857+026	hess j1857+026 is an extended tev gamma-ray source that was discovered byh.e.s.s. as part of its galactic plane survey. given its broadband spectralenergy distribution and its spatial coincidence with the young energetic pulsarpsr j1856+0245, the source has been put forward as a pulsar wind nebula (pwn)candidate. magic has performed follow-up observations aimed at mapping thesource down to energies approaching 100 gev in order to better understand itscomplex morphology. hess j1857+026 was observed by magic in 2010, yielding 29hours of good quality stereoscopic data that allowed us to map the sourceregion in two separate ranges of energy. we detected very-high-energy gamma-rayemission from hess j1857+026 with a significance of $12 \sigma$ above $150$gev. the differential energy spectrum between $100$ gev and $13$ tev is welldescribed by a power law function $dn/de = n_0(e/1\textrm{tev})^{-\gamma}$ with$n_0 = (5.37 \pm0.44_{stat} \pm1.5_{sys}) \times 10^{-12} (\textrm{tev}^{-1}\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ $\textrm{ s}^{-1})$ and $\gamma = 2.16\pm0.07_{stat}\pm0.15_{sys}$, which bridges the gap between the gev emission measured byfermi-lat and the multi-tev emission measured by h.e.s.s.. in addition, wepresent a detailed analysis of the energy-dependent morphology of this region.we couple these results with archival multi-wavelength data and outlineevidence in favor of a two-source scenario, whereby one source is associatedwith a pwn, while the other could be linked with a molecular cloud complexcontaining an hii region and a possible gas cavity.

1402.0291	search for very-high-energy gamma rays from the z = 0.896 quasar 4c  +55.17 with the magic telescopes	the bright gamma-ray quasar 4c +55.17 is a distant source ($z = 0.896$) witha hard spectrum at gev energies as observed by the large area telescope (lat)on board the {{\it fermi}} satellite. this source is identified as a goodsource candidate for very-high-energy (vhe; $&gt; 30$ gev) gamma rays. in generalvhe gamma rays from distant sources provide an unique opportunity to study theextragalactic background light (ebl) and underlying astrophysics. the fluxintensity of this source in the vhe range is investigated. then, constraints onthe ebl are derived from the attenuation of gamma-ray photons coming from thedistant blazar. we searched for a gamma-ray signal from this object using the35-hour observations taken by the magic telescopes between november 2010 andjanuary 2011. no significant vhe gamma-ray signal was detected. we computed theupper limits of the integrated gamma-ray flux at $95\%$ confidence level of$9.4 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above $100$ gev and $200$ gev, respectively. the differential upperlimits in four energy bins in the range from $80$ gev to $500$ gev are alsoderived. the upper limits are consistent with the attenuation predicted bylow-flux ebl models on the assumption of a simple power-law spectrumextrapolated from lat data.

1402.4219	detection of bridge emission above 50 gev from the crab pulsar with the  magic telescopes	the crab pulsar is the only astronomical pulsed source detected at very highenergy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma-rays. the emission mechanism of vhe pulsation isnot yet fully understood, although several theoretical models have beenproposed. in order to test the new models, we measured the light curve and thespectra of the crab pulsar with high precision by means of deep observations.we analyzed 135 hours of selected magic data taken between 2009 and 2013 instereoscopic mode. in order to discuss the spectral shape in connection withlower energies, 4.6 years of {\it fermi}-lat data were also analyzed. the knowntwo pulses per period were detected with a significance of $8.0 \sigma$ and$12.6 \sigma$. in addition, significant emission was found between the twopulses with $6.2 \sigma$. we discovered the bridge emission above 50 gevbetween the two main pulses. this emission can not be explained with theexisting theories. these data can be used for testing new theoretical models.

1405.6074	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula 3c 58 by  magic	the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) 3c 58 is one of the historical very-high-energy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray source candidates. it is energized by one of thehighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of crab pulsar) and it has beencompared to the crab nebula due to their morphological similarities. thisobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(whipple, veritas and magic), although not detected, with an upper limit of2.4% crab unit (c.u.) at vhe. it was detected by fermi-lat with a spectrumextending beyond 100 gev. we analyzed 81 hours of 3c 58 data taken with themagic telescopes and we detected vhe gamma-ray emission with a significance of5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% c.u. above 1 tev. the differentialenergy spectrum between 400 gev and 10 tev is well described by a power-lawfunction d\phi/de=f_0(e/1tev)^{-gamma} withf_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}tev^{-1} andgamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. the skymap is compatible with an unresolvedsource. we report the first significant detection of pwn 3c 58 at tev energies.according to our results 3c 58 is the least luminous vhe gamma-ray pwn everdetected at vhe and the one with the lowest flux at vhe to date. we compare ourresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electronsup-scatter photon fields. the best representation favors a distance to the pwnof 2 kpc and far infrared (fir) comparable to cmb photon fields. if we consideran unexpectedly high fir density, the data can also be reproduced by modelsassuming a 3.2 kpc distance. a low magnetic field, far from equipartition, isrequired to explain the vhe data. hadronic contribution from the hostingsupernova remnant (snr) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density ofthe medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the snr as origin of the vhegamma-ray emission.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1410.1311	finding and characterising whim structures using the luminosity density  method	we have developed a new method to approach the missing baryons problem. weassume that the missing baryons reside in a form of warm hot intergalacticmedium, i.e. the whim. our method consists of (a) detecting the coherent largescale structure in the spatial distribution of galaxies that traces the cosmicweb and that in hydrodynamical simulations is associated to the whim, (b) mapits luminosity into a galaxy luminosity density field, (c) use numericalsimulations to relate the luminosity density to the density of the whim, (d)apply this relation to real data to trace the whim using the observed galaxyluminosities in the sloan digital sky survey and 2df redshift surveys. in ourapplication we find evidence for the whim along the line of sight to thesculptor wall, at redshifts consistent with the recently reported x-rayabsorption line detections. our indirect whim detection technique complementsthe standard method based on the detection of characteristic x-ray absorptionlines, showing that the galaxy luminosity density is a reliable signpost forthe whim. for this reason, our method could be applied to current galaxysurveys to optimise the observational strategies for detecting and studying thewhim and its properties. our estimates of the whim hydrogen column density insculptor agree with those obtained via the x-ray analysis. due to theadditional column density estimate, our method has potential for improving theconstrains of the physical parameters of the whim as derived with x-rayabsorption, and thus for improving the understanding of the missing baryonsproblem.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1504.03020	short timescale photometric and polarimetric behavior of two bl lacertae  type objects	blazars are astrophysical sources whose emission is dominated by non-thermalprocesses, typically interpreted as synchrotron and inverse compton emission.although the general picture is rather robust and consistent with observations,many aspects are still unexplored. polarimetric monitoring can offer a wealthof information about the physical processes in blazars. models with largelydifferent physical ingredients can often provide almost indistinguishablepredictions for the total flux, but usually are characterized by markedlydifferent polarization properties. we explore, with a pilot study, thepossibility to derive structural information about the emitting regions ofblazars by means of a joint analysis of rapid variability of the total andpolarized flux at optical wavelengths. short timescale (from tens of seconds toa couple of minutes) optical linear polarimetry and photometry for two blazars,bl lacertae and pks 1424+240, was carried out with the paolo polarimeter at the3.6m telescopio nazionale galileo. several hours of almost continuousobservations were obtained for both sources. our intense monitoring allowed usto draw strongly different scenarios for bl lacertae and pks 1424+240, with theformer characterized by intense variability on time-scales from hours to a fewminutes and the latter practically constant in total flux. essentially the samebehavior is observed for the polarized flux and the position angle. thevariability time-scales turned out to be as short as a few minutes, althoughinvolving only a few percent variation of the flux. the polarizationvariability time-scale is generally consistent with the total flux variability.total and polarized flux appear to be essentially uncorrelated. however, evenduring our relatively short monitoring, different regimes can be singled out.(abridged)

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1511.02654	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars. ii  multifrequency correlations	in an attempt to constrain and understand the emission mechanism of gammarays, we perform a cross-correlation analysis of 15 blazars using light curvesin millimetre, optical and gamma rays. we use discrete correlation function andconsider only correlations significant at 99 per cent level. a strongcorrelation was found between 37 and 95 ghz with a near-zero time delay in mostof the sources, and ~1 month or longer in the rest. a similar result wasobtained between the optical and gamma-ray bands. of the 15 sources, less than50 per cent showed a strong correlation between the millimetre and gamma-ray ormillimetre and optical bands. the primary reason for the lack of statisticallysignificant correlation is the absence of a major outburst in the millimetrebands of most of the sources during the 2.5 yr time period investigated in ourstudy. this may indicate that only the long-term variations or large flares arecorrelated between these bands. the variability of the sources at everywaveband was also inspected using fractional rms variability. the fractionalrms variability displays an increase with frequency reaching its maximum in thegamma rays.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.
