0902.0305	the triple system hip96515: a low-mass eclipsing binary with a db white  dwarf companion	hip96515a is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a visual companion(hip96515b) at 8.6 arcsec. it is included in the sacy catalog as a potentialyoung star and classified as an eclipsing binary in the asas catalog. we haveanalyzed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the triple system. thehigh-resolution optical spectrum of hip96515a has been used to derive a massratio, m_2/m_1, close to 0.9, with the sb2 components showing spectral types ofm1 and m2. the asas and hipparcos light-curves of hip96515a show periodicvariations with p=2.3456 days, confirming that hip96515a is an eclipsing binarywith preliminary parameters of i=89, m_aa=0.59+-0.03 msun and m_ab=0.54+-0.03msun, for the primary and secondary, respectively, at an estimated distance of42+-3 pc. this is a new eclipsing binary with component masses below 0.6 msun.multi-epoch observations of hip 96515 a&amp;b show that the system is a commonproper motion pair. the optical spectrum of hip 96515b is consistent with apure helium atmosphere (db) white dwarf. we estimate a total age (main-sequencelifetime plus cooling age) of 400 myr for the white dwarf. if hip 96515 a&amp;b arecoeval, and assuming a common age of 400 myr, the comparison of the masses ofthe eclipsing binary members with evolutionary tracks shows that they areunderestimated by ~15% and ~10%, for the primary and secondary, respectively.

0902.0627	the solar neighborhood. xxi. parallax results from the ctiopi 0.9m  program: 20 new members of the 25 parsec white dwarf sample	we present accurate trigonometric parallaxes for 20 new members of the 25 pcwhite dwarf sample as part of the dense project (discovery and evalution ofnearby stellar embers, http://www.denseproject.com). previously, there were atotal of 112 white dwarf systems with trigonometric parallaxes placing themwithin 25 pc and of these, 99 have trigonometric parallaxes known to betterthan 10%. thus, the 20 new members presented in this work represent a 20%increase in the number of white dwarfs accurately known to be within 25 pc. inaddition, we present updated parallaxes for seven known white dwarfs within 10pc that have been observed as part of the aspens initiative (astrometric searchfor planets encircling nearby stars) to monitor nearby southern red and whitedwarfs for astrometric perturbations from unseen companions. including a fewwhite dwarf companions and white dwarfs beyond 25 pc, we present a total of 33trigonometric parallaxes. we perform atmospheric modeling for white dwarfs todetermine physical parameters (i.e., effective temperature, log g, mass, andwhite dwarf age). finally, a new zz ceti pulsating white dwarf was identifiedand revised constraints are placed on two mixed h/he atmosphere cool whitedwarfs that display continuum absorption in the near-infrared.

0902.3640	spectroscopic analysis of the white dwarf kuv 02196+2816: a new  unresolved da+db degenerate binary	a spectroscopic analysis of the dba (or dab) white dwarf kuv 02196+2816 ispresented. the observed hydrogen and helium line profiles are shown to beincompatible with model spectra calculated under the assumption of ahomogeneous hydrogen and helium chemical composition. in contrast, an excellentfit to the optical spectrum of kuv 02196+2816 can be achieved if the object isinterpreted as an unresolved double degenerate composed of a hydrogen-line dastar and a helium-line db star. the atmospheric parameters obtained from thebest fit are teff=27,170 k and log g=8.09 for the da star, teff=36,340 k andlog g=8.09 for the db star, which implies that the total mass of the system(m~1.4 msol) is very close to the chandrasekhar limit. moreover, the effectivetemperature of the db stars lies well within the so-called db gap where veryfew bright db stars are found. the implications of this discovery with respectto the dab and dba spectral classes and to the evolution of double degeneratebinaries are discussed.

0902.4182	spectroscopic analysis of da white dwarfs: stark broadening of hydrogen  lines including non-ideal effects	we present improved calculations for the stark broadening of hydrogen linesin dense plasmas typical of white dwarf atmospheres. our new model is based onthe unified theory of stark broadening from vidal, cooper, &amp; smith. for thefirst time, we account for the non-ideal effects in a consistent way directlyinside the line profile calculations. the hummer &amp; mihalas theory is used todescribe the non-ideal effects due to perturbations on the absorber fromprotons and electrons. we use a truncation of the electric microfielddistribution in the quasi-static proton broadening to take into account thefact that high electric microfields dissociate the upper state of a transition.this approach represents a significant improvement over previous calculationsthat relied on the use of an ad hoc parameter to mimic these non-ideal effects.we obtain the first model spectra with line profiles that are consistent withthe equation of state. we revisit the properties of da stars in the range40,000 k &gt; teff &gt; 13,000 k by analyzing the optical spectra with our improvedmodels. the updated atmospheric parameters are shown to differ substantiallyfrom those published in previous studies, with a mean mass shifted by +0.034msun. we also show that these revised atmospheric parameters yield absolutevisual magnitudes that remain in excellent agreement with trigonometricparallax measurements.

0706.3030	a comparative study of optical and ultraviolet effective temperatures  for da white dwarfs from the iue archive	we present a comparative study of effective temperatures determined from thehydrogen balmer lines and from the uv energy distribution for 140 da whitedwarfs drawn from the iue archive. our results indicate that the optical and uvtemperatures of the majority of stars below t~40,000 k and within ~75 pc are infairly good agreement given the uncertainties. at higher temperatures and/orlarger distances, however, significant discrepancies are observed. severalmechanisms are investigated to account for these discrepancies including theeffect of interstellar reddening, the presence of metals in the photosphere,and the existence of unresolved binary white dwarfs. the results of ouranalysis reveal that wavelength-dependent extinction is the most naturalexplanation for the observed temperature differences. we also attempt topredict the differences in optical and uv temperatures expected from unresolveddegenerate binaries by performing an exhaustive simulation of composite modelspectra. in light of these simulations, we then discuss some known doubledegenerates and identify new binary candidates by restricting our analysis tostars located within 75 pc where the effect of interstellar reddening issignificantly reduced.

0909.2253	the masses of population ii white dwarfs	globular star clusters are among the first stellar populations to have formedin the milky way, and thus only a small sliver of their initial spectrum ofstellar types are still burning hydrogen on the main-sequence today. almost allof the stars born with more mass than 0.8 m_sun have evolved to form the whitedwarf cooling sequence of these systems, and the distribution and properties ofthese remnants uniquely holds clues related to the nature of the now evolvedprogenitor stars. with ultra-deep hst imaging observations, rich white dwarfpopulations of four nearby milky way globular clusters have recently beenuncovered, and are found to extend an impressive 5 - 8 magnitudes in thefaint-blue region of the h-r diagram. in this paper, we characterize theproperties of these population ii remnants by presenting the first direct massmeasurements of individual white dwarfs near the tip of the cooling sequence inthe nearest of the milky way globulars, m4. based on gemini/gmos and keck/lrismultiobject spectroscopic observations, our results indicate that 0.8 m_sunpopulation ii main-sequence stars evolving today form 0.53 +/- 0.01 m_sun whitedwarfs. we discuss the implications of this result as it relates to ourunderstanding of stellar structure and evolution of population ii stars and forthe age of the galactic halo, as measured with white dwarf cooling theory.

1002.3585	new insights into the problem of the surface gravity distribution of  cool da white dwarfs	we review at length the longstanding problem in the spectroscopic analysis ofcool hydrogen-line (da) white dwarfs (teff &lt; 13,000 k) where gravities aresignificantly higher than those found in hotter da stars. the first solutionthat has been proposed for this problem is a mild and systematic heliumcontamination from convective mixing that would mimic the high gravities. weconstrain this scenario by determining the helium abundances in six cool dawhite dwarfs using high-resolution spectra from the keck i 10-m telescope. weobtain no detections, with upper limits as low as he/h = 0.04 in some cases.this allows us to put this scenario to rest for good. we also extend our modelgrid to lower temperatures using improved stark profiles with non-ideal gaseffects from tremblay &amp; bergeron and find that the gravity distribution of coolobjects remains suspiciously high. finally, we find that photometric massesare, on average, in agreement with expected values, and that the high-log gproblem is so far unique to the spectroscopic approach.

1006.3710	the discovery of the most metal-rich white dwarf: composition of a  tidally disrupted extrasolar dwarf planet	cool white dwarf stars are usually found to have an outer atmosphere that ispractically pure in hydrogen or helium. however, a small fraction have tracesof heavy elements that must originate from the accretion of extrinsic material,most probably circumstellar matter. upon examining thousands of sloan digitalsky survey spectra, we discovered that the helium-atmosphere white dwarf sdssj073842.56+183509.6 shows the most severe metal pollution ever seen in theoutermost layers of such stars. we present here a quantitative analysis of thisexciting star by combining high s/n follow-up spectroscopic and photometricobservations with model atmospheres and evolutionary models. we determine theglobal structural properties of our target star, as well as the abundances ofthe most significant pollutants in its atmosphere, i.e., h, o, na, mg, si, ca,and fe. the relative abundances of these elements imply that the source of theaccreted material has a composition similar to that of bulk earth. we alsoreport the signature of a circumstellar disk revealed through a large infraredexcess in jhk photometry. combined with our inferred estimate of the mass ofthe accreted material, this strongly suggests that we are witnessing theremains of a tidally disrupted extrasolar body that was as large as ceres.

1105.5433	a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of db white dwarfs	we present a detailed analysis of 108 helium-line (db) white dwarfs based onmodel atmosphere fits to high signal-to-noise optical spectroscopy. we derive amean mass of 0.67 mo for our sample, with a dispersion of only 0.09 mo. whitedwarfs also showing hydrogen lines, the dba stars, comprise 44% of our sample,and their mass distribution appears similar to that of db stars. as in ourprevious investigation, we find no evidence for the existence of low-mass (m &lt;0.5 mo) db white dwarfs. we derive a luminosity function based on a subset ofdb white dwarfs identified in the palomar-green survey. we show that 20% of allwhite dwarfs in the temperature range of interest are db stars, although thefraction drops to half this value above teff ~ 20,000 k. we also show that thepersistence of db stars with no hydrogen features at low temperatures isdifficult to reconcile with a scenario involving accretion from theinterstellar medium, often invoked to account for the observed hydrogenabundances in dba stars. we present evidence for the existence of two differentevolutionary channels that produce db white dwarfs: the standard model where dastars are transformed into db stars through the convective dilution of a thinhydrogen layer, and a second channel where db stars retain a helium-atmospherethroughout their evolution. we finally demonstrate that the instability stripof pulsating v777 her white dwarfs contains no nonvariables, if the hydrogencontent of these stars is properly accounted for.

1106.6007	solution to the problem of the surface gravity distribution of cool da  white dwarfs from improved 3d model atmospheres	the surface gravities of cool (teff &lt; 13,000 k) hydrogen-atmosphere da whitedwarfs, determined from spectroscopic analyses, are found to be significantlyhigher than the canonical value of log g ~ 8 expected for these stars. it wasrecently concluded that a problem with the treatment of convective energytransport within the framework of the mixing-length theory was the mostplausible explanation for this high-log g problem. we pursue the investigationof this discrepancy by computing model spectra of cool convective white dwarfsfrom a small sequence (11,300 k &lt; teff &lt; 12,800 k) of 3d hydrodynamical modelatmospheres, which feature a sophisticated treatment of convection andradiative transfer. our approach is to proceed with a differential analysisbetween 3d and standard 1d models. we find that the 3d spectra predictsignificantly lower surface gravities, with corrections of the right amplitudeas a function of effective temperature to obtain values of log g ~ 8 onaverage. we conclude that the surface gravity distribution of cool convectiveda white dwarfs is much closer to that of hotter radiative objects when using,for the treatment of the convection, 3d models instead of the mixing-lengthframework.

0710.1073	the ratio of helium- to hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs: direct  evidence for convective mixing	we determine the ratio of helium- to hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarf stars asa function of effective temperature from a model atmosphere analysis of theinfrared photometric data from the two micron all sky survey combined withavailable visual magnitudes. our study surpasses any previous analysis of thiskind both in terms of the accuracy of the teff determinations as well as thesize of the sample. we observe that the ratio of helium- to hydrogen-atmospherewhite dwarfs increases gradually from a constant value of ~0.25 between teff =15,000 k and 10,000 k to a value twice as large in the range 10,000 &gt; teff &gt;8000 k, suggesting that convective mixing, which occurs when the bottom of thehydrogen convection zone reaches the underlying convective helium envelope, isresponsible for this gradual transition. the comparison of our results with anapproximate model used to describe the outcome of this convective mixingprocess implies hydrogen mass layers in the range log m_h/m_tot = -10 to -8 forabout 15% of the da stars that survived the da to db transition near teff ~30,000 k, the remainder having presumably more massive layers above logm_h/m_tot ~ -6.

1207.5393	an accurate mass and radius measurement for an ultracool white dwarf	studies of cool white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood have placed a limiton the age of the galactic disk of 8-9 billion years. however, determiningtheir cooling ages requires the knowledge of their effective temperatures,masses, radii, and atmospheric composition. so far, these parameters could onlybe inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accuratedistance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions (seds) inconjunction with a theoretical mass-radius relation. however, the mass-radiusrelation remains largely untested, and the derived cooling ages are hencemodel-dependent. here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius ofan ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary sdssj013851.54-001621.6. we find m(wd)=0.529+/-0.010msol andr(wd)=0.0131+/-0.0003rsol. our measurements are consistent with the mass-radiusrelation and we determine a robust cooling age of 9.5 billion years for the3570k white dwarf. we find that the mass and radius of the low mass companionstar, m(sec)=0.132+/-0.003msol and r(sec)=0.165+/-0.001rsol, are in agreementwith evolutionary models. we also find evidence that this &gt;9.5 gyr old m5 staris still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectraltype. this is likely caused by the high tidally-enforced rotation rate of thestar. the companion star is close to filling its roche lobe and the system willevolve into a cataclysmic variable in only 70 myr. our direct measurementsdemonstrate that this system can be used to calibrate ultracool white dwarfatmospheric models.

0705.0977	stellar evolution in ngc 6791: mass loss on the red giant branch and the  formation of low mass white dwarfs	we present the first detailed study of the properties (temperatures,gravities, and masses) of the ngc 6791 white dwarf population. this uniquestellar system is both one of the oldest (8 gyr) and most metal-rich ([fe/h] ~0.4) open clusters in our galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) thatexhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch.fitting the balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using keck/lrisspectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, &lt;m&gt; = 0.43 +/-0.06 msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolutioninvolving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. we show that atleast 40% of ngc 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the redgiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium intocarbon-oxygen in their core. such increased mass loss in the evolution of theprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extremehorizontal branch in the cmd. this unique stellar evolutionary channel alsonaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 gyr) for ngc6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this clusterwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore thecorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 gyr, consistent with the wellmeasured main-sequence turnoff age. these results provide direct empiricalevidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high metallicity environmentsand therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn inelliptical galaxies.

1410.5255	comparison of atmospheric parameters determined from spectroscopy and  photometry for da white dwarfs in the sloan digital sky survey	we present a comparative analysis of atmospheric parameters obtained with theso-called photometric and spectroscopic techniques. photometric andspectroscopic data for 1360 da white dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) are used, as well as spectroscopic data from the villanova white dwarfcatalog. we first test the calibration of the ugriz photometric system by usingmodel atmosphere fits to observed data. our photometric analysis indicates thatthe ugriz photometry appears well calibrated when the sdss to ab_95 zeropointcorrections are applied. the spectroscopic analysis of the same data setreveals that the so-called high-log g problem can be solved by applyingpublished correction functions that take into account 3d hydrodynamicaleffects. however, a comparison between the sdss and the white dwarf catalogspectra also suggests that the sdss spectra still suffer from a smallcalibration problem. we then compare the atmospheric parameters obtained fromboth fitting techniques and show that the photometric temperatures aresystematically lower than those obtained from spectroscopic data. thissystematic offset may be linked to the hydrogen line profiles used in the modelatmospheres. we finally present the results of an analysis aimed at measuringsurface gravities using photometric data only.

1512.03114	a comparative analysis of the observed white dwarf cooling sequence from  globular clusters	we report our study of features at the observed red end of the white dwarfcooling sequences for three galactic globular clusters: ngc\,6397, 47\,tucanaeand m\,4. we use deep colour-magnitude diagrams constructed from archivalhubble space telescope (acs) to systematically investigate the blue turn atfaint magnitudes and the age determinations for each cluster. we find that theage difference between ngc\,6397 and 47\,tuc is 1.98$^{+0.44}_{-0.26}$\,gyr,consistent with the picture that metal-rich halo clusters were formed laterthan metal-poor halo clusters. we self-consistently include the effect ofmetallicity on the progenitor age and the initial-to-final mass relation. incontrast with previous investigations that invoked a single white dwarf massfor each cluster, the data shows a spread of white dwarf masses that betterreproduce the shape and location of the blue turn. this effect alone, however,does not completely reproduce the observational data - the blue turn retainssome mystery. in this context, we discuss several other potential problems inthe models. these include possible partial mixing of h and he in the atmosphereof white dwarf stars, the lack of a good physical description of thecollision-induced absorption process and uncertainties in the opacities at lowtemperatures. the latter are already known to be significant in the descriptionof the cool main sequence. additionally, we find that the present day localmass function of ngc\,6397 is consistent with a top-heavy type, while 47\,tucpresents a bottom-heavy profile.

astro-ph;0011286	photometric and spectroscopic analysis of cool white dwarfs with  trigonometric parallax measurements	a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 152 cool white dwarf stars ispresented. the discovery of 7 new da white dwarfs, 2 new dq white dwarfs, 1 newmagnetic white dwarf, and 3 weak magnetic white dwarf candidates, is reported,as well as 19 known or suspected double degenerates. the photometric energydistributions, the halpha line profiles, and the trigonometric parallaxmeasurements are combined and compared to model atmosphere calculations todetermine the effective temperature and the radius of each object, and also toconstrain the atmospheric composition. new evolutionary sequences with c/ocores with thin and thick hydrogen layers are used to derive masses and ages.we confirm the existence of a range in teff between 5000 and 6000k where almostall white dwarfs have h-rich atmospheres. there is little evidence for mixedh/he dwarfs, with the exception of 2 he-rich da stars, and 5 c2h white dwarfswhich possibly have mixed h/he/c atmospheres. the dq sequence terminates near6500k, below which they are believed to turn into c2h stars. true dc starsslightly above this temperature are found to exhibit h-like energydistributions despite the lack of halpha absorption. attempts to interpret thechemical evolution show the problem to be complex. convective mixing isnecessary to account for the non-da to da ratio as a function of temperature.the presence of helium in cool da stars, the existence of the non-da gap, andthe peculiar dc stars are also explained in terms of convective mixing,although our understanding of how this mechanism works needs to be revised. theoldest object in our sample is about 7.9 gyr or 9.7 gyr old depending onwhether thin or thick hydrogen layer models are used. the mean mass of oursample is 0.65 +/- 0.20 msun.

astro-ph;0210319	the true incidence of magnetism among field white dwarfs	we study the incidence of magnetism in white dwarfs from three large andwell-observed samples of hot, cool, and nearby white dwarfs in order to testwhether the fraction of magnetic degenerates is biased, and whether it varieswith effective temperature, cooling age, or distance. the magnetic fraction isconsiderably higher for the cool sample of bergeron, ruiz, and leggett, and theholberg, oswalt, and sion sample of local white dwarfs that it is for thegenerally-hotter white dwarfs of the palomar green survey. we show that themean mass of magnetic white dwarfs in this survey is 0.93 solar masses or more,so there may be a strong bias against their selection in the magnitude-limitedpalomar green survey. we argue that this bias is not as important in thesamples of cool and nearby white dwarfs. however, this bias may not account forall of the difference in the magnetic fractions of these samples.  it is not clear that the magnetic white dwarfs in the cool and local samplesare drawn from the same population as the hotter pg stars. in particular, twoor threee of the cool sample are low-mass white dwarfs in unresolved binarysystems. moreover, there is a suggestion from the local sample that thefractional incidence may increase with decreasing temperature, luminosity,and/or cooling age. overall, the true incidence of magnetism at the level of 2megagauss or greater is at least 10%, and could be higher. limited studiescapable of detecting lower field strengths down to 10 kilogauss suggest byimplication that the total fraction may be substantially higher than 10%.

astro-ph;0211569	a critical examination of halo white dwarf candidates	a detailed analysis of halo white dwarf candidates is presented, which isbased on model atmosphere fits to observed energy distributions built fromphotoelectric or photographic magnitudes. most of the candidates identified inreduced proper motion diagrams are shown to be too warm (teff &gt; 5000 k) andmost likely too young to be members of the galactic halo, while the tangentialvelocities of the cooler and thus older white dwarfs are shown to be entirelyconsistent with the disk population. the results suggest that some white dwarfstars born in the young disk may have high velocities with respect to the localstandard of rest. such objects could represent the remnants of donor stars fromclose mass-transfer binaries that produced type ia supernovae via the singledegenerate channel, or other scenarios suggested in the literature. ongoingsurveys that rely solely on reduced proper motion diagrams are likely toidentify more of these high velocity young degenerates, rather than to unveilthe old white dwarf population of the galactic halo. the importance of infraredphotometry for studying extremely cool white dwarfs is also emphasized.

astro-ph;0312588	analysis of a very massive da white dwarf via the trigonometric parallax  and spectroscopic methods	by two different methods, we show that lhs 4033 is an extremely massive whitedwarf near its likely upper mass limit for destruction by unstable electroncaptures. from the accurate trigonometric parallax reported herein, theeffective temperature (t=10,900 k) and the stellar radius (r=0.00368 r_sun) aredirectly determined from the broad-band spectral energy distribution -- theparallax method. the effective temperature and surface gravity are alsoestimated independently from the simultaneous fitting of the observed balmerline profiles with those predicted from pure-hydrogen model atmospheres -- thespectroscopic method (t=10,760 k, log g=9.46). the mass of lhs 4033 is theninferred from theoretical mass-radius relations appropriate for white dwarfs.the parallax method yields a mass estimate of 1.310--1.330 m_sun, for interiorcompositions ranging from pure magnesium to pure carbon, respectively, whilethe spectroscopic method yields an estimate of 1.318--1.335 m_sun for the samecore compositions. this star is the most massive white dwarf for which a robustcomparison of the two techniques has been made.

astro-ph;0506451	towards an empirical determination of the zz ceti instability strip	we present atmospheric parameters for a large sample of da white dwarfs thatare known to be photometrically constant. for each star, we determine theeffective temperature and surface gravity by comparing high signal-to-noiseratio optical spectra to the predictions of detailed model atmospherecalculations. we also report the successful prediction and detection ofphotometric variability in g232-38 based on similar teff and log gdeterminations. the atmospheric parameters derived for this sample of constantstars as well as those for the known sample of bright zz ceti stars (nowboosted to a total of 39) have been obtained in a highly homogeneous way. wecombine them to study the empirical red and blue edges as well as the purity ofthe zz ceti instability strip. we find that the red edge is rather wellconstrained whereas there exists a rather large range of possibilities for theslope of the blue edge. furthermore, the zz ceti instability strip that resultsfrom our analysis contains no nonvariable white dwarfs. our sample of constantstars is part of a much broader spectroscopic survey of bright (v &lt; 17) dawhite dwarfs, which we have recently undertaken. we also present here somepreliminary results of this survey. finally, we revisit the analysis by mukadamet al. of the variable and nonvariable da stars uncovered as part of the sloandigital sky survey. their erroneous conclusion of an instability stripcontaining several nonvariable stars is traced back to the low signal-to-noiseratio spectroscopic observations used in that survey.

astro-ph;0606485	a quantitative analysis of the available multicolor photometry for  rapidly pulsating hot b subdwarfs	we present a quantitative and homogeneous analysis of the broadbandmulticolor photometric data sets gathered so far on rapidly pulsating hot bsubdwarf stars. this concerns seven distinct data sets related to six differentstars. our analysis is carried out within the theoretical framework developedby randall et al., which includes full nonadiabatic effects. the goal of thisanalysis is partial mode identification, i.e., the determination of the degreeindex l of each of the observed pulsation modes. we assume possible values of lfrom 0 to 5 in our calculations. for each target star, we compute a specificmodel atmosphere and a specific pulsation model using estimates of theatmospheric parameters coming from time-averaged optical spectroscopy. forevery assumed value of l, we use a formal chi-squared approach to model theobserved amplitude-wavelength distribution of each mode, and we compute aquality-of-fit q probability to quantify the derived fit and to discriminateobjectively between the various solutions. we find that no completelyconvincing and unambiguous l identification is possible on the basis of theavailable data, although partial mode discrimination has been reached for 25out of the 41 modes studied. a brief statistical study of these resultssuggests that a majority of the modes must have l values of 0, 1, and 2, butalso that modes with l = 4 could very well be present while modes with l = 3appear to be rarer. this is in line with recent results showing that l = 4modes in rapidly pulsating b subdwarfs have a higher visibility in the opticaldomain than modes with l = 3. although somewhat disappointing in terms of modediscrimination, our results still suggest that the full potential of multicolorphotometry for l identification in pulsating subdwarfs is within reach.

astro-ph;0611899	infrared photometric analysis of white dwarfs from the two micron all  sky survey and the spitzer space telescope	we review the available near- and mid-infrared photometry for white dwarfsobtained from the two micron all-sky survey (2mass) and by the spitzer spacetelescope. both data sets have recently been used to seek white dwarfs withinfrared excesses due to the presence of unresolved companions or circumstellardisks, and also to derive the atmospheric parameters of cool white dwarfs. wefirst attempt to evaluate the reliability of the 2mass photometry by comparingit with an independent set of published jhk cit magnitudes for 160 cool whitedwarf stars, and also by comparing the data with the predictions of detailedmodel atmosphere calculations. the possibility of using 2mass to identifyunresolved m dwarf companions or circumstellar disks is then discussed. we alsorevisit the analysis of 46 binary candidates from wachter et al. using thesynthetic flux method and confirm the large near-infrared excesses in mostobjects. we perform a similar analysis by fitting spitzer 4.5 and 8 micronphotometric observations of white dwarfs with our grid of model atmospheres,and demonstrate the reliability of both the spitzer data and the theoreticalcalculations up to 8 micron. finally, we search for massive disks resultingfrom the merger of two white dwarfs in a 2mass sample composed of 57 massivedegenerates, and show that massive disks are uncommon in such stars.

astro-ph;0702347	the unusual binary pulsar psr j1744-3922: radio flux variability,  near-infrared observation and evolution	psr j1744-3922 is a binary pulsar exhibiting highly variable pulsed radioemission. we report on a statistical multi-frequency study of the pulsed radioflux variability which suggests that this phenomenon is extrinsic to the pulsarand possibly tied to the companion, although not strongly correlated withorbital phase. the pulsar has an unusual combination of characteristicscompared to typical recycled pulsars: a long spin period (172 ms); a relativelyhigh magnetic field strength (1.7x10^10 g); a very circular, compact orbit of4.6 hours; and a low-mass companion (0.08 msun). these spin and orbitalproperties are likely inconsistent with standard evolutionary models. we findsimilarities between the properties of the psr j1744-3922 system and those ofseveral other known binary pulsar systems, motivating the identification of anew class of binary pulsars. we suggest that this new class could result fromeither: a standard accretion scenario of a magnetar or a high-magnetic fieldpulsar; common envelope evolution with a low-mass star and a neutron star,similar to what is expected for ultra-compact x-ray binaries; or, accretioninduced collapse of a white dwarf. we also report the detection of a possiblek'=19.30(15) infrared counterpart at the position of the pulsar, which isrelatively bright if the companion is a helium white dwarf at the nominaldistance, and discuss its implications for the pulsar's companion andevolutionary history.

astro-ph;0703758	on the spectral evolution of cool, helium-atmosphere white dwarfs:  detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of dz stars	we present a detailed analysis of a large spectroscopic and photometricsample of dz white dwarfs based on our latest model atmosphere calculations. werevise the atmospheric parameters of the trigonometric parallax sample ofbergeron, leggett, &amp; ruiz (12 stars) and analyze 147 new dz white dwarfsdiscovered in the sloan digital sky survey. the inclusion of metals andhydrogen in our model atmosphere calculations leads to different atmosphericparameters than those derived from pure helium models. calcium abundances arefound in the range from log (ca/he) = -12 to -8. we also find that fits of thecoolest objects show peculiarities, suggesting that our physical models may notcorrectly describe the conditions of high atmospheric pressure encountered inthe coolest dz stars. we find that the mean mass of the 11 dz stars withtrigonometric parallaxes, &lt;m&gt; = 0.63 mo, is significantly lower than thatobtained from pure helium models, &lt;m&gt; = 0.78 mo, and in much better agreementwith the mean mass of other types of white dwarfs. we determine hydrogenabundances for 27% of the dz stars in our sample, while only upper limits areobtained for objects with low signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic data. weconfirm with a high level of confidence that the accretion rate of hydrogen isat least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of metals (and up to five insome cases) to be compatible with the observations. we find a correlationbetween the hydrogen abundance and the effective temperature, suggesting forthe first time empirical evidence of a lower temperature boundary for thehydrogen screening mechanism. finally, we speculate on the possibility that thedza white dwarfs could be the result of the convective mixing of thinhydrogen-rich atmospheres with the underlying helium convection zone.

astro-ph;9606045	the masses of the millisecond pulsar j1012+5307 and its white-dwarf  companion	we report on spectroscopy of the white-dwarf companion of the millisecondradio pulsar psr j1012+5307. we find strong balmer absorption lines, as wouldbe expected for a cool da white dwarf. the profiles are much narrower thanusual, however, and lines are seen up to h12, indicating that the companion hasa low gravity and hence a low mass. this is consistent with theexpectation---based on evolutionary considerations and on the massfunction---that it is a low-mass white dwarf with a helium core. by comparingthe spectra to model atmospheres, we derive an effective temperature$t_{\rm{}eff}=8550\pm25\,$k and a surface gravity $\log{}g=6.75\pm0.07$ (cgsunits). using the hamada-salpeter mass-radius relation for helium white dwarfs,with an approximate correction for finite-temperature effects, we infer a mass$\mwd=0.16\pm0.02\,\msun$. this is the lowest mass among all spectroscopicallyidentified white dwarfs. we determine radial velocities from our spectra, andfind a radial-velocity amplitude of $280\pm15\,\kms$. with the pulsar'sradial-velocity amplitude, the mass ratio $\mpsr/\mwd=13.3\pm0.7$. from allconstraints, we find that with 95\% confidence $1.5&lt;\mpsr/\msun&lt;3.2$.

astro-ph;9703053	s1040 in m67: a post-mass-transfer binary with a helium-core white dwarf	we have obtained spectra of the yellow giant s1040 in the open cluster m67using the goddard high-resolution spectrograph (ghrs) and the faint objectspectrograph on the hubble space telescope. s1040 is a single-linedspectroscopic binary with a 42.8d period that occupies a "red straggler"position in the m67 color-magnitude diagram (cmd), 0.2 mag blueward of thegiant branch. a detection of s1040 at 1620 a with the ultraviolet imagingtelescope provided evidence that the secondary is a hot white dwarf, and thusthat the anomalous location of s1040 in the cmd is likely due to a priorepisode of mass-transfer. our ghrs spectrum shows a broad ly alpha absorptionprofile that confirms the white dwarf identification of the s1040 secondary. amodel atmosphere fit to the ghrs spectrum yields teff = 16,160 k, log g = 6.7,and a mass of 0.22 msun, for an assumed cluster distance of 820 pc andreddening of e(b-v) = 0.02. the unusually low mass derived for the white dwarfimplies that it must have a helium core, and that a mass-transfer episode musthave begun while the progenitor was on the lower giant branch. we construct aplausible mass-transfer history for s1040 in which it originated as a short(~2d) period binary, and evolved through a blue straggler phase to reach itscurrent state.

0810.4011	cool white dwarfs identified in the second data release of the ukirt  infrared deep sky survey	we have paired the second data release of the large area survey of the ukirtinfrared deep sky survey with the fifth data release of the sloan digital skysurvey to identify ten cool white dwarf candidates, from their photometry andastrometry. of these ten, one was previously known to be a very cool whitedwarf. we have obtained optical spectroscopy for seven of the candidates usingthe gmos-n spectrograph on gemini north, and have confirmed all seven as whitedwarfs. our photometry and astrometry indicates that the remaining two objectsare also white dwarfs. model analysis of the photometry and availablespectroscopy shows that the seven confirmed new white dwarfs, and the two newlikely white dwarfs, have effective temperatures in the range teff = 5400-6600k. our analysis of the previously known white dwarf confirms that it is cool,with teff = 3800 k. the cooling age for this dwarf is 8.7 gyr, while that ofthe nine ~6000 k white dwarfs is 1.8-3.6 gyr. we are unable to determine themasses of the white dwarfs from the existing data, and therefore we cannotconstrain the total ages of the white dwarfs. the large cooling age for thecoolest white dwarf in the sample, combined with its low estimated tangentialvelocity, suggests that it is an old member of the thin disk, or a member ofthe thick disk of the galaxy, with an age 10-11 gyr. the warmer white dwarfsappear to have velocities typical of the thick disk or even halo; these may bevery old remnants of low-mass stars, or they may be relatively young thin diskobjects with unusually high space motion.
