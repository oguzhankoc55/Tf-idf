0902.1527	astro2010 decadal survey whitepaper: coordinated science in the  gravitational and electromagnetic skies	it is widely expected that the coming decade will witness the first directdetection of gravitational waves (gws). the ground-based ligo and virgo gwobservatories are being upgraded to advanced sensitivity, and are expected toobserve a significant binary merger rate. the launch of the laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) would extend the gw window to lowfrequencies, opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (m &gt;~10^5 m_sun) black holes. gw events are likely to be accompanied byelectromagnetic (em) counterparts and, since information carriedelectromagnetically is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a greatdeal can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes possibleto measure both forms of radiation in concert. measurements of this kind willmark the dawn of trans-spectral astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectralbands of information. the aim of this whitepaper is to articulate futuredirections in both theory and observation that are likely to impact broadastrophysical inquiries of general interest. what will em observations reflecton the nature and diversity of gw sources? can gw sources be exploited ascomplementary probes of cosmology? what cross-facility coordination will expandthe science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic observations?

0706.2364	super star cluster ngc1705-1: a local analogue to the birthsite of  long-duration gamma-ray bursts	recent observations suggest that global properties of the host galaxies forlong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are particularly well-suited for creatingthe massive star progenitors of these grbs. motivated by the hypothesis thatmassive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies area natural birthsite for grb progenitors, we present a comparison study of theism properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, ngc1705-1,and those in distant grb hosts. using the same set of metal transitions in theuv and applying known ism structures in ngc1705, we find that ngc1705-1resembles distant grb host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, lowmolecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dustdepletion. the lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced uv radiation fieldin the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for grbprogenitors. in addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds atr&lt;500 pc from ngc1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of c^+, si^+, and fe^+ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow uv radiation field toproduce excited lines commonly seen in grb host ism. we further argue that theapparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionizationtransitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers importantclues for related starburst episodes in grb host galaxies. our study shows thata statistical comparison between the ism around star clusters and high-redshiftgrb progenitors is important for identifying the key physical parameters thatfacilitate the formation of grbs.

0902.3981	the impact of the astro2010 recommendations on variable star science	the next decade of survey astronomy has the potential to transform ourknowledge of variable stars. stellar variability underpins our knowledge of thecosmological distance ladder, and provides direct tests of stellar formationand evolution theory. variable stars can also be used to probe the fundamentalphysics of gravity and degenerate material in ways that are otherwiseimpossible in the laboratory. the computational and engineering advances of thepast decade have made large-scale, time-domain surveys an immediate reality.some surveys proposed for the next decade promise to gather more data than inthe prior cumulative history of astronomy. the actual implementation of thesesurveys will have broad implications for the types of science that will beenabled. we examine the design considerations for an optimal time-domainphotometric survey dedicated to variable star science, including: observingcadence, wavelength coverage, photometric and astrometric accuracy,single-epoch and cumulative depth, overall sky coverage, and data access by thebroader astronomical community. the best surveys must combine aspects from eachof these considerations to fully realize the potential for the next decade oftime-domain science.

0906.5355	exploring the optical transient sky with the palomar transient factory	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a wide-field experiment designed toinvestigate the optical transient and variable sky on time scales from minutesto years. ptf uses the cfh12k mosaic camera, with a field of view of 7.9 deg^2and a plate scale of 1 asec/pixel, mounted on the the palomar observatory48-inch samuel oschin telescope. the ptf operation strategy is devised to probethe existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for theoreticallypredicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such as fallback supernovae,macronovae, .ia supernovae and the orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. ptfwill also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmicvariables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei,and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics(through rr lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-earthobjects). the lessons that can be learned from ptf will be essential for thepreparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the large synoptic surveytelescope. in this paper we present the scientific motivation for ptf anddescribe in detail the goals and expectations for this experiment.

0908.0030	limits on radioactive-powered emission associated with a short-hard grb  070724a in a star-forming galaxy	we present results of an extensive observing campaign of the short duration,hard spectrum gamma-ray burst (grb) 070724a, aimed at detecting theradioactively-powered emission that might follow from a binary merger orcollapse involving compact objects. our multi-band observations span the rangein time over which this so-called li-paczynski mini-supernova could be active,beginning within 3 hours of the grb trigger, and represent some of the deepestand most comprehensive searches for such emission. we find no evidence for suchactivity and place limits on the abundances and the lifetimes of the possibleradioactive nuclides that could form in the rapid decompression ofnuclear-density matter. furthermore, our limits are significantly fainter thanthe peak magnitude of any previously detected broad-lined type ic supernova(sn) associated with other grbs, effectively ruling out a long grb-like sn forwith this event. given the unambiguous redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.456),grb 070724a represents one of a small, but growing, number of short-hard grbsfor which firm physical/restframe quantities currently exist. the host of grb070724a is a moderately star-forming galaxy with an older stellar populationcomponent and a relatively high metallicity of 12+log(o/h)_kd02=9.1. we find nosignificant evidence for large amounts of extinction along the line of sightthat could mask the presence of a sn explosion and estimate a small probabilityfor chance alignment with the putative host. we discuss how our derivedconstraints fit into the evolving picture of short-hard grbs, their potentialprogenitors, and the host environments in which they are thought to beproduced.

0909.4792	discovery of precursor lbv outbursts in two recent optical transients:  the fitfully variable missing links ugc 2773-ot and sn 2009ip	we present progenitor-star detections, light curves, and optical spectra ofsn2009ip and the 2009 optical transient in ugc2773 (u2773-ot), which were notgenuine sne. precursor variability in the decade before outburst indicates thatboth of the progenitor stars were lbvs. their pre-outburst light curvesresemble the s doradus phases that preceded giant eruptions of eta carinae andsn1954j (v12 in ngc2403), with intermediate progenitor luminosities. hstdetections a decade before discovery indicate that the sn2009ip and u2773-otprogenitors were supergiants with likely initial masses of 50-80 msun and$\ga$20 msun, respectively. both outbursts had spectra befitting known lbvs,although in different physical states. sn 2009ip exhibited a hot lbv spectrumwith characteristic speeds of 550 km/s, plus faster material up to 5000 km/s,resembling the slow homunculus and fast blast wave of eta carinae. u2773-otshows a forest of narrow absorption and emission lines comparable to that of sdor in its cool state, plus [caii] emission and an ir excess indicative ofdust, similar to sn2008s and n300-ot. [caii] emission is probably tied to adusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. sn2009ip andu2773-ot may provide a critical link between historical lbv eruptions, whileu2773-ot may provide a link between lbvs and sn2008s and n300-ot. futuresearches will uncover more examples of precursor lbv variability of this kind,providing key clues that may help unravel the instability driving lbvs.

1008.3143	optimal time-series selection of quasars	we present a novel method for the optimal selection of quasars usingtime-series observations in a single photometric bandpass. utilizing the dampedrandom walk model of kelly et al.

1101.1959	on machine-learned classification of variable stars with sparse and  noisy time-series data	with the coming data deluge from synoptic surveys, there is a growing needfor frameworks that can quickly and automatically produce calibratedclassification probabilities for newly-observed variables based on a smallnumber of time-series measurements. in this paper, we introduce a methodologyfor variable-star classification, drawing from modern machine-learningtechniques. we describe how to homogenize the information gleaned from lightcurves by selection and computation of real-numbered metrics ("feature"),detail methods to robustly estimate periodic light-curve features, introducetree-ensemble methods for accurate variable star classification, and show howto rigorously evaluate the classification results using cross validation. on a25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable stars, we achieve a 22.8%overall classification error using the random forest classifier; thisrepresents a 24% improvement over the best previous classifier on these data.this methodology is effective for identifying samples of specific scienceclasses: for pulsational variables used in milky way tomography we obtain adiscovery efficiency of 98.2% and for eclipsing systems we find an efficiencyof 99.1%, both at 95% purity. we show that the random forest (rf) classifier issuperior to other machine-learned methods in terms of accuracy, speed, andrelative immunity to features with no useful class information; the rfclassifier can also be used to estimate the importance of each feature inclassification. additionally, we present the first astronomical use ofhierarchical classification methods to incorporate a known class taxonomy inthe classifier, which further reduces the catastrophic error rate to 7.8%.excluding low-amplitude sources, our overall error rate improves to 14%, with acatastrophic error rate of 3.5%.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1104.3142	data mining and machine-learning in time-domain discovery &amp;  classification	the changing heavens have played a central role in the scientific effort ofastronomers for centuries. galileo's synoptic observations of the moons ofjupiter and the phases of venus starting in 1610, provided strong refutation ofptolemaic cosmology. in more modern times, the discovery of a relationshipbetween period and luminosity in some pulsational variable stars led to theinference of the size of the milky way, the distance scale to the nearestgalaxies, and the expansion of the universe. distant explosions of supernovaewere used to uncover the existence of dark energy and provide a precisenumerical account of dark matter. indeed, time-domain observations of transientevents and variable stars, as a technique, influences a broad diversity ofpursuits in the entire astronomy endeavor. while, at a fundamental level, thenature of the scientific pursuit remains unchanged, the advent of astronomy asa data-driven discipline presents fundamental challenges to the way in whichthe scientific process must now be conducted. digital images (and data cubes)are not only getting larger, there are more of them. on logistical grounds,this taxes storage and transport systems. but it also implies that the intimateconnection that astronomers have always enjoyed with their data---fromcollection to processing to analysis to inference---necessarily must evolve.the pathway to scientific inference is now influenced (if not driven by) modernautomation processes, computing, data-mining and machine learning. the emergingreliance on computation and machine learning is a general one, but thetime-domain aspect of the data and the objects of interest presents some uniquechallenges, which we describe and explore in this chapter.

1105.0055	mid-infrared period-luminosity relations of rr lyrae stars derived from  the wise preliminary data release	interstellar dust presents a significant challenge to extendingparallax-determined distances of optically observed pulsational variables tolarger volumes. distance ladder work at mid-infrared wavebands, where dusteffects are negligible and metallicity correlations are minimized, have beenlargely focused on few-epoch cepheid studies. here we present the firstdetermination of mid-infrared period-luminosity (pl) relations of rr lyraestars from phase-resolved imaging using the preliminary data release of thewide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). we present a novel statisticalframework to predict posterior distances of 76 well-observed rr lyrae that usesthe optically constructed prior distance moduli while simultaneously imposing apower-law pl relation to wise-determined mean magnitudes. we find that theabsolute magnitude in the bluest wise filter is m_w1 = (-0.421+-0.014) -(1.681+-0.147)*log(p/0.50118 day), with no evidence for a correlation withmetallicity. combining the results from the three bluest wise filters, we findthat a typical star in our sample has a distance measurement uncertainty of0.97% (statistical) plus 1.17% (systematic). we do not fundamentalize theperiods of rrc stars to improve their fit to the relations. taking thehipparcos-derived mean v-band magnitudes, we use the distance posteriors todetermine a new optical metallicity-luminosity relation which we present insection 5. the results of this analysis will soon be tested by hst parallaxmeasurements and, eventually, with the gaia astrometric mission.

1106.2832	active learning to overcome sample selection bias: application to  photometric variable star classification	despite the great promise of machine-learning algorithms to classify andpredict astrophysical parameters for the vast numbers of astrophysical sourcesand transients observed in large-scale surveys, the peculiarities of thetraining data often manifest as strongly biased predictions on the data ofinterest. typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys ofbrighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys(testing data). this sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors inpredictions on the testing data because a) standard assumptions formachine-learned model selection procedures break down and b) dense regions oftesting space might be completely devoid of training data. we explore possibleremedies to sample selection bias, including importance weighting (iw),co-training (ct), and active learning (al). we argue that al---where the datawhose inclusion in the training set would most improve predictions on thetesting set are queried for manual follow-up---is an effective approach and isappropriate for many astronomical applications. for a variable starclassification problem on a well-studied set of stars from hipparcos and ogle,al is the optimal method in terms of error rate on the testing data, beatingthe off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4% and the other proposed methods by at least3.0%. to aid with manual labeling of variable stars, we developed a webinterface which allows for easy light curve visualization and querying ofexternal databases. finally, we apply active learning to classify variablestars in the asas survey, finding dramatic improvement in our agreement withthe acvs catalog, from 65.5% to 79.5%, and a significant increase in theclassifier's average confidence for the testing set, from 14.6% to 42.9%, aftera few al iterations.

1106.3570	the palomar transient factory orion project: eclipsing binaries and  young stellar objects	the palomar transient factory (ptf) orion project is an experiment within thebroader ptf survey, a systematic automated exploration of the sky for opticaltransients. taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the ptfcamera at the palomar 48" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in december2009-january 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry ona single field containing the young (7-10myr) 25 ori association. the primarymotivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in thisregion. the unique data set also provides for much ancillary science. in thisfirst paper we describe the survey and data reduction pipeline, and presentinitial results from an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relatingto two of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing binaries andyoung stellar objects. we find 82 new eclipsing binary systems, 9 of which weare candidate 25 ori- or orion ob1a-association members. of these, 2 arepotential young w uma type systems. we report on the possible low-mass (m-dwarfprimary) eclipsing systems in the sample, which include 6 of the candidateyoung systems. 45 of the binary systems are close (mainly contact) systems; oneshows an orbital period among the shortest known for w uma binaries, at0.2156509 \pm 0.0000071d, with flat-bottomed primary eclipses, and a deriveddistance consistent with membership in the general orion association. one ofthe candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhapsrepresenting a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-mass primary ora star with a warped disk, and may represent an additional young orion member.finally, we identify 14 probable new classical t-tauri stars in our data, alongwith one previously known (cvso 35) and one previously reported as a candidateweak-line t-tauri star (sdss j052700.12+010136.8).

1107.5307	swift j2058.4+0516: discovery of a possible second relativistic tidal  disruption flare?	we report the discovery by the swift hard x-ray monitor of the transientsource swift j2058.4+0516 (sw j2058+05). our multi-wavelength follow-upcampaign uncovered a long-lived (duration &gt;~ months), luminous x-ray (l_x,iso ~3 x 10^47 erg s^-1) and radio (nu l_nu,iso ~ 10^42 erg s^-1) counterpart. theassociated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dustextinction in the host galaxy. based on numerous similarities with the recentlydiscovered grb 110328a / swift j164449.3+573451 (sw j1644+57), we suggest thatsw j2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outburstsresulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. ifso, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate oftidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowlycollimated (theta &lt; 1 degree), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptionsgenerate relativistic ejecta. analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-raybursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the blackhole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component.alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus[agn]), sw j2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in thesesources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with knownclasses of agns capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxies).

1108.2868	sn2010jp (ptf10aaxi): a jet-driven type ii supernova	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar typeii supernova (sn)2010jp, also named ptf10aaxi. the light curve exhibits a linear decline with arelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactivedecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003$m_{\odot}$. spectra of sn2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peakedh$\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component thatsuggests shock interaction with dense csm; (2) high-velocity blue and redemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wingsextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. these features persist during 100 daysafter explosion. we propose that this line profile indicates a bipolarjet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal sn ejectaand csm interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broadline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. two variations of the jetinterpretation seem plausible: (1) a fast jet mixes 56ni to high velocities inpolar zones of the h-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jetproduces blue and red bumps in balmer lines when a jet interacts with densecsm. jet-driven sneii are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide rangeof initial masses above 25 $m_{\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. this seemsconsistent with the sn host environment, which is either an extremelylow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair ofstar-forming galaxies. it also seems consistent with the low 56ni mass that mayaccompany black hole formation. we speculate that the jet survives to produceobservable signatures because the star's h envelope was mostly stripped away byprevious eruptive mass loss.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1111.0966	a compact degenerate primary-star progenitor of sn 2011fe	while a white dwarf is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausibleprimary star in type ia supernova (sn ia), many other candidates have not beenformally ruled out. shock energy deposited in the envelope of any explodingprimary contributes to the early sn brightness and, since this radiation energyis degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity dependson the initial primary radius. we present a new non-detection limit of thenearby sn ia 2011fe, obtained what appears to be just 4 hours after explosion,allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius, r_p. coupled withthe non-detection of a quiescent x-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesizedni mass, we show that r_p &lt;~ 0.02 r_sun (a factor of 5 smaller than previouslyinferred), that the average density of the primary must be rho_p &gt; 10,000 gmcm^{-3}, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few x 10^5 k.this rules out hydrogen burning main sequence stars and giants. constructingthe helium-burning main sequence and carbon-burning main sequence, we find suchobjects are also excluded. by process of elimination, we find that onlydegeneracy-supported compact objects---wds and neutron stars---are viable asthe primary star of sn 2011fe. with few caveats, we also restrict the companion(secondary) star radius to r_ c &lt;~ 0.1 r_sun, excluding roche-lobe overflowingred giant and main-sequence companions to high significance.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1112.3654	rapid, machine-learned resource allocation: application to high-redshift  grb follow-up	as the number of observed gamma-ray bursts (grbs) continues to grow,follow-up resources need to be used more efficiently in order to maximizescience output from limited telescope time. as such, it is becomingincreasingly important to rapidly identify bursts of interest as soon aspossible after the event, before the afterglows fade beyond detectability.studying the most distant (highest redshift) events, for instance, remains aprimary goal for many in the field. here we present our random forest automatedtriage estimator for grb redshifts (rate grb-z) for rapid identification ofhigh-redshift candidates using early-time metrics from the three telescopesonboard swift. while the basic rate methodology is generalizable to a number ofresource allocation problems, here we demonstrate its utility fortelescope-constrained follow-up efforts with the primary goal to identify andstudy high-z grbs. for each new grb, rate grb-z provides a recommendation -based on the available telescope time - of whether the event warrantsadditional follow-up resources. we train rate grb-z using a set consisting of135 swift bursts with known redshifts, only 18 of which are z &gt; 4.cross-validated performance metrics on this training data suggest that ~56% ofhigh-z bursts can be captured from following up the top 20% of the rankedcandidates, and ~84% of high-z bursts are identified after following up the top~40% of candidates. we further use the method to rank 200+ swift bursts withunknown redshifts according to their likelihood of being high-z.

1201.4863	optimizing automated classification of periodic variable stars in new  synoptic surveys	efficient and automated classification of periodic variable stars is becomingincreasingly important as the scale of astronomical surveys grows. severalrecent papers have used methods from machine learning and statistics toconstruct classifiers on databases of labeled, multi--epoch sources with theintention of using these classifiers to automatically infer the classes ofunlabeled sources from new surveys. however, the same source observed with twodifferent synoptic surveys will generally yield different derived metrics(features) from the light curve. since such features are used in classifiers,this survey-dependent mismatch in feature space will typically lead to degradedclassifier performance. in this paper we show how and why feature distributionschange using ogle and \textit{hipparcos} light curves. to overcome surveysystematics, we apply a method, \textit{noisification}, which attempts toempirically match distributions of features between the labeled sources used toconstruct the classifier and the unlabeled sources we wish to classify. resultsfrom simulated and real--world light curves show that noisification cansignificantly improve classifier performance. in a three--class problem usinglight curves from \textit{hipparcos} and ogle, noisification reduces theclassifier error rate from 27.0% to 7.0%. we recommend that noisification beused for upcoming surveys such as gaia and lsst and describe some of thepromises and challenges of applying noisification to these surveys.

1202.2128	berkeley supernova ia program i: observations, data reduction, and  spectroscopic sample of 582 low-redshift type ia supernovae	in this first paper in a series we present 1298 low-redshift (z\leq0.2)optical spectra of 582 type ia supernovae (sne ia) observed from 1989 through2008 as part of the berkeley sn ia program (bsnip). 584 spectra of 199 sne iahave well-calibrated light curves with measured distance moduli, and many ofthe spectra have been corrected for host-galaxy contamination. most of the datawere obtained using the kast double spectrograph mounted on the shane 3 mtelescope at lick observatory and have a typical wavelength range of3300-10,400 ang., roughly twice as wide as spectra from most previouslypublished datasets. we present our observing and reduction procedures, and wedescribe the resulting sn database (sndb), which will be an online, public,searchable database containing all of our fully reduced spectra and companionphotometry. in addition, we discuss our spectral classification scheme (usingthe supernova identification code, snid; blondin &amp; tonry 2007), utilising ournewly constructed set of snid spectral templates. these templates allow us toaccurately classify our entire dataset, and by doing so we are able toreclassify a handful of objects as bona fide sne ia and a few other objects asmembers of some of the peculiar sn ia subtypes. in fact, our dataset includesspectra of nearly 90 spectroscopically peculiar sne ia. we also presentspectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts of some sne ia where these values werepreviously unknown.

1202.3990	a bayesian approach to calibrating period-luminosity relations of rr  lyrae stars in the mid-infrared	a bayesian approach to calibrating period-luminosity (pl) relations hassubstantial benefits over generic least-squares fits. in particular, thebayesian approach takes into account the full prior distribution of the modelparameters, such as the a priori distances, and refits these parameters as partof the process of settling on the most highly-constrained final fit.additionally, the bayesian approach can naturally ingest data from multiplewavebands and simultaneously fit the parameters of pl relations for eachwaveband in a procedure that constrains the parameter posterior distributionsso as to minimize the scatter of the final fits appropriately in all wavebands.here we describe the generalized approach to bayesian model fitting and thenspecialize to a detailed description of applying bayesian linear model fittingto the mid-infrared pl relations of rr lyrae variable stars. for this exampleapplication we quantify the improvement afforded by using a bayesian model fit.we also compare distances previously predicted in our example application torecently published parallax distances measured with the hubble space telescopeand find their agreement to be a vindication of our methodology. our intentwith this article is to spread awareness of the benefits and applicability ofthis bayesian approach and encourage future pl relation investigations toconsider employing this powerful analysis method.

1204.4180	construction of a calibrated probabilistic classification catalog:  application to 50k variable sources in the all-sky automated survey	with growing data volumes from synoptic surveys, astronomers must become moreabstracted from the discovery and introspection processes. given the scarcityof follow-up resources, there is a particularly sharp onus on the frameworksthat replace these human roles to provide accurate and well-calibratedprobabilistic classification catalogs. such catalogs inform the subsequentfollow-up, allowing consumers to optimize the selection of specific sources forfurther study and permitting rigorous treatment of purities and efficienciesfor population studies. here, we describe a process to produce a probabilisticclassification catalog of variability with machine learning from a multi-epochphotometric survey. in addition to producing accurate classifications, we showhow to estimate calibrated class probabilities, and motivate the importance ofprobability calibration. we also introduce a methodology for feature-basedanomaly detection, which allows discovery of objects in the survey that do notfit within the predefined class taxonomy. finally, we apply these methods tosources observed by the all sky automated survey (asas), and unveil themachine-learned asas classification catalog (macc), which is a 28-classprobabilistic classification catalog of 50,124 asas sources. we estimate thatmacc achieves a sub-20% classification error rate, and demonstrate that theclass posterior probabilities are reasonably calibrated. macc classificationscompare favorably to the classifications of several previous domain-specificasas papers and to the asas catalog of variable stars, which had classifiedonly 24% of those sources into one of 12 science classes. the macc is publiclyavailable at http://www.bigmacc.info.

1206.1510	the ptf orion project: a possible planet transiting a t-tauri star	we report observations of a possible young transiting planet orbiting apreviously known weak-lined t-tauri star in the 7-10 myr old orion-ob1a/25-oriregion. the candidate was found as part of the palomar transient factory (ptf)orion project. it has a photometric transit period of 0.448413 +- 0.000040days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 ptf data. follow-up low-precisionradial velocity (rv) observations and adaptive optics imaging suggest that thestar is not an eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a backgroundsource is blended with the target and mimicking the observed transit. rvobservations with the hobby-eberly and keck telescopes yield an rv that has thesame period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transitcenter by approximately -0.22 periods. the amplitude (half range) of the rvvariations is 2.4 km/s and is comparable with the expected rv amplitude thatstellar spots could induce. the rv curve is likely dominated by stellar spotmodulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of m_psin i_orb &lt; 4.8 +- 1.2 m_jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, iorb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we findan upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of m_p &lt; 5.5 +- 1.4m_jup. this limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,its roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active massloss and evaporation.

0711.2068	type ia supernovae are good standard candles in the near infrared:  evidence from pairitel	we have obtained 1087 nir (jhks) measurements of 21 sne ia using pairitel,nearly doubling the number of well-sampled nir sn ia light curves. these datastrengthen the evidence that sne ia are excellent standard candles in the nir,even without correction for optical light-curve shape. we construct fiducialnir templates for normal sne ia from our sample, excluding only the three knownpeculiar sne ia: sn 2005bl, sn 2005hk, and sn 2005ke. the h-band absolutemagnitudes in this sample of 18 sne ia have an intrinsic rms of only 0.15 magwith no correction for light-curve shape. we found a relationship between theh-band extinction and optical color excess of ah=0.2e(b-v). this variation isas small as the scatter in distance modulus measurements currently used forcosmology based on optical light curves after corrections for light-curveshape. combining the homogeneous pairitel measurements with 23 sne ia from theliterature, these 41 sne ia have standard h-band magnitudes with an rms scatterof 0.16 mag. the good match of our sample with the literature sample suggeststhere are few systematic problems with the photometry. we present a nearby nirhubble diagram that shows no correlation of the residuals from the hubble linewith light-curve properties. future samples that account for optical and nirlight-curve shapes, absorption, spectroscopic variation, or host-galaxyproperties may reveal effective ways to improve the use of sne ia as distanceindicators. since systematic errors due to dust absorption in optical bandsremain the leading difficulty in the cosmological use of supernovae, the goodbehavior of sn ia nir light curves and their relative insensitivity toreddening make these objects attractive candidates for future cosmologicalwork.

1209.3775	using machine learning for discovery in synoptic survey imaging	modern time-domain surveys continuously monitor large swaths of the sky tolook for astronomical variability. astrophysical discovery in such data sets iscomplicated by the fact that detections of real transient and variable sourcesare highly outnumbered by bogus detections caused by imperfect subtractions,atmospheric effects and detector artefacts. in this work we present a machinelearning (ml) framework for discovery of variability in time-domain imagingsurveys. our ml methods provide probabilistic statements, in near real time,about the degree to which each newly observed source is astrophysicallyrelevant source of variable brightness. we provide details about each of theanalysis steps involved, including compilation of the training and testingsets, construction of descriptive image-based and contextual features, andoptimization of the feature subset and model tuning parameters. using avalidation set of nearly 30,000 objects from the palomar transient factory, wedemonstrate a missed detection rate of at most 7.7% at our chosenfalse-positive rate of 1% for an optimized ml classifier of 23 features,selected to avoid feature correlation and over-fitting from an initial libraryof 42 attributes. importantly, we show that our classification methodology isinsensitive to mis-labelled training data up to a contamination of nearly 10%,making it easier to compile sufficient training sets for accurate performancein future surveys. this ml framework, if so adopted, should enable themaximization of scientific gain from future synoptic survey and enable fastfollow-up decisions on the vast amounts of streaming data produced by suchexperiments.

1210.0020	late time radio emission from x-ray selected tidal disruption events	we present new observations with the karl g. jansky very large array of sevenx-ray-selected tidal disruption events (tdes). the radio observations werecarried out between 9 and 22 years after the initial x-ray discovery, and,thus, probe the late-time formation of relativistic jets and jet interactionswith the interstellar medium in these systems. we detect a compact radio sourcein the nucleus of the galaxy ic 3599 and a compact radio source that is apossible counterpart to rx j1420.4+5334. we find no radio counterparts for fiveother sources with flux density upper limits between 51 and 200 microjy (3sigma). if the detections truly represent late radio emission associated with atde, then our results suggest that a fraction &gt;~ 10% of x-ray-detected tdes areaccompanied by relativistic jets. we explore several models for producing lateradio emission, including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclearenvironment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of the jet itself.upper limits on the radio flux density from archival observations suggest thatthe jet formation may have been delayed for years after the tde, possiblytriggered by the accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of ~10^{-2} -- 10^{-3} mdot_edd. the non-detections are also consistent with thisscenario; deeper radio observations can determine whether relativistic jets arepresent in these systems. the emission from rx j1420.4+5334 is also consistentwith the predictions of the blast wave model, however the radio emission fromic 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its spectral slope is too flat,relative to the blast wave model expectations. future radio monitoring of ic3599 and rx j1420.4+5334 will help to better constrain the nature of the jetsin these systems.

1210.4550	millions of multiples: detecting and characterizing close-separation  binary systems in synoptic sky surveys	the direct detection of binary systems in wide-field surveys is limited bythe size of the stars' point-spread-functions (psfs). a search for elongatedobjects can find closer companions, but is limited by the precision to whichthe psf shape can be calibrated for individual stars. we have developed thebinaryfinder algorithm to search for close binaries by using precisionmeasurements of psf ellipticity across wide-field survey images. we show thatthe algorithm is capable of reliably detecting binary systems down toapproximately 1/5 of the seeing limit, and can directly measure the systems'position angles, separations and contrast ratios. to verify the algorithm'sperformance we evaluated 100,000 objects in palomar transient factory (ptf)wide-field-survey data for signs of binarity, and then used the robo-ao roboticlaser adaptive optics system to verify the parameters of 44 high-confidencetargets. we show that binaryfinder correctly predicts the presence of closecompanions with a &lt;5% false-positive rate, measures the detected binaries'position angles within 2 degrees and separations within 25%, and weaklyconstrains their contrast ratios. when applied to the full ptf dataset, weestimate that binaryfinder will discover and characterize ~450,000physically-associated binary systems with separations &lt;2 arcseconds andmagnitudes brighter than r=18. new wide-field synoptic surveys with highsensitivity and sub-arcsecond angular resolution, such as lsst, will allowbinaryfinder to reliably detect millions of very faint binary systems withseparations as small as 0.1 arcseconds.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1304.4236	discovery of a cosmological, relativistic outburst via its rapidly  fading optical emission	we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory (ptf) of thetransient source ptf11agg, which is distinguished by three primarycharacteristics: (1) bright, rapidly fading optical transient emission; (2) afaint, blue quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long,scintillating radio transient. we argue that these observed properties areinconsistent with any known class of galactic transients, and instead suggest acosmological origin. the detection of incoherent radio emission at suchdistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence ofrelativistic ejecta. the observed properties are all consistent with thepopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), marking the first timesuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of ahigh-energy trigger. we searched for possible high-energy counterparts toptf11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. we thereforeconsider three possible scenarios to account for a grb-like afterglow without ahigh-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" grb (lack of satellite coverage), an"orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressedhigh-energy emission). the observed optical and radio light curves appearinconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglowmodels. the simplest explanation, then, is that ptf11agg is a normal, on-axislong-duration grb for which the associated high-energy emission was simplymissed. however, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitousdiscovery by ptf and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). while notdefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that ptf11agg may represent a new, morecommon (&gt; 4 times the on-axis grb rate at 90% confidence) class of relativisticoutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

(2) anir echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existingdust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to haveejected another 10 msun shell about 1500 yr before the sn.

0802.3396	generalized tests for selection effects in grb high-energy correlations	several correlations among parameters derived from modelling the high-energyproperties of grbs have been reported. we show that well-known examples ofthese have common features indicative of strong contamination by selectioneffects. we focus here on the impact of detector threshold truncation on thespectral peak versus isotropic equivalent energy release ($e_{\rm pk}$-$e_{\rmiso}$) relation, extended to a large sample of 218 swift and 56 hete-2 grbswith and without measured redshift. the existence of faint swift events missingfrom pre-swift surveys calls into question inferences based on pre-swiftsurveys which must be subject to complicated incompleteness effects. wedemonstrate a generalized method for treating data truncation in correlationanalyses and apply this method to swift and pre-swift data. also, we show thatthe $e_{\rm pk}$-$e_{\gamma}$ ("ghirlanda") correlation is effectivelyindependent of the grb redshifts, which suggests its existence has little to dowith intrinsic physics. we suggest that a physically-based correlation,manifest observationally, must show significantly reduced scatter in the restframe relative to the observer frame and must not persist if the assumedredshifts are scattered. as with the $e_{\rm pk}$-$e_{\gamma}$ correlation, wefind that the pre-swift, bright grb $e_{\rm pk}$-$e_{\rm iso}$ correlation of\citet{amati06} does not rigorously satisfy these conditions.

1404.4870	towards precision distances and 3d dust maps using broadband  period--magnitude relations of rr lyrae stars	we determine the period-magnitude relations of rr lyrae stars in 13photometric bandpasses from 0.4 to 12 {\mu}m using timeseries observations of134 stars. the bayesian formalism, extended from our previous work to includethe effects of line-of-sight dust extinction, allows for the simultaneousinference of the posterior distribution of the mean absolute magnitude, slopeof the period-magnitude power-law, and intrinsic scatter about a perfectpower-law for each bandpass. in addition, the distance modulus andline-of-sight dust extinction to each rr lyrae star in the calibration sampleis determined, yielding a sample median fractional distance error of 0.66%. theintrinsic scatter in all bands appears to be larger than the photometricerrors, except in wise w1 (3.4 {\mu}m) and w2 (4.6 {\mu}m) where thephotometric error ($\sigma \approx 0.05$ mag) is to be comparable or largerthan the intrinsic scatter. additional observations at these wavelengths couldimprove the inferred distances to these sources further. as an application ofthe methodology, we infer the distance to the rrc-type star rzcep at lowgalactic latitude ($b = 5.5^\circ$) to be $\mu=8.0397\pm0.0123$ mag($405.4\pm2.3$ pc) with colour excess $e(b-v)=0.2461\pm0.0089$ mag. thisdistance, equivalent to a parallax of $2467\pm14$ microarcsec, is consistentwith the published hst parallax measurement but with an uncertainty that is 13times smaller than the hst measurement. if our measurements (and methodology)hold up to scrutiny, the distances to these stars have been determined to anaccuracy comparable to those expected with gaia. as rr lyrae are one of theprimary components of the cosmic distance ladder, the achievement of sub-1%distance errors within a formalism that accounts for dust extinction may beconsidered a strong buttressing of the path to eventual 1% uncertainties inhubble's constant.

astro-ph;0102371	the prompt energy release of gamma-ray bursts using a cosmological  k-correction	the fluences of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are measured with a variety ofinstruments in different detector energy ranges. a detailed comparison of theimplied energy releases of the grb sample requires, then, an accurateaccounting of this diversity in fluence measurements which properly correctsfor the redshifting of grb spectra. here, we develop a methodology to``k-correct'' the implied prompt energy release of a grb to a fixed co-movingbandpass. this allows us to homogenize the prompt energy release of 17cosmological grbs (using published redshifts, fluences, and spectra) to twocommon co-moving bandpasses: 20-2000 kev and 0.1 kev-10 mev (``bolometric'').while the overall distribution of grb energy releases does not changesignificantly by using a k-correction, we show that uncorrected energyestimates systematically undercounts the bolometric energy by ~5% to 600%,depending on the particular grb. we find that the median bolometricisotropic-equivalent prompt energy release is 2.2 x 10^{53} erg with an r.m.s.scatter of 0.80 dex. the typical estimated uncertainty on a given k-correctedenergy measurement is ~20%.

astro-ph;0301028	toward an understanding of the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts	the various possibilities for the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (grbs)manifest in differing observable properties. through deep spectroscopic andhigh-resolution imaging observations of some grb hosts, i demonstrate thatwell-localized long-duration grbs are connected with otherwise normalstar-forming galaxies at moderate redshifts of order unity. i test variousprogenitor scenarios by examining the offset distribution of grbs about theirapparent hosts, making extensive use of ground-based optical data from keck andpalomar and space-based imaging from the hubble space telescope. the offsetdistribution appears to be inconsistent with the coalescing neutron star binaryhypothesis but statistically consistent with a population of progenitors thatclosely traces the ultra-violet light of galaxies. this is naturally explainedby bursts which originate from the collapse of massive stars. this claim isfurther supported by the unambiguous detections of emission ''bumps'' which canbe explained as supernovae that occur at approximately the same time as theassociated grb; if true, grb 980326 and grb 011121 provide strong observationalevidence connecting cosmological grbs to high-redshift supernovae and implicatemassive stars as the progenitors of some long-duration grbs. interestingly,most alternative models of these bumps require wind-stratified circumburstmedia; this too, implicates massive stars. in addition to this work, i alsoconstructed the jacobs camera (jcam), a dual-beam optical camera for thepalomar 200-inch telescope designed to follow-up rapid grb localizations(abridged).

astro-ph;0408413	towards a more standardized candle using grb energetics and spectra	the use of grb energetics for cosmography has long been advanced as a meansto probe out to high redshifts, to the epoch of deceleration. however, theprompt energy release in grbs, even when corrected for jetting geometry, is farfrom being a standard candle. we explore the cosmographic potential of a grbstandard candle based on the newly-discovered relation by ghirlanda et al.between the apparent geometry-corrected energies (e_gamma) and the peak of theprompt burst spectrum (e_p). we present an explicit, self-consistent formalismfor correcting grb energies with a thorough accounting for observationaluncertainties. in contrast to other work, we demonstrate that the currentsample of 19 grbs is not yet cosmographically competitive with results fromother studies (e.g., sne ia). although the e_p-e_gamma relation is asignificant correlation across a range of cosmologies, the goodness of fit ofthe data to a power law, depends strongly on input assumptions -- especiallythe unknown density of the circumburst medium. independent of assumptions, withvery few low-z bursts, the current sample is most sensitive to omega_m butessentially insensitive to omega_lambda. the proper use of the relation clearlybrings grbs an impressive step closer toward a standardizable candle, but untilthe physical origin of the e_p-e_gamma relation is understood, calibrated witha training set of low redshift bursts, and the major potential systematicuncertainties and selection effects are addressed, we urge caution concerningclaims of the utility of grbs for cosmography (abridged).

astro-ph;0502559	present and future prospects for grb standard candles	following our previous work, we conclude that a grb standard candleconstructed from the ghirlanda et al. power-law relation between thegeometry-corrected energy (e_gamma) and the peak of the rest-frame prompt burstspectrum (e_p) is not yet cosmographically useful, despite holding somepotential advantages over sne ia. this is due largely to the small sample of\~20 grbs with the required measured redshifts, jet-breaks, and peak energies,and to the strong sensitivity of the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to inputassumptions. the most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to thegenerally unknown density (and density profile), of the circumburst medium.although the e_p-e_gamma relation is a highly significant correlation over manycosmologies, until the sample expands to include many low-z events, it will bemost sensitive to omega_m but essentially insensitive to omega_lambda and w,with some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z grb data alone. the relationclearly represents a significant improvement in the search for an empirical grbstandard candle, but is further hindered by an unknown physical basis for therelation, the lack of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in acosmology-independent way, and several major potential systematic uncertaintiesand selection effects. until these concerns are addressed, a larger sample isacquired, and attempts are made to marginalize or perform monte carlosimulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge caution concerningclaims of the utility of grbs for cosmography and especially the attempts tocombine grbs with sne ia.

astro-ph;0608313	no supernovae associated with two long-duration gamma ray bursts	it is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are producedduring the collapse of a massive star. the standard "collapsar" model predictsthat a broad-lined and luminous type ic core-collapse supernova (sn)accompanies every long-duration grb. this association has been confirmed inobservations of several nearby grbs. here we present observations of two nearbylong-duration grbs that challenge this simple view. in the grbs 060505 and060614 we demonstrate that no sn emission accompanied these long-durationbursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal sn 1998bwthat accompanied grb 980425, and fainter than any type ic sn ever observed.multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of thehost galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and showthat the bursts originated in star-forming regions. the absence of a sn to suchdeep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long grbs andsuggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. from thesupplementary material: now we have observed sn-less grbs in star-formingregions, suggesting that a non-detection of a sn does not preclude a massiveprogenitor. the position of the grb, i.e. in a star-forming region or in anolder component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compactobjects and massive stars as progenitors. in fact, several host galaxies forshort grbs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxiesof long-duration grbs. the grb labels "long" and "short" have become synonymouswith "massive stars" and "other progenitors". these distinctions may need to berelaxed.

astro-ph;0611079	on the absence of wind signatures in grb afterglow spectra: constraints  on the wolf-rayet winds of grb progenitors	we investigate available constraints on the circumstellar medium (csm) aroundlong-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitors from afterglow spectra. wefirst establish a statistical sample of five grb afterglow spectra that havebeen collected and analyzed with no prior knowledge of the line-of-sightproperties. this sample is then adopted for a uniform search of wolf-rayet windsignatures, as represented by civ 1548, 1550 absorption doublets at dv=-1000 to-5000 km/s from the grbs (hereafter civ_{15}). we report the detection of asingle civ_{15} absorber at dv ~ -1500 km/s from grb 050730 and none in therest. our search yields an estimate of 20% for the incidence of civ_{15}absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent width ew(civ 1548)&gt;0.2 ang neargrb host galaxies, consistent with the incidence of intergalactic civ_{15} nearclassical damped lya absorbers toward quasar sightlines. including the twociv_{15} absorbers previously known toward grb 021004, we further demonstratethat the presence of h^0, c^+, and si^+ together with the absence of excitedc^+ or si^+ argue against a csm origin. the null result is consistent with theexpectation that the circumburst medium is fully ionized by the afterglowradiation field. we examine possible scenarios for the survival of the c^{3+}ions, including a clumpy wind model. we find that a clumpy wind is unable toeffectively shield the ionizing radiation and allow c^{3+} to survive at r&lt;10pc from the afterglow. we conclude that the lack of csm-originated civ_{15}absorbers is consistent with wolf-rayet winds terminating at &lt; 30 pc from theirprogenitor stars.

astro-ph;0612617	sn 2006gy: discovery of the most luminous supernova ever recorded,  powered by the death of an extremely massive star like eta carinae	(abridged) we report our discovery and observations of the peculiar type iinsupernova sn2006gy in ngc1260, revealing that it reached a peak magnitude of-22, making it the most luminous supernova ever recorded. it is not yet clearwhat powers the total radiated energy of 1e51 erg, but we argue that anymechanism -- thermal emission, circumstellar interaction, or 56ni decay --requires a very massive progenitor star. the circumstellar interactionhypothesis would require truly exceptional conditions around the star probablyexperienced an lbv eruption like the 19th century eruption of eta carinae.alternatively, radioactive decay of 56ni may be a less objectionablehypothesis. that power source would imply a large ni mass of 22 msun, requiringthat sn2006gy was a pair-instability supernova where the star's core wasobliterated. sn2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason tosuspect a pair-instability explosion. based on a number of lines of evidence,we rule out the hypothesis that sn 2006gy was a ``type iia'' event. instead, wepropose that the progenitor may have been a very massive evolved object likeeta carinae that, contrary to expectations, failed to completely shed itsmassive hydrogen envelope before it died. our interpretation of sn2006gyimplies that the most massive stars can explode earlier than expected, duringthe lbv phase, preventing them from ever becoming wolf-rayet stars. sn2006gyalso suggests that the most massive stars can create brilliant supernovaeinstead of dying ignominious deaths through direct collapse to a black hole.

astro-ph;0612621	multicolor infrared observations of sn 2006aj, the supernova associated  with xrf 060218 - paper i	we report simultaneous multicolor near-infrared (nir) observations of thesupernova associated with x-ray flash 060218 during the first 16 days after thehigh energy event. we find that the light curve rises and peaks relatively fastcompared to other sn ic, with the characteristic broad nir peak seen in allthree bands. we find that the rise profile before the peak is largelyindependent of nir wavelength, each band appearing to transition into a plateauphase around day 10--13. since the light curve is in the plateau phase when ourobservations end at day 16, we can only place limits on the peak absolutemagnitudes, but we estimate that sn 2006aj is one of the lowest nir luminosityxrf/grb associated sne observed to date. the broad peaks observed in the {\emjhk$_s$} bands point to a large increase in the nir contribution of the totalflux output from days 10--16. this evolution can be seen in the broad color andsed diagrams constructed using {\em ubvrijhk$_s$} monochromatic fluxmeasurements for the first 16 days of the event. ultimately, a 10-day rise timewould make sn 2006aj an extremely fast rise sn ic event, faster than sn 1998bwand sn 2003dh, which combined with its underluminous nature, indicates a loweramount of $^{56}$ni ejected by the progenitor compared to other xrf/grb-sne.furthermore, the lack of significant color change during the rise portion ofthe burst points to little or no spectral evolution over the first 10 days ofactivity in the nir.

astro-ph;0702452	pulse width evolution of late time x-rays flares in grbs: evidence for  internal shocks	we study the duration and variability of late time x-ray flares followinggamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the narrow field x-ray telescope (xrt)aboard the {\it swift} spacecraft. these flares are thought to be indicative oflate time activity by the central engine that powers the grb and produced bymeans similar to those which produce the prompt emission. we use anon-parametric procedure to study the overall temporal properties of the flaresand a structure function analysis to look for an evolution of the fundamentalvariability time-scale between the prompt and late time emission. we find astrong correlation in 28 individual x-ray flares in 18 separate grbs betweenthe flare duration and their time of peak flux since the grb trigger. we alsofind a qualitative trend of decreasing variability as a function of time sincetrigger, with a characteristic minimum variability timescale $\delta t/t=0.1$for most flares. we interpret these results as evidence of internal shocks atcollision radii that are larger than those that produced the prompt emission.contemporaneous detections of high energy emission by glast could be a crucialtest in determining if indeed these x-ray flares originate as internal shocksbehind the afterglow, as any x-ray emission originating from behind theafterglow is expected to undergo inverse compton scattering as it passesthrough the external shock.

astro-ph;0703125	discovery of a very bright, nearby gravitational microlensing event	we report the serendipitous detection of a very bright, very nearbymicrolensing event. in late october 2006, an otherwise unremarkable a0 star ata distance ~1 kpc (gsc 3656-1328) brightened achromatically by a factor ofnearly 40 over the span of several days and then decayed in an apparentlysymmetrical way. we present a light curve of the event based on opticalphotometry from the center for backyard astrophysics and the all sky automatedsurvey, as well as near-infrared photometry from the peters automated infraredimaging telescope. this light curve is well-fit by a generic microlensingmodel. we also report optical spectra, and swift x-ray and uv observations thatare consistent with the microlensing interpretation. we discuss and rejectalternative explanations for this variability. the lens star is probably alow-mass star or brown dwarf, with a relatively high proper motion of &gt;20mas/yr, and may be visible using precise optical/infrared imaging taken severalyears from now. a modest, all-sky survey telescope could detect ~10 such eventsper year, which would enable searches for very low-mass planetary companions torelatively nearby stars.

astro-ph;0703665	probing the ism near star forming regions with grb afterglow  spectroscopy: gas, metals, and dust	we study the chemical abundances of the interstellar medium surrounding highz gamma-ray bursts (grbs) through analysis of the damped lya systems (dlas)identified in afterglow spectra. these grb-dlas are characterized by large hicolumn densities n(hi) and metallicities [m/h] spanning 1/100 to nearly solar,with median [m/h]&gt;-1. the majority of grb-dlas have [m/h] values exceeding thecosmic mean metallicity of atomic gas at z&gt;2, i.e. if anything, the grb-dlasare biased to larger metallicity. we also observe (i) large [zn/fe] values(&gt;+0.6) and sub-solar ti/fe ratios which imply substantial differentialdepletion, (ii) large a/fe ratios suggesting nucleosynthetic enrichment bymassive stars, and (iii) low c^0/c^+ ratios (&lt;10^{-4}). quantitatively, theobserved depletion levels and c^0/c^+ ratios of the gas are not characteristicof cold, dense hi clouds in the galactic ism. we argue that the grb-dlasrepresent the ism near the grb but not gas directly local to the grb (e.g. itsmolecular cloud or circumstellar material). we compare these observations withdlas intervening background quasars (qso-dlas). the grb-dlas exhibit largern(hi) values, higher a/fe and zn/fe ratios, and have higher metallicity thanthe qso-dlas. we argue that the differences primarily result fromgalactocentric radius-dependent differences in the ism: grb-dlas preferentiallyprobe denser, more depleted, higher metallicity gaslocated in the inner few kpcwhereas qso-dlas are more likely to intersect the less dense, less enriched,outer regions of the galaxy. finally, we investigate whether dust obscurationmay exclude grb-dla sightlines from qso-dla samples; we find that the majorityof grb-dlas would be recovered which implies little observational bias againstlarge n(hi) systems.

astro-ph;0703666	missing molecular hydrogen and the physical conditions of grb host  galaxies	we examine the abundance of molecular hydrogen (h2) in the spectra of gammaray burst afterglows (grbs). in nearby galaxies h2 traces the cold neutralmedium (cnm) and dense molecular star-forming interstellar gas. though h2 isdetected in at least half of all sightlines towards hot stars in the magellanicclouds and in ~25% of damped lya systems toward quasars, it is not detected inany of the five grb environments with a similar range of neutral hydrogencolumn and metallicity. we detect no vibrationally-excited h2 that would implythe grb itself has photodissociated its parent molecular cloud, so such modelsare ruled out unless the parent cloud was &lt;~4 pc in radius and was fullydissociated prior to the spectroscopic observations, or the star escaped itsparent cloud during its main-sequence lifetime. the low molecular fractions forthe grbs are mysterious in light their large column densities of neutral h andexpectations based on local analogs, i.e. 30 doradus in the lmc. thissurprising lack of h2 in grb-dlas indicates that the destruction processes thatsuppress molecule formation in the lmc and smc are more effective in the grbhosts, most probably a combination of low metallicity and an fuv radiationfield 10--100 times the galactic mean field. these inferred conditions placestrong constraints on the star forming regions in these early galaxies.

astro-ph;0703701	on the nature of velocity fields in high z galaxies	we analyze the gas kinematics of damped lya systems (dlas) hosting high zgamma-ray bursts (grbs) and those toward quasars (qso-dlas) focusing onthreestatistics: (1) dv, the velocity interval encompassing 90% of thetotaloptical depth, (2,3) wsi and wciv, the rest equivalent widths of thesiii1526 and civ1548 transitions. the dv distributions of the grb-dlas andqso-dlas are similar, each has median dv~80km/s and a significant tail toseveral hundred km/s. this suggests comparable galaxy masses for the parentpopulations of grb-dlas and qso-dlas and we infer the average dark matter halomass of grb galaxies is &lt;~10^{12} msol. the unique configuration of grb-dlasightlines and the presence (and absence) of fine-structure absorption togethergive special insight into the nature of high z, protogalactic velocity fields.the data support a scenario where the dv statistic reflects dynamics in theinterstellar medium (ism) and wsi traces motions outside the ism (e.g. halogas, galactic-scale winds). the wsi statistic and gas metallicity [m/h] aretightly correlated, especially for the qso-dlas: [m/h]=a + b log(wsi/1a) witha=-0.92+/-0.05 and b=-1.41+/-0.10. we argue that the wsi statistic primarilytracks dynamical motions in the halos of high z galaxies and interpret thiscorrelation as a mass-metallicity relation with very similar slope to the trendobserved in local, low-metallicity galaxies. finally, the grb-dlas exhibitsystematically larger wsi values (&gt;0.5a) than the qso-dlas (&lt;wsi&gt;~ 0.5a) whichmay suggest galactic-scale outflows contribute to the largest observed velocityfields.

astro-ph;9504063	determination of distance from time dilation of cosmological gamma-ray  bursts	the isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts as observed with the burst andtransient experiment (batse) strongly suggests that the bursts are atcosmological distances. at such distances, the expansion of the universe shouldredshift the spectra and stretch the temporal structure. we relate the observedpeak intensities, spectral shapes, and time dilation to distance. we includethe uncertainties in our knowledge of the intrinsic spectrum and correct forthe coupling between the spectral shape and the temporal structure. thereported time dilation between the dimmest batse bursts and the bright batsebursts (a factor of 2) requires a redshift of about 6 for the batse dimmestbursts rather than a redshift of 1 or 2 as previously reported. the largeluminosity and distance determined from the time dilation is inconsistent withthe observed log n-log p distribution. unless there is very strong evolution.the implied distance for the dimmest bursts is beyond where galaxies arethought to form. if true, the gamma-ray bursts would be orphans: no knownobjects would have the same distance scale. we conclude that either a largefraction (65%) of the observed time dilation between the batse bright anddimmest bursts is intrinsic to the bursts or that there are strong evolutionaryeffects in the log n-log p distribution and that it is only a coincidence thatlog n-log p shows a -3/2 power law at high intensities.

astro-ph;9705098	testing for extragalactic correlations of gamma-ray bursts	if gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are cosmological they need not necessarily bespatially coincident with a host galaxy--in many cosmological models theprogenitors are ejected to large distances from their parent galaxies. whilethe optical transient of grb 970228 may be close to a faint galaxy, there areseveral other galaxies in the field which could be the host if the progenitorsare ejected to ~50 kpc. if grbs come from such a widely distributed progenitorpopulation then it should be possible to search for a statistical correlationbetween optical transients and nearby galaxies. we provide a statisticalframework for quantifying a correlation between potential host galaxies andgrbs, taking into account that galaxies are clustered. from simulations, weestimate that if grbs occur within l &lt; 100 kpc of their host, then opticalobservations b &lt; 24.0 of the galaxy field near just 6 optical transientpositions are required to find a correlation with potential hosts at the 95percent confidence level. the methodology constructed herein is extendible toany cross-correlation analysis and is especially useful if either set ofobjects is clustered. ultimately, if the distance scale to grbs is establishedas cosmological, this analysis can be used to determine the spatialdistribution of grbs near their host galaxies.

astro-ph;9706174	using stis to find gamma-ray burst redshifts	a recent spectrum of the optical afterglow of grb 970508 suggests thatgamma-ray bursts (grbs) are cosmological in origin and it is of crucialimportance to derive an accurate distance to each burst. if grbs occur neartheir host galaxies then lyman limit absorption should be observable in roughlyhalf the grb afterglow spectra. here we outline the methodology to obtain aredshift from the grb afterglow spectrum using the recently installed spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) instrument onboard the hubble spacetelescope. a low-resolution spectrum with the multi-anode microchannel array(mama) detector gives complete spectral coverage over the wavelength range157.0-318.0 nm (near uv) and 115.0-174.0 nm (far uv). assuming a target ofopportunity observation is conducted soon (&lt; 3 weeks) after a bright burst, arelatively small integration time (about 3 orbits) would be sufficient todetect the lyman limit over a wide redshift range (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.2). detection(or non-detection) of the lyman limit, in concert with ground-basedobservations of nearby galaxies and mg ii and c iv absorption lines, shouldprovide meaningful constraints on the relationship of grbs to galaxies.

astro-ph;9708183	gamma-ray bursts from stellar remnants: probing the universe at high  redshift	a gamma-ray burst (grb) releases an amount of energy similar to that of asupernova explosion, which combined with its rapid variability suggests anorigin related to neutron stars or black holes. since these compact stellarremnants form from the most massive stars not long after their birth, gamma-raybursts should trace the star formation rate in the universe; we show that thegrb flux distribution is consistent with this. because of the strong evolutionof the star formation rate with redshift, it follows that the dimmest knownbursts have z ~ 6, much above the value usually quoted and beyond the mostdistant quasars. this explains the absence of bright galaxies in well-studiedgamma-ray burst error boxes. the increased distances imply a peak luminosity of8.3e51 erg/s and a rate density of 0.025 per million years per galaxy. thesevalues are 20 times higher and 150 times lower, respectively, than are impliedby fits with non-evolving grb rates. this means that grbs are either caused bya much rarer phenomenon than mergers of binary neutron stars, or theirgamma-ray emission is often invisible to us due to beaming. precise burstlocations from optical transients will discriminate between the various modelsfor grbs from stellar deaths, because the distance between progenitor birthplace and burst varies greatly among them. the dimmest grbs are then the mostdistant known objects, and may probe the universe at an age when the firststars were forming.

astro-ph;9805222	the spatial distribution of coalescing neutron star binaries:  implications for gamma-ray bursts	we find the distribution of coalescence times, birthrates, spatialvelocities, and subsequent radial offsets of coalescing neutron stars (nss) invarious galactic potentials accounting for large asymmetric kicks introducedduring a supernovae. the birthrates of bound ns-ns binaries are quite sensitiveto the magnitude of the kick velocities but are, nevertheless, similar (~10 pergalaxy per myr) to previous population synthesis studies. the distribution ofmerger times since zero-age main sequence is, however, relatively insensitiveto the choice of kick velocities. with a median merger time of ~100 myr, wefind that compact binaries should closely trace the star formation rate in theuniverse.  in a range of plausible galactic potentials (m_galaxy &gt; 3 x 10^10 m_solar)the median radial offset of a ns-ns mergers is less than 10 kpc. at a redshiftof z=1 (with h_0 = 65 km/s/mpc and omega = 0.2), this means that half thecoalescences should occur within ~1.3 arcsec from the host galaxy. in all butthe most shallow potentials, ninety percent of ns-ns binaries merge within 30kpc of the host. we find that although the spatial distribution of coalescingneutron star binaries is consistent with the close spatial association of knownoptical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with faint galaxies, anon-negligible fraction (~15 percent) of grbs should occur well outside (&gt;30kpc) dwarf galaxy hosts. extinction due to dust in the host, projection ofoffsets, and a range in interstellar medium densities confound the truedistribution of ns-ns mergers around galaxies with an observable set of opticaltransients/galaxy offsets.

0810.4923	improved standardization of type ii-p supernovae: application to an  expanded sample	in the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using avariety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematicuncertainties. owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics differingfrom those of type ia sne (sne ia), type ii-plateau supernovae (sne ii-p) areunlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. based on a new analysisof 17 sne ii-p, and on an improved methodology, we find that sne ii-p are goodstandardizable candles, almost comparable to sne ia. we derive a tight hubblediagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the simple correlationbetween luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by hamuy &amp; pinto 2002.we show that the descendent method of nugent et al. 2006 can be furthersimplified and that the correction for dust extinction has low statisticalimpact. we find that our sn sample favors, on average, a very steep dust lawwith total to selective extinction r_v&lt;2. such an extinction law has beenrecently inferred for many sne ia. our results indicate that a distancemeasurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a sn ii-p during theplateau phase combined with sparse photometric measurements.

0706.1275	a complete catalog of swift grb spectra and durations: demise of a  physical origin for pre-swift high-energy correlations	we calculate durations and spectral paramaters for 218 swift bursts detectedby the bat instrument between and including grbs 041220 and 070509, including77 events with measured redshifts. incorporating prior knowledge into thespectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic $\nu f_{\nu}$ spectralpeak energy $e_{\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $e_{\rm iso}$(1--$10^4$ kev) for all events. this complete and rather extensive catalog,analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence andorigin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-swift observations. we findthat the $e_{\rm pk,obs}$-$e_{\rm iso}$ correlation is present in the swiftsample; however, the best-fit powerlaw relation is inconsistent with thebest-fit pre-swift relation at &gt;5 sigma significance. moreover, it has a factor&gt;~ 2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on $e_{\rmpk,obs}$. a large fraction of the swift events are hard and subluminousrelative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-swift relation, in agreement withindications from batse grbs without redshift. moreover, we determine anexperimental threshold for the bat detector and show how the $e_{\rmpk,obs}$--$e_{\rm iso}$ correlation arises artificially due to partialcorrelation with the threshold. we show that pre-swift correlations found byamati et al.(2002), yonetoku et al. (2004), firmani et al.(2006) (andindependently by others) are likely unrelated to the physical properties ofgrbs and are likely useless for tests of cosmology. also, an explanation ofthese correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a natural andquantitative explanation for why short-duration grbs and events at low redshifttend to be outliers to the correlations.
