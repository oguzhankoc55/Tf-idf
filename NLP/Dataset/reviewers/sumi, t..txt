0903.4002	probing the galactic potential with next-generation observations of disk  stars	near-future surveys promise a dramatic improvement in the number andprecision of astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic measurements of starsin the milky way's disk. we examine the impact of such surveys on ourunderstanding of the galaxy by "observing" particle realizations ofnon-axisymmetric disk distributions orbiting in an axisymmetric halo withappropriate errors and then attempting to recover the underlying potentialusing a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) approach. we demonstrate that theazimuthally averaged gravitational force field in the galactic plane--andhence, to a lesser extent, the galactic mass distribution--can be tightlyconstrained over a large range of radii using a variety of types of surveys solong as the error distribution of the measurements of the parallax, propermotion and radial velocity are well-understood and the disk is surveyedglobally. one advantage of our method is that the target stars can be selectednon-randomly in real or apparent-magnitude space to ensure just such a globalsample without biasing the results. assuming we can always measure theline-of-sight velocity of a star with at least 1 km/s precision, we demonstratethat the force field can be determined to better than ~1% for galactocentricradii in the range r=4-20 kpc we conclude that near-future surveys, like simlite, gaia, and vera, will provide the first precise mapping of thegravitational force field in the region of the galactic disk.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0908.0529	sub-saturn planet moa-2008-blg-310lb: likely to be in the galactic bulge	we report the detection of sub-saturn-mass planet moa-2008-blg-310lb andargue that it is the strongest candidate yet for a bulge planet. deviationsfrom the single-lens fit are smoothed out by finite-source effects and so arenot immediately apparent from the light curve. nevertheless, we find that amodel in which the primary has a planetary companion is favored over thesingle-lens model by \delta\chi^2 ~ 880 for an additional three degrees offreedom. detailed analysis yields a planet/star mass ratioq=(3.3+/-0.3)x10^{-4} and an angular separation between the planet and starwithin 10% of the angular einstein radius. the small angular einstein radius,\theta_e=0.155+/-0.011 mas, constrains the distance to the lens to be d_l&gt;6.0kpc if it is a star (m_l&gt;0.08 m_sun). this is the only microlensing exoplanethost discovered so far that must be in the bulge if it is a star. by analyzingvlt naco adaptive optics images taken near the baseline of the event, we detectadditional blended light that is aligned to within 130 mas of the lensedsource. this light is plausibly from the lens, but could also be due to acompanion to lens or source, or possibly an unassociated star. if the blendedlight is indeed due to the lens, we can estimate the mass of the lens,m_l=0.67+/-0.14 m_sun, planet mass m=74+/-17 m_earth, and projected separationbetween the planet and host, 1.25+/-0.10 au, putting it right on the "snowline". if not, then the planet has lower mass, is closer to its host and iscolder. to distinguish among these possibilities on reasonable timescales wouldrequire obtaining hubble space telescope images almost immediately, before thesource-lens relative motion of \mu=5 mas yr^{-1} causes them to separatesubstantially.

0911.5076	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. ii. ages, metallicities, detailed elemental abundances,  and connections to the galactic thick disc	the bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the milky way.most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the bulge comes frombright giant stars. the underlying assumption that giants represent all thestars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, isunder debate. in particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarfstars give a very different picture of the evolution of the bulge from thatgiven by the giant stars. [abridged] we perform a detailed elemental abundanceanalysis of dwarf stars in the galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectrathat were obtained while the stars were optically magnified duringgravitational microlensing events. [abridged] we present detailed elementalabundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the galactic bulge.combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sampleto date of microlensed dwarf stars in the galactic bulge. we find that thestars span the full range of metallicities from [fe/h]=-0.72 to +0.54, and anaverage metallicity of &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicitybased on giant stars in the bulge. furthermore, the stars follow well-definedabundance trends, that for [fe/h]&lt;0 are very similar to those of the localgalactic thick disc. this suggests that the bulge and the thick disc have had,at least partially, comparable chemical histories. at sub-solar metallicitieswe find the bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while atsuper-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. using the new age andabundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possibleformation scenarios for the bulge.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

0912.1171	a cold neptune-mass planet ogle-2007-blg-368lb: cold neptunes are common	we present the discovery of a neptune-mass planet ogle-2007-blg-368lb with aplanet-star mass ratio of q=[9.5 +/- 2.1] x 10^{-5} via gravitationalmicrolensing. the planetary deviation was detected in real-time thanks to thehigh cadence of the moa survey, real-time light curve monitoring and intensivefollow-up observations. a bayesian analysis returns the stellar mass anddistance at m_l = 0.64_{-0.26}^{+0.21} m_\sun and d_l = 5.9_{-1.4}^{+0.9} kpc,respectively, so the mass and separation of the planet are m_p = 20_{-8}^{+7}m_\oplus and a = 3.3_{-0.8}^{+1.4} au, respectively. this discovery addsanother cold neptune-mass planet to the planetary sample discovered bymicrolensing, which now comprise four cold neptune/super-earths, five gas giantplanets, and another sub-saturn mass planet whose nature is unclear. thediscovery of these ten cold exoplanets by the microlensing method implies thatthe mass ratio function of cold exoplanets scales as dn_{\rm pl}/d\log q\propto q^{-0.7 +/- 0.2} with a 95% confidence level upper limit of n &lt; -0.35(where dn_{\rm pl}/d\log q \propto q^n). as microlensing is most sensitive toplanets beyond the snow-line, this implies that neptune-mass planets are atleast three times more common than jupiters in this region at the 95%confidence level.

1001.0572	frequency of solar-like systems and of ice and gas giants beyond the  snow line from high-magnification microlensing events in 2005-2008	we present the first measurement of planet frequency beyond the "snow line"for planet/star mass-ratios[-4.5&lt;log q&lt;-2]: d^2 n/dlog q/dlogs=(0.36+-0.15)/dex^2 at mean mass ratio q=5e-4, and consistent with being flatin log projected separation, s. our result is based on a sample of 6 planetsdetected from intensive follow-up of high-mag (a&gt;200) microlensing eventsduring 2005-8. the sample host stars have typical mass m_host 0.5 msun, anddetection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations(r_e/s_max,r_e*s_max), where r_e 3.5 au sqrt(m_host/msun) is the einsteinradius and s_max (q/5e-5)^{2/3}, corresponding to deprojected separations ~3times the "snow line". though frenetic, the observations constitute a"controlled experiment", which permits measurement of absolute planetfrequency. high-mag events are rare, but the high-mag channel is efficient:half of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yieldedplanet detections. the planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7larger than from rv studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2&lt;p&lt;2000 days].however, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived fromrv studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it ismeasured). this suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex insemi-major axis, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. finally, if allplanetary systems were "analogs" of the solar system, our sample would haveyielded 18.2 planets (11.4 "jupiters", 6.4 "saturns", 0.3 "uranuses", 0.2"neptunes") including 6.1 systems with 2 or more planet detections. thiscompares to 6 planets including one 2-planet system in the actual sample,implying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

0708.1066	observation of the first gravitational microlensing event in a sparse  stellar field : the tago event	we report the observation of the first gravitational microlensing event in asparse stellar field, involving the brightest (v=11.4 mag) andclosest (~ 1 kpc)source star to date. this event was discovered by an amateurastronomer, a.tago, on 2006 october 31 as a transient brightening, by ~4.5 mag during a ~15day period, of a normal a-type star (gsc 3656-1328) in the cassiopeiaconstellation. analysis of both spectroscopic observations and the light curveindicates that this event was caused by gravitational microlensing rather thanan intrinsically variable star. discovery of this single event over a 30 yearperiod is roughly consistent with the expected microlensing rate for the wholesky down to v = 12 mag stars. however, the probability for finding events withsuch a high magnification (~ 50) is much smaller, by a factor ~1/50, whichimplies that the true event rate may be higher than expected. this discoveryindicates the potential of all sky variability surveys, employing frequentsampling by telescopes with small apertures and wide fields of view, forfinding such rare transient events, and using the observations to exploregalactic disk structure and search for exo-planets.

1006.1396	determining the physical lens parameters of the binary gravitational  microlensing event moa-2009-blg-016	we report the result of the analysis of the light curve of the microlensingevent moa-2009-blg-016. the light curve is characterized by a short-durationanomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. we find that the peak anomalyis due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the lightcurve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of theobserver over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the eartharound the sun. in addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finitesize of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure theangular einstein radius of the lens system. the einstein radius combined withthe microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens andthe distance to the lens. we identify three distinct classes of degeneratesolutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of thepreviously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negativeimpact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloidshape of the caustic. we find that, for the best-fit solution, the estimatedmass of the lower-mass component of the binary is (0.04 +- 0.01) m_sun,implying a brown-dwarf companion. however, there exists a solution that isworse only by \delta\chi^2 ~ 3 for which the mass of the secondary is above thehydrogen-burning limit. unfortunately, resolving these two degenerate solutionswill be difficult as the relative lens-source proper motions for both aresimilar and small (~ 1 mas/yr) and thus the lens will remain blended with thesource for the next several decades.

1105.3544	unbound or distant planetary mass population detected by gravitational  microlensing	since 1995, more than 500 exoplanets have been detected using differenttechniques, of which 11 were detected with gravitational microlensing. most ofthese are gravitationally bound to their host stars. there is some evidence offree-floating planetary mass objects in young star-forming regions, but theseobjects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 jupiter masses with largeuncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. here, wereport the discovery of a population of unbound or distant jupiter-massobjects, which are almost twice (1.8_{-0.8}^{+1.7}) as common as main-sequencestars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observationstoward the galactic bulge. these planetary-mass objects have no host stars thatcan be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitationalmicrolensing. however a comparison with constraints from direct imagingsuggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any hoststar. an abrupt change in the mass function at about a jupiter mass favours theidea that their formation process is different from that of stars and browndwarfs. they may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequentlyscattered into unbound or very distant orbits.

1203.1291	ogle-2008-blg-510: first automated real-time detection of a weak  microlensing anomaly - brown dwarf or stellar binary?	the microlensing event ogle-2008-blg-510 is characterised by an evidentasymmetric shape of the peak, promptly detected by the artemis system in realtime. the skewness of the light curve appears to be compatible both withbinary-lens and binary-source models, including the possibility that the lenssystem consists of an m dwarf orbited by a brown dwarf. the detection of thismicrolensing anomaly and our analysis demonstrates that: 1) automated real-timedetection of weak microlensing anomalies with immediate feedback is feasible,efficient, and sensitive, 2) rather common weak features intrinsically comewith ambiguities that are not easily resolved from photometric light curves, 3)a modelling approach that finds all features of parameter space rather thanjust the `favourite model' is required, and 4) the data quality is mostcrucial, where systematics can be confused with real features, in particularsmall higher-order effects such as orbital motion signatures. it moreoverbecomes apparent that events with weak signatures are a silver mine forstatistical studies, although not easy to exploit. clues about the apparentpaucity of both brown-dwarf companions and binary-source microlensing eventsmight hide here.

1203.4560	planetary and other short binary microlensing events from the moa short  event analysis	we present the analysis of four candidate short duration binary microlensingevents from the 2006-2007 moa project short event analysis. these events werediscovered as a byproduct of an analysis designed to find short timescalesingle lens events that may be due to free-floating planets. three of theseevents are determined to be microlensing events, while the fourth is mostlikely caused by stellar variability. for each of the three microlensingevents, the signal is almost entirely due to a brief caustic feature withlittle or no lensing attributable mainly to the lens primary. one of theseevents, moa-bin-1, is due to a planet, and it is the first example of aplanetary event in which stellar host is only detected through binarymicrolensing effects. the mass ratio and separation are q = 4.9 +- 1.4 x10^{-3} and s = 2.10 +- 0.05, respectively. a bayesian analysis based on astandard galactic model indicates that the planet, moa-bin-1lb, has a mass ofm_p = 3.7 +- 2.1 m_{jup}, and orbits a star of m_* = 0.75{+0.33 -0.41} m_solarat a semi-major axis of a = 8.3 {+4.5 -2.7} au. this is one of the most massiveand widest separation planets found by microlensing. the scarcity of such wideseparation planets also has implications for interpretation of the isolatedplanetary mass objects found by this analysis. if we assume that we have beenable to detect wide separation planets with a efficiency at least as high asthat for isolated planets, then we can set limits on the distribution onplanets in wide orbits. in particular, if the entire isolated planet samplefound by sumi et al. (2011) consists of planets bound in wide orbits aroundstars, we find that it is likely that the median orbital semi-major axis is &gt;30 au.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1207.1244	a possible binary system of a stellar remnant in the high magnification  gravitational microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514	we report the extremely high magnification (a &gt; 1000) binary microlensingevent ogle-2007-blg-514. we obtained good coverage around the double peakstructure in the light curve via follow-up observations from differentobservatories. the binary lens model that includes the effects of parallax(known orbital motion of the earth) and orbital motion of the lens yields abinary lens mass ratio of q = 0.321 +/- 0.007 and a projected separation of s =0.072 +/- 0.001$ in units of the einstein radius. the parallax parameters allowus to determine the lens distance d_l = 3.11 +/- 0.39 kpc and total massm_l=1.40 +/- 0.18 m_sun; this leads to the primary and secondary componentshaving masses of m_1 = 1.06 +/- 0.13 m_sun and m_2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 m_sun,respectively. the parallax model indicates that the binary lens system islikely constructed by the main sequence stars. on the other hand, we used abayesian analysis to estimate probability distributions by the model thatincludes the effects of xallarap (possible orbital motion of the source arounda companion) and parallax (q = 0.270 +/- 0.005, s = 0.083 +/- 0.001). theprimary component of the binary lens is relatively massive with m_1 =0.9_{-0.3}^{+4.6} m_sun and it is at a distance of d_l = 2.6_{-0.9}^{+3.8} kpc.given the secure mass ratio measurement, the companion mass is therefore m_2 =0.2_{-0.1}^{+1.2} m_sun. the xallarap model implies that the primary lens islikely a stellar remnant, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star or a blackhole.

1211.6848	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. v. evidence for a wide age distribution and a complex mdf	based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensingevents we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 32 dwarf andsubgiant stars in the galactic bulge. [abridged], we now have 58 microlensedbulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously analysed. the maincharacteristics of the sample and the findings that can be drawn are: (i) themetallicity distribution (mdf) is wide and spans all metallicities between[fe/h]=-1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in the mdf around solar metallicity that wasapparent in our previous analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) isno longer evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications ofmultiple components are starting to emerge. [abridged]; (iii) the stars with[fe/h]&lt;-0.1 are old with ages between 10 and 12 gyr; (iv) the metal-rich starswith [fe/h]&gt;-0.1 show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 gyr with adistribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 gyr and a tail towards higherages; (v) there are indications in the [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] that the "knee"occurs around [fe/h] = -0.3 to -0.2, which is a slightly higher metallicity ascompared to the "knee" for the local thick disk. this suggests that thechemical enrichment of the metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than whatis observed for the local thick disk. the results from the microlensed bulgedwarf stars in combination with other findings in the literature, in particularthe evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the milkyway could be an almost pure disk galaxy. the bulge would then just be aconglomerate of the other galactic stellar populations (thin disk, thick disk,halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of the galaxy,influenced by the galactic bar.

0801.2194	implications for galaxy evolution from the cosmic evolution of supernova  rate density	we report a comprehensive statistical analysis of the observational data ofthe cosmic evolution of supernova (sn) rate density, to derive constraints oncosmic star formation history and the nature of type ia supernova (sn ia)progenitor. we use all available information of magnitude, sn type, andredshift information of both type ia and core-collapse (cc) sne in goods andsdf, as well as sn ia rate densities reported in the literature. furthermore,we also add 157 sn candidates in the past subaru/suprime-cam data that arenewly reported here, to increase the statistics. we find that the current dataset of sn rate density evolution already gives a meaningful constraint on theevolution of the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) at z &lt;~ 1, though strongconstraints cannot be derived for the delay time distribution (dtd) of sne ia.we derive a constraint of the evolutionary index of sfr density alpha ~ 3--4[(1+z)^alpha at z &lt;~ 1] with an evidence for a significant evolution of meanextinction of cc sne [e(b-v) ~ 0.5 at z ~ 0.5 compared with ~ 0.2 at z = 0],which does not change significantly within a reasonable range of various dtdmodels. this result is nicely consistent with the systematic trend of alphaestimates based on galactic sfr indicators in different wavelengths(ultraviolet, h_alpha, and infrared), indicating that there is a strongevolution in mean extinction of star forming regions in galaxies at relativelylow redshift range of z &lt;~ 0.5. these results are obtained by a method that iscompletely independent of galaxy surveys, and especially, there is no detectionlimit about the host galaxy luminosity in our analysis, giving a strongconstraint on the star formation activity in high-z dwarf galaxies orintergalactic space.

1403.3092	candidate gravitational microlensing events for future direct lens  imaging	the mass of the lenses giving rise to galactic microlensing events can beconstrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.the flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions tothe source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken whenthe lens and source are spatially resolved. for typical ground-based adaptiveoptics (ao) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately longtime baselines or high relative proper motions. we provide a list ofmicrolensing events toward the galactic bulge with high relative lens-sourceproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens masswith future high-resolution imaging. we investigate all events from 2004 --2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us tomeasure the proper motion. in total, we present 20 events with mu &gt;~ 8 mas/yr.of these, 14 were culled from previous analyses while 6 are new, includingogle-2004-blg-368, moa-2005-blg-36, ogle-2012-blg-0211, ogle-2012-blg-0456,moa-2012-blg-532, and moa-2013-blg-029. in &lt;~12 years the lens and source ofeach event will be sufficiently separated for ground-based telescopes with aosystems or space telescopes to resolve each component and further characterizethe lens system. furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of thelens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated fromimages taken when the lens and source are resolved can be used to empiricallycheck the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used toestimate lens masses for many events.

1403.7005	ogle-2008-blg-355lb: a massive planet around a late type star	we report the discovery of a massive planet ogle-2008-blg-355lb. the lightcurve analysis indicates a planet:host mass ratio of q = 0.0118 +/- 0.0006 at aseparation of 0.877 +/- 0.010 einstein radii. we do not measure a significantmicrolensing parallax signal and do not have high angular resolution imagesthat could detect the planetary host star. therefore, we do not have a directmeasurement of the host star mass. a bayesian analysis, assuming that all hoststars have equal probability to host a planet with the measured mass ratioimplies a host star mass of m_h = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.30} m_sun and a companion ofmass m_p = 4.6^{+3.7}_{-2.2} m_jup, at a projected separation of r_proj =1.70^{+0.29}_{-0.30} au. the implied distance to the planetary system is d_l =6.8 +/- 1.1 kpc. a planetary system with the properties preferred by thebayesian analysis would be a challenge to the core-accretion model of planetformation, as the core-accretion model predicts that massive planets are farmore likely to form around more massive host stars. this core accretion modelprediction is not consistent with our bayesian prior of an equal probability ofhost stars of all masses to host a planet with the measured mass ratio. so, ifthe core accretion model prediction is right, we should expect that follow-uphigh angular resolution observations will detect a host star with a mass in theupper part of the range allowed by the bayesian analysis. that is, the hostwould probably be a k or g dwarf.

1410.8252	ogle-2011-blg-0265lb: a jovian microlensing planet orbiting an m dwarf	we report the discovery of a jupiter-mass planet orbiting an m-dwarf starthat gave rise to the microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0265. such a system isvery rare among known planetary systems and thus the discovery is important fortheoretical studies of planetary formation and evolution. high-cadence temporalcoverage of the planetary signal combined with extended observations throughoutthe event allows us to accurately model the observed light curve. the finalmicrolensing solution remains, however, degenerate yielding two possibleconfigurations of the planet and the host star. in the case of the preferredsolution, the mass of the planet is $m_{\rm p} = 0.9\pm 0.3\ m_{\rm j}$, andthe planet is orbiting a star with a mass $m = 0.22\pm 0.06\ m_\odot$. thesecond possible configuration (2$\sigma$ away) consists of a planet with$m_{\rm p}=0.6\pm 0.3\ m_{\rm j}$ and host star with $m=0.14\pm 0.06\ m_\odot$.the system is located in the galactic disk 3 -- 4 kpc towards the galacticbulge. in both cases, with an orbit size of 1.5 -- 2.0 au, the planet is a"cold jupiter" -- located well beyond the "snow line" of the host star.currently available data make the secure selection of the correct solutiondifficult, but there are prospects for lifting the degeneracy with additionalfollow-up observations in the future, when the lens and source star separate.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1412.1546	can the masses of isolated planetary-mass gravitational lenses be  measured by terrestrial parallax?	recently sumi et al. (2011) reported evidence for a large population ofplanetary-mass objects (pmos) that are either unbound or orbit host stars inorbits &gt; 10 au. their result was deduced from the statistical distribution ofdurations of gravitational microlensing events observed by the moacollaboration during 2006 and 2007. here we study the feasibility of measuringthe mass of an individual pmo through microlensing by examining a particularevent, moa-2011-blg-274. this event was unusual as the duration was short, themagnification high, the source-size effect large and the angular einsteinradius small. also, it was intensively monitored from widely separatedlocations under clear skies at low air masses. choi et al. (2012) concludedthat the lens of the event may have been a pmo but they did not attempt ameasurement of its mass. we report here a re-analysis of the event usingre-reduced data. we confirm the results of choi et al. and attempt ameasurement of the mass and distance of the lens using the terrestrial parallaxeffect. evidence for terrestrial parallax is found at a 3 sigma level ofconfidence. the best fit to the data yields the mass and distance of the lensas 0.80 +/- 0.30 m_j and 0.80 +/- 0.25 kpc respectively. we exclude a host starto the lens out to a separation ~ 40 au. drawing on our analysis ofmoa-2011-blg-274 we propose observational strategies for future microlensingsurveys to yield sharper results on pmos including those down to super-earthmass.

1502.06663	reanalyses of anomalous gravitational microlensing events in the  ogle-iii early warning system database with combined data	we reanalyze microlensing events in the published list of anomalous eventsthat were observed from the ogle lensing survey conducted during 2004-2008period. in order to check the existence of possible degenerate solutions andextract extra information, we conduct analyses based on combined data fromother survey and follow-up observation and consider higher-order effects. amongthe analyzed events, we present analyses of 8 events for which either newsolutions are identified or additional information is obtained. we find thatthe previous binary-source interpretations of 5 events are better interpretedby binary-lens models. these events include ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2007-blg-159, ogle-2007-blg-491, ogle-2008-blg-143, and ogle-2008-blg-210.with additional data covering caustic crossings, we detect finite-sourceeffects for 6 events including ogle-2006-blg-215, ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2006-blg-450, ogle-2008-blg-143, ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513.among them, we are able to measure the einstein radii of 3 events for whichmulti-band data are available. these events are ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513. for ogle-2008-blg-143, we detecthigher-order effect induced by the changes of the observer's position caused bythe orbital motion of the earth around the sun. in addition, we presentdegenerate solutions resulting from the known close/wide or eclipticdegeneracy. finally, we note that the masses of the binary companions of thelenses of ogle-2006-blg-450 and ogle-2008-blg-210 are in the brown-dwarfregime.

0806.0025	a low-mass planet with a possible sub-stellar-mass host in microlensing  event moa-2007-blg-192	we report the detection of an extrasolar planet of mass ratio q ~ 2 x 10^(-4)in microlensing event moa-2007-blg-192. the best fit microlensing model showsboth the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can becombined to obtain the lens masses of m = 0.060 (+0.028 -0.021) m_sun for theprimary and m = 3.3 (+4.9 -1.6) m_earth for the planet. however, theobservational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, andthe radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source starcolor measurement. as a result, the 2-sigma limits on the mass ratio and finitesource measurements are weak. nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signalclearly favors a sub-stellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finitesource effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. adaptive opticsimages taken with the very large telescope (vlt) naco instrument are consistentwith a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of themain sequence. follow-up vlt and/or hubble space telescope (hst) observationswill either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-masslens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. in either case, thelens star, moa-2007-blg-192l, is the lowest mass primary known to have acompanion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, moa-2007-blg-192lb, isprobably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date, aside from the lowest masspulsar planet.

0809.2997	microlensing event moa-2007-blg-400: exhuming the buried signature of a  cool, jovian-mass planet	we report the detection of the cool, jovian-mass planet moa-2007-blg-400lb.the planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peakmagnification a_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. the angular extentof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller thanthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is alsosmoothed out by the finite source size. thus the deviation from a single-lensfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). nevertheless, we demonstratethat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertainedfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairlyprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the largesignificance (\delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. the planet/star projectedseparation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to twoindistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be m &lt; 0.75 m_sun(assuming it is a main-sequence star). a bayesian analysis that includes allavailable observational constraints indicates a primary in the galactic bulgewith a mass of ~0.2-0.5 m_sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 m_jupiter.the separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1au (~5.3-9.7au) and~103k (~34k) for the close (wide) solution. if the primary is a main-sequencestar, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so ameasurement of its mass and distance.

astro-ph;9905151	on planetary companions to the macho-98-blg-35 microlens star	we present observations of microlensing event macho-98-blg-35 which reached apeak magnification factor of almost 80. these observations by the microlensingplanet search (mps) and the moa collaborations place strong constraints on thepossible planetary system of the lens star and show intriguing evidence for alow mass planet with a mass fraction $4\times 10^{-5} \leq \epsilon \leq2\times 10^{-4}$. a giant planet with $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ is excluded from 95%of the region between 0.4 and 2.5 $r_e$ from the lens star, where $r_e$ is theeinstein ring radius of the lens. this exclusion region is more extensive thanthe generic "lensing zone" which is $0.6 - 1.6 r_e$. for smaller mass planets,we can exclude 57% of the "lensing zone" for $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ and 14% ofthe lensing zone for $\epsilon = 10^{-5}$. the mass fraction $\epsilon =10^{-5}$ corresponds to an earth mass planet for a lensing star of mass $\sim0.3 \msun$. a number of similar events will provide statistically significantconstraints on the prevalence of earth mass planets. in order to put our limitsin more familiar terms, we have compared our results to those expected for asolar system clone averaging over possible lens system distances andorientations. we find that such a system is ruled out at the 90% confidencelevel. a copy of the solar system with jupiter replaced by a second saturn massplanet can be ruled out at 70% confidence. our low mass planetary signal (fewearth masses to neptune mass) is significant at the $4.5\sigma$ confidencelevel. if this planetary interpretation is correct, the macho-98-blg-35 lenssystem constitutes the first detection of a low mass planet orbiting anordinary star without gas giant planets.

astro-ph;9911348	photometry of pulsating stars in the magellanic clouds as observed in  the moa project	a review of the moa (microlensing observations in astrophysics) project ispresented. moa is a collaboration of approximately 30 astronomers from newzealand and japan established with the aim of finding and detectingmicrolensing events towards the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge, whichmay be indicative of either dark matter or of planetary companions. theobserving program commenced in 1995, using very wide band blue and red filtersand a nine-chip mosaic ccd camera.  as a by-product of these observations a large database of ccd photometry for1.4 million stars towards both lmc and smc has been established. in onepreliminary analysis 576 bright variable stars were confirmed, nearly half ofthem being cepheids. another analysis has identified large numbers of bluevariables, and 205 eclipsing binaries are included in this sample. in addition351 red variables (agb stars) have been found. light curves have been obtainedfor all these stars. the observations are carried out on a 61-cm f/6.25telescope at mt john university observatory where a new larger ccd camera wasinstalled in 1998 july. from this latitude (44 s) the magellanic clouds can bemonitored throughout the year.
