0903.3950	molecular hydrogen deficiency in hi-poor galaxies and its implications  for star formation	we use a sample of 47 homogeneous and high sensitivity co images taken fromthe nobeyama and bima surveys to demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, asignificant number (~40%) of hi-deficient nearby spiral galaxies are alsodepleted in molecular hydrogen. while hi-deficiency by itself is not asufficient condition for molecular gas depletion, we find that h2 reduction isassociated with the removal of hi inside the galaxy optical disk. thosehi-deficient galaxies with normal h2 content have lost hi mainly from outsidetheir optical disks, where the h2 content is low in all galaxies. this findingis consistent with theoretical models in which the molecular fraction in agalaxy is determined primarily by its gas column density. our result issupported by indirect evidence that molecular deficient galaxies form stars ata lower rate or have dimmer far infrared fluxes than gas rich galaxies, asexpected if the star formation rate is determined by the molecular hydrogencontent. our result is consistent with a scenario in which, when the atomic gascolumn density is lowered inside the optical disk below the critical valuerequired to form molecular hydrogen and stars, spirals become quiescent andpassive evolving systems. we speculate that this process would act on thetime-scale set by the gas depletion rate and might be a first step for thetransition between the blue and red sequence observed in the color-magnitudediagram.

0906.0983	on the absence of high metallicity-high column density damped lyman  alpha systems: molecule formation in a two-phase interstellar medium	we argue that the lack of observed damped lyman alpha (dla) systems thatsimultaneously have high hi columns densities and high metallicities resultsnaturally from the formation of molecules in the cold phase of a two-phaseatomic medium in pressure balance. our result applies equally well in diffusesystems where the ultraviolet radiation field is dominated by the extragalacticbackground and in dense star-forming ones, where the local radiation field islikely to be orders of magnitude higher. we point out that such aradiation-insensitive model is required to explain the absence of high column -high metallicity systems among dlas observed using gamma-ray burst afterglows,since these are likely subjected to strong radiation fields created by activestar formation in the grb host galaxy. moreover, we show that the observedrelationship between the maximum atomic gas column in dlas sets a firm upperlimit on the fraction of the mass in these systems that can be in the warm,diffuse phase. finally, we argue that our result explains the observed lack ofin situ star formation in dla systems.

0906.4452	numerical star-formation studies -- a status report	the formation of stars is a key process in astrophysics. detailed knowledgeof the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite forunderstanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the milky way.a theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin ofour solar system and of planets around other stars. despite this pivotalimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of theprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.  stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. starformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between thegravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magneticfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. the competitionbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars formand how much mass they ultimately accrete. it plays out over many orders ofmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. inaddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare andhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and theresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of astar-forming cloud.  as a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control starformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.these can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they mustbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations. here we summarizethe state of modern star formation theory and review the recent advances innumerical simulation techniques.

0908.0330	the atomic-to-molecular transition in galaxies. iii. a new method for  determining the molecular content of primordial and dusty clouds	understanding the molecular content of galaxies is a critical problem in starformation and galactic evolution. here we present a new method, based on astromgren-type analysis, to calculate the amount of hi that surrounds amolecular cloud irradiated by an isotropic radiation field. we consider bothplanar and spherical clouds, and h_2 formation either in the gas phase orcatalyzed by dust grains. under the assumption that the transition from atomicto molecular gas is sharp, our method gives the solution without any referenceto the photodissociation cross section. we test our results for the planar caseagainst those of a pdr code, and find typical accuracies of about 10%. ourresults are also consistent with the scaling relations found in paper i of thisseries, but they apply to a wider range of physical conditions. we presentsimple, accurate analytic fits to our results that are suitable for comparisonto observations and to implementation in numerical and semi-analytic models.

0910.2238	stellar feedback in molecular clouds and its influence on the mass  function of young star clusters	we investigate how the removal of interstellar material by stellar feedbacklimits the efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds and how thisdetermines the shape of the mass function of young star clusters. inparticular, we derive relations between the power-law exponents of the massfunctions of the clouds and clusters in the limiting regimes in which thefeedback is energy-driven and momentum-driven, corresponding to minimum andmaximum radiative losses and likely to bracket all realistic cases. we findgood agreement between the predicted and observed exponents, especially formomentum-driven feedback, provided the protoclusters have roughly constant meansurface density, as indicated by observations of the star-forming clumps withinmolecular clouds. we also consider a variety of specific feedback mechanisms,concluding that hii regions inflated by radiation pressure predominate inmassive protoclusters, a momentum-limited process when photons can escape afteronly a few interactions with dust grains. we then present a first estimate ofthe star formation efficiency in this case, finding that it depends on themasses and sizes of the protoclusters only through their mean surface density,thus ensuring consistency between the observed power-law exponents of the massfunctions of the clouds and clusters. the numerical value of this efficiency isalso consistent with observations.

1001.0971	radiation feedback, fragmentation, and the environmental dependence of  the initial mass function	the fragmentation of star-forming interstellar clouds, and the resultingstellar initial mass function (imf), is strongly affected by the temperaturestructure of the collapsing gas. since radiation feedback from embedded starscan modify this as collapse proceeds, feedback plays an important role indetermining the imf. however, the effects and importance of radiative heatingare likely to depend strongly on the surface density of the collapsing clouds,which determines both their effectiveness at trapping radiation and theaccretion luminosities of the stars forming within them. in this paper wereport a suite of adaptive mesh refinement radiation-hydrodynamic simulationsusing the orion code in which we isolate the effect of column density onfragmentation by following the collapse of clouds of varying column densitywhile holding the mass, initial density and velocity structure, and initialvirial ratio fixed. we find that radiation does not significantly modify theoverall star formation rate or efficiency, but that it suppresses fragmentationmore and more as cloud surface densities increase from those typical of lowmass star-forming regions like taurus, through the typical surface density ofmassive star-forming clouds in the galaxy, up to conditions found only in superstar clusters. in regions of low surface density, fragmentation during collapseleads to the formation of small clusters rather than individual massive starsystems, greatly reducing the fraction of the stellar population with masses &gt;~10 msun. our simulations have important implications for the formation ofmassive stars and the universality of the imf.

1003.4513	on the dynamics and evolution of gravitational instability-dominated  disks	we derive the evolution equations describing a thin axisymmetric disk of gasand stars with an arbitrary rotation curve that is kept in a state of marginalgravitational instability and energy equilibrium due to the balance betweenenergy released by accretion and energy lost due to decay of turbulence. ratherthan adopt a parameterized alpha prescription, we instead use the condition ofmarginal gravitational instability to self-consistently determine the position-and time-dependent transport rates. we show that there is a steady-stateconfiguration for disks dominated by gravitational instability, and that thissteady state persists even when star formation is taken into account if theaccretion rate is sufficiently large. for disks in this state we analyticallydetermine the velocity dispersion, surface density, and rates of mass andangular momentum transport as a function of the gas mass fraction, the rotationcurve, and the rate of external accretion onto the disk edge. we show thatdisks that are initially out of steady state will evolve into it on the viscoustimescale of the disk, which is comparable to the orbital period if theaccretion rate is high. finally, we discuss the implications of these resultsfor the structure of disks in a broad range of environments, including highredshift galaxies, the outer gaseous disks of local galaxies, and accretiondisks around protostars.

1004.2325	the atomic to molecular transition and its relation to the scaling  properties of galaxy disks in the local universe	we extend existing semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to track atomicand molecular gas in disk galaxies. simple recipes for processes such ascooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical enrichment of thestars and gas are grafted on to dark matter halo merger trees derived from themillennium simulation. each galactic disk is represented by a series ofconcentric rings. we assume that surface density profile of infalling gas in adark matter halo is exponential, with scale radius r_d that is proportional tothe virial radius of the halo times its spin parameter $\lambda$. as the darkmatter haloes grow through mergers and accretion, disk galaxies assemble fromthe inside out. we include two simple prescriptions for molecular gas formationprocesses in our models: one is based on the analytic calculations by krumholz,mckee &amp; tumlinson (2008), and the other is a prescription where the h_2fraction is determined by the kinematic pressure of the ism. motivated by theobservational results of leroy et al. (2008), we adopt a star formation law inwhich $\sigma_{sfr}\propto\sigma_{h_2}$ in the regime where the molecular gasdominates the total gas surface density, and $\sigma_{sfr}\propto\sigma_{gas}^2$ where atomic hydrogen dominates. we then fit these models tothe radial surface density profiles of stars, hi and h_2 drawn from recent highresolution surveys of stars and gas in nearby galaxies. we explore how theratios of atomic gas, molecular gas and stellar mass vary as a function ofglobal galaxy scale parameters, including stellar mass, stellar surfacedensity, and gas surface density. we elucidate how the trends can be understoodin terms of three variables that determine the partition of baryons in disks:the mass of the dark matter halo, the spin parameter of the halo, and theamount of gas recently accreted from the external environment.

1008.2383	what drives the expansion of giant hii regions?: a study of stellar  feedback in 30 doradus	observations show that star formation is an inefficient and slow process.this result can be attributed to the injection of energy and momentum by starsthat prevents free-fall collapse of molecular clouds. the mechanism of thisstellar feedback is debated theoretically: possible sources of pressure includethe classical warm hii gas, the hot gas generated by shock-heating from stellarwinds and supernovae, direct radiation of stars, and the dust-processedradiation field trapped inside the hii shell. in this paper, we measureobservationally the pressures associated with each component listed aboveacross the giant hii region 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud. weexploit high-resolution, multi-wavelengh images (radio, infrared, optical, andx-ray) to map these pressures as a function of position. we find that radiationpressure dominates within 75 pc of the central star cluster, r136, while thehii gas pressure dominates at larger radii. by contrast, the dust-processedradiation pressure and hot gas pressure are generally weak and not dynamicallyimportant, although the hot gas pressure may have played a more significantrole at early times. based on the low x-ray gas pressures, we demonstrate thatthe hot gas is only partially confined and must be leaking out the hii shell.additionally, we consider the implications of a dominant radiation pressure onthe early dynamics of 30 doradus.

1008.4137	testing models for molecular gas formation in galaxies: hydrostatic  pressure or gas and dust shielding?	stars in galaxies form in giant molecular clouds that coalesce when theatomic hydrogen is converted into molecules. there are currently two dominantmodels for what property of the galactic disk determines its molecularfraction: either hydrostatic pressure driven by the gravity of gas and stars,or a combination of gas column density and metallicity. to assess the validityof these models, we compare theoretical predictions to the observed atomic gascontent of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies with high stellar densities. theextreme conditions found in these systems are optimal to distinguish the twomodels, otherwise degenerate in nearby spirals. locally, on scales &lt;100 pc, wefind that the state of the interstellar medium is mostly sensitive to the gascolumn density and metallicity rather than hydrostatic pressure. on largerscales where the average stellar density is considerably lower, both pressureand shielding models reproduce the observations, even at low metallicity. weconclude that models based on gas and dust shielding more closely describe theprocess of molecular formation, especially at the high resolution that can beachieved in modern galaxy simulations or with future radio/millimeter arrays.

1011.4065	a comparison of methods for determining the molecular content of model  galaxies	recent observations indicate that star formation occurs only in the molecularphase of a galaxy's interstellar medium. a realistic treatment of starformation in simulations and analytic models of galaxies therefore requiresthat one determine where the transition from the atomic to molecular gasoccurs. in this paper we compare two methods for making this determination incosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds areunresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiativetransfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (uv) radiation field, anda simple time-independent analytic approximation. we show that these twomethods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities &gt;~10^-2 of the milkyway value across a very wide range of uv fields. at lower metallicities theagreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important;however, there are no observational calibrations of molecular gas content atsuch low metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. thecomparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analyticapproximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to fulltime-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer.

1101.1296	what phase of the interstellar medium correlates with the star formation  rate?	nearby spiral galaxies show an extremely tight correlation between tracers ofmolecular hydrogen (h_2) in the interstellar medium (ism) and tracers of recentstar formation, but it is unclear whether this correlation is fundamental oraccidental. in the galaxies that have been surveyed to date, h_2 residespredominantly in gravitationally bound clouds cooled by carbon monoxide (co)molecules, but in galaxies of low metal content the correlations between boundclouds, co, and h_2 break down, and it is unclear if the star formation ratewill then correlate with h_2 or with some other quantity. here we show thatstar formation will continue to follow h_2 independent of metallicity. this isnot because h_2 is directly important for cooling, but instead because thetransition from predominantly atomic hydrogen (hi) to h_2 occurs under the sameconditions as a dramatic drop in gas temperature and bonnor-ebert mass thatdestabilizes clouds and initiates collapse. we use this model to compute howstar formation rate will correlate with total gas mass, with mass of gas wherethe hydrogen is h_2, and with mass of gas where the carbon is co in galaxies ofvarying metallicity, and show that preliminary observations match the trend wepredict.

1101.3599	on the reliability of stellar ages and age spreads inferred from  pre-main sequence evolutionary models	we revisit the problem of low-mass pre-main-sequence (pms) stellar evolutionand its observational consequences for where stars fall on thehertzsprung-russell diagram (hrd). in contrast to most previous work, ourmodels follow stars as they grow from small masses via accretion, and weperform a systematic study of how the stars' hrd evolution is influenced bytheir initial radius, by the radiative properties of the accretion flow, and bythe accretion history, using both simple idealized accretion histories andhistories taken from numerical simulations of star cluster formation. wecompare our numerical results to both non-accreting isochrones and to thepositions of observed stars in the hrd, with a goal of determining whether boththe absolute ages and the age dispersions inferred from non-accretingisochrones are reliable. we show that non-accreting isochrones can sometimesoverestimate stellar ages for more massive stars (those with effectivetemperatures above \sim 3500 k), thereby explaining why non-accretingisochrones often suggest a systematic age difference between more and lessmassive stars in the same cluster. however, we also find the only way toproduce a similar overestimate for the ages of cooler stars is by selectingparameters that are strongly inconsistent with both theoretical models andobservational constraints. we therefore conclude that inferred ages and agespreads for cool stars are reliable, at least to the extent that the observedbolometric luminosities and temperatures are accurate. finally, we note thatthe time-dependence of the mass accretion rate has remarkably little effect onlow-mass stars' evolution on the hrd, and that such time-dependence may beneglected for all stars except those with effective temperatures above \sim4000 k.

1101.5172	star formation in molecular clouds	star formation is one of the least understood processes in cosmic evolution.it is difficult to formulate a general theory for star formation in partbecause of the wide range of physical processes involved. the interstellar gasout of which stars form is a supersonically turbulent plasma governed bymagnetohydrodynamics. this is hard enough by itself, since we do not understandeven subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence very well, let alone supersonic non-idealmhd turbulence. however, the behavior of star-forming clouds in the ism is alsoobviously influenced by gravity, which adds complexity, and by both continuumand line radiative processes. finally, the behavior of star-forming clouds isinfluenced by a wide variety of chemical processes, including formation anddestruction of molecules and dust grains (which changes the thermodynamicbehavior of the gas) and changes in ionization state (which alter how stronglythe gas couples to magnetic fields). as a result of these complexities, thereis nothing like a generally agreed-upon theory of star formation, as there isfor stellar structure. instead, we are forced to take a much morephenomenological approach. these notes provide an introduction to our currentthinking about how star formation works.

1102.2023	metallicity and the universality of the imf	the stellar initial mass function (imf), along with the star formation rate,is one of the fundamental properties that any theory of star formation mustexplain. an interesting feature of the imf is that it appears to be remarkablyuniversal across a wide range of environments. particularly, there appears tobe little variation in either the characteristic mass of the imf or itshigh-mass tail between clusters with different metallicities. previous attemptsto understand this apparent independence of metallicity have not accounted forradiation feedback from high-mass protostars, which can dominate the energybalance of the gas in star-forming regions. we extend this work, showing thatthe fragmentation of molecular gas should depend only weakly on the amount ofdust present, even when the primary heating source is radiation from massiveprotostars. first, we report a series of core collapse simulations using theorion amr code that systematically vary the dust opacity and show explicitlythat this has little effect on the temperature or fragmentation of the gas.then, we provide an analytic argument for why the imf varies so little inobserved star clusters, even as the metallicity varies by a factor of 100.

1103.1642	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  i. relations between h2, hi, stellar content and structural properties	we are conducting cold gass, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearbygalaxies. using the iram 30m telescope, we measure the co(1-0) line in a sampleof ~350 nearby (d=100-200 mpc), massive galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10.0). thesample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides anunbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. by combining the iram datawith sdss photometry and spectroscopy, galex imaging and high-quality arecibohi data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars,atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10l* galaxies. in this paper, we present columinosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. theoverall co detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence ofsharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surfacedensity and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurablecold gas component but above which the detection rate of the co line dropssuddenly. the mean molecular gas fraction mh2/m* of the co detections is0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is astrong function of nuv-r colour. through stacking, we set a firm upper limit ofmh2/m*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with nuv-r&gt;5.0. the averagemolecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, withsignificant scatter from one galaxy to the next. the existence of strongdetection thresholds in both the hi and co lines suggests that "quenching"processes have occurred in these systems. intriguingly, atomic gas stronglydominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie abovethese thresholds. this suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still bepossible following the quenching event.

1104.0019	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  ii. the non-universality of the molecular gas depletion timescale	we study the relation between molecular gas and star formation in avolume-limited sample of 222 galaxies from the cold gass survey, withmeasurements of the co(1-0) line from the iram 30m telescope. the galaxies areat redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05 and have stellar masses in the range10.0&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;11.5. the iram measurements are complemented by deep arecibohi observations and homogeneous sdss and galex photometry. a reference samplethat includes both uv and far-ir data is used to calibrate our estimates ofstar formation rates from the seven optical/uv bands. the mean molecular gasdepletion timescale, tdep(h2), for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 gyr,however tdep(h2) increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ~0.5 gyr forgalaxies with stellar masses of 10^10 msun to ~3 gyr for galaxies with massesof a few times 10^11 msun. in contrast, the atomic gas depletion timescaleremains contant at a value of around 3 gyr. this implies that in high massgalaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales are comparable, but inlow mass galaxies, molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly thanatomic gas. the strongest dependences of tdep(h2) are on the stellar mass ofthe galaxy (parameterized as log tdep(h2)= (0.36+/-0.07)(log m* -10.70)+(9.03+/-0.99)), and on the specific star formation rate. a singletdep(h2) versus ssfr relation is able to fit both "normal" star-forminggalaxies in our cold gass sample, as well as more extreme starburst galaxies(lirgs and ulirgs), which have tdep(h2) &lt; 10^8 yr. normal galaxies at z=1-2 aredisplaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the tdep(h2) versusssfr plane and have molecular gas depletion times that are a factor of 3-5times longer at a given value of ssfr due to their significantly larger gasfractions.

1104.1218	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of massive star formation with  protostellar outflows	we report the results of a series of amr radiation-hydrodynamic simulationsof the collapse of massive star forming clouds using the orion code. thesesimulations are the first to include the feedback effects protostellaroutflows, as well as protostellar radiative heating and radiation pressureexerted on the infalling, dusty gas. we find that that outflows evacuate polarcavities of reduced optical depth through the ambient core. these enhance theradiative flux in the poleward direction so that it is 1.7 to 15 times largerthan that in the midplane. as a result the radiative heating and outwardradiation force exerted on the protostellar disk and infalling cloud gas in theequatorial direction are greatly diminished. the simultaneously reduces theeddington radiation pressure barrier to high-mass star formation and increasesthe minimum threshold surface density for radiative heating to suppressfragmentation compared to models that do not include outflows. the strength ofboth these effects depends on the initial core surface density. lower surfacedensity cores have longer free-fall times and thus massive stars formed withinthem undergo more kelvin contraction as the core collapses, leading to morepowerful outflows. furthermore, in lower surface density clouds the ratio ofthe time required for the outflow to break out of the core to the corefree-fall time is smaller, so that these clouds are consequently influenced byoutflows at earlier stages of collapse. as a result, outflow effects arestrongest in low surface density cores and weakest in high surface density one.we also find that radiation focusing in the direction of outflow cavities issufficient to prevent the formation of radiation pressure-supportedcircumstellar gas bubbles, in contrast to models which neglect protostellaroutflow feedback.

1104.2038	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of orion-like star  clusters i. implications for the origin of the initial mass function	one model for the origin of typical galactic star clusters such as the orionnebula cluster (onc) is that they form via the rapid, efficient collapse of abound gas clump within a larger, gravitationally-unbound giant molecular cloud.however, simulations in support of this scenario have thus far have notincluded the radiation feedback produced by the stars; radiative simulationshave been limited to significantly smaller or lower density regions. here weuse the orion adaptive mesh refinement code to conduct the first everradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global collapse scenario for theformation of an onc-like cluster. we show that radiative feedback has adramatic effect on the evolution: once the first ~10-20% of the gas mass isincorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas temperaturehigh enough to suppress any further fragmentation. however, gas continues toaccrete onto existing stars, and, as a result, the stellar mass distributionbecomes increasingly top-heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with theobserved imf. systematic variation in the location of the imf peak as starformation proceeds is incompatible with the observed invariance of the imfbetween star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the imfs indifferent clusters by ensuring that star formation is always truncated when theimf peak reaches a particular value. we therefore conclude that the globalcollapse scenario, at least in its simplest form, is not compatible with theobserved stellar imf. we speculate that processes that slow down starformation, and thus reduce the accretion luminosity, may be able to resolve theproblem.

1105.3205	spin down of protostars through gravitational torques	young protostars embedded in circumstellar discs accrete from an angularmomentum-rich mass reservoir. without some braking mechanism, all stars shouldbe spinning at or near break-up velocity. in this paper, we perform simulationsof the self-gravitational collapse of an isothermal cloud using the orionadaptive mesh refinement code and investigate the role that gravitationaltorques might play in the spin-down of the dense central object. while magneticeffects likely dominate for low mass stars, high mass and population iii starsmight be less well magnetised. we find that gravitational torques alone preventthe central object from spinning up to more than half of its breakup velocity,because higher rotation rates lead to bar-like deformations that enableefficient angular momentum transfer to the surrounding medium. we also findthat the long-term spin evolution of the central object is dictated by theproperties of the surrounding disc. in particular, spiral modes with azimuthalwavenumber $m=2$ couple more effectively to its spin than the lopsided $m=1$mode, which was found to inhibit spin evolution. we suggest that even in theabsence of magnetic fields, gravitational torques may provide an upper limit onstellar spin, and that moderately massive circumstellar discs can causelong-term spin down.

0709.4252	global models for the evolution of embedded, accreting protostellar  disks	most analytic work to date on protostellar disks has focused on those inisolation from their environments. however, observations are now beginning toprobe the earliest, most embedded phases of star formation, during which disksare rapidly accreting from their parent cores and cannot be modeled inisolation. we present a simple, one-zone model of protostellar accretion diskswith high mass infall rates. our model combines a self-consistent calculationof disk temperatures with an approximate treatment of angular momentumtransport via two mechanisms. we use this model to survey the properties ofprotostellar disks across a wide range of stellar masses and evolutionarytimes, and make predictions for disks' masses, sizes, spiral structure, andfragmentation that will be directly testable by future large-scale surveys ofdeeply embedded disks. we define a dimensionless accretion-rotation parameterwhich, in conjunction with the disk's temperature, controls the disk evolution.we track the dominant mode of angular momentum transport, and demonstrate thatfor stars with final masses greater than roughly one solar mass, gravitationalinstabilities are the most important mechanism as most of the mass accumulates.we predict that binary formation through disk fission, fragmentation of thedisk into small objects, and spiral arm strength all increase in importance tohigher stellar masses.

1105.6097	the global evolution of giant molecular clouds ii: the role of accretion	we present virial models for the global evolution of giant molecular clouds.focusing on the presence of an accretion flow, and accounting for the amount ofmass, momentum, and energy supplied by accretion and star formation feedback,we are able to follow the growth, evolution, and dispersal of individual giantmolecular clouds. our model clouds reproduce the scaling relations observed inboth galactic and extragalactic clouds. we find that accretion and starformation contribute contribute roughly equal amounts of turbulent kineticenergy over the lifetime of the cloud. clouds attain virial equilibrium andgrow in such a way as to maintain roughly constant surface densities, withtypical surface densities of order 50 - 200 msun pc^-2, in good agreement withobservations of giant molecular clouds in the milky way and nearby externalgalaxies. we find that as clouds grow, their velocity dispersion and radiusmust also increase, implying that the linewidth-size relation constitutes anage sequence. lastly, we compare our models to observations of giant molecularclouds and associated young star clusters in the lmc and find good agreementbetween our model clouds and the observed relationship between h ii regions,young star clusters, and giant molecular clouds.

1105.6101	stochastic star formation and a (nearly) uniform stellar initial mass  function	recent observations indicate a lower halpha to fuv ratio in dwarf galaxiesthan in brighter systems, a trend that could be explained by a truncated and/orsteeper imf in small galaxies. however, at low star formation rates (sfrs), thehalpha to fuv ratio can vary due to stochastic sampling even for a universalimf, a hypothesis that has, prior to this work, received limited investigation.using slug, a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry in star clustersand galaxies, we compare the halpha and fuv luminosity in a sample of ~450nearby galaxies with models drawn from a universal kroupa imf and a modifiedimf, the integrated galactic initial mass function (igimf). once randomsampling and time evolution are included, a kroupa imf convolved with thecluster mass function reproduces the observed halpha distribution at all fuvluminosities, while a truncated imf as implemented in current igimf modelsunderpredicts the halpha luminosity by more than an order of magnitude at thelowest sfrs. we conclude that the observed luminosity is the result of thejoint probability distribution function of the sfr, cluster mass function, anda universal imf, consistent with parts of the igimf theory, but that atruncation in the imf in clusters is inconsistent with the observations. futurework will examine stochastic star formation and its time dependence in detailto study whether random sampling can explain other observations that suggest avarying imf.

1109.1564	on the origin of stellar masses	it has been a longstanding problem to determine, as far as possible, thecharacteristic masses of stars in terms of fundamental constants; the almostcomplete invariance of this mass as a function of the star-forming environmentsuggests that this should be possible. here i provide such a calculation. thetypical stellar mass is set by the characteristic fragment mass in astar-forming cloud, which depends on the cloud's density and temperaturestructure. except in the very early universe, the latter is determined mainlyby the radiation released as matter falls onto seed protostars. the energyyield from this process is ultimately set by the properties of deuteriumburning in protostellar cores, which determines the stars' radii. i show thatit is possible to combine these considerations to compute a characteristicstellar mass almost entirely in terms of fundamental constants, with anextremely weak residual dependence on the interstellar pressure andmetallicity. this result not only explains the invariance of stellar masses, itresolves a second mystery: why fragmentation of a cold, low-densityinterstellar cloud, a process with no obvious dependence on the properties ofnuclear reactions, happens to select a stellar mass scale such that stellarcores can ignite hydrogen. finally, the weak residual dependence on theinterstellar pressure and metallicity may explain recent observational hints ofa smaller characteristic mass in the high pressure, high metallicity cores ofgiant elliptical galaxies.

1109.4150	a universal, local star formation law in galactic clouds, nearby  galaxies, high-redshift disks, and starbursts	[abridged] while observations of local group galaxies show a very simple,local star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in eachpatch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density,recent observations of both milky way molecular clouds and high redshiftgalaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship, in which regions ofequal surface density can form stars at quite different rates. these data havebeen interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws apply indifferent circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive tolarge-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there arehigh density thresholds for star formation. here we collate resolvedobservations of milky way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of localgroup galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxiesin the local universe and at high redshift. we show that all of these data arein fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. theapparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a widevariety of 3d size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixedgas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volumedensities. we provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projectioneffect, and we show that all the data, from small solar neighborhood cloudswith masses ~10^3 msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses ~10^11 msun, fall on asingle star formation law in which the sfr is simply ~1% of the molecular gasmass per local free-fall time. in contrast, proposed star formation laws inwhich the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period orthe sfr is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density thresholdfail to match at least some of the data.

1110.3791	a general model for the co-h2 conversion factor in galaxies with  applications to the star formation law	the most common means of converting an observed co line intensity into amolecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (xco). while in themilky way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is goodreason to believe that xco will depend on the larger-scale galacticenvironment. utilising numerical models, we investigate how varyingmetallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impact theway co line emission traces the underlying h2 gas mass, and under whatcircumstances xco may differ from the galactic mean value. we find that, due tothe combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, xcois depressed below the galactic mean in high surface density environments suchas ulirgs. in contrast, in low metallicity environments, xco tends to be higherthan in the milky way, due to photodissociation of co in metal-poor clouds. athigher redshifts, gas-rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps whichare warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocitydispersions. these discs tend to have xco values ranging between present-epochgas-rich mergers and quiescent discs at low-z. this model shows that onaverage, mergers do have lower xco values than disc galaxies, though there issignificant overlap. xco varies smoothly with the local conditions within agalaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. we combine ourresults to provide a general fitting formula for xco as a function of co lineintensity and metallicity. we show that replacing the traditional approach ofusing one constant xco for starbursts and another for discs with our best-fitfunction produces star formation laws that are continuous rather than bimodal,and that have significantly reduced scatter.

1110.4645	evolution of blister-type hii regions in a magnetized medium	we use the three-dimensional athena ionizing radiation-magnetohydrodynamics(irmhd) code to simulate blister-type hii regions driven by stars on the edgeof magnetized gas clouds. we compare these to simulations of spherical hiiregions where the star is embedded deep within a cloud, and to non-magnetizedsimulations of both types, in order to compare their ability to driveturbulence and influence star formation. we find that magnetized blister hiiregions can be very efficient at injecting energy into clouds. this is partly amagnetic effect: the magnetic energy added to a cloud by an hii region iscomparable to or larger than the kinetic energy, and magnetic fields can alsohelp collimate the ejected gas, increasing its energy yield. as a result ofthese effects, a blister hii region expanding into a cloud with a magneticfield perpendicular to its edge injects twice as much energy by 5 myr as anon-magnetized blister hii region driven by a star of the same luminosity.blister hii regions are also more efficient at injecting kinetic energy thanspherical hii regions, due to the recoil provided by escaping gas, but not byas much as predicted by some analytic approximations.

1111.3693	was the sun born in a massive cluster?	a number of authors have argued that the sun must have been born in a clusterof no more than about 1000 stars, on the basis that, in a larger cluster, closeencounters between the sun and other stars would have truncated the outer solarsystem or excited the outer planets into eccentric orbits. however, thisdynamical limit is in tension with meteoritic evidence that the solar systemwas exposed to a nearby supernova during or shortly after its formation; a1000-star cluster is much too small for supernova contamination to be likely.in this paper we revisit the dynamical limit in the light of improvedobservations of the properties of young clusters. we use a series of scatteringsimulations to measure the velocity-dependent cross-section for disruption ofthe outer solar system by stellar encounters, and use this cross-section tocompute the probability of a disruptive encounter as a function of birthcluster properties. we find that, contrary to prior work, the probability ofdisruption is small regardless of the cluster mass, and that it actuallydecreases rather than increases with cluster mass. our results differ fromprior work for three main reasons: (1) unlike in most previous work, we computea velocity-dependent cross section and properly integrate over the clustermass-dependent velocity distribution of incoming stars; (2) we adoptrealistically-short cluster lifetimes of a few crossing times, rather thanassuming lifetimes of 10 to 100 myr; and (3) following recent observations, weadopt a mass-independent surface density for embedded clusters, rather than amass-independent radius as assumed many earlier papers. our results remove thetension between the dynamical limit and the meteoritic evidence, and suggestthat the sun was born in a massive cluster.

1201.0816	radiatively efficient magnetized bondi accretion	we have carried out a numerical study of the effect of large scale magneticfields on the rate of accretion from a uniform, isothermal gas onto aresistive, stationary point mass. only mass, not magnetic flux, accretes ontothe point mass. the simulations for this study avoid complications arising fromboundary conditions by keeping the boundaries far from the accreting object.our simulations leverage adaptive refinement methodology to attain high spatialfidelity close to the accreting object. our results are particularly relevantto the problem of star formation from a magnetized molecular cloud in whichthermal energy is radiated away on time scales much shorter than the dynamicaltime scale. contrary to the adiabatic case, our simulations show convergencetoward a finite accretion rate in the limit in which the radius of theaccreting object vanishes, regardless of magnetic field strength. for very weakmagnetic fields, the accretion rate first approaches the bondi value and thendrops by a factor ~ 2 as magnetic flux builds up near the point mass. forstrong magnetic fields, the steady-state accretion rate is reduced by a factor~ 0.2 \beta^{1/2} compared to the bondi value, where \beta is the ratio of thegas pressure to the magnetic pressure. we give a simple expression for theaccretion rate as a function of the magnetic field strength. approximateanalytic results are given in the appendixes for both time-dependent accretionin the limit of weak magnetic fields and steady-state accretion for the case ofstrong magnetic fields.

1201.4186	what sets the initial rotation rates of massive stars?	the physical mechanisms that set the initial rotation rates in massive starsare a crucial unknown in current star formation theory. observations of young,massive stars provide evidence that they form in a similar fashion to theirlow-mass counterparts. the magnetic coupling between a star and its accretiondisk may be sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main sequence (pms) stars towell below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rateis low. however, we show that these magnetic torques are insufficient to spindown massive pms stars due to their short formation times and high accretionrates. we develop a model for the angular momentum evolution of stars over awide range in mass, considering both magnetic and gravitational torques. wefind that magnetic torques are unable to spin down either low or high massstars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spundown significantly by magnetic torques during the end stage of their formationeither. spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes aresubstantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than currentobservations suggest.

1203.2620	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of orion-like star  clusters ii. the initial mass function from winds, turbulence, and radiation	[abridged] we report a series of simulations of the formation of a starcluster similar to the orion nebula cluster (onc), including both radiativetransfer and protostellar outflows, and starting from both smooth andself-consistently turbulent initial conditions. each simulation forms &gt;150stars and brown dwarfs, yielding a stellar mass distribution from &lt; 0.1 to &gt; 10msun. we show that a simulation that begins with self-consistently turbulenceembedded in a larger turbulent volume, and that includes protostellar outflows,produces an initial mass function (imf) consistent both with that of the oncand the galactic field. this is the first simulation published to date thatreproduces the observed imf in a cluster large enough to contain massive stars,and where the result is determined by a fully self-consistent calculation ofgas thermodynamics. this simulation also produces a star formation rate that,while still somewhat too high, is much closer to observed values than if weomit either the larger turbulent volume or the outflows. moreover, we show thatthe combination of outflows, self-consistently turbulent initial conditions,and turbulence continually fed by motions on scales larger than that of theprotocluster yields an imf that is in agreement with observations and invariantwith time, resolving the "overheating" problem in which simulations withoutthese features have an imf peak that shifts to progressively higher masses overtime. the simulation that matches the observed imf also reproduces the observedtrend of stellar multiplicity strongly increasing with mass. we show that thissimulation produces massive stars from distinct massive cores whose propertiesare consistent with those of observed massive cores. however, the stars formedin these cores also undergo dynamical interactions that naturally producetrapezium-like hierarchical multiple systems.

1203.2926	direct numerical simulation of radiation pressure-driven turbulence and  winds in star clusters and galactic disks	[abridged] the pressure exerted by the radiation of young stars may be animportant feedback mechanism in forming star clusters and the disks ofstarburst galaxies. however, there is great uncertainty in how efficientlyradiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. inparticular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,and whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise toheavily mass-loaded winds. in this paper we report a series of two-dimensionalflux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with thecode orion in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dustymatter confined by gravity. we consider both systems where the radiation fluxis sub-eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-eddington atthe midplane but sub-eddington in the atmosphere. in the latter, we find thatthe radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven rayleigh-taylorinstability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fullyexplain the turbulence seen in galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make anon-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.however, the instability also produces a channel structure in which theradiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is notfully trapped. for astrophysical parameters relevant to forming star clustersand starburst galaxies, we find that this effect reduces the net momentumdeposition rate in the dusty gas by a factor of ~2-6 compared to simpleanalytic estimates, and that in steady state the eddington ratio reaches unityand there are no strong winds. we provide an approximation formula, appropriatefor implementation in analytic models and non-radiative simulations, for theforce exerted by the infrared radiation field in this regime.

1208.1504	star formation in atomic gas	observations of nearby galaxies have firmly established, over a broad rangeof galactic environments and metallicities, that star formation occursexclusively in the molecular phase of the interstellar medium (ism).theoretical models show that this association results from the correlationbetween chemical phase, shielding, and temperature. interstellar gas convertsfrom atomic to molecular only in regions that are well shielded frominterstellar ultraviolet (uv) photons, and since uv photons are also thedominant source of interstellar heating, only in these shielded regions doesthe gas become cold enough to be subject to jeans instability. however, whilethe equilibrium temperature and chemical state of interstellar gas arewell-correlated, the time scale required to reach chemical equilibrium is muchlonger than that required to reach thermal equilibrium, and both timescales aremetallicity-dependent. here i show that the difference in time scales impliesthat, at metallicities below a few percent of the solar value, well-shieldedgas will reach low temperatures and proceed to star formation before the bulkof it is able to convert from atomic to molecular. as a result, at extremelylow metallicities, star formation will occur in a cold atomic phase of the ismrather than a molecular phase. i calculate the observable consequences of thisresult for star formation in low metallicity galaxies, and i discuss how somecurrent numerical models for h2-regulated star-formation may need to bemodified.

1210.3361	dwarf galaxies with ionizing radiation feedback. i: escape of ionizing  photons	we describe a new method for simulating ionizing radiation and supernovafeedback in the analogues of low-redshift galactic disks. in this method, whichwe call star-forming molecular cloud (sfmc) particles, we use a ray-tracingtechnique to solve the radiative transfer equation for ultraviolet photonsemitted by thousands of distinct particles on the fly. joined with highnumerical resolution of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedbackhelps to self-regulate star formation. this new feedback scheme also enables usto study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming clumps and from agalaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. bysimulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 msun, we find that the averageescape fraction from all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding thecentral 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08% and 5.9% during a ~20 myr period witha mean value of 1.1%. the flux of escaped photons from these sources is notstrongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degreefrom the galactic pole. further, we investigate the escape fraction per sfmcparticle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves as the particle ages. we discover thatthe average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number of sfmcparticles with high f_esc(i). on average, the escape fraction from a sfmcparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particlelifetime, 6 myrs. this is because sfmc particles drift away from the dense gasclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-formingclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback. the frameworkestablished in this study brings deeper insight into the physics of photonescape fraction from an individual star-forming clump, and from a galacticdisk.

1210.6988	dwarf galaxies with ionizing radiation feedback. ii: spatially-resolved  star formation relation	we investigate the spatially-resolved star formation relation using agalactic disk formed in a comprehensive high-resolution (3.8 pc) simulation.our new implementation of stellar feedback includes ionizing radiation as wellas supernova explosions, and we handle ionizing radiation by solving theradiative transfer equation rather than by a subgrid model. photoheating bystellar radiation stabilizes gas against jeans fragmentation, reducing the starformation rate. because we have self-consistently calculated the location ofionized gas, we are able to make spatially-resolved mock observations of starformation tracers, such as h-alpha emission. we can also observe how stellarfeedback manifests itself in the correlation between ionized and molecular gas.applying our techniques to the disk in a galactic halo of 2.3e11 msun, we findthat the correlation between star formation rate density (estimated from mockh-alpha emission) and molecular hydrogen density shows large scatter,especially at high resolutions of &lt;~ 75 pc that are comparable to the size ofgiant molecular clouds (gmcs). this is because an aperture of gmc size capturesonly particular stages of gmc evolution, and because h-alpha traces hot gasaround star-forming regions and is displaced from the molecular hydrogen peaksthemselves. by examining the evolving environment around star clusters, wespeculate that the breakdown of the traditional star formation laws of thekennicutt-schmidt type at small scales is further aided by a combination ofstars drifting from their birthplaces, and molecular clouds being dispersed viastellar feedback.

1211.3467	the fragmentation of magnetized, massive star-forming cores with  radiative feedback	we present a set of 3-dimensional, radiation-magnetohydrodynamic calculationsof the gravitational collapse of massive (300 msun), star-forming molecularcloud cores. we show that the combined effects of magnetic fields and radiativefeedback strongly suppress core fragmentation, leading to the production ofsingle star systems rather than small clusters. we find that the two processesare efficient at suppressing fragmentation in different regimes, with thefeedback most effective in the dense, central region and the magnetic fieldmost effective in more diffuse, outer regions. thus, the combination of the twois much more effective at suppressing fragmentation than either one consideredin isolation. our work suggests that typical massive cores, which havemass-to-flux ratios of about 2 relative to critical, likely form a single starsystem, but that cores with weaker fields may form a small star cluster. thisresult helps us understand why the observed relationship between the core massfunction and the stellar initial mass function holds even for ~100 msun coreswith many thermal jeans masses of material. we also demonstrate that a ~40 aukeplerian disk is able to form in our simulations, despite the braking effectcaused by the strong magnetic field.

0712.0828	models for the formation of massive stars	the formation of massive stars is currently an unsolved problems inastrophysics. understanding the formation of massive stars is essential becausethey dominate the luminous, kinematic, and chemical output of stars.furthermore, their feedback is likely to play a dominant role in the evolutionof molecular clouds and any subsequent star formation therein. althoughsignificant progress has been made observationally and theoretically, we stilldo not have a consensus as to how massive stars form. there are two contendingmodels to explain the formation of massive stars, core accretion andcompetitive accretion. they differ primarily in how and when the mass thatultimately makes up the massive star is gathered. in the core accretion model,the mass is gathered in a prestellar stage due to the overlying pressure of astellar cluster or a massive pre-cluster cloud clump. in contrast, competitiveaccretion envisions that the mass is gathered during the star formation processitself, being funneled to the centre of a stellar cluster by the gravitationalpotential of the stellar cluster. although these differences may not appearoverly significant, they involve significant differences in terms of thephysical processes involved. furthermore, the differences also have importantimplications in terms of the evolutionary phases of massive star formation, andultimately that of stellar clusters and star formation on larger scales. herewe review the dominant models, and discuss prospects for developing a betterunderstanding of massive star formation in the future.

1302.4440	numerical simulations of radiatively-driven dusty winds	[abridged] radiation pressure on dust grains may be an important mechanism indriving winds in a wide variety of astrophysical systems. however, theefficiency of the coupling between the radiation field and the dusty gas ispoorly understood in environments characterized by high optical depths. wepresent a series of idealized numerical experiments, performed with theradiation-hydrodynamic code orion, in which we study the dynamics of such windsand quantify their properties. we find that, after wind acceleration begins,radiation rayleigh-taylor instability forces the gas into a configuration thatreduces the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation field to the gas by afactor ~ 10 - 100 compared to an estimate based on the optical depth at thebase of the atmosphere; instead, the rate of momentum transfer from a drivingradiation field of luminosity l to the gas is roughly l/c multiplied by oneplus half the optical depth evaluated using the photospheric temperature, whichis far smaller than the optical depth one would obtain using the interiortemperature. when we apply our results to conditions appropriate to ulirgs andstar clusters, we find that the asymptotic wind momentum flux from such objectsshould not significantly exceed that carried by the direct radiation field,l/c. this result constrains the expected mass loss rates from systems thatexceed the eddington limit to be of order the so-called "single-scattering"limit, and not significantly higher. we present an approximate fitting formulafor the rate of momentum transfer from radiation to dusty gas through which itpasses, which is suitable for implementation in sub-grid models of galaxyformation. finally, we provide a first map of the column density distributionof gas in a radiatively-driven wind as a function of velocity, and velocitydispersion.

1302.4457	steady outflows in giant clumps of high-z disk galaxies during migration  and growth by accretion	we predict the evolution of giant clumps undergoing star-driven outflows inhigh-z gravitationally unstable disk galaxies. we find that the mass loss isexpected to occur through a steady wind over many tens of free-fall times (t_ff~ 10 myr) rather than by an explosive disruption in one or a few t_ff. ouranalysis is based on the finding from simulations that radiation trapping isnegligible because it destabilizes the wind (krumholz &amp; thompson 2012, 2013).each photon can therefore contribute to the wind momentum only once, so theradiative force is limited to l/c. when combining radiation, protostellar andmain-sequence winds, and supernovae, we estimate the total direct injectionrate of momentum into the outflow to be 2.5 l/c. the adiabatic phase ofsupernovae and main-sequence winds can double this rate. the resulting outflowmass-loading factor is of order unity, and if the clumps were to deplete theirgas the timescale would have been a few disk orbital times, to end with halfthe original clump mass in stars. however, the clump migration time to the diskcenter is on the order of an orbital time, about 250 myr, so the clumps areexpected to complete their migration prior to depletion. furthermore, theclumps are expected to double their mass in a disk orbital time by accretionfrom the disk and clump-clump mergers, so their mass actually grows in time andwith decreasing radius. from the 6-7 giant clumps with observed outflows, 5 areconsistent with these predictions, and one has a much higher mass-loadingfactor and momentum injection rate. the latter either indicates that theestimated outflow is an overestimate (within the 1-sigma error), that the sfrhas dropped since the time when the outflow was launched, or that the drivingmechanism is different, e.g. supernova feedback in a cavity generated by theother feedbacks.

1303.4737	line emission from radiation-pressurized hii region ii: dynamics and  population synthesis	optical and infrared emission lines from hii regions are an importantdiagnostic used to study galaxies, but interpretation of these lines requiressignificant modeling of both the internal structure and dynamical evolution ofthe emitting regions. most of the models in common use today assume that hiiregion dynamics are dominated by the expansion of stellar wind bubbles, andhave neglected the contribution of radiation pressure to the dynamics, and insome cases also to the internal structure. however, recent observations ofnearby galaxies suggest that neither assumption is justified, motivating us torevisit the question of how hii region line emission depends on the physics ofwinds and radiation pressure. in a companion paper we construct models ofsingle hii regions including and excluding radiation pressure and winds, and inthis paper we describe a population synthesis code that uses these models tosimulate galactic collections of hii regions with varying physical parameters.we show that the choice of physical parameters has significant effects ongalactic emission line ratios, and that in some cases the line ratios canexceed previously claimed theoretical limits. our results suggest that therecently-reported offset in line ratio values between high-redshiftstar-forming galaxies and those in the local universe may be partiallyexplained by the presence of large numbers of radiation pressured-dominated hiiregions within them.

1303.4742	line emission from radiation-pressurized hii regions i: internal  structure and line ratios	the emission line ratios [oiii]5007/h-beta and [nii]6584/h-alpha have beenadopted as an empirical way to distinguish between the fundamentally differentmechanisms of ionization in emission-line galaxies. however, detailedinterpretation of these diagnostics requires calculations of the internalstructure of the emitting hii regions, and these calculations depend on theassumptions one makes about the relative importance of radiation pressure andstellar winds. in this paper we construct a grid of quasi-static hii regionmodels to explore how choices about these parameters alter hii regions'emission line ratios. we find that, when radiation pressure is included in ourmodels, hii regions reach a saturation point beyond which further increases inthe luminosity of the driving stars does not produce any further increase ineffective ionization parameter, and thus does not yield any further alterationin an hii region's line ratio. we also show that, if stellar winds are assumedto be strong, the maximum possible ionization parameter is quite low. as aresult of this effect, it is inconsistent to simultaneously assume that hiiregions are wind-blown bubbles and that they have high ionization parameters;some popular hii region models suffer from this inconsistency. our work in thispaper provides a foundation for a companion paper in which we embed the modelgrids we compute here within a population synthesis code that enables us tocompute the integrated line emission from galactic populations of hii regions.

1304.7683	close stellar encounters in young, substructured, dissolving star  clusters: statistics and effects on planetary systems	both simulations and observations indicate that stars form in filamentary,hierarchically clustered associations, most of which disperse into theirgalactic field once feedback destroys their parent clouds. however, duringtheir early evolution in these substructured environments, stars can undergoclose encounters with one another that might have significant impacts on theirprotoplanetary disks or young planetary systems. we perform n-body simulationsof the early evolution of dissolving, substructured clusters with a wide rangeof properties, with the aim of quantifying the expected number and orbitalelement distributions of encounters as a function of cluster properties. weshow that the presence of substructure both boosts the encounter rate andmodifies the distribution of encounter velocities compared to what would beexpected for a dynamically relaxed cluster. however, the boost only lasts for adynamical time, and as a result the overall number of encounters expectedremains low enough that gravitational stripping is unlikely to be a significanteffect for the vast majority of star-forming environments in the galaxy. webriefly discuss the implications of this result for models of the origin of thesolar system, and of free-floating planets. we also provide tabulated encounterrates and orbital element distributions suitable for inclusion in populationsynthesis models of planet formation in a clustered environment.

0801.0442	a minimum column density of 1 g cm^-2 for massive star formation	massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them boththe only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominantenergy sources in the universe today. they form rarely because efficientradiative cooling keeps most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal asthey collapse, and this favors fragmentation into stars &lt;~1 msun. heating of acloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allowformation of massive stars, but what properties a cloud must have to formmassive stars, and thus where massive stars form in a galaxy, has not yet beendetermined. here we show that only clouds with column densities &gt;~ 1 g cm^-2can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. this threshold, and theenvironmental variation of the stellar initial mass function (imf) that itimplies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities of massive starclusters and the difference between the radial profiles of halpha and uvemission in galactic disks. the existence of a threshold also implies thatthere should be detectable variations in the imf with environment within thegalaxy and in the characteristic column densities of massive star clustersbetween galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environmentsmay have been systematically underestimated.

1305.2925	balance among gravitational instability, star formation, and accretion  determines the structure and evolution of disk galaxies	over the past 10 gyr, star-forming galaxies have changed dramatically, fromclumpy and gas rich, to rather quiescent stellar-dominated disks with specificstar formation rates lower by factors of a few tens. we present a generaltheoretical model for how this transition occurs, and what physical processesdrive it, making use of 1d axisymmetric thin disk simulations with an improvedversion of the gravitational instability-dominated galaxy evolution tool(gidget) code. we show that at every radius galaxies tend to be in a slowlyevolving equilibrium state wherein new accretion is balanced by star formation,galactic winds, and radial transport of gas through the disk by gravitationalinstability (gi) -driven torques. the gas surface density profile is determinedby which of these terms are in balance at a given radius - direct accretion isbalanced by star formation and galactic winds near galactic centers, and bytransport at larger radii. we predict that galaxies undergo a smooth transitionfrom a violent disk instability phase to secular evolution. this model providesa natural explanation for the high velocity dispersions and large clumps in z~2galaxies, the growth and subsequent quenching of bulges, and features of theneutral gas profiles of local spiral galaxies.

1309.5421	the role of stellar feedback in the dynamics of hii regions	stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxyformation models today. this uncertainty stems from a dearth of observationalconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (&lt;1 pc)where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (&gt;1 kpc) that areshaped by this feedback. to bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assessobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of hiiregions. in particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine severalstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 hii regions in the large andsmall magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively). using optical, infrared,radio, and x-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells fromthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionizedgas, and the hot x-ray emitting gas. we find that the warm ionized gasdominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two havecomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. thehot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressuresare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. we discuss the implicationsof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage fromthe hii shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processedradiation to the warm gas. furthermore, we emphasize that similar observationalwork should be done on very young hii regions to test whether direct radiationpressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.

1402.0867	the big problems in star formation: the star formation rate, stellar  clustering, and the initial mass function	star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmicevolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation ofplanets, and development of life. decades of observations have yielded avariety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have nocomprehensive, quantitative theory. in this review i discuss the current stateof the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: whatcontrols the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? what determineshow those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population endsup in gravitationally-bound structures? what determines the stellar initialmass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? i use thesethree question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginningwith a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physicalprocesses. i then review the status of current theories that attempt to solveeach of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunitiesfor theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. iconclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the comingyears.

1402.0919	massive star formation	the enormous radiative and mechanical luminosities of massive stars impact avast range of scales and processes, from the reionization of the universe, tothe evolution of galaxies, to the regulation of the interstellar medium, to theformation of star clusters, and even to the formation of planets around starsin such clusters. two main classes of massive star formation theory are underactive study, core accretion and competitive accretion. in core accretion, theinitial conditions are self-gravitating, centrally concentrated cores thatcondense with a range of masses from the surrounding, fragmenting clumpenvironment. they then undergo relatively ordered collapse via a central diskto form a single star or a small-n multiple. in this case, the pre-stellar coremass function has a similar form to the stellar initial mass function. incompetitive accretion, the material that forms a massive star is drawn morechaotically from a wider region of the clump without passing through a phase ofbeing in a massive, coherent core. in this case, massive star formation mustproceed hand in hand with star cluster formation. if stellar densities becomevery high near the cluster center, then collisions between stars may also helpto form the most massive stars. we review recent theoretical and observationalprogress towards understanding massive star formation, considering physical andchemical processes, comparisons with low and intermediate-mass stars, andconnections to star cluster formation.

1403.4605	slug - stochastically lighting up galaxies. ii: quantifying the effects  of stochasticity on star formation rate indicators	the integrated light of a stellar population, measured through photometricfilters that are sensitive to the presence of young stars, is often used toinfer the star formation rate (sfr) for that population. however, thesetechniques rely on an assumption that star formation is a continuous process,whereas in reality stars form in discrete spatially- and temporally-correlatedstructures. this discreteness causes the light output to undergo significanttime-dependent fluctuations, which, if not accounted for, introduce systematicerrors in the inferred sfrs due to the intrinsic distribution of luminositiesat any fix sfr. we use slug, a code that stochastically lights up galaxies, tosimulate galaxies undergoing stochastic star formation. we then use thesesimulations to present a quantitative analysis of these effects and providetools for calculating probability distribution functions of sfrs given a set ofobservations. we show that, depending on the sfr tracer used, stochasticfluctuations can produce non-trivial errors at sfrs as high as 1 m/yr, andbiases &gt;0.5 dex at the lowest sfrs. we emphasize that due to the stochasticbehavior of blue sfr tracers, one cannot assign a deterministic single value tothe sfr of an individual galaxy, but we suggest methods by which futureanalyses that rely on integrated-light indicators can properly account forthese stochastic effects.

1405.1427	gone with the wind: where is the missing stellar wind energy from  massive star clusters?	star clusters larger than $\sim 10^{3}$ $m_\odot$ contain multiple hot starsthat launch fast stellar winds. the integrated kinetic energy carried by thesewinds is comparable to that delivered by supernova explosions, suggesting thatat early times winds could be an important form of feedback on the surroundingcold material from which the star cluster formed. however, the interaction ofthese winds with the surrounding clumpy, turbulent, cold gas is complex andpoorly understood. here we investigate this problem via an accounting exercise:we use empirically determined properties of four well-studied massive starclusters to determine where the energy injected by stellar winds ultimatelyends up. we consider a range of kinetic energy loss channels, includingradiative cooling, mechanical work on the cold interstellar medium, thermalconduction, heating of dust via collisions by the hot gas, and bulk advectionof thermal energy by the hot gas. we show that, for at least some of theclusters, none of these channels can account for more than a small fraction ofthe injected energy. we suggest that turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interfaceor physical leakage of the hot gas from the hii region can efficiently removethe kinetic energy injected by the massive stars in young star clusters. evenfor the clusters where we are able to account for all the injected kineticenergy, we show that our accounting sets strong constraints on the importanceof stellar winds as a mechanism for feedback on the cold interstellar medium.

1406.6691	vader: a flexible, robust, open-source code for simulating viscous thin  accretion disks	the evolution of thin axisymmetric viscous accretion disks is a classicproblem in astrophysics. while models based on this simplified geometry provideonly approximations to the true processes of instability-driven mass andangular momentum transport, their simplicity makes them invaluable tools forboth semi-analytic modeling and simulations of long-term evolution where two-or three-dimensional calculations are too computationally costly. despite theutility of these models, the only publicly-available frameworks for simulatingthem are rather specialized and non-general. here we describe a highlyflexible, general numerical method for simulating viscous thin disks witharbitrary rotation curves, viscosities, boundary conditions, grid spacings,equations of state, and rates of gain or loss of mass (e.g., through winds) andenergy (e.g., through radiation). our method is based on a conservative,finite-volume, second-order accurate discretization of the equations, which wesolve using an unconditionally-stable implicit scheme. we implement andersonacceleration to speed convergence of the scheme, and show that this leads tofactor of $\sim 5$ speed gains over non-accelerated methods in realisticproblems, though the amount of speedup is highly problem-dependent. we haveimplemented our method in the new code viscous accretion disk evolutionresource (vader), which is freely available for download fromhttps://bitbucket.org/krumholz/vader/ under the terms of the gnu general publiclicense.

1408.6543	early turbulent mixing as the origin of chemical homogeneity in open  star clusters	the abundances of elements in stars are a critical clue to their origins.observed star-to-star variations in logarithmic abundance within an opencluster are typically only $\sim 0.01-0.05$ over many elements, significantlysmaller than the variation of $\sim 0.06-0.3$ seen in the interstellar mediumfrom which the stars form. it is unknown why clusters are so homogenous, andwhether homogeneity should also prevail in regions of lower star formationefficiency that do not produce bound clusters. here we report adaptive meshsimulations using passively-advected scalars in order to trace the mixing ofchemical elements as star-forming clouds form and collapse. we show thatturbulent mixing during cloud assembly naturally produces a stellar abundancescatter at least ~5 times smaller than that in the gas, sufficient to fullyexplain the observed chemical homogeneity of stars. moreover, mixing occursvery early, so that regions with efficiencies $\varepsilon \sim 10\%$ arenearly as well-mixed as those with $\varepsilon\sim 50\%$. this implies thateven regions that do not form bound clusters are likely to be well-mixed, andenhances the prospects for using chemical tagging to reconstruct dissolved starclusters via their unique chemical signatures.

1411.1769	sub-eddington star-forming regions are super-eddington: momentum driven  outflows from supersonic turbulence	we show that the turbulent gas in the star-forming regions of galaxies isunstable to wind formation via momentum deposition by radiation pressure orother momentum sources like supernova explosions, even if the system is belowthe average eddington limit. this conclusion follows from the fact that thecritical momentum injection rate per unit mass for unbinding gas from aself-gravitating system is proportional to the gas surface density and that aturbulent medium presents a broad distribution of column densities to thesources. for an average eddington ratio of &lt;gamma&gt;~0.1 and for turbulent machnumbers &gt;30, we find that ~1% of the gas is ejected per dynamical timescale atvelocities larger than the local escape velocity. because of the lognormalshape of the surface density distribution, the mass loss rate is highlysensitive to the average eddington ratio, reaching 20-40% of the gas mass perdynamical time for &lt;gamma&gt;=1. using this model we find a large scatter in themass-loading factor for star-forming galaxies, ranging from 0.001-10, but withsignificant uncertainties. implications for the efficiency of star formation ingiant molecular clouds are highlighted. for radiation pressure feedback alone,we find an increasing star formation efficiency as a function of initial gassurface density. uncertainties are discussed.

1411.7585	mixing and transport of metals by gravitational instability-driven  turbulence in galactic discs	metal production in galaxies traces star formation, and is highlyconcentrated toward the centers of galactic discs. this suggests that galaxiesshould have inhomogeneous metal distributions with strong radial gradients, butobservations of present-day galaxies show only shallow gradients with littleazimuthal variation, implying the existence of a redistribution mechanism. westudy the role of gravitational instability-driven turbulence as a mixingmechanism by simulating an isolated galactic disc at high resolution, includingmetal fields treated as passive scalars. since any cylindrical field can bedecomposed into a sum of fourier-bessel basis functions, we set up initialmetal fields characterized by these functions and study how different modesmix. we find both shear and turbulence contribute to mixing, but the mixingstrongly depends on the symmetries of the mode. non-axisymmetric modes havedecay times smaller than the galactic orbital period because shear winds themup to small spatial scales, where they are erased by turbulence. the decaytimescales for axisymmetric modes are much greater, though for all but thelargest-scale inhomogeneities the mixing timescale is still short enough toerase chemical inhomogeneities over cosmological times. these differenttimescales provide an explanation for why galaxies retain metallicity gradientswhile there is almost no variation at a fixed radius. moreover, thecomparatively long timescales required for mixing axisymmetric modes mayexplain the greater diversity of metallicity gradients observed in highredshift galaxies as compared to local ones: these systems have not yet reachedequilibrium between metal production and diffusion.

1505.07111	a dynamical model for the formation of gas rings and episodic starbursts  near galactic centres	we develop a simple dynamical model for the evolution of gas in the centresof barred spiral galaxies, using the milky way's central molecular zone (cmz,i.e., the central few hundred pc) as a case study. we show that, in thepresence of a galactic bar, gas in a disc in the central regions of a galaxywill be driven inwards by angular momentum transport induced by acousticinstabilities within the bar's inner lindblad resonance. this transport processdrives turbulence within the gas that temporarily keeps it stronglygravitationally stable and prevents the onset of rapid star formation. however,at some point the rotation curve must transition from approximately flat toapproximately solid body, and the resulting reduction in shear reduces thetransport rates and causes gas to build up, eventually producing agravitationally-unstable region that is subject to rapid and violent starformation. for the observed rotation curve of the milky way, the accumulationhappens $\sim 100$ pc from the centre of the galaxy, in good agreement with theobserved location of gas clouds and young star clusters in the cmz. thecharacteristic timescale for gas accumulation and star formation is of order$10-20$ myr. we argue that similar phenomena should be ubiquitous in otherbarred spiral galaxies.

0704.0792	the relationship between molecular gas tracers and kennicutt-schmidt  laws	we provide a model for how kennicutt-schmidt (ks) laws, which describe thecorrelation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. we show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the ks law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. high critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. we show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the co(1-&gt;0) and hcn(1-&gt;0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. we predictthat ir-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. this prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as hco^+(1-&gt;0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by hcn(1-&gt;0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. recent observations by gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope. we argue that deviations from linearity inthe hcn(1-&gt;0)-ir correlation at high luminosity are consistent with theassumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

astro-ph;0312612	embedding lagrangian sink particles in eulerian grids	we introduce a new computational method for embedding lagrangian sinkparticles into an eulerian calculation. simulations of gravitational collapseor accretion generally produce regions whose density greatly exceeds the meandensity in the simulation. these dense regions require extremely small timesteps to maintain numerical stability. smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)codes approach this problem by introducing non-gaseous, accreting sinkparticles, and eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. however, untilnow there has been no approach that allows eulerian codes to follow accretiononto multiple, moving objects. we have removed that limitation by extending thesink particle capability to eulerian hydrodynamics codes. we have tested thisnew method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analyticsolutions. in analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method forevaluating the disk viscosity parameter $\alpha$ due to the numerical viscosityof a hydrodynamics code, and use it to compute $\alpha$ for our cartesian amrcode. we also present a simple application of this new method: studying thetransition from bondi to bondi-hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits aparticle undergoing bondi accretion.

astro-ph;0409454	bondi accretion in the presence of vorticity	the classical bondi-hoyle formula gives the accretion rate onto a pointparticle of a gas with a uniform density and velocity. however, the bondi-hoyleproblem considers only gas with no net vorticity, while in a real astrophysicalsituation accreting gas invariably has at least a small amount of vorticity. wetherefore consider the related case of accretion of gas with constantvorticity, for the cases of both small and large vorticity. we confirm thefindings of earlier two dimensional simulations that even a small amount ofvorticity can substantially change both the accretion rate and the morphologyof the gas flow lines. we show that in three dimensions the resulting flowfield is non-axisymmetric and time dependent. the reduction in accretion rateis due to an accumulation of circulation near the accreting particle. using acombination of simulations and analytic treatment, we provide an approximateformula for the accretion rate of gas onto a point particle as a function ofthe vorticity of the surrounding gas.

astro-ph;0510410	bondi-hoyle accretion in a turbulent medium	the bondi-hoyle formula gives the approximate accretion rate onto a pointparticle accreting from a uniform medium. however, in many situations accretiononto point particles occurs from media that are turbulent rather than uniform.in this paper, we give an approximate solution to the problem of a pointparticle accreting from an ambient medium of supersonically turbulent gas.accretion in such media is bimodal, at some points resembling classicalbondi-hoyle flow, and in other cases being closer to the vorticity-dominatedaccretion flows recently studied by krumholz, mckee, &amp; klein. based on thisobservation, we develop a theoretical prediction for the accretion rate, andconfirm that our predictions are highly consistent with the results ofnumerical simulations. the distribution of accretion rates is lognormal, andthe mean accretion rate in supersonically turbulent gas can be substantiallyenhanced above the value that would be predicted by a naive application of thebondi-hoyle formula. however, it can also be suppressed by the vorticity, justas krumholz, mckee, &amp; klein found for non-supersonic vorticity-dominated flows.magnetic fields, which we have not included in these models, may furtherinhibit accretion. our results have significant implications for a numberastrophysical problems, ranging from star formation to the black holes ingalactic centers. in particular, there are likely to be significant errors inresults that assume that accretion from turbulent media occurs at theunmodified bondi-hoyle rate, or that are based on simulations that do notresolve the bondi-hoyle radius of accreting objects.

astro-ph;0510412	stars form by gravitational collapse, not competitive accretion	there are now two dominant models of how stars form: gravitational collapsetheory holds that star-forming molecular clumps, typically hundreds tothousands of solar masses in mass, fragment into gaseous cores thatsubsequently collapse to make individual stars or small multiple systems. incontrast, competitive accretion theory suggests that at birth all stars aremuch smaller than the typical stellar mass (~0.5 solar masses), and that finalstellar masses are determined by the subsequent accretion of unbound gas fromthe clump. competitive accretion models explain brown dwarfs and free-floatingplanets as protostars ejected from star-forming clumps before accreting muchmass, predicting that they should lack disks, have high velocity dispersions,and form more frequently in denser clumps. they also predict that mean stellarmass should vary within the galaxy. here we derive a simple estimate for therate of competitive accretion as a function of the star-forming environment,based partly on simulations, and determine in what types of environmentscompetitive accretion can occur. we show that no observed star-forming regionproduces significant competitive accretion, and that simulations that showcompetitive accretion do so because their properties differ from thosedetermined by observation. our result shows that stars form by gravitationalcollapse, and explains why observations have failed to confirm predictions ofthe competitive accretion scenario.

astro-ph;0511766	massive star formation: a tale of two theories	the physical mechanism that allows massive stars to form is a major unsolvedproblem in astrophysics. stars with masses $\gtsim 20$ $\msun$ reach the mainsequence while still embedded in their natal clouds, and the immense radiationoutput they generate once fusion begins can exert a force stronger than gravityon the dust and gas around them. they also produce huge lyman continuumluminosities, which can ionize and potentially unbind their parent clouds. thismakes massive star formation a more daunting problem than the formation of lowmass stars. in this review i present the current state of the field, anddiscuss the two primary approaches to massive star formation. one holds thatthe most massive stars form by direct collisions between lower mass stars andtheir disks. the other approach is to see if the radiation barrier can beovercome by improved treatment of the radiation-hydrodynamic accretion process.i discuss the theoretical background to each model, the observationalpredictions that can be used to test them, and the substantial parts of theproblem that neither theory has fully addressed.

astro-ph;0603026	radiation feedback and fragmentation in massive protostellar cores	star formation generally proceeds inside-out, with overdense regions insideprotostellar cores collapsing rapidly and progressively less dense regionsfollowing later. consequently, a small protostar will form early in theevolution of a core, and collapsing material will fall to the protostellarsurface and radiate away its gravitational potential energy. the resultingaccretion luminosity will heat the core and may substantially affect theprocess of fragmentation. this is of particular interest for massive coresthat, at their initial temperatures, have masses much greater than a thermaljeans mass and thus might be expected to fragment into many stars duringcollapse. here i show that accretion luminosity can heat the inner parts of acore to &gt;100 k very early in the star formation process, and that this in turnstrongly suppresses fragmentation. this has implications for a number ofoutstanding problems in star formation, including the mechanism of massive starformation, the origin of the stellar initial mass function and its relationshipto the core mass function, the demographics of massive binaries, and theequation of state in star-forming gas.

astro-ph;0606277	slow star formation in dense gas: evidence and implications	it has been known for more than 30 years that star formation in giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) is slow, in the sense that only ~1% of the gas formsstars every free-fall time. this result is entirely independent of anyparticular model of molecular cloud lifetime or evolution. here we surveyobservational data on higher density objects in the interstellar medium,including infrared dark clouds and dense molecular clumps, to determine ifthese objects form stars slowly like gmcs, or rapidly, converting a significantfraction of their mass into stars in one free-fall time. we find no evidencefor a transition from slow to rapid star formation in structures covering threeorders of magnitude in density. this has important implications for models ofstar formation, since competing models make differing predictions for thecharacteristic density at which star formation should transition from slow torapid. the data are inconsistent with models that predict that star clustersform rapidly and in free-fall collapse. magnetic- and turbulence-regulated starformation models can reproduce the observations qualitatively, and theturbulence-regulated star formation model of krumholz &amp; mckee quantitativelyreproduces the infrared-hcn luminosity correlation recently reported by gao &amp;solomon. slow star formation also implies that the process of star clusterformation cannot be one of global collapse, but must instead proceed over manyfree-fall times. this suggests that turbulence in star-forming clumps must bedriven, and that the competitive accretion mechanism does not operate intypical cluster-forming molecular clumps.

astro-ph;0607429	high mass star formation by gravitational collapse of massive cores	the current generation of millimeter interferometers have revealed apopulation of compact (r &lt;~ 0.1 pc), massive (m ~ 100 msun) gas cores that arethe likely progenitors of massive stars. i review models for the evolution ofthese objects from the observed massive core phase through collapse and intomassive star formation, with particular attention to the least well-understoodaspects of the problem: fragmentation during collapse, interactions of newbornstars with the gas outside their parent core, and the effects of radiationpressure feedback. through a combination of observation, analytic argument, andnumerical simulation, i develop a model for massive star formation bygravitational collapse in which massive cores collapse to produce single starsor (more commonly) small-multiple systems, and these stars do not gainsignificant mass from outside their parent core by accretion of either gas orother stars. collapse is only very slightly inhibited by feedback from themassive star, thanks to beaming of the radiation by a combination ofprotostellar outflows and radiation-hydrodynamic instabilities. based on thesefindings, i argue that many of the observed properties of young star clusterscan be understood as direct translations of the properties of their gas phaseprogenitors. finally, i discuss unsolved problems in the theory of massive starformation, and directions for future work on them.

astro-ph;0608471	the global evolution of giant molecular clouds. i: model formulation and  quasi-equilibrium behavior	we present semi-analytic dynamical models for giant molecular clouds evolvingunder the influence of hii regions launched by newborn star clusters. incontrast to previous work, we neither assume that clouds are in virial orenergetic equilibrium, nor do we ignore the effects of star formation feedback.the clouds, which we treat as spherical, can expand and contract homologously.photoionization drives mass ejection; the recoil of cloud material both stirsturbulent motions and leads to an effective confining pressure. the balancebetween these effects and the decay of turbulent motions through isothermalshocks determines clouds' dynamical and energetic evolution. we find that forrealistic values of the rates of turbulent dissipation, photoevaporation, andenergy injection by hii regions, the massive clouds where most molecular gas inthe galaxy resides live for a few crossing times, in good agreement with recentobservational estimates that large clouds in local group galaxies surviveroughly 20-30 myr. during this time clouds remain close to equilibrium, withvirial parameters of 1-3 and column densities near 10^22 h atoms cm^-2, also inagreement with observed cloud properties. over their lives they convert 5-10%of their mass into stars, after which point most clouds are destroyed when alarge hii region unbinds them. in contrast, small clouds like those found inthe solar neighborhood only survive ~1 crossing time before being destroyed.

astro-ph;0609798	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of collapse and fragmentation in  massive protostellar cores	we simulate the early stages of the evolution of turbulent, virialized,high-mass protostellar cores, with primary attention to how cores fragment, andwhether they form a small or large number of protostars. our simulations usethe orion adaptive mesh refinement code to follow the collapse from ~0.1 pcscales to ~10 au scales, for durations that cover the main fragmentation phase,using three-dimensional gravito-radiation hydrodynamics. we find that for awide range of initial conditions radiation feedback from accreting protostarsinhibits the formation of fragments, so that the vast majority of the collapsedmass accretes onto one or a few objects. most of the fragmentation that doesoccur takes place in massive, self-shielding disks. these are driven togravitational instability by rapid accretion, producing rapid mass and angularmomentum transport that allows most of the gas to accrete onto the central starrather than forming fragments. in contrast, a control run using the sameinitial conditions but an isothermal equation of state produces much morefragmentation, both in and out of the disk. we conclude that massive cores withobserved properties are not likely to fragment into many stars, so that, atleast at high masses, the core mass function probably determines the stellarinitial mass function. our results also demonstrate that simulations of massivestar forming regions that do not include radiative transfer, and instead relyon a barotropic equation of state or optically thin heating and cooling curves,are likely to produce misleading results.

astro-ph;0610526	turbulence, feedback, and slow star formation	one of the outstanding puzzles about star formation is why it proceeds soslowly. giant molecular clouds convert only a few percent of their gas intostars per free-fall time, and recent observations show that this low starformation rate is essentially constant over a range of scales from individualcluster-forming molecular clumps in the milky way to entire starburst galaxies.this striking result is perhaps the most basic fact that any theory of starformation must explain. i argue that a model in which star formation occurs invirialized structures at a rate regulated by supersonic turbulence can explainthis observation. the turbulence in turn is driven by star formation feedback,which injects energy to offset radiation from isothermal shocks and keepsstar-forming structures from wandering too far from virial balance. this modelis able to reproduce observational results covering a wide range of scales,from the formation times of young clusters to the extragalactic ir-hcncorrelation, and makes additional quantitative predictions that will betestable in the next few years.

0811.0004	the atomic to molecular transition in galaxies. ii: hi and h_2 column  densities	gas in galactic disks is collected by gravitational instabilities into giantatomic-molecular complexes, but only the inner, molecular parts of thesestructures are able to collapse to form stars. determining what controls theratio of atomic to molecular hydrogen in complexes is therefore a significantproblem in star formation and galactic evolution. in this paper we use themodel of h_2 formation, dissociation, and shielding developed in the previouspaper in this series to make theoretical predictions for atomic to molecularratios as a function of galactic properties. we find that the molecularfraction in a galaxy is determined primarily by its column density andsecondarily by its metallicity, and is to good approximation independent of thestrength of the interstellar radiation field. we show that the column of atomichydrogen required to shield a molecular region against dissociation is ~10 msunpc^-2 at solar metallicity. we compare our model to data from recent surveys ofthe milky way and of nearby galaxies, and show that the both the primarydependence of molecular fraction on column density and the secondary dependenceon metallicity that we predict are in good agreement with observed galaxyproperties.
