0911.2697	the atesp 5 ghz radio survey. iii. 4.8, 8.6 and 19 ghz follow-up  observations of radio galaxies	[abridged] physical and evolutionary properties of the sub-mjy radiopopulation are not entirely known. the radio/optical analysis of the atesp 5ghz sample has revealed a significant class of compact flat/invertedradio-spectrum sources associated to early-type galaxies up to redshift 2. suchsources are most plausibly triggered by an agn, but their observationalproperties are not entirely consistent with those of standard radio galaxypopulations. in the present work we aim at a better understanding of the radiospectra of such sources and ultimately of the nature of agns at sub-mjy fluxlevels. we used the atca to get multi-frequency (4.8, 8.6 and 19 ghz)quasi-simultaneous observations for a representative sub-sample of atesp radiosources associated with early-type galaxies (26 objects with s&gt;0.6 mjy). thiscan give us insight into the accretion/radiative mechanism that is at work,since different regimes display different spectral signatures in the radiodomain. from the analysis of the radio spectra, we find that our sources aremost probably jet-dominated systems. adaf models are ruled out by the highfrequency data, while adaf+jet scenarios are still consistent withflat/moderately inverted-spectrum sources, but are not required to explain thedata. we compared our sample with high (&gt;20 ghz) frequency selected surveys,finding spectral properties very similar to the ones of much brighter (s&gt;500mjy) radio galaxies extracted from the massardi et al. (2008) sample. linearsizes of atesp 5 ghz sources associated with early type galaxies are also oftenconsistent with the ones of brighter b2 and 3c radio galaxies, with possibly avery compact component that could be associated at least in part to (obscured)radio-quiet quasar-like objects and/or low power bl lacs.

0911.4571	atlbs: the australia telescope low-brightness survey	we present a radio survey carried out with the australia telescope compactarray. a motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of thediffuse emission components as a step towards a study of the cosmic evolutionin radio source structure and the contribution from radio-mode feedback ongalaxy evolution. the australia telescope low-brightness survey (atlbs) at 1388mhz covers 8.42 sq deg of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield imageswith exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. the atlbsradio images, made with 0.08 mjy/beam rms noise and 50" beam, detect a total of1094 sources with peak flux exceeding 0.4 mjy/beam. the atlbs source countswere corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beamattenuation; the normalized differential source counts are consistent with noupturn down to 0.6 mjy. the percentage integrated polarization pi_0 wascomputed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarizedintensity; pi_0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing flux density.simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images,with 5" beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. theobservations provide a measurement of the complexity and diffuse emissionassociated with mjy and sub-mjy radio sources. 10% of the atlbs sources havemore than half of their flux density in extended emission and the fractionalflux in diffuse components does not appear to vary with flux density, althoughthe percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with fluxdensity. the observations are consistent with a transition in the nature ofextended radio sources from fr-ii radio source morphology, which dominates themjy population, to fr-i structure at sub-mjy flux density.

0912.4441	the exploration of the unknown	the discovery of cosmic radio emission by karl jansky in the course ofsearching for the source of interference to telephone communications and theinstrumental advances which followed, have led to a series of new paradigmchanging astronomical discoveries. these discoveries, which to a large extentdefine much of modern astrophysical research were the result of the rightpeople being in the right place at the right time using powerful newinstruments, which in many cases they had designed and built. they were not theresult of trying to test any particular theoretical model or trying to answerpreviously posed questions, but they opened up whole new areas of explorationand discovery. rather many important discoveries came from military orcommunications research; others while looking for something else; and yetothers from just looking. traditionally, the designers of big telescopesinvariably did not predict what the telescopes would ultimately be known for.the place in history of the next generation of telescopes will not likely befound in the science case created to justify their construction, but in theunexpected new phenomena, new theories, and new ideas which will emerge fromthese discoveries. it is important that those who are in a position to filterresearch proposals and plans not dismiss as butterfly collecting,investigations which explore new areas without having predefined the resultthey are looking for. progress must also allow for new discoveries, as well asfor the explanation of old discoveries. new telescopes need to be designed withthe flexibility to make new discoveries which will invariably raise newquestions and new problems.

1202.0134	high resolution imaging of the atlbs regions: the radio source counts	the australia telescope low-brightness survey (atlbs; \cite{sess10}) regionshave been mosaic imaged at a radio frequency of 1.4 ghz with $6\arcsec$ angularresolution and 72 $\mu$jy beam$^{-1}$ rms noise. the images (centered at ra:$00^{h}\ 35^{m}\ 00^{s}$, dec: $-67^{\circ}\ 00^{'}\ 00^{"}$ and ra: $00^{h}\59^{m}\ 17^{s}$, dec: $-67^{\circ}\ 00^{'}\ 00^{"}$ (j2000 epoch)) cover 8.42square degrees sky area and have no artifacts or imaging errors above the imagethermal noise. multi-resolution radio and optical r-band images (made using the4-m ctio blanco telescope) were used to recognize multi-component sources andprepare a source list; the detection threshold was 0.38 mjy in a low resolutionradio image made with beam fwhm of $50\arcsec$. radio source counts in the fluxdensity range 0.4-8.7 mjy are estimated, with corrections applied for noisebias, effective area correction and resolution bias. the resolution bias ismitigated using low resolution radio images, while effects of source confusionare removed by using high resolution images for identifying blended sources.below 1 mjy the atlbs counts are systematically lower than the previousestimates. showing no evidence for an upturn down to 0.4 mjy, they do notrequire any changes in the radio source population down to the limit of thesurvey. the work suggests that automated image analysis for counts may bedependent on the ability of the imaging to reproduce connecting emission withlow surface brightness and on the ability of the algorithm to recognizesources, which may require that source finding algorithms effectively work withmulti-resolution and multi-wavelength data. the work underscores the importanceof using source lists-as opposed to component lists-and correcting for thenoise bias in order to precisely estimate counts close to the image noise anddetermine the upturn at sub-mjy flux density.

1202.5406	spectral properties and the effect on redshift cut-off of compact agns  from the at20g survey	we use high angular resolution data, measured from visibility of sources atthe longest baseline of 4500 m of the australia telescope compact array (atca),for the australia telescope 20 ghz (at20g) survey to obtain angular sizeinformation for &gt; 94% of at20g sources. we confirm the previous at20g resultthat due to the high survey frequency of 20 ghz, the source population isstrongly dominated by compact sources (79%). at 0.15 arcseconds angularresolution limit, we show a very strong correlation between the compact andextended sources with flat and steep-spectrum sources respectively. thus, weprovide a firm physical basis for the traditional spectral classification intoflat and steep-spectrum sources to separate compact and extended sources. wefind the cut-off of -0.46 to be optimum for spectral indices between 1 and 5ghz and, hence, recommend the continued use of -0.5 for future studies.  we study the effect of spectral curvature on redshift cut-off of compact agnsusing recently published redshift data. using spectral indices at differentfrequencies, we correct for the redshift effect and produce restframe frequencyspectra for compact sources for redshift up to ~5. we show that the flatspectra of most compact sources start to steepen at ~30 ghz. at higherfrequencies, the spectra of both populations are steep so the use of spectralindex does not separate the compact and extended source populations as well asin lower frequencies. we find that due to the spectral steepening, surveys ofcompact sources at higher frequencies (&gt;5 ghz) will have redshift cut-off dueto spectral curvature but at lower frequencies, the surveys are notsignificantly affected by spectral curvature, thus, the evidence for a strongredshift cut-off in agns found in lower frequency surveys is a real cut-off andnot a result of k-correction.

0710.5682	the atesp 5 ghz radio survey. ii. physical properties of the faint radio  population	one of the most debated issues about sub-mjy radio sources, which areresponsible for the steepening of the 1.4 ghz source counts, is the origin oftheir radio emission. particularly interesting is the possibility of combiningradio spectral index information with other observational properties to assesswhether the sources are triggered by star formation or nuclear activity. theaim of this work is to study the optical and near infrared properties of acomplete sample of 131 radio sources with s&gt;0.4 mjy, observed at both 1.4 and 5ghz as part of the atesp radio survey. we use deep multi-colour (ubvrijk)images, mostly taken in the framework of the eso deep public survey, tooptically identify and derive photometric redshifts for the atesp radiosources. deep optical coverage and extensive colour information are availablefor 3/4 of the region covered by the radio sample. typical depths of the imagesare u~25, b~26, v~25.4, r~25.5, i~24.3, 19.5&lt;k_s&lt;20.2, j&lt;22.2. optical/nearinfrared counterparts are found for ~78% (66/85) of the radio sources in theregion covered by the deep multi-colour imaging, and for 56 of these reliableestimates of the redshift and type are derived. we find that many of thesources with flat radio spectra are characterised by high radio-to-opticalratios (r&gt;1000), typical of classical powerful radio galaxies and quasars.flat-spectrum sources with low r values are preferentially identified withearly type galaxies, where the radio emission is most probably triggered bylow-luminosity active galactic nuclei. considering both early type galaxies andquasars as sources with an active nucleus, such sources largely dominate oursample (78%). flat-spectrum sources associated with early type galaxies arequite compact (d&lt;10-30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radio emission.

1203.2706	on the reliability of polarization estimation using rotation measure  synthesis	we benchmark the reliability of the rotation measure (rm) synthesis algorithmusing the 1005 centaurus a field sources of feain et al. (2009). the rmsynthesis solutions are compared with estimates of the polarization parametersusing traditional methods. this analysis provides verification of thereliability of rm synthesis estimates. we show that estimates of thepolarization parameters can be made at lower s/n if the range of rms isbounded, but reliable estimates of individual sources with unusual rms requireunconstrainted solutions and higher s/n.  we derive from first principles the statistical properties of thepolarization amplitude associated with rm synthesis in the presence of noise.the amplitude distribution depends explicitly on the amplitude of theunderlying (intrinsic) polarization signal. hence it is necessary to model theunderlying polarization signal distribution in order to estimate thereliability and errors in polarization parameter estimates. we introduce abayesian method to derive the distribution of intrinsic amplitudes based on thedistribution of measured amplitudes.  the theoretically-derived distribution is compared with the empirical data toprovide quantitative estimates of the probability that an rm synthesis solutionis correct as a function of s/n. we provide quantitative estimates of theprobability that any given rm synthesis solution is correct as a function ofmeasured polarized amplitude and the intrinsic polarization amplitude comparedto the noise.

0711.2627	observability of the virialization phase of spheroidal galaxies with  radio arrays	in the standard galaxy formation scenario plasma clouds with a high thermalenergy content must exist at high redshifts since the proto-galactic gas isshock heated to the virial temperature, and extensive cooling, leading toefficient star formation, must await the collapse of massive halos (asindicated by the massive body of evidence, referred to as "downsizing").massive plasma clouds are potentially observable through the thermal andkinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effects and their free-free emission. we find thatthe detection of substantial numbers of galaxy-scale thermal sz signals isachievable by blind surveys with next generation radio telescope arrays such asevla, alma and ska. this population is even detectable with the 10% ska, andwide field of view options at high frequency on any of these arrays wouldgreatly increase survey speed. an analysis of confusion effects and of thecontamination by radio and dust emissions shows that the optimal frequenciesare those in the range 10-35 ghz. predictions for the redshift distributions ofdetected sources are also worked out.

1301.1400	thermal plasma in the giant lobes of the radio galaxy centaurus a	we present a faraday rotation measure (rm) study of the diffuse, polarized,radio emission from the giant lobes of the nearest radio galaxy, centaurus a.after removal of the smooth galactic foreground rm component, using an ensembleof background source rms located outside the giant lobes, we are left with aresidual rm signal associated with the giant lobes. we find the most likelyorigin of this residual rm is from thermal material mixed throughout therelativistic lobe plasma. the alternative possibility of a thin-skin/boundarylayer of magnetoionic material swept up by the expansion of the lobes is highlyunlikely since it requires, at least, an order of magnitude enhancement of theswept up gas over the expected intragroup density on these scales. strongdepolarisation observed from 2.3 to 0.96 ghz also supports the presence of asignificant amount of thermal gas within the lobes; although depolarisationsolely due to rm fluctuations in a foreground faraday screen on scales smallerthan the beam cannot be ruled out. considering the internal faraday rotationscenario, we find a thermal gas number density of ~10^{-4} cm^{-3} implying atotal gas mass of ~10^{10} m_solar within the lobes. the thermal pressureassociated with this gas (with temperature kt ~ 0.5 kev, obtained from recentx-ray results) is approximately equal to the non-thermal pressure, indicatingthat over the volume of the lobes, there is approximate equipartition betweenthe thermal gas, radio-emitting electrons and magnetic field (and potentiallyany relativistic protons present).

1501.02922	bighorns - broadband instrument for global hydrogen reionisation signal	the redshifted 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (hi), potentially observable atlow radio frequencies (~50-200 mhz), should be a powerful probe of the physicalconditions of the inter-galactic medium during cosmic dawn and the epoch ofreionisation (eor). the sky-averaged hi signal is expected to be extremely weak(~100 mk) in comparison to the foreground of up to 10000 k at the lowestfrequencies of interest. the detection of such a weak signal requires anextremely stable, well characterised system and a good understanding of theforegrounds. development of a nearly perfectly (~mk accuracy) calibrated totalpower radiometer system is essential for this type of experiment. we presentthe bighorns (broadband instrument for global hydrogen reionisation signal)experiment which was designed and built to detect the sky-averaged hi signalfrom the eor at low radio frequencies. the bighorns system is a mobile totalpower radiometer, which can be deployed in any remote location in order tocollect radio-interference (rfi) free data. the system was deployed in remote,radio quiet locations in western australia and low rfi sky data have beencollected. we present a description of the system, its characteristics, detailsof data analysis and calibration. we have identified multiple challenges toachieving the required measurement precision, which triggered two majorimprovements for the future system.

1505.00949	a co-rich merger shaping a powerful and hyper-luminous infrared radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy	in the low-redshift universe, the most powerful radio sources are oftenassociated with gas-rich galaxy mergers or interactions. we here presentevidence for an advanced, gas-rich (`wet') merger associated with a powerfulradio galaxy at a redshift of z~2. this radio galaxy, mrc 0152-209, is the mostinfrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the southern hemisphere.using the australia telescope compact array, we obtained high-resolutionco(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with hst/wfpc2 imagingand wht long-slit spectroscopy. we find that, while roughly m(h2) ~ 2 x10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,another m(h2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of~60 kpc. most of this widespread co(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidalfeatures visible in the rest-frame near-uv hst/wfpc2 imaging. ly$\alpha$emission shows an excess over heii, but a deficiency over l(ir), which islikely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured starformation that was triggered by the merger. in terms of feedback, the radiosource is aligned with widespread co(1-0) emission, which suggests that thereis a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of coldmolecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. its optical appearance, combinedwith the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of mrc0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `dragonfly galaxy'.

1507.04819	broadband spectral modeling of the extreme gigahertz-peaked spectrum  radio source pks b0008-421	we present broadband observations and spectral modeling of pks b0008-421, andidentify it as an extreme gigahertz-peaked spectrum (gps) source. pks b0008-421is characterized by the steepest known spectral slope below the turnover, closeto the theoretical limit of synchrotron self-absorption, and the smallest knownspectral width of any gps source. spectral coverage of the source spans from0.118 to 22 ghz, which includes data from the murchison widefield array and thewide bandpass receivers on the australia telescope compact array. we haveimplemented a bayesian inference model fitting routine to fit the data withvarious absorption models. we find that without the inclusion of ahigh-frequency exponential break the absorption models can not accurately fitthe data, with significant deviations above and below the peak in the radiospectrum. the addition of a high-frequency break provides acceptable spectralfits for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption and double-componentsynchrotron self-absorption models, with the inhomogeneous free-free absorptionmodel statistically favored. the requirement of a high-frequency spectral breakimplies that the source has ceased injecting fresh particles. additionalsupport for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption model as being responsiblefor the turnover in the spectrum is given by the consistency between thephysical parameters derived from the model fit and the implications of theexponential spectral break, such as the necessity of the source beingsurrounded by a dense ambient medium to maintain the peak frequency near thegigahertz region. the discovery of pks b0008-421 suggests that the nextgeneration of low radio frequency surveys could reveal a large population ofgps sources that have ceased activity, and that a portion of the ultra-steepspectrum source population could be composed of these gps sources in a relicphase.

1509.05256	the lunar askaryan technique: a technical roadmap	the lunar askaryan technique, which involves searching for askaryan radiopulses from particle cascades in the outer layers of the moon, is a method forusing the lunar surface as an extremely large detector of ultra-high-energyparticles. the high time resolution required to detect these pulses, which havea duration of around a nanosecond, puts this technique in a regime quitedifferent from other forms of radio astronomy, with a unique set of associatedtechnical challenges which have been addressed in a series of experiments byvarious groups. implementing the methods and techniques developed by thesegroups for detecting lunar askaryan pulses will be important for a futureexperiment with the square kilometre array (ska), which is expected to havesufficient sensitivity to allow the first positive detection using thistechnique.  key issues include correction for ionospheric dispersion, beamforming,efficient triggering, and the exclusion of spurious events from radio-frequencyinterference. we review the progress in each of these areas, and consider thefurther progress expected for future application with the ska.

0806.1623	a view of the sub-mjy populations, modelling and perspectives for future  deep surveys	we use deep multi-colour (ubvrijk) images mostly taken in the framework ofthe eso deep public survey (dps) to optically identify and derive photometricredshifts for a complete sample of 131 radio sources with s&gt;0.4 mjy, observedat both 1.4 and 5 ghz as part of the atesp radio survey. the availability ofmulti-wavelength radio and optical information is exploited to infer thephysical properties of the faint radio population. in particular we find that,considering both early-type galaxies and quasars as sources with an activenucleus, agns largely dominate our sample sub-mjy sample (78%). furtherradio/optical analysis of such agn component has revealed a somewhat unexpectedclass of flat/inverted-spectrum sources with low radio-to-optical ratios(r&lt;100), which are preferentially identified with early-type galaxies. suchsources are quite compact (d&lt;10-30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radioemission triggered by low luminosity agns. this intriguing class of objectsdeserves further analysis, and new higher resolution radio observations arecurrently under way. in parallel we are developing radio source models, forboth the agn and the star-forming components of the sub-mjy radio pupulation.here we discuss the first results.

0807.0127	interpretation of radio continuum and molecular line observations of sgr  b2: free-free and synchrotron emission, and implications for cosmic rays	recent ammonia (1,1) inversion line data on the galactic star forming regionsgr b2 show that the column density is consistent with a radial gaussiandensity profile with a standard deviation of 2.75 pc. deriving a formula forthe virial mass of spherical gaussian clouds, we obtain a virial mass of 1.9million solar masses for sgr b2. for this matter distribution, a reasonablemagnetic field and an impinging flux of cosmic rays of solar neighbourhoodintensity, we predict the expected synchrotron emission from the sgr b2 giantmolecular cloud due to secondary electrons and positrons resulting from cosmicray interactions, including effects of losses due to pion production collisionsduring diffusive propagation into the cloud complex.  we assemble radio continuum data at frequencies between 330 mhz and 230 ghz.  from the spectral energy distribution the emission appears to be thermal atall frequencies. before using these data to constrain the predicted synchrotronflux, we first model the spectrum as free-free emission from the known ultracompact hii regions plus emission from an envelope or wind with a radialdensity gradient. this severely constrains the possible synchrotron emission bysecondary electrons to quite low flux levels. the absence of a significantcontribution by secondary electrons is almost certainly due to multi-gev energycosmic rays being unable to penetrate far into giant molecular clouds. thiswould also explain why 100 mev--gev gamma-rays (from neutral pion decay orbremsstrahlung by secondary electrons) were not observed from sgr b2 by egret,while tev energy gamma-rays were observed, being produced by higher energycosmic rays which more readily penetrate giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0005235	e&amp;f white conference on radio frequency interference mitigation  strategies	the conference brought together expertise on a range of interferencemitigation techniques from csiro, australian and international industry anduniversities. key goals were to: enhance the understanding of techniques andtheir inter-relationship, increase awareness of advanced technologies such assoftware radios and photonics, and foster a cooperative approach to thedevelopment of interference mitigation techniques. the foremost application inmind was the square kilometre array (ska) and the need to find ways to developan hierarchical scheme for removing unwanted signals from astronomical data.this paper gives an overview of the topics discussed at the conference andsummarises some of the key ideas and results that were presented.  many of the interference challenges we face can be overcome with technicalsolutions. there will always be a place for regulatory and legal approaches tospectrum management, but too much reliance has been placed on these in thepast. the strategy of avoidance has worked well in the past and will continueto be useful in the future, but is now limited by the growth of space basedcommunications systems, which are visible everywhere on earth. there is notechnical solution which is likely to provide a silver bullet. rather ahierarchical approach will be required, combining a range of techniques. wehave just begun exploring technical solutions and their toxicity toastronomical data. we need to continue on this path, determining whichtechniques are best and how they interact in order to develop a flexible andpowerful system for interference suppression.

astro-ph;0005267	an extragalactic hi cloud with no optical counterpart?	we report the discovery, from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass), of anisolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic. the himass of the cloud (hipass j1712-64) is very low, 1.7 x 10^7 msun, using anestimated distance of ~3.2 mpc. most significantly, we have found no opticalcompanion to this object to very faint limits (mu(b)~ 27 mag arcsec^-2). hipassj1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,hi 1225+01 (the virgo hi cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. the meanvelocity dispersion, measured with the australia telescope compact array(atca), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak ornon-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (t&lt;2000 k)rather than bulk motion or turbulence. the peak column density for hipassj1712-64, from the combined parkes and atca data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for starformation. apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties ofhipass j1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact highvelocity clouds. we therefore consider the evidence for a local group orgalactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712-64was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud/galaxy system atperigalacticon ~ 2 x 10^8 yr ago.

astro-ph;0102016	the atesp radio survey iv. optical identifications and spectroscopy in  the eis-a region	(abridged) this paper is the fourth of a series reporting the results of theatesp 1.4 ghz radio survey. the survey covers a region of ~26 sq. degrees atdecl. -40 degr. and has produced a catalogue of 2967 radio sources down to ~0.5mjy (6sigma). in this paper we present the optical identifications over a 3 sq.degr. region of the public eso imaging survey. in this region deep photometryand 95% complete object catalogues in the i band are available down to i~22.5.these data allowed us to identify 57% of the atesp sources present in theregion (219/386). for a magnitude limited sample of 70 identified sources withi&lt;19.0 we have obtained spectroscopy at the eso 3.6 m telescope. this dataallowed us to get redshifts and spectral classification for all sources (exceptone). from the analysis of the spectroscopic sample we find that thecomposition of the faint radio population abruptly changes going from mjy tosub-mjy fluxes: the early type galaxies largely dominate the mjy population(60%), while star forming processes become important in the sub-mjy regime.starburst and post-starburst galaxies go from 13% at s&gt;1 mjy to 39% at s&lt;1 mjy.nevertheless, at sub-mjy fluxes, early type galaxies still constitute asignificant fraction (25%) of the whole population. we also show that, due tothe distribution of radio to optical ratios, sub-mjy samples with fainterspectroscopic follow-ups should be increasingly sensitive to the population ofearly type galaxies, while a larger fraction of star-forming galaxies would beexpected in microjy samples. we compare our results with others obtained fromstudies of sub-mjy samples and we show how the existing discrepancies can beexplained in terms of selection effects.

astro-ph;0607141	the atesp 5 ghz radio survey i. source counts and spectral index  properties of the faint radio population	[abridged] the nature and evolutionary properties of the faint radiopopulation, responsible for the steepening observed in the 1.4 ghz sourcecounts below 1 millijy, are not yet entirely clear. radio spectral indices mayhelp to constrain the origin of the radio emission in such faint radio sourcesand may be fundamental in understanding eventual links to the optical light. westudy the spectral index behaviour of sources that were found in the 1.4 ghzatesp survey (prandoni et al. 2000a,b). using the australia telescope compactarray we observed at 5 ghz part of the region covered by the sub-mjy atespsurvey. in particular we imaged a one square degree area for which deep opticalimaging in ubvrijk is available. in this paper we present the 5 ghz survey andsource catalogue, we derive the 5 ghz source counts and we discuss the 1.4-5ghz spectral index properties of the atesp sources. the analysis of the opticalproperties of the sample will be the subject of a following paper. the 5 ghzsurvey has produced a catalogue of 111 radio sources, complete down to a (6sigma) limit s_lim(5 ghz)~0.4 mjy. we take advantage of the better spatialresolution at 5 ghz (~2 arcsec compared to ~8 arcsec at 1.4 ghz) to infer radiosource structures and sizes. the 5 ghz source counts derived by the presentsample are consistent with those reported in the literature, but improvesignificantly the statistics in the flux range 0.4&lt; s(5 ghz)&lt;1 mjy. the atespsources show a flattening of the 1.4-5 ghz spectral index with decreasing fluxdensity, which is particularly significant for the 5 ghz selected sample. sucha flattening confirm previous results coming from smaller samples and isconsistent with a flattening of the 5 ghz source counts occurring at fluxes&lt;=0.5 mjy.

astro-ph;0702619	limit on uhe neutrino flux from the parkes lunar radio cherenkov  experiment	the first search for ultra-high energy (uhe) neutrinos using a radiotelescope was conducted by hankins, ekers and o'sullivan (1996). this was asearch for nanosecond duration radio cherenkov pulses from electromagneticcascades initiated by ultra-high energy (uhe) neutrino interactions in thelunar regolith, and was made using a broad-bandwidth receiver fitted to theparkes radio telescope, australia. at the time, no simulations were availableto convert the null result into a neutrino flux limit. since then, similarexperiments at goldstone, usa, and kalyazin, russia, have also recorded nullresults, and computer simulations have been used to model the experimentalsensitivities of these two experiments and put useful limits on the uheneutrino flux.  proposed future experiments include the use of broad-bandwidth receivers,making the sensitivity achieved by the parkes experiment highly relevant to thefuture prospects of this field. we have therefore calculated the effectiveaperture for the parkes experiment and found that when pointing at the lunarlimb, the effective aperture at all neutrino energies was superior tosingle-antenna, narrow-bandwidth experiments, and that the detection thresholdwas comparable to that of the double-antenna experiment at goldstone. however,because only a small fraction of the observing time was spent pointing thelimb, the parkes experiment places only comparatively weak limits on the uheneutrino flux. future efforts should use multiple telescopes andbroad-bandwidth receivers.

astro-ph;9807001	the gamma-ray burst of 980425 and its association with the extraordinary  radio emission from a most unusual supernova	supernova sn 1998bw exploded in the same direction and at the same time asthe gamma-ray burst grb 980425. here we report radio observations of this typeic supernova, beginning 4 days after the gamma-ray burst. at its peak the radiosource is the most luminous ever seen from a supernova, nu l_nu = 4 x 10^38erg/s at 5 ghz. more remarkably, the traditional synchrotron interpretation ofthe radio emission requires that the radio source be expanding at an apparentvelocity of at least twice the speed of light, indicating that this supernovawas accompanied by a shock wave moving at relativistic speed. the energy u_eassociated with the radio-emitting relativistic electrons must lie between10^49 erg &lt;u_e&lt; 10^52 erg, and thus represents a significant fraction of thetotal kinetic energy ~10^51 erg associated with supernova explosions. thepresence of a relativistic shock in sn 1998bw suggests a physical connectionwith the gamma-ray burst grb 980425. we argue that this represents a secondclass of gamma-ray burst, with much lower emitted energy ~10^48 erg ingamma-rays than the two powerful ~10^53 erg high-redshift gamma-ray burstspreviously identified.

astro-ph;9808023	the disruption of nearby galaxies by the milky way	interactions between galaxies are common and are an important factor indetermining their physical properties such as position along the hubblesequence and star-formation rate. there are many possible galaxy interactionmechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression,gravitational interaction and cluster tides. the relative importance of thesemechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly knownparameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halosthat surround galaxies. a nearby example of a galaxy interaction where themechanism is controversial is that between our own galaxy and two of itsneighbours -- the large and small magellanic clouds. here we present the firstresults of a new hi survey which provides a spectacular view of thisinteraction. in addition to the previously known magellanic stream, whichtrails 100 degrees behind the clouds, the new data reveal a counter-streamwhich lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the clouds. thisresult supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streamsare tidally torn from the body of the magellanic clouds.

astro-ph;9808164	new hi-detected galaxies in the zone of avoidance	we present the first results of a blind hi survey for galaxies in thesouthern zone of avoidance with a multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope.this survey is eventually expected to catalog several thousand galaxies withingalactic latitude |b|&lt;5 degrees, mostly unrecognised before due to galacticextinction and confusion. we present here results of the first three detectionsto have been imaged with the australia telescope compact array (atca). thegalaxies all lie near galactic longitude 325 degrees and were selected becauseof their large angular sizes, up to 1.3 degrees. linear sizes range from 53 to108 kpc. the first galaxy is a massive 5.7x10^11 solar mass disk galaxy with afaint optical counterpart, sgc 1511.1--5249. the second is probably aninteracting group of galaxies straddling the galactic equator. no opticalidentification is possible. the third object appears to be an interacting pairof low column density galaxies, possibly belonging to an extended circinus orcentaurus a galaxy group. no optical counterpart has been seen despite thepredicted extinction (a(b) = 2.7 - 4.4 mag) not being excessive. we discuss theimplications of the results, in particular the low hi column densities (~10^19atoms/sq.cm) found for two of the three galaxies.

astro-ph;9903448	centaurus a: multiple outbursts or bursting bubble?	we present new radio observations of the brighter region of the northern lobe(the northern middle lobe, nml) of centaurus a obtained at 20 cm with theaustralia telescope compact array. the angular resolutions are ~50 and ~130arcsec, therefore much higher than for the previously available radio images ofthis region. the most interesting feature detected is a large-scale jet thatconnects the inner radio lobe and the nml and that is imaged for the firsttime. the nml itself appears as diffuse emission with a relatively bright ridgeon the eastern side. the radio morphology of centaurus a and, in particular,its nml could be the result of a precessing jet that has undergone a stronginteraction with the environment at least in the northern side. the very bigdrop in intensity between the inner jet and the large-scale jet can beexplained with a sequence of bursts of activity at different epochs in the lifeof the source. alternatively (or additionally) a ``bursting bubble'' model isproposed which could also explain the good collimation of the large-scale jet.in this model, the plasma accumulated in the inner lobe would be able to``burst'' out only through one nozzle that would be the region where thelarge-scale jet forms. from the comparison between the radio emission and theregions of ionized gas we find that the inner optical filament falls about 2arcmin (~2 kpc) away from the large-scale radio jet. thus, this filament doesnot seem to have experienced a direct interaction with the radio plasma. theouter filaments appear to be, in projection, closer to the radio emission,arguing for a direct interaction with the radio jet. however, also in this casea more complicated interaction than assumed so far has to be occuring.

astro-ph;9906146	new galaxies discovered in the first blind hi survey of the centaurus a  group	we have commenced a 21-cm survey of the entire southern sky (\delta &lt; 0degrees, -1200 km/s &lt; v &lt; 12700 km/s) which is ''blind'', i.e. unbiased byprevious optical information. in the present paper we report on the results ofa pilot project which is based on data from this all-sky survey. the projectwas carried out on an area of 600 square degrees centred on the nearbycentaurus a (cen a) group of galaxies at a mean velocity of v ~ 500 km/s. thiswas recently the subject of a separate and thorough optical survey.  we found 10 new group members to add to the 21 galaxies already known in thecen a group: five of these are previously uncatalogued galaxies, while fivewere previously catalogued but not known to be associated with the group.  we found optical counterparts for all the hi detections, most of themintrinsically very faint low surface brightness dwarfs. the new group membersadd approximately 6% to the hi mass of the group and 4% to its light. the himass function, derived from all the known group galaxies in the interval 10^7\msun of hi to 10^9 \msun of hi, has a faint-end slope of 1.30 +/- 0.15,allowing us to rule out a slope of 1.7 at 95% confidence. even if the number inthe lowest mass bin is increased by 50%, the slope only increases to 1.45 +/-0.15.

astro-ph;9910437	radio observations of the hubble deep field south - a new class of  radio-luminous galaxies?	we present the first results from a series of radio observations of thehubble deep field south and its flanking fields. here we consider only thosesources greater than 100 microjy at 20 cm, in an 8-arcmin square field thatcovers the wfpc field, the stis and nicmos field, and most of the hst flankingfields and complementary ground-based observations. we have detected 13 suchradio sources, two of which are in the wfpc2 field itself. one of the sourcesin the wfpc field (source c) corresponds to a very faint galaxy, and severalothers outside the wfpc field can not be identified with sources in the otheroptical/ir wavebands. the radio and optical luminosities of these galaxies areinconsistent with either conventional starburst galaxies or with radio-loudgalaxies. instead, it appears that it belongs to a population of galaxies whichare rare in the local universe, possibly consisting of a radio-luminous activenucleus embedded in a very dusty starburst galaxy, and which are characterisedby a very high radio/optical luminosity ratio.
