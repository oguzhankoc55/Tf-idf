0904.0712	the changing ism of massive elliptical galaxies and cosmic evolution of  radio galaxies and quasars	the recently discovered apparent dramatic expansion in the effective radii ofmassive elliptical galaxies from $z \simeq 2$ to $z \simeq 0.1$ has beeninterpreted in terms of either galaxy mergers or the rapid loss of cold gas dueto agn feedback. in examining the latter case we have quantified the extent ofthe expansion, which is uncertain observationally, in terms of the starformation parameters and time of the expulsion of the cold gas. in either case,the large global decrease in stellar density should translate into a major dropin the ism density and pressure, and a much steeper radial decline in thosequantities with cosmic epoch. these cosmological changes are expected to have amajor influence on the gas accretion mode, which will shift from `cold' thindisk accretion at high redshifts toward `hot' bondi fed adaf accretion at lowredshifts. the decline of angular momentum inflow would then lead to a spindown of the black hole, for which we have calculated more precise time scales;a value of about 0.2 gyr is typical for a $10^9 m_\odot$ central black hole.these results have implications for the different cosmological evolutionarypatterns found for the luminosity functions of powerful and weak radiogalaxies.

0910.1487	optical variability of radio-intermediate quasars	we report the results of our intensive intranight optical monitoring of 8`radio-intermediate quasars' (riqs) having flat or inverted radio spectra. themonitoring was carried out in {\it r-} band on 25 nights during 2005-09. anintranight optical variability (inov) detection threshold of $\sim$ 1--2% wasachieved for the densely sampled differential light curves (dlcs). theseobservations amount to a large increase over those reported hitherto for thisrare and sparsely studied class of quasars which can, however, play animportant role in understanding the link between the dominant varieties ofpowerful agn, namely the radio-quiet quasars (rqqs), radio-loud quasars (rlqs)and blazars. despite the probable presence of relativistically boosted nuclearjets, clear evidence for inov in our extensive observations was detected onlyon one night. these results demonstrate that as a class, riqs are much lessextreme in nuclear activity compared to blazars. the availability in theliterature of inov data for another 2 riqs conforming to our selection criteriaallowed us to enlarge the sample to 10 riqs (monitored on a total of 42 nightsfor a minimum duration of $\sim 4$ hours per night). the absence of largeamplitude inov $(\psi &gt; 3%)$ persists in this enlarged sample. this extensivedatabase has enabled us to arrive at the first estimate for the inov duty cycle(dc) of riqs. the dc is found to be small ($\sim$ 9%). the corresponding valueis known to be $\sim 60%$ for bl lacs and $\approx 15%$ for rlqs and rqqs. onlonger-term, the riqs are found to be fairly variable with typical amplitudesof $\approx$ 0.1-mag. the light curves of these riqs are briefly discussed inthe context of a theoretical framework proposed earlier for linking this rarekind of quasars to the much better studied dominant classes of quasars.

0707.3456	effects of jet opening angle and velocity structure on blazar parameters	we had earlier shown that for a constant velocity jet the discrepancy betweenthe low speeds indicated by vlbi knot motions and the high doppler factorsinferred from emission of tev photons could be reconciled if ultrarelativisticjets possessed modest opening angles. here we evaluate the (flux-weighted)viewing angles of the jet and the apparent speeds and doppler factors of theradio knots on parsec scales. the influence of the jet opening angle on theseradio knot parameters are found for the usually considered types ofrelativistic nuclear jets: those with uniform bulk speeds and those where thebulk lorentz factor of the flow decreases with distance from the jet axis,known as `spine--sheath' flows. for both types of jet velocity structures theexpectation value of the jet orientation angle at first falls dramatically withincreases in the (central) jet lorentz factor, but for extremely relativisticjets it levels off at a fraction of the opening angle. the effective values ofthe apparent speeds and doppler factors of the knots always declinesubstantially with increasing jet opening angle. the rarity of highlysuperluminal parsec-scale radio components in tev blazars can be understood iftheir jets are both highly relativistic and intrinsically weaker, so probablyless well collimated, than the jets in ordinary blazars.

1001.5206	short term flux and colour variations in low-energy peaked blazars	we have measured multi-band optical flux and colour variations for a sampleof 12 low energy peaked blazars on short, day-to-month, timescales. our samplecontains six bl lacertae objects and six flat spectrum radio quasars. thesephotometric observations, made during september 2008 to june 2009, used fiveoptical telescopes, one in india and four in bulgaria. we detected short termflux variations in eleven of these blazars and colour variability in eight ofthem. our data indicate that six blazars (3c 66a, ao 0235+164, s5 0716+714, pks0735+178, oj 287 and 3c 454.3) were observed in pre- or post-outburst states,that five (pks 0420-014, 4c 29.45, 3c 279, pks 1510-089 and bl lac) were in alow state, while one (3c 273) was in an essentially steady state. the dutycycles for flux and colour variations on short timescales in these low energypeaked blazars are ~ 92 percent and ~ 33 percent, respectively. the colour vsmagnitude correlations seen here support the hypothesis that bl lac objectstend to become bluer with increase in brightness; however, flat spectrum radioquasars may show the opposite trend, and there are exceptions to these trendsin both categories of blazar. we briefly discuss emission models for activegalactic nuclei that might explain our results.

0707.4023	influence of the jet opening angle on the derived kinematical parameters  of blazar jets having uniform and stratified bulk motion	we present analytical modelling of conical relativistic jets, in order toevaluate the role of the jet opening angle on certain key parameters that areinferred from vlbi radio observations of blazar nuclear jets. the keyparameters evaluated are the orientation angle (i.e., the viewing angle) of thejet and the apparent speed and doppler factor of the radio knots on parsecscales. quantitative comparisons are made of the influence of the jet openingangle on the above parameters of the radio knots, as would be estimated for twowidely discussed variants of relativistic nuclear jets, namely, those havinguniform bulk speed and those in which the bulk lorentz factor of the flowdecreases with distance from the jet axis (a `spine--sheath' flow). ouranalysis shows that for both types of jet velocity distributions theexpectation value of the jet orientation angle at first falls dramatically withincreases in the (central) jet lorentz factor, but it levels off at a fractionof the opening angle for extremely relativistic jets. we also find that theeffective values of the apparent speeds and doppler factors of the knots alwaysdecline substantially with increasing jet opening angle, but that this effectis strongest for ultra-relativistic jets with uniform bulk speed. we suggestthat the paucity of highly superluminal parsec-scale radio components in tevblazars can be understood if their jets are highly relativistic and, beingintrinsically weaker, somewhat less well collimated, in comparison to the jetsin other blazars.

1005.4475	detection of intra-day variability timescales of four high energy peaked  blazars with xmm-newton	we selected a sample of 24 xmm-newton light curves (lcs) of four high energypeaked blazars, pks 0548-322, on 231, 1es 1426+428 and pks 2155-304. these datacomprise continuous light curves of 7.67h to 18.97h in length. we searched forpossible quasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) and intra-day variability (idv)timescales in the lcs of these blazars. we found a likely qpo in one lc of pks2155-304 which was reported elsewhere (lachowicz et al. 2009). in the remaining23 lcs we found hints of possible weak qpos in one lc of each of on 231 and pks2155-304, but neither is statistically significant. we found idv timescalesthat ranged from 15.7 ks to 46.8 ks in 8 lcs. in 13 lcs any variabilitytimescales were longer than the length of the data. assuming the possible weakqpo periods in the blazars pks 2155-304 and on 231 are real and are associatedwith the innermost portions of their accretion disk, we can estimate that theircentral black hole masses exceed 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$. emissionmodels for radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) that could explain ourresults are briefly discussed.

1006.5022	ultra-high energy cosmic rays from centaurus a: jet interaction with  gaseous shells	ultra high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs), with energies above ~6 x 10^19 ev,seem to show a weak correlation with the distribution of matter relatively nearto us in the universe. it has earlier been proposed that uhecrs could beaccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxycen a. we show that uhecr production at a spatially intermediate location about15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus isobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausiblealternative. a relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavyseed cosmic rays (crs) to uhecrs on timescales comparable to the time it takesthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. in this model many crs arising froma starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee regionaround pev, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of anewly oriented jet. this model matches the overall spectrum shown by the augerdata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function ofparticle energy. we thus predict an observable anisotropy in the composition athigh energy in the sense that lighter nuclei should preferentially be seentoward the general direction of cen a. taking into consideration the magneticfield models for the galactic disk and a galactic magnetic wind, this scenariomay resolve the discrepancy between hires and auger results concerning thechemical composition of uhecrs.

1008.0789	on the origin of x-shaped radio galaxies	after a brief, critical review of the leading explanations proposed for thesmall but important subset of radio galaxies showing an x-shaped morphology(xrgs) we propose a generalized model, based on the jet-shell interaction andspin-flip hypotheses. the most popular scenarios for this intriguing phenomenoninvoke either hydrodynamical backflows and over-pressured cocoons or rapid jetreorientations, presumably from the spin-flips of central engines following themergers of pairs of galaxies, each of which contains a supermassive black hole(smbh). we confront these models with a number of key observations and thusargue that none of the models is capable of explaining the entire range ofsalient observational properties of xrgs, although some of the arguments raisedin the literature against the spin-flip scenario are probably not tenable. wethen propose here a new scenario which also involves galactic mergers but wouldallow the spin of the central engine to maintain its direction. motivated bythe detailed multi-band observations of the nearest radio galaxy, centaurus a,this new model emphasizes the role of interactions between the jets and theshells of stars and gas that form and rotate around the merged galaxy and cancause temporary deflections of the jets, occasionally giving rise to anx-shaped radio structure. although each of the models is likely to be relevantto a subset of xrgs, the bulk of the evidence indicates that most of them arebest explained by the jet-shell interaction or spin-flip hypotheses.

1009.3774	a multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamics code with a general  equation of state	the ideal gas equation of state with a constant adiabatic index, althoughcommonly used in relativistic hydrodynamics, is a poor approximation for mostrelativistic astrophysical flows. here we propose a new general equation ofstate for a multi-component relativistic gas which is consistent with the syngeequation of state for a relativistic perfect gas and is suitable for numerical(special) relativistic hydrodynamics. we also present a multidimensionalrelativistic hydrodynamics code incorporating the proposed general equation ofstate, based on the hll scheme, which does not make use of a fullcharacteristic decomposition of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. theaccuracy and robustness of this code is demonstrated in multidimensionalcalculations through several highly relativistic test problems taking intoaccount nonvanishing tangential velocities. results from three-dimensionalsimulations of relativistic jets show that the morphology and dynamics of therelativistic jets are significantly influenced by the different equation ofstate and by different compositions of relativistic perfect gases. our newnumerical code, combined with our proposed equation of state is very efficientand robust, and unlike previous codes, it gives very accurate results forthermodynamic variables in relativistic astrophysical flows.

1011.5611	optical microvariability properties of balqsos	we present optical light curves of 19 radio quiet (rq) broad absorption line(bal) qsos and study their rapid variability characteristics. systematic ccdobservations, aided by a careful data analysis procedure, have allowed us toclearly detect any such microvariability exceeding 0.01--0.02 mag. ourobservations cover a total of 13 nights (~72 hours) with each quasar monitoredfor about 4 hours on a given night. our sample size is a factor of three largerthan the number of radio-quiet balqsos previously searched formicrovariability. we introduce a scaled f-test statistic for evaluating thepresence of optical microvariability and demonstrate why it is generallypreferable to the statistics usually employed for this purpose. consideringonly unambiguous detections of microvariability we find that ~11 per cent ofradio-quiet balqsos (two out of 19 sources) show microvariability for anindividual observation length of about 4 hr. this new duty cycle of 11 per centis similar to the usual low microvariability fraction of normal rqqsos withobservation lengths similar to those of ours. this result provides support formodels where radio-quiet balqso do not appear to be a special case of therqqsos in terms of their microvariability properties.

1012.4334	radio properties of low redshift broad line active galactic nuclei  including extended radio sources	we present a study of the extended radio emission in a sample of 8434 lowredshift (z &lt; 0.35) broad line active galactic nuclei (agn) from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). to calculate the jet and lobe contributions to thetotal radio luminosity, we have taken the 846 radio core sources detected inour previous study of this sample and performed a systematic search in thefaint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimeters (first) database forextended radio emission that is likely associated with the opticalcounterparts. we found 51 out of 846 radio core sources have extended emission(&gt; 4" from the optical agn) that is positively associated with the agn, and wehave identified an additional 12 agn with extended radio emission but nodetectable radio core emission. among these 63 agn, we found 6 giant radiogalaxies (grgs), with projected emission exceeding 750 kpc in length, andseveral other agn with unusual radio morphologies also seen in higher redshiftsurveys. the optical spectra of many of the extended sources are similar tothat of typical broad line radio galaxy spectra, having broad h$\alpha$emission lines with boxy profiles and large m_bh. with extended emission takeninto account, we find strong evidence for a bimodal distribution in theradio-loudness parameter r, where the lower radio luminosity core-only sourcesappear as a population separate from the extended sources, with a dividing lineat log(r) $\approx 1.75$. this dividing line ensures that these are indeed themost radio-loud agn, which may have different or extreme physical conditions intheir central engines when compared to the more numerous radio quiet agn.

1103.4791	correlations of quasar optical spectra with radio morphology	(abridged) with the largest homogeneous quasar sample with optical spectraand robust radio morphology classifications assembled to date, we investigatequasar radio and optical properties with unprecedented statistical power. thedata consist of 4714 radio quasars from first with s_{20}&gt;2mjy and sdssspectra. radio morphology classes include core-only (core), core-lobe (lobe),core-jet (jet), lobe-core-lobe (triple), and double-lobe. we examine theoptical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars withcore emission unresolved by first (on 5" scale) have a redder colordistribution than radio-quiet quasars (s_{20}&lt;1mjy); other classes of radioquasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.this analysis also suggests that optical colors of z&lt;2.7 sdss quasars are notstrongly (&lt;0.1mag) biased blue. we show that the radio core-to-lobe fluxdensity ratio (r) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core(ri) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative ofline-of-sight orientation. we investigate spectral line equivalent widths as afunction of r and ri, including the [oiii] narrow line doublet and the civ{\lambda}1549 and mgii {\lambda}2799 broad lines. we find that the restequivalent widths (ews) of the broad lines correlate positively with ri at the4-8{\sigma} level. but we find no strong dependence of ew on r, in contrast toprevious results. one interpretation is that ews increase as the line-of-sightangle to the radio-jet axis decreases. these results are in stark contrast tocommonly accepted orientation-based theories, which suggest that continuumemission should increase as the angle to the radio-jet axis decreases,resulting in smaller ew of emission lines (assumed isotropic). finally, we findthat the baldwin effect in our sample does not depend on quasar radiomorphology.

1205.2324	intra-night optical variability of core dominated radio quasars: the  role of optical polarization	{abridged} rapid variations in optical flux are seen in many quasars and allblazars. the amount of variability in different classes of active galacticnuclei has been studied extensively but many questions remain unanswered. wepresent the results of a long-term programme to investigate the intra-nightoptical variability (inov) of powerful flat spectrum radio core-dominatedquasars (cdqs), with a focus on probing the relationship of inov to the degreeof optical polarization. we observed a sample of 16 bright cdqs showing strongbroad optical emission lines and consisting of both high and low opticalpolarization quasars (hpcdqs and lpcdqs). we employed aries, iia, igotelescopes, to carry out {\it r}-band monitoring on a total of 47 nights.combining these inov data with those taken from the literature, we were able toincrease the sample size to 21 cdqs(12 lpcdqs and 9 hpcdqs) monitored on atotal of 73 nights. as the existence of a prominent flat-spectrum radio coresignifies that strong relativistic beaming is present in all these cdqs, thedefinitions of the two sets differ primarily in fractional opticalpolarization, the lpcdqs showing a very low median$ p_{op} \simeq$ 0.4 percent.  our study yields an inov duty cycle (dc) of $\sim$28 per cent for the lpcdqsand $\sim 68$ percent for hpcdqs.  if only strong inov with fractional amplitude above 3 per cent is considered,the corresponding dcs are $\sim$ 7 per cent and $\sim$ 40 per cent,respectively.from this strong contrast between the two classes of luminous,relativistically beamed quasars, it is apparent that relativistic beaming isnormally not a sufficient condition for strong inov and a high opticalpolarization is the other necessary condition.

1306.5437	on the photometric error calibration for the `differential light curves'  of point-like active galactic nuclei	it is important to quantify the underestimation of rms photometric errorsreturned by the commonly used $\emph apphot$ algorithm in the $\emph iraf$software, in the context of differential photometry of point-like agn, becauseof the crucial role it plays in evaluating their variability properties.published values of the underestimation factor, $\eta$, using several differenttelescopes, lie in the range 1.3 - 1.75. the present study aims to revisit thisquestion by employing an exceptionally large data set of 262 differential lightcurves (dlcs) derived from 262 pairs of non-varying stars monitored under ouraries agn monitoring program for characterizing the intra-night opticalvariability (inov) of prominent agn classes. the bulk of these data were takenwith the 1-m sampurnanad telescope (st). we find $\eta$ = 1.54$\pm$0.05 whichis close to our recently reported value of $\eta$ = 1.5. moreover, thisconsistency holds at least up to a brightness mismatch of 1.5 mag between thepaired stars. from this we infer that a magnitude difference of at least up to1.5 mag between a point-like agn and comparison star(s) monitoredsimultaneously is within the same ccd chip acceptable, as it should not lead tospurious claims of inov.

1311.4838	investigating active galactic nuclei variability using combined  multi-quarter kepler data	we have used photometry from the kepler satellite to characterize thevariability of four radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) on timescales fromyears to minutes. the kepler satellite produced nearly continuous highprecision data sets which provided better temporal coverage than possible withground based observations. we have now accumulated eleven quarters of data,eight of which were reported in our previous paper. in addition to constructingpower spectral densities (psds) and characterizing the variability of the lastthree quarters, we have linked together the individual quarters using amultiplicative scaling process, providing data sets spanning ~2.8 years with&gt;98% coverage at a 30 minute sampling rate. we compute psds on these connecteddata sets that yield power law slopes at low frequencies in the approximaterange of -1.5 to -2.0, with white noise seen at higher frequencies. these psdsare similar to those of both the individual quarters and to those of groundbased optical observations of other agn. we also have explored a psd binningmethod intended to reduce a bias toward shallow slope fits by evenlydistributing the points within the psds. this tends to steepen the computed psdslopes, especially when the low frequencies are relatively poorly fit. wedetected flares lasting several days in which the brightness increased by~15-20% in one object, as well a smaller flare in another. two agn showed onlysmall, ~1-2%, fluctuations in brightness.

0802.2116	superdisks in radio galaxies: jet-wind interactions	taking a clue from their sharp-edged (strip-like) morphology observed inseveral cases, a new mechanism is proposed for the formation of the emissiongaps seen between the radio lobes of many powerful extragalactic double radiosources. canonical understanding of the radio gaps invokes either blocking ofthe back-flowing lobe plasma by the denser interstellar medium (ism) of thehost galaxy, or "squeezing" of the radio bridge in the middle through buoyancyforce exerted by either the ism or the surrounding intra-cluster medium (icm).these pictures encounter difficulties in explaining situations where thesharp-edged radio gaps associated with non-cluster radio galaxies have widthsrunning into several tens (even hundreds) of kiloparsecs. more particularly,the required dense high-pressure ism/icm is likely to be lacking at least inthe case of high-redshift radio galaxies. we propose here that radio emissiongaps in at least such cases could arise from a dynamical interaction betweenthe powerful thermal wind outflowing from the active galactic nucleus and theback-flowing synchrotron plasma in the two radio lobes, which occurs once therapidly advancing jets have crossed out of the wind zone into the intergalacticmedium. a simple analytical scheme is presented to explore the plausibility ofthe side-ways confinement of the thermal wind by the radio lobe pair, whichwould "freeze" pancake shaped conduits in the space, along which the hot, metalenriched wind from the agn can escape (roughly orthogonal to the radio axis).some other possible consequences of this scenario are pointed out.

1407.3687	modeling the emission from turbulent relativistic jets in active  galactic nuclei	we present a numerical model developed to calculate observed fluxes ofrelativistic jets in active galactic nuclei. the observed flux of eachturbulent eddy is dependent upon its variable doppler boosting factor, computedas a function of the relativistic sum of the individual eddy and bulk jetvelocities and our viewing angle to the jet. the total observed flux is foundby integrating the radiation from the eddies over the turbulent spectrum. weconsider jets that contain turbulent eddies that have either standardkolmogorov or recently derived relativistic turbulence spectra. we also accountfor the time delays in receiving the emission of the eddies due to theirdifferent simulated positions in the jet, as well as due to the varying beamingdirections as they turn over. we examine these theoretical light curves andcompute power spectral densities (psds) for a range of viewing angles, bulkvelocities of the jet, and turbulent velocities. these psd slopes dependsignificantly on the turbulent velocity and are essentially independent ofviewing angle and bulk velocity. the flux variations produced in thesimulations for realistic values of the parameters tested are consistent withthe types of variations observed in radio-loud agn as, for example, recentlymeasured with the kepler satellite, as long as the turbulent velocities are nottoo high.

1407.4255	extragalactic radio sources with sharply inverted spectrum at metre  wavelengths	we present the first results of a systematic search for the rareextragalactic radio sources showing an inverted (integrated) spectrum, withspectral index $\alpha \ge +2.0$, a previously unexplored spectral domain. thesearch is expected to yield strong candidates for $\alpha \ge +2.5$, for whichthe standard synchrotron self-absorption (characterized by a single power-lawenergy distribution of relativistic electron population) would not be aplausible explanation, even in an ideal case of a perfectly homogeneous sourceof incoherent synchrotron radiation. such sharply inverted spectra, if found,would require alternative explanations, e.g., free-free absorption, ornon-standard energy distribution of relativistic electrons which differs from apower-law (e.g., maxwellian).  the search was carried out by comparing two sensitive low-frequency radiosurveys made with sub-arcminute resolution, namely, the wish survey at 352 mhzand tgss/dr5 at 150 mhz. the overlap region between these two surveys contains7056 wish sources classified as `single' and brighter than 100 mjy at 352 mhz.we focus here on the seven of these sources for which we find $\alpha &gt; +2.0$.two of these are undetected at 150 mhz and are particularly good candidates for$\alpha &gt; +2.5$. five of the seven sources exhibit a`gigahertz-peaked-spectrum' (gps).

1506.00586	multi-band variability in the blazar 3c 273 with xmm-newton	we have undertaken a nearly simultaneous optical/uv and x-ray variabilitystudy of the flat spectrum radio quasar, 3c 273 using data available from thexmm$-$newton satellite mission from june 2000 to july 2012. here we focus onthe multi-wavelength flux variability on both intra-day and long time scales ofthis very well known radio-loud source. we found high flux variability overlong time scales in all bands for which observations were made. the optical/uvvariability amplitude was more than twice than that in the x-ray bands. thereis some frequency dependence of the variability in optical/uv bands in thesense that the variability amplitude increases with increasing frequency;however, the x-ray emissions disagree with this trend as the variabilityamplitude decreases from soft to hard x-ray bands. on intra-day time scales 3c273 showed small amplitude variability in x-ray bands. a hardness ratioanalysis in the x-ray regime indicates that the particle acceleration mechanismdominates the cooling mechanism during most of the ~12 year span of theseobservations.

1506.07137	frequency dependent core shifts and parameter estimation for the blazar  3c 454.3	we study the core shift effect in the parsec scale jet of the blazar 3c 454.3using the 4.8 ghz - 36.8 ghz radio light curves obtained from three decades ofcontinuous monitoring. from a piecewise gaussian fit to each flare, time lags$\delta t$ between the observation frequencies $\nu$ and spectral indices$\alpha$ based on peak amplitudes $a$ are determined. from the fit $\delta t\propto \nu^{1/k_r}$, $k_r = 1.10 \pm 0.18$ indicating equipartition betweenthe magnetic field energy density and the particle energy density. from the fit$a \propto \nu^\alpha$, $\alpha$ is in the range $-0.24$ to $1.52$. a meanmagnetic field strength at 1 pc, $b_1 = 0.5 \pm 0.2$ g, and at the core,$b_{\rm core} = 46 \pm 16$ mg, are inferred, consistent with previousestimates. the measure of core position offset is $\omega_{r\nu} = 6.4 \pm 2.8$pc ghz$^{1/k_r}$ when averaged over all frequency pairs. based on thestatistical trend shown by the measured core radius $r_{\rm core}$ as afunction of $\nu$, we infer that the synchrotron opacity model may not be validfor all cases. a fourier periodogram analysis yields power law slopes in therange $-1.6$ to $-3.5$ describing the power spectral density shape and givesbend timescales in the range $0.52 - 0.66~$yr. this result, and both positiveand negative $\alpha$, indicate that the flares originate from multiple shocksin a small region. important objectives met in our study include: thedemonstration of the computational efficiency and statistical basis of thepiecewise gaussian fit; consistency with previously reported results; evidencefor the core shift dependence on observation frequency and its utility in jetdiagnostics in the region close to the resolving limit of very long baselineinterferometry observations.

0806.1464	stellar disruption and the quasar radio dichotomy	the origin of the dichotomy of radio loudness among quasars can be explainedusing recent findings that the mass of the central supermassive black hole(smbh) in extended radio-loud quasars is systematically a few times that oftheir counterparts in radio-quiet quasars. this sensitive dependence of radiojet ejection upon smbh mass probably arises from the blockage of jets by thepresence of substantial quantities of gas tidally stripped from stars by thecentral bh. this disruptive gas, however, will only be available around bhswith masses less than $m_c ~\gtrsim ~10^8\msun$, for which the tidal disruptionradius lies outside the smbh's event horizon. consequently, we find that agnwith $m_{bh} &gt; m_c$ can successfully launch jets with a wide range of powers,thus producing radio-loud quasars. the great majority of jets launched by lessmassive bhs, however, will be truncated in the vicinity of the smbh due to massloading from this stellar debris. this scenario also can naturally explain theremarkable dearth of extended radio structures in quasars showing broadabsorption line spectra.

0808.0038	superdisks and the structural asymmetry of radio galaxies	we present a sample of 16 radio galaxies, each of which is characterized by awide, elongated emission gap with fairly sharp and straight edges between thetwo radio lobes. this particular subset of the 'superdisk' radio galaxies ischosen because of a highly asymmetric location of the host elliptical galaxyrelative to the gap's central axis. in addition to posing a considerablechallenge to the existing models, such a morphology also means that the twojets traverse highly unequal distances through the superdisk material. one thushas a possibility to directly investigate if the marked asymmetry between thetwo jets' interaction with the (much denser) ambient medium, during theirpropagation, has a significant import for the brightness of the hotspot formingnear each jet's extremity. we also propose a new explanation for the formationof superdisks through the merger of a smaller elliptical galaxy with themassive host, in which the gas attached to the infalling galaxy deposits itsangular momentum into the host's circumgalactic gas, thereby causing it toflatten into a fat pancake, or superdisk. the asymmetric location of the hostgalaxy can be assisted by the kick imparted to it during the merger. we alsosuggest a physical link between these radio galaxies and those with x-shapedand z-symmetric radio lobes, commonly believed to arise from mergers of twogalactic nuclei, each harboring a supermassive black hole.

astro-ph;0009424	models for accretion disk fluctuations through self-organized  criticality including relativistic effects	the possibility that some of the observed x-ray and optical variability inactive galactic nuclei and galactic black hole candidates is produced inaccretion disks through the development of a self-organized critical state isreconsidered. new simulations, including more complete calculations ofrelativistic effects, do show that this model can produce light-curves andpower-spectra for the variability which agree with the range observed inoptical and x-ray studies of agn and x-ray binaries. however, the universalityof complete self-organized criticality is not quite achieved. this is mainlybecause the character of the variations depend quite substantially on theextent of the unstable disk region. if it extends close to the innermost stableorbit then a physical scale is introduced and the scale-free character ofself-organized criticality is vitiated. significant dependence of the powerspectrum density slope on the type of diffusion within the disk and a weakerdependence on the amount of differential rotation are noted. when generalrelativistic effects are incorporated in the models, additional substantialdifferences are produced if the disk is viewed from directions far from theaccretion disk axis.

astro-ph;0108144	are the hotspots of radio galaxies the sites of in-situ acceleration of  relativistic particles?	using a large set of optically detected hotspots in powerful extragalacticdouble radio sources, we examine the basic question of whether the detection ofoptical synchrotron radiation requires in-situ acceleration of relativisticelectrons within the hotspots/lobes. for this, we take into account the jet'sbulk relativistic motion, as well as its likely misalignment from the plane ofthe sky. together, both these factors can drastically reduce the apparent rangeof the ultra-relativistic electrons ejected from the nucleus in the form of ajet. the conventionally adopted parameter space for the fundamental variables,namely, the hotspot magnetic field, radio source orientation angle relative tothe line-of-sight and the bulk speed of the jet plasma, is considered. we findthat the observed optical/near-ir synchrotron emission of the hotspots can beexplained even if the radiating relativistic electrons were acceleratedexclusively within the nuclear region, provided the energy losses incurred bythe electrons during their transport down the jet are dominated by inversecompton upscatterings of the cosmic microwave background photons. under thiscircumstance, in-situ acceleration of relativistic electrons inside thehotspots or lobes is not found to be mandated by their reportedoptical/near-infrared detections.

astro-ph;0211455	radio galaxies and the star formation history of the universe	multi-wavelength observations made in the last decade suggest that theuniverse underwent an intense phase of star formation in the past (z &gt; 1). thisintensive activity is commonly attributed to a higher galaxy merger rate whenthe universe was a fraction of its present age. we examine the role of thepowerful radio sources whose comoving density is known to be a few orders ofmagnitude higher at z ~ 2, the `quasar era'. taking into account recent modelsfor the temporal evolution of the size and luminosity of a powerful doubleradio source, as well as lambda-cdm simulations of the cosmic web of baryonicmaterial at different redshifts, we argue that during the quasar era a highfraction of the volume of the web was occupied by the lobes of double radiosources. widespread compression of protostellar clouds, triggered by the highpressure of the synchrotron plasma of the radio lobes, can thus be expected tohave played a significant role in the global star formation history of theuniverse. these lobes can also yield a rather high level of magnetization ofthe intergalactic medium at these early cosmic epochs.

astro-ph;0301094	radio galaxies and the magnetization of the igm	observed radio galaxies had a much higher comoving density during the `quasarera', at z ~ 2-3, but these sources are only detectable for small fractions oftheir active lifetimes at such high z due to expansion losses and increasedinverse compton losses against the cosmic microwave background. using recentmodels for the evolution of the size and luminosity of powerful double radiosources, as well as lcdm simulations of the cosmic web of baryonic material, weargue that during the quasar era a high volume fraction of this web wasoccupied by the lobes of double radio sources. they could have seeded the igmwith an average magnetic field approaching 10^{-8} g. further, these advancingoverpressured lobes could compress the denser interstellar gas clouds of thegalaxies engulfed by them and thus trigger starbursts. this can probablyaccount for much of the intense star-formation activity witnessed beyond z ~1.5. also, the sweeping up of the ism of the gas-rich galaxies by the rapidlyadvancing radio lobes may well be responsible for the widespread metalpollution of the igm and proto-galaxies at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0308059	the origin of x-shaped radio galaxies: clues from the z-symmetric  secondary lobes	existing radio images of a few x-shaped radio galaxies reveal z-symmetricmorphologies in their weaker secondary lobes which cannot be naturallyexplained by either the galactic merger or radio-lobe backflow scenarios, thetwo dominant models for these x-shaped radio sources. we show that the mergerpicture can explain these morphologies provided one takes into account that,prior to the coalescence of their supermassive black holes, the smaller galaxyreleases significant amounts of gas into the ism of the dominant active galaxy.this rotating gas, whose angular momentum axis will typically not be alignedwith the original jets, is likely to provide sufficient ram pressure at adistance ~10 kpc from the nucleus to bend the extant jets emerging from thecentral engine, thus producing a z-symmetry in the pair of radio lobes. oncethe two black holes have coalesced some 10^7 yr later, a rapid reorientation ofthe jets along a direction close to that of the orbital angular momentum of theswallowed galaxy relative to the primary galaxy would create the youngerprimary lobes of the x-shaped radio galaxy. this picture naturally explains whysuch sources typically have powers close to the fr i/ii break. we suggest thatpurely z-symmetric radio sources are often en route to coalescence and theconcomitant emission of substantial gravitational radiation, while x-shapedones have already merged and radiated.

astro-ph;0401463	brightness suppression of relativistic radio jets of quasars: the role  of the lower electron energy cut-off	although the possibility of a low energy cut-off (lec) of the relativisticelectron population (e_{min} ~ 0.1 gev) in the different components of radiogalaxies has been discussed in the literature, from both theoretical andobservational viewpoints, its possible role in causing a distinct spectralflattening, and thus reducing the apparent brightness temperature of the radionucleus, has thus far not been explicitly discussed. here we point out thatsuch an effect may in fact be quite significant for the parsec-scale,superluminal emission regions associated with the inner radio jets. this isbecause the observed frequency of the spectral turnover arising from the lecincreases linearly with the bulk doppler factor (\delta) of the jet flow,whereas the frequency of synchrotron self-absorption (the well known cause ofspectral flattening and turnover at low frequencies) shows a mild decrease as\delta rises. for an observationally relevant range of source parameters, weinvestigate here the role of the lec. we argue that some statistical trendsrevealed by the recent vlbi surveys can in fact be understood in terms ofeffects arising from lec, including the faster superluminal motion found in thevlbi surveys at higher frequencies, and the apparent inability of most radiocores to even attain the brightness temperatures consistent with theequipartition condition. we also point out some possible implications of thelec for x-ray observations of the kiloparsec scale relativistic jets ofquasars.

astro-ph;0409761	asymmetries in powerful extragalactic radio sources	this review provides the background and current perspective of some of thestriking asymmetries exhibited by extragalactic double-lobed radio sources,paying special attention to the reported interrelationships among some of them.we particularly aim to highlight some less discussed aspects pertaining to theradio lobes and hot-spots for which any relativistic beaming effects are milderthan those imposed on the jets. various attributes of these features, such astheir geometry, intensity, spectrum, and polarization provide importantunderpinnings to models of radio galaxies and quasars, as well as to theoriesthat attempt to unify them. these contraints are sharpened by exploiting theasymmetry properties of the extended optical emission-line regions associatedwith powerful radio sources, including the giant halos of lyman-alpha emissionassociated with them. we suggest that highly extended disks of dusty gaseousmaterial, which could also be parts of cosmic filaments, around the hostgalaxies of radio sources may hold the key to understanding the correlatedradio--optical asymmetry and perhaps also the depolarization asymmetry of thetwin radio lobes. we also discuss the nature and possible implications of theextreme type of asymmetry witnessed in the enigmatic quasar 3c273, whose entireradio emission is observed on just one side of the nucleus. in this context,theoretical scenarios for the production of one-sided jets are also brieflyrecounted. taking a clue from theobserved one-sidedness of the extended radiojets even in `weak-headed-quasars', we also propose a scenario for the lateevolutionary stage of double radio sources. we end with a list of key questionsconcerning radio source asymmetries which still require final answers.(abridged)

astro-ph;0410332	do the mildly superluminal vlbi knots exclude ultrarelativistic blazar  jets?	we compute the effective values of apparent transverse velocity and fluxboosting factors for the vlbi radio knots of blazar jets, by integrating overthe angular distributions of these quantities across the widths of jets withfinite opening angles but constant velocities. for high bulk lorentz factors(gamma &gt; 10) variations across the jet can be quite large if the opening angle,omega, is even a few degrees on sub-parsec scales. the resulting apparentspeeds are often much lower than those obtained from the usual analyses thatignore the finite jet opening angles. we can thus reconcile the usuallyobserved subluminal or mildly superluminal speeds with the very high (&gt;~ 20)gamma factors, required by the inverse compton origin and rapid variability oftev fluxes, as well as by intraday radio variability. thus it is possible toassociate the vlbi radio knots directly with shocks in the ultra-relativisticmain jet flow, without invoking very rapid jet deceleration on parsec scales,or extremely unlikely viewing angles.

astro-ph;0510724	testing models of the individual and cosmological evolutions of powerful  radio galaxies	we seek to develop an essentially analytical model for the evolution offanaroff-riley class ii radio galaxies as they age individually and as theirnumbers vary with cosmological epoch. such modeling is required in order toprobe in more detail the impact of radio galaxies on the growth of structuresin the universe, which appears likely to have been quite significant at z &gt; 1.in this first paper of a series we compare three rather sophisticatedanalytical models for the evolution of linear size and lobe power of fr iiradio galaxies, those of kaiser, dennett-thorpe &amp; alexander (1997), blundell,rawlings &amp; willott (1999), and manolakou &amp; kirk (2002). we performmulti-dimensional monte carlo simulations in order to compare the predictionsof each model for radio powers, sizes, redshifts and spectral indices withdata. the observational samples used here are the low frequency radio surveys,3crr, 6ce and 7crs, which are flux-limited and complete. we search for anddescribe the best parameters for each model, after doing statistical tests onthem. we find that no existing model can give acceptable fits to all theproperties of the surveys considered, although the kaiser, dennett-thorpe &amp;alexander (1997) model gives better overall results than do the manolakou &amp;kirk (2002) or blundell, rawlings &amp; willott (1999) models for most of the testswe performed. we suggest ways in which these models may be improved.

astro-ph;0512522	multiband optical monitoring of the blazars s5 0716+714 and bl lacertae	we report results of multiband optical monitoring of two well known blazars,s5 0716+714 and bl lacertae, carried out in 1996 and 2000-01 with an aim tostudy optical variations on time scales from minutes to hours and longer.thelight curves were derived relative to comparison stars present on the ccdframes. night to night flux variations of &gt;0.1 mag were observed in s5 0716+714during a campaign of ~2 weeks in 1996.a good correlation between thelightcurves in different optical bands was found for both inter-night andintra-night observations. two prominent events of intra-night opticalvariability were detected in s5 0716+714.each of these rapidly varying segmentsof the lightcurves trace an exponential flux profile whose rate of variation isthe same in both cases. our long-term monitoring data of s5 0716+714 showed adistinct flare around jd 2451875 which can be identified in the bvri bands.thisflare coincides with the brightest phase recorded during 1994-2001 in thelong-term lightcurves reported by raiteri et al.(2003). no evidence for thebluer when brighter trend was noticed on inter-night and intra-night timescales. on the other hand, our nearly simultaneous multiband observations of bllacertae in october 2001 showed flux variations that were not achromatic. thisblazar was found to become bluer when brighter on intra-night time scales andthere is a hint of the same trend on inter-night time scales. based on fivenights of observations during a week, bl lacertae showed a peak night-to-nightvariability of ~0.6 mag in b. thus, we found that the present observations ofthe two blazars, reveal a contrasting behaviour in terms of the dependence ofspectral hardening with increasing brightness, at least on intra-night, andpossibly also on inter-night, time scales.

astro-ph;0603728	active galactic nuclei: unification, blazar variability and the radio  galaxy/cosmology interface	we first review some basic properties of the most important classes of activegalactic nuclei (agn), including quasars, blazars, seyfert galaxies and radiogalaxies. the most commonly accepted type of scheme designed to individuallyunify the radio-loud and radio-quiet categories of agn is based upon threeparameters: black hole mass, accretion rate, and our orientation to theaccretion flow. some recent evidence from optical microvariability of severalclasses of agn points in favor of a strong unification scheme that unites bothradio-loud and radio-quiet categories. an important question concerning thenature of blazars and other agn whose jet emission appears to dominate theirspectral energy distributions involves the velocities of those flows. a varietyof apparently contradictory observations can be reconciled if such flows areultrarelativistic but have an opening angle of a few degrees. radio galaxies(rgs) were much more numerous at redshifts ~2 than they are today. combiningthis fact with the realization that older rgs at such redshifts are verydifficult to detect, and with cosmological simulations of the growth ofstructure in the universe has led us to propose that rg lobes have impacted asignificant fraction of the cosmic web of baryons. these impacts may havetriggered extensive star formation and perhaps even engendered new galaxies;they also probably played important roles in the spreading of magnetic fieldsand heavier elements into the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0610474	hydrodynamic interactions of relativistic extragalactic jets with dense  clouds	we have studied three-dimensional hydrodynamic interactions of relativisticextragalactic jets with two-phase ambient media. these jets propagate through adenser homogeneous gas and then impact clouds with densities 100 to 1000 timeshigher than the initial beam density. the deflection angle of the jet isinfluenced more by the density contrast of the cloud than by the beam machnumber of the jet. a relativistic jet with low relativistic beam mach numbercan eventually be slightly bent after it crosses the dense cloud; however, wehave not seen permanently bent structures in the interaction of a highrelativistic beam mach number jet with a cloud. the relativistic jet impacts ondense clouds do not necessarily destroy the clouds completely, and much of thecloud body can survive as a coherent blob. this enhancement of cloud durabilityis partly due to the geometric influence of the off-axis collisions we considerand also arises from the lower rate of cloud fragmentation through thekelvin-helmholtz instability for relativistic jets. to compare our simulationswith observed extragalactic radio jets, we have computed the approximatesurface distributions of synchrotron emission at different viewing angles.these surface intensity maps show relativistic jets interacting with clouds canproduce synchrotron emission knots similar to structures observed in manyvlbi-scale radio sources. we find that the synchrotron emission increasessteeply at the moment of impact and the emission peaks right before the jetpasses through the cloud.

astro-ph;0611689	testing models of radio galaxy evolution and the cosmological impact of  fr ii radio galaxies	we investigate aspects of the cosmological evolution of fr ii radio galaxies,focusing first on the abilities of models to match data for linear-sizes, radiopowers, redshifts and spectral indices. here we consider modifications to thetheoretical models we had treated earlier, primarily by accounting for thegrowth of the radius of hotspots with source size. better fits to thedistributions of most of the data in three low-frequency surveys can be foundwith sensible choices of model parameters but no model yet considered gives agood match to all of the survey data simultaneously, nor does any do a good jobof producing the spectral index distributions. the observational datasets aretoo small to completely discriminate among the models. we calculate the volumefraction of the ``relevant universe'' cumulatively occupied by the expandingradio galaxy lobes over the quasar era, when these powerful radio galaxies weremuch more common, and when they have been argued to play an important role intriggering galaxy formation and spreading magnetic fields and metals. we foundthe cumulative relevant volume filling factor of radio galaxies to be $\sim 5%$, so we conclude that these impacts are smaller than previously estimated butthat they are still significant.
