hep-ph;9909420	microwave background anisotropies and large scale structure constraints  on isocurvature modes in a two-field model of inflation	in this paper we study the isocurvature mode contribution to the cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies and the large scale structure power spectrum,for a two-field model of inflation proposed by linde and mukhanov. we provideconstraints on the parameters of the model by comparing its predictions withobservations of the microwave background anisotropies, large scale structuredata on the galaxy power spectrum, and the number density of nearby galaxyclusters. we find that such models are consistent with observations for anarrow range of parameters. as our main result, we find that only a very smallisocurvature component is allowed, $\al \le 0.006$, for any underlyingfriedmann model. furthermore, we give the expected resolution with which themodel parameters will be determined from future satellite missions like map andplanck, for a fiducial flat $\lambda$cdm model. we find that planck missionwill be able to detect such small contributions, especially if polarizationinformation is included. the isocurvature spectral index $\niso$ will also bedetermined with better than 8% precision.

0904.3545	damped lyman-alpha systems in high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations	we investigate the properties of damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) usinghigh-resolution and large box-size cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of alambdacdm model. the numerical code used is a modification of gadget-2 with aself consistent implementation of the metal enrichment mechanism (tornatore etal. 2007). we explore the numerical convergence of some relevant physicalquantities and we vary the parameters describing the properties of galacticwinds; the initial stellar mass function; the linear dark matter power spectrumand the metal enrichment pattern of the igm (intergalactic medium) around dlas.we find that strong galactic winds with speed of about 600 km/s, in anenergy-driven wind scenario, are needed in order to match the observed columndensity distribution function for dlas and the evolution of the neutralhydrogen content with redshift. the momentum-driven implementation of thegalactic wind model, that relates the speed and mass load in the wind to theproperties of the dark matter haloes, shows a behaviour which is intermediatebetween the energy-driven galactic winds of small (100 km/s) and large (600km/s) velocities. at z=3 the contribution of haloes of masses between 10^9 and10^10 h^-1 m_sun, for dlas below 10^20.8 cm^-2, to the column densitydistribution function, is significant. by interpolating physical quantitiesalong line-of-sights through massive haloes we qualitatively show how differentgalactic wind models impact on the igm around dlas. furthermore, we analysestatistics related to the velocity widths of siii associated to dlas: themetallicity in the wind seems to be rather clumpy and this produces anunderestimation of the observed velocity widths. we outline possible solutionsto this problem.

0906.4370	cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters	we review recent progress in the description of the formation and evolutionof galaxy clusters in a cosmological context by using numerical simulations. wefocus our presentation on the comparison between simulated and observed x-rayproperties, while we will also discuss numerical predictions on properties ofthe galaxy population in clusters. many of the salient observed properties ofclusters, such as x-ray scaling relations, radial profiles of entropy anddensity of the intracluster gas, and radial distribution of galaxies arereproduced quite well. in particular, the outer regions of cluster at radiibeyond about 10 per cent of the virial radius are quite regular and exhibitscaling with mass remarkably close to that expected in the simplest case inwhich only the action of gravity determines the evolution of the intra-clustergas. however, simulations generally fail at reproducing the observed cool-corestructure of clusters: simulated clusters generally exhibit a significantexcess of gas cooling in their central regions, which causes an overestimate ofthe star formation and incorrect temperature and entropy profiles. the totalbaryon fraction in clusters is below the mean universal value, by an amountwhich depends on the cluster-centric distance and the physics included in thesimulations, with interesting tensions between observed stellar and gasfractions in clusters and predictions of simulations. besides their importantimplications for the cosmological application of clusters, these puzzles alsopoint towards the important role played by additional physical processes,beyond those already included in the simulations. we review the role played bythese processes, along with the difficulty for their implementation, anddiscuss the outlook for the future progress in numerical modeling of clusters.

1002.4122	a sub-resolution multiphase interstellar medium model of star formation  and sne energy feedback	we present a new multi-phase sub-resolution model for star formation andfeedback in sph numerical simulations of galaxy formation. our model, calledmuppi (multi-phase particle integrator), describes each gas particle as amulti-phase system, with cold and hot gas phases, coexisting in pressureequilibrium, and a stellar component. cooling of the hot tenuous gas phasefeeds the cold gas phase. stars are formed out of molecular gas with a givenefficiency, which scales with the dynamical time of the cold phase. ourprescription for star formation is not based on imposing the schmidt-kennicuttrelation, which is instead naturally produced by muppi. energy from supernovaexplosions is deposited partly into the hot phase of the gas particles, andpartly to that of neighboring particles. mass and energy flows among thedifferent phases of each particle are described by a set of ordinarydifferential equations which we explicitly integrate for each gas particle,instead of relying on equilibrium solutions. this system of equations alsoincludes the response of the multi-phase structure to energy changes associatedto the thermodynamics of the gas. we apply our model to two isolated diskgalaxy simulations and two spherical cooling flows. muppi is able to reproducethe schmidt-kennicutt relation for disc galaxies. it also reproduces the basicproperties of the inter-stellar medium in disc galaxies, the surface densitiesof cold and molecular gas, of stars and of star formation rate, the verticalvelocity dispersion of cold clouds and the flows connected to the galacticfountains. quite remarkably, muppi also provides efficient stellar feedbackwithout the need to include a scheme of kinetic energy feedback.

1011.0372	measuring the escape velocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters  beyond their virial radius	the caustic technique uses galaxy redshifts alone to measure the escapevelocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters to clustrocentric distances wellbeyond the virial radius, where dynamical equilibrium does not necessarilyhold. we provide a detailed description of this technique and analyse itspossible systematic errors. we apply the caustic technique to clusters withmass m_200&gt;=10^{14}h^{-1} m_sun extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamicsimulation of a lambdacdm universe. with a few tens of redshifts per squaredcomoving megaparsec within the cluster, the caustic technique, on average,recovers the profile of the escape velocity from the cluster with better than10 percent accuracy up to r~4 r_200. the caustic technique also recovers themass profile with better than 10 percent accuracy in the range (0.6-4) r_200,but it overestimates the mass up to 70 percent at smaller radii. thisoverestimate is a consequence of neglecting the radial dependence of thefilling function f_beta(r). the 1-sigma uncertainty on individual escapevelocity profiles increases from ~20 to ~50 percent when the radius increasesfrom r~0.1 r_200 to ~4 r_200. individual mass profiles have 1-sigma uncertaintybetween 40 and 80 percent within the radial range (0.6-4) r_200. we show thatthe amplitude of these uncertainties is completely due to the assumption ofspherical symmetry, which is difficult to drop. alternatively, we can apply thetechnique to synthetic clusters obtained by stacking individual clusters: inthis case, the 1-sigma uncertainty on the escape velocity profile is smallerthan 20 percent out to 4 r_200. the caustic technique thus provides reliableaverage profiles which extend to regions difficult or impossible to probe withother techniques.

1102.2089	measuring redshift through x-ray spectroscopy of galaxy clusters:  results from chandra data and future prospects	the ubiquitous presence of the fe line complex in the x-ray spectra of galaxyclusters offers the possibility of measuring their redshift without resortingto spectroscopic follow-up observations. in this paper we assess the accuracywith which the redshift of galaxy clusters can be recovered from an x-rayspectral analysis of chandra archival data. this study indicates a strategy tobuild large surveys of clusters whose identification and redshift measurementare both based on x-ray data alone. we apply a blind search for k--shell andl--shell fe line complex in x-ray cluster spectra using chandra archivalobservations of galaxy clusters. the fe line in the icm spectra can be detectedby simply analyzing the c-statistics variation $\delta c_{stat}$ as a functionof the redshift parameter. we repeat the measurement under differentconditions, and compare the x-ray derived redshift $z_x$ with the one obtainedby means of optical spectroscopy $z_o$. we explore how a number of priors onmetallicity and luminosity can be effectively used to reduce catastrophicerrors. the $\delta c_{stat}$ provides the most efficient means for discardingwrong redshift measures and to estimate the actual error on $z_x$. we identifya simple and efficient procedure for optimally measuring the redshifts from thex-ray spectral analysis of clusters of galaxies. when this procedure is appliedto mock catalogs extracted from high sensitivity, wide-area cluster surveys,such as those proposed with wide field x-ray telescope (wfxt) mission, it ispossible to obtain a complete samples of x-ray clusters with reliable redshiftmeasurements, thus avoiding time-consuming optical spectroscopic observations.this methodology will make it possible to trace cosmic growth by studying theevolution of the cluster mass function directly using x-ray data.

1102.4269	properties of fossil groups in cosmological simulations and galaxy  formation models	it has been a long-standing question whether fossil groups are just samplingthe tail of the distribution of ordinary groups, or whether they are aphysically distinct class of objects, characterized by an unusual and specialformation history. to study this question, we here investigate fossil groupsidentified in the hydrodynamical simulations of the gimic project, whichconsists of resimulations of five regions in the millennium simulation (ms)that are characterized by different large-scale densities, ranging from a deepvoid to a proto-cluster region. for comparison, we also consider semi-analyticmodels built on top of the ms, as well as a conditional luminosity functionapproach. we identify galaxies in the gimic simulations as groups of stars anduse a spectral synthesis code to derive their optical properties. the x-rayluminosity of the groups is estimated in terms of the thermal bremsstrahlungemission of the gas in the host halos, neglecting metallicity effects. we focuson comparing the properties of fossil groups in the theoretical models andobservational results, highlighting the differences between them, and trying toidentify possible dependencies on environment for which our approach isparticularly well set-up. we find that the optical fossil fraction in all ofour theoretical models declines with increasing halo mass, and there is noclear environmental dependence. combining the optical and x-ray selectioncriteria for fossil groups, the halo mass dependence of the fossil groups seenin optical vanishes. over the gimic halo mass range we resolve best,9.0\times1012 \sim 4.0\times1013 h-1 m, the central galaxies in the fossilgroups show similar properties as those in ordinary groups, in terms of age,metallicity, color, concentration, and mass-to-light ratio.

1105.1344	hydrodynamic simulations with the godunov sph	we present results based on an implementation of the godunov smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (gsph), originally developed by inutsuka (2002), in thegadget-3 hydrodynamic code. we first review the derivation of the gsphdiscretization of the equations of moment and energy conservation, startingfrom the convolution of these equations with the interpolating kernel. the twomost important aspects of the numerical implementation of these equations are(a) the appearance of fluid velocity and pressure obtained from the solution ofthe riemann problem between each pair of particles, and (b the absence of anartificial viscosity term. we carry out three different controlledhydrodynamical three-dimensional tests, namely the sod shock tube, thedevelopment of kelvin-helmholtz instabilities in a shear flow test, and the"blob" test describing the evolution of a cold cloud moving against a hot wind.  the results of our tests confirm and extend in a number of aspects thoserecently obtained by cha (2010): (i) gsph provides a much improved descriptionof contact discontinuities, with respect to sph, thus avoiding the appearanceof spurious pressure forces; (ii) gsph is able to follow the development ofgas-dynamical instabilities, such as the kevin--helmholtz and therayleigh-taylor ones; (iii) as a result, gsph describes the development of curlstructures in the shear-flow test and the dissolution of the cold cloud in the"blob" test.  we also discuss in detail the effect on the performances of gsph of changingdifferent aspects of its implementation. the results of our tests demonstratethat gsph is in fact a highly promising hydrodynamic scheme, also to be coupledto an n-body solver, for astrophysical and cosmological applications.[abridged]

1107.4098	convergence of galaxy properties with merger tree temporal resolution	dark matter halo merger trees are now routinely extracted from cosmologicalsimulations of structure formation. these trees are frequently used as inputsto semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone withinwhich galaxy formation takes place. by necessity, these merger trees areconstructed from a finite set of discrete "snapshots" of the n-body simulationand so have a limited temporal resolution. to date, there has been littleconsideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties ofgalaxies formed within these trees. in particular, the question of how manysnapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not beanswered. therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonicmasses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions andstar formation rates in the galacticus model of galaxy formation as a functionof the number of "snapshot" times used to represent dark matter halo mergertrees. when utilizing snapshots between z=20 and z=0, we find that at least 128snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5% for galaxy masses.this convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples ofgalaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when usingvery large numbers of snapshots. we find only weak dependence of the rate ofconvergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaceduniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansionfactor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse workequally well in almost all cases. we provide input parameters to galacticuswhich allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations andto be carried out for other galaxy properties.

1107.5740	merger induced scatter and bias in the cluster mass - sunyaev-zeldovich  effect scaling relation	we examine sources of scatter in scaling relations between galaxy clustermass and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect using cluster samples extractedfrom cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. overall, the scatter of themass-sz scaling relation is well correlated with the scatter in the mass-haloconcentration relation with more concentrated halos having stronger integratedsz signals at fixed mass. additional sources of intrinsic scatter areprojection effects from correlated structures, which cause the distribution ofscatter to deviate from log-normality and skew it towards higher inferredmasses, and the dynamical state of clusters. we study the evolution of mergingclusters based on simulations of 39 clusters and their cosmological environmentwith high time resolution. this sample enables us to study for the first timethe detailed evolution of merging clusters around the scaling relation for acosmologically representative distribution of merger parameters. major mergerscause an asymmetric scatter such that the inferred mass of merging systems isbiased low. we find mergers to be the dominant source of bias towards lowinferred masses: over 50% of outliers on this side of the scaling relationunderwent a major merger within the last gigayear. as the fraction ofdynamically disturbed clusters increases with redshift, our analysis indicatesthat mergers cause a redshift-dependent bias in scaling relations. furthermore,we find the sz morphology of massive clusters to be well correlated with theclusters' dynamical state, suggesting that morphology may be used to constrainmerger fractions and identify merger-induced outliers of the scaling relation.

1109.0484	schmidt-kennicutt relations in sph simulations of disc galaxies with  effective thermal feedback from supernovae	we study several versions of the schmidt-kennicutt (sk) relation obtained forisolated spiral galaxies in treesph simulations run with the gadget3 codeincluding the novel multi-phase particle integrator (muppi) algorithm for starformation and stellar feedback. [...] the standard sk relation between surfacedensities of cold (neutral+molecular) gas and star formation rate of simulatedgalaxies shows a steepening at low gas surface densities, starting from a kneewhose position depends on disc gas fraction: for more gas-rich discs thesteepening takes place at higher surface densities. because gas fraction andmetallicity are typically related, this environmental dependence mimics thepredictions of models where the formation of h2 is modulated by metallicity.the cold gas surface density at which hi and molecular gas surface densitiesequate can range from ~10 up to 34 msun/pc^2. as expected, the sk relationobtained using molecular gas shows much smaller variations among simulations.we find that disc pressure is not well represented by the classical externalpressure of a disc in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. instead is well fit bythe expression p_fit = sigma_cold sigma_cold kappa / 6, where the threequantities on the right-hand side are cold gas surface density, verticalvelocity dispersion and epicyclic frequency. when the "dynamical" sk relation,i.e. the relation that uses gas surface density divided by orbital time, isconsidered, we find that all of our simulations stay on the same relation. weinterpret this as a manifestation of the equilibrium between energy injectionand dissipation in stationary galaxy discs, when energetic feedback iseffective and pressure is represented by the expression given above. thesefindings further support the idea that a realistic model of the structure ofgalaxy discs should take into account energy injection by sne.

1111.3066	the effects of baryons on the halo mass function	we present an analysis of the effects of baryon physics on the halo massfunction. the analysis is based on simulations of a cosmological volume.besides a dark matter (dm) only simulation, we also carry out two otherhydrodynamical simulations. we identified halos using a spherical overdensityalgorithm and their masses are computed at three different overdensities (withrespect to the critical one), $\delta_c=200$, 500 and 1500. we find thefractional difference between halo masses in the hydrodynamical and in the dmsimulations to be almost constant, at least for halos more massive than $\log(m_{\delta_c} / \hmsun)\geq 13.5$. in this range, mass increase in thehydrodynamical simulations is of about 4-5 per cent at $\delta_c=500$ and $\sim1$ - 2 per cent at $\delta_c=200$. quite interestingly, these differences arenearly the same for both radiative and non-radiative simulations. suchvariations of halo masses induce corresponding variations of the halo massfunction (hmf). at $z=0$, the hmfs for gh and csf simulations are close to thedm one, with differences of $\mincir 3$ per cent at $\delta_c = 200$, and$\simeq 7$ per cent at $\delta_c=500$, with $\sim 10$ - 20 per cent differencesreached at $\delta_c = 1500$. at this higher overdensity, the increase of thehmf for the radiative case is larger by about a factor 2 with respect to thenon--radiative case. assuming a constant mass shift to rescale the hmf from thehydrodynamic to the dm simulations, brings the hmf difference with respect tothe dm case to be consistent with zero. our results have interestingimplications to bracket uncertainties in the mass function calibrationassociated to the uncertain baryon physics, in view of cosmologicalapplications of future large surveys of galaxy clusters.

1201.3568	the halo mass function in interacting dark energy models	we present a detailed investigation of the effects that a direct interactionbetween dark energy (de) and cold dark matter (cdm) particles imprints on thehalo mass function (hmf) of groups and clusters of galaxies. making use of thepublic halo catalogs of the {\small codecs} simulations, we derive the hmf forseveral different types of coupled de scenarios both based on the fof algorithmand on the so halo identification for different values of the overdensitythreshold $\delta_{c}$. we compare the computed hmfs for coupled de cosmologieswith $\lambda $cdm as well as with the predictions of the standard analyticfitting functions. our results show that the standard fitting functions stillreproduce reasonably well both the fof and the so hmfs of interacting decosmologies at intermediate masses and at low redshifts, once rescaled to thecharacteristic amplitude of linear density perturbations of each specific modelas given by $\sigma_{8}$. however, we also find that such apparent degeneracywith $\sigma_{8}$ is broken both by the high-mass tail and by the redshiftevolution of our hmfs, with deviations beyond $\sim 10%$ for most of the modelsunder investigation. furthermore, the discrepancy with respect to thepredictions of standard fitting functions rescaled with the characteristicvalue of $\sigma_{8}$ shows -- for some models -- a strong dependence on thespherical overdensity threshold $\delta_{c}$ used for the halo identification.we find that such effect is due to a significant increase of halo concentrationat low redshifts in these models, that is however absent in the majority of thecosmological scenarios considered in this work. we can therefore conclude thatthe universality of the hmf is violated by cosmological models that feature adirect interaction between de and cdm.

1202.0550	simulating the evolution of disc galaxies in a group environment. i. the  influence of the global tidal field	we present the results of a series of numerical simulations aimed to studythe evolution of a disc galaxy within the global tidal field of a groupenvironment. both the disc galaxy and the group are modelled asmulti-component, collision-less, n-body systems, composed by both dark matterand stars. in our simulations, the evolution of disc galaxies is followed astheir orbits sink towards the group centre, under the effect of dynamicalfriction. we explore a broad parameter space, covering several aspects of thegalaxy-group interaction that are potentially relevant to galaxy evolution.namely, prograde and retrograde orbits, orbital eccentricities, discinclination, role of a central bulge in discs, internal disc kinematics, andgalaxy-to-group mass ratios. we find that significant disc transformationsoccur only after the mean density of the group, measured within the orbit ofthe galaxy, exceeds ~0.3-1 times the central mean density of the galaxy. themorphological evolution of discs is found to be strongly dependent on theinitial inclination of the disc with respect to its orbital plane. that is,discs on face-on and retrograde orbits are shown to retain longer their discstructures and kinematics, in comparison to prograde discs. this suggests thatafter interacting with the global tidal field alone, a significant fraction ofdisc galaxies should be found in the central regions of groups. prominentcentral bulges are not produced, and pre-existing bulges are not enhanced indiscs after the interaction with the group. assuming that most s0 are formed ingroup environments, this implies that prominent bulges should be formed mostlyby young stars, created only after a galaxy has been accreted by a group.finally, contrary to some current implementations of tidal stripping insemi-analytical models of galaxy evolution, we find that more massive galaxiessuffer more tidal stripping.

1202.5212	a warm mode of gas accretion on forming galaxies	we present results from high--resolution cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations of a milky--way-sized halo, aimed at studying the effect offeedback on the nature of gas accretion. simulations include a model ofinter-stellar medium and star formation, in which sn explosions provideeffective thermal feedback. we distinguish between gas accretion onto the halo,which occurs when gas particles cross the halo virial radius, and gas accretiononto the central galaxy, which takes place when gas particles cross the innerone-tenth of the virial radius. gas particles can be accreted through threedifferent channels, depending on the maximum temperature value, $t_{\rm max}$,reached during the particles' past evolution: a cold channel for $t_{\rmmax}&lt;2.5 \times 10^5$ k, a hot one for $t&gt;10^6$k, and a warm one forintermediate values of $t_{\rm max}$. we find that the warm channel is at leastas important as the cold one for gas accretion onto the central galaxy. thisresult is at variance with previous findings that the cold mode dominates gasaccretion at high redshift. we ascribe this difference to the differentsupernova feedback scheme implemented in our simulations. while resultspresented so far in the literature are based on uneffective sn thermal feedbackschemes and/or the presence of a kinetic feedback, our simulations include onlyeffective thermal feedback. we argue that observational detections of a warmaccretion mode in the high--redshift circum-galactic medium would provideuseful constraints on the nature of the feedback that regulates star formationin galaxies.

1203.5251	tomographic weak lensing shear spectra from large n-body and  hydrodynamical simulations	forthcoming experiments will enable us to determine tomographic shear spectraat a high precision level. most predictions about them have until now beenbiased on algorithms yielding the expected linear and non-linear spectrum ofdensity fluctuations. even when simulations have been used, so-called halofit(smith et al 2003) predictions on fairly large scales have been needed. we wishto go beyond this limitation. we perform n-body and hydrodynamical simulationswithin a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connectionbetween simulations and linear spectra. while covering large length-scales, thesimulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-lharmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l ~ 50000), well into the domain wherebaryon physics becomes important. we then compare shear spectra in the absenceand in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling,star formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds. wedistinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in thedifferent simulations and test their impact on shear spectra. we compare ouroutputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non--linearspectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results andthose of purely n-body results. our simulations and the treatment of theiroutputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results taht arefully independent of any approximate expression, also in the high-l range,where we need to incorporate a non-linear power spectrum of densityperturbations, and the effects of baryon physics. this will allow us to fullyexploit the cosmological information contained in future high--sensitivitycosmic shear surveys, exploring the physics of cosmic shears via weak lensingmeasurements.

1208.5770	how baryonic processes affect strong lensing properties of simulated  galaxy clusters	the observed abundance of giant arcs produced by galaxy cluster lenses andthe measured einstein radii have presented a source of tension for lcdm.previous cosmological tests for high-redshift clusters (z&gt;0.5) have sufferedfrom small number statistics in the simulated sample and the implementation ofbaryonic physics is likely to affect the outcome. we analyse zoomed-insimulations of a fairly large sample of cluster-sized objects, with mvir &gt;3x10^14 msun/h, identified at z=0.25 and z=0.5, for a concordance lcdmcosmology. we start with dark matter only simulations, and then add gashydrodynamics, with different treatments of baryonic processes: non-radiativecooling, radiative cooling with star formation and galactic winds powered bysupernova explosions, and finally including the effect of agn feedback. we findthat the addition of gas in non-radiative simulations does not change thestrong lensing predictions significantly, but gas cooling and star formationtogether significantly increase the number of expected giant arcs and theeinstein radii, particularly for lower redshift clusters and lower sourceredshifts. further inclusion of agn feedback reduces the predicted stronglensing efficiencies such that the lensing probability distributions becomescloser to those obtained for simulations including only dark matter. ourresults indicate that the inclusion of baryonic physics in simulations will notsolve the arc-statistics problem at low redshifts, when the physical processesincluded provide a realistic description of cooling in the central regions ofgalaxy clusters.

1301.1682	the relation between velocity dispersion and mass in simulated clusters  of galaxies: dependence on the tracer and the baryonic physics	[abridged] we present an analysis of the relation between the masses ofcluster- and group-sized halos, extracted from $\lambda$cdm cosmological n-bodyand hydrodynamic simulations, and their velocity dispersions, at differentredshifts from $z=2$ to $z=0$. the main aim of this analysis is to understandhow the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects suchrelation, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy forcluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of thebaryonic physics. in our analysis we use several sets of simulations withdifferent physics implemented. velocity dispersions are determined using threedifferent tracers, dm particles, subhalos, and galaxies.  we confirm that dm particles trace a relation that is fully consistent withthe theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem and with previousresults presented in the literature. on the other hand, subhalos and galaxiestrace steeper relations, and with larger values of the normalization. suchrelations imply that galaxies and subhalos have a $\sim10$ per cent velocitybias relative to the dm particles, which can be either positive or negative,depending on halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation.  we explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamicalfriction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not ondm particles. these processes appear to be more or less effective, depending onthe halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create anon-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the $\soned$--$\mtwo$ relationon the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift.  these results are relevant in view of the application of velocity dispersionas a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large redshift surveys.

1301.7476	on the discrepancy between theoretical and x-ray concentration-mass  relations for galaxy clusters	[abridged] in the past 15 years, the concentration-mass relation has beeninvestigated diffusely in theoretical studies. on the other hand, only recentlyhas this relation been derived from x-ray observations. when that happened, theresults caused a certain level of concern: the x-ray normalizations and slopeswere found significantly dissimilar from those predicted by theory.  we analyzed 52 objects, simulated each time with different physical recipesfor the baryonic component, as well as 60 synthetic x-ray images, to determineif these discrepancies are real or artificial. in particular, we investigatehow the simulated concentration-mass relation depends (1) on the radial rangeused to derive the concentration, (2) on the presence of baryons in thesimulations, and on the prescription used to reproduce the gas. finally, weevaluate (3) how the results differ when adopting an x-ray approach for theanalysis and (4) how the selection functions based on x-ray luminosity canimpact the results. all effects studied go in the direction of alleviating thediscrepancy between observations and simulations, although with differentsignificance: while the fitting radial range and the baryonic component playonly a minor role, the x-ray approach and selection function have profoundrepercussion on the resulting concentration-mass relation.

1303.2117	an improved prescription for merger time-scales from controlled  simulations	we compare three analytical prescriptions for merger times available from theliterature to simulations of isolated mergers. we probe three differentredshifts, and several halo concentrations, mass ratios, orbital circularitiesand orbital energies of the satellite. we find that prescriptions available inthe literature significantly under-predict long timescales for mergers at highredshift. we argue that these results have not been highlighted previouslyeither because the evolution of halo concentration of satellite galaxies hasbeen neglected (in previous isolated merger simulations), or because longmerger times and mergers with high initial orbital circularities areunder-represented (for prescriptions based on cosmological simulations).motivated by the evolution of halo concentration at fixed mass, an explicitdependence on redshift added as t_merger,modified(z) = (1+z)^0.44 t_merger tothe prescription based on isolated mergers gives a significant improvement inthe predicted merger times up to ~20 t_dyn in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2. whenthis modified prescription is used to compute galaxy stellar mass functions, wefind that it leads up to a 25 per cent increase in the number of low massgalaxies surviving at z=0, and a 10 per cent increase for more massivegalaxies. this worsen the known over-prediction in the number of low massgalaxies by hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1308.0333	cosmological simulations of black hole growth: agn luminosities and  downsizing	in this study, we present a detailed, statistical analysis of black holegrowth and the evolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) using cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations run down to $z=0$. the simulations self-consistentlyfollow radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment, black hole growthand associated feedback processes from both supernovae typeii/ia and agn. weconsider two simulation runs, one with a large co-moving volume of $(500\\mathrm{mpc})^3$ and one with a smaller volume of $(68\ \mathrm{mpc})^3$ butwith a by a factor of almost 20 higher mass resolution. consistently withprevious results, our simulations can widely match observed black holeproperties of the local universe. furthermore, our simulations can successfullyreproduce the evolution of the bolometric agn luminosity function for both thelow-luminosity and the high-luminosity end up to $z=3.0$. in addition, thesmaller but higher resolution run is able to match the observational data ofthe low bolometric luminosity end at higher redshifts $z=3-4$. we also performa direct comparison with the observed soft and hard x-ray luminosity functionsof agn, including an empirical correction for a torus-level obscuration, andfind a similarly good agreement. these results nicely demonstrate that theobserved "anti-hierarchical" trend in the agn number density evolution (i.e.the number densities of luminous agn peak at higher redshifts than those offaint agn) is self-consistently predicted by our simulations. implications ofthis downsizing behaviour on active black holes, their masses andeddington-ratios are discussed. overall, the downsizing behaviour in the agnnumber density as a function of redshift can be mainly attributed to theevolution of the gas density in the resolved vicinity of a (massive) blackhole.

1308.3246	brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations: achievements and  limitations of agn feedback models	we analyze the basic properties of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) producedby state of the art cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations. thesesimulations have been run with different sub-grid physics included. here wefocus on the results obtained with and without the inclusion of theprescriptions for supermassive black hole (smbh) growth and of the ensuingactive galactic nuclei (agn) feedback. the latter process goes in the rightdirection of decreasing significantly the overall formation of stars. however,bcgs end up still containing too much stellar mass, a problem that increaseswith halo mass, and having an unsatisfactory structure. this is in the sensethat their effective radii are too large, and that their density profilesfeature a flattening on scales much larger than observed. we also find that ourmodel of thermal agn feedback has very little effect on the stellar velocitydispersions, which turn out to be very large. taken together, these problems,which to some extent can be recognized also in other numerical studiestypically dealing with smaller halo masses, indicate that on one hand presentday sub-resolution models of agn feedback are not effective enough indiminishing the global formation of stars in the most massive galaxies, but onthe other hand they are relatively too effective in their centers. it is likelythat a form of feedback generating large scale gas outflows from bcgsprecursors, and a more widespread effect over the galaxy volume, can alleviatethese difficulties.

1311.1514	cosmology with massive neutrinos iii: the halo mass function and an  application to galaxy clusters	we use a suite of n-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos as anextra-set of particles to investigate their effect on the halo mass function.we show that for cosmologies with massive neutrinos the mass function of darkmatter haloes selected using the spherical overdensity (so) criterion is wellreproduced by the fitting formula of tinker et al. (2008) once the cold darkmatter power spectrum is considered instead of the total matter power, as it isusually done. the differences between the two implementations, i.e. using$p_{\rm cdm}(k)$ instead of $p_{\rm m}(k)$, are more pronounced for largevalues of the neutrino masses and in the high end of the halo mass function: inparticular, the number of massive haloes is higher when $p_{\rm cdm}(k)$ isconsidered rather than $p_{\rm m}(k)$. as a quantitative application of ourfindings we consider a planck-like sz-clusters survey and show that thedifferences in predicted number counts can be as large as $30\%$ for $\summ_\nu = 0.4$ ev. finally, we use the planck-sz clusters sample, with anapproximate likelihood calculation, to derive planck-like constraints oncosmological parameters. we find that, in a massive neutrino cosmology, ourcorrection to the halo mass function produces a shift in the$\sigma_8(\omega_{\rm m}/0.27)^\gamma$ relation which can be quantified as$\delta \gamma \sim 0.05$ and $\delta \gamma \sim 0.14$ assuming one($n_\nu=1$) or three ($n_\nu=3$) degenerate massive neutrino, respectively. theshift results in a lower mean value of $\sigma_8$ with $\delta \sigma_8 = 0.01$for $n_\nu=1$ and $\delta \sigma_8 = 0.02$ for $n_\nu=3$, respectively. suchdifference, in a cosmology with massive neutrinos, would increase the tensionbetween cluster abundance and planck cmb measurements.

1312.5310	simulated star formation rate functions at z~4-7, and the role of  feedback in high-z galaxies	we study the role of feedback from supernovae and black holes in theevolution of the star formation rate function (sfrf) of z~4-7 galaxies. we usea new set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, angus (australian gadget-3early universe simulations), run with a modified and improved version of theparallel treepm-smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gadget-3 calledp-gadget3(xxl), that includes a self-consistent implementation of stellarevolution and metal enrichment. in our simulations both supernova (sn) drivengalactic winds and active galactic nuclei (agn) act simultaneously in a complexinterplay. the sfrf is insensitive to feedback prescription at z&gt;5, meaningthat it cannot be used to discriminate between feedback models duringreionisation. however, the sfrf is sensitive to the details of feedbackprescription at lower redshift. by exploring different sn driven windvelocities and regimes for the agn feedback, we find that the key factor forreproducing the observed sfrfs is a combination of "strong" sn winds and earlyagn feedback in low mass galaxies. conversely, we show that the choice ofinitial mass function and inclusion of metal cooling have less impact on theevolution of the sfrf. when variable winds are considered, we find that anon-aggressive wind scaling is needed to reproduce the sfrfs at z&gt;4. otherwise,the amount of objects with low sfrs is greatly suppressed and at the same timewinds are not effective enough in the most massive systems.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1402.1493	the effect of agn feedback on the halo mass function	[abridged.] we investigate baryon effects on the halo mass function (hmf),with emphasis on the role played by agn feedback. halos are identified withboth friends-of-friends (fof) and spherical overdensity (so) algorithms. weembed the standard so algorithm into a memory-controlled frame program andpresent the {\bf p}ython spher{\bf i}c{\bf a}l {\bf o}verdensity code ---{\small piao}.  for both fof and so halos, the effect of agn feedback is that of suppressingthe hmfs to a level even below that of dark matter simulations. the ratiobetween the hmfs in the agn and in the dm simulations is $\sim 0.8$ atoverdensity $\delta_c=500$, a difference that increases at higher overdensity$\delta_c=2500$, with no significant redshift and mass dependence. a decreaseof the halo masses ratio with respect to the dm case induces the decrease ofthe hmf in the agn simulation. the shallower inner density profiles of halos inthe agn simulation witnesses that mass reduction is induced by the suddendisplacement of gas induced by thermal agn feedback. we provide fittingfunctions to describe halo mass variations at different overdensities, whichcan recover the hmfs with a residual random scatter $\lt 5$ per cent for halomasses larger than $10^{13} ~h^{-1}{\rm m_\odot}$.

(i) when the contribution from poorly resolved halosis subtracted out, sams tend to under-predict by ~30 per cent the mass thatcools in the infall-dominated regime. (ii) at large halo masses sams tend toover-predict cooling rates, though the numerical result may be affected by theuse of sph. (iii) as found in our previous work, cooling rates are found to besignificantly affected by model details: simulations disfavour models withlarge cores and with quenching of cooling at major mergers. (iv) when coolingis switched on at z~2, cold gas accumulates very quickly in the simulatedhalos. this accumulation is reproduced by sams with varying degrees ofaccuracy.

1406.4410	temperature structure of the intra-cluster medium from sph and amr  simulations	analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters suggestthat x-ray masses can be underestimated by 10% to 30%. the largest biasoriginates by both violation of hydrostatic equilibrium and an additionaltemperature bias caused by inhomogeneities in the x-ray emitting intra-clustermedium (icm). to elucidate on this large dispersion among theoreticalpredictions, we evaluate the degree of temperature structures in cluster setssimulated either with smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (sph) andadaptive-mesh-refinement (amr) codes. we find that the sph simulations producelarger temperature variations connected to the persistence of bothsubstructures and their stripped cold gas. this difference is more evident inno-radiative simulations, while it is reduced in the presence of radiativecooling. we also find that the temperature variation in radiative clustersimulations is generally in agreement with the observed one in the centralregions of clusters. around r_500 the temperature inhomogeneities of the sphsimulations can generate twice the typical hydrostatic-equilibrium mass bias ofthe amr sample. we emphasize that a detailed understanding of the physicalprocesses responsible for the complex thermal structure in icm requiresimproved resolution and high sensitivity observations in order to extend theanalysis to higher temperature systems and larger cluster-centric radii.

(2010) at a 3 sigma level, thus indicating that our stellar disksare still too massive for the dark matter halo in which they reside. resultsare found to be remarkably stable against resolution. this further demonstratesthe feasibility of carrying out simulations producing a realistic population ofgalaxies within representative cosmological volumes, at a relatively modestresolution.

1510.04277	neutral hydrogen in galaxy clusters: impact of agn feedback and  implications for intensity mapping	by means of zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations we quantify the amount ofneutral hydrogen (hi) hosted by groups and clusters of galaxies. oursimulations, which are based on an improved formulation of smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph), include radiative cooling, star formation, metalenrichment and supernova feedback, and can be split in two different groups,depending on whether feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) is turned on oroff. simulations are analyzed to account for hi self-shielding and the presenceof molecular hydrogen. we find that the mass in neutral hydrogen of dark matterhalos monotonically increases with the halo mass and can be well described by apower-law of the form $m_{\rm hi}(m,z)\propto m^{3/4}$. our results point outthat agn feedback reduces both the total halo mass and its hi mass, although itis more efficient in removing hi. we conclude that agn feedback reduces theneutral hydrogen mass of a given halo by $\sim50\%$, with a weak dependence onhalo mass and redshift. the spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen withinhalos is also affected by agn feedback, whose effect is to decrease thefraction of hi that resides in the halo inner regions. by extrapolating ourresults to halos not resolved in our simulations we derive astrophysicalimplications from the measurements of $\omega_{\rm hi}(z)$: halos with circularvelocities larger than $\sim25~{\rm km/s}$ are needed to host hi in order toreproduce observations. we find that only the model with agn feedback iscapable of reproducing the value of $\omega_{\rm hi}b_{\rm hi}$ derived fromavailable 21cm intensity mapping observations.

(2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

1512.01253	how does our choice of observable influence our estimation of the centre  of a galaxy cluster? insights from cosmological simulations	galaxy clusters are an established and powerful test-bed for theories of bothgalaxy evolution and cosmology. accurate interpretation of cluster observationsoften requires robust identification of the location of the centre. using astatistical sample of clusters drawn from a suite of cosmological simulationsin which we have explored a range of galaxy formation models, we investigatehow the location of this centre is affected by the choice of observable -stars, hot gas, or the full mass distribution as can be probed by thegravitational potential. we explore several measures of cluster centre: theminimum of the gravitational potential, which would expect to define the centreif the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium; the peak of the density; the centreof bcg; and the peak and centroid of x-ray luminosity. we find that the centreof bcg correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potentialthan the x-ray defined centres, while agn feedback acts to significantlyenhance the offset between the peak x-ray luminosity and minimum gravitationalpotential. these results highlight the importance of centre identification wheninterpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoreticalpredictions and observational data.

astro-ph;0209035	the evolution of x-ray clusters of galaxies	considerable progress has been made over the last decade in the study of theevolutionary trends of the population of galaxy clusters in the universe. inthis review we focus on observations in the x-ray band. x-ray surveys with therosat satellite, supplemented by follow-up studies with asca and beppo-sax,have allowed an assessment of the evolution of the space density of clustersout to z~1, and the evolution of the physical properties of the intra-clustermedium out to z~0.5. with the advent of chandra and newton-xmm, and theirunprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution, these studies have beenextended beyond redshift unity and have revealed the complexity of thethermodynamical structure of clusters. the properties of the intra-cluster gasare significantly affected by non-gravitational processes including starformation and active galactic nucleus (agn) activity. convincing evidence hasemerged for modest evolution of both the bulk of the x-ray cluster populationand their thermodynamical properties since redshift unity. such anobservational scenario is consistent with hierarchical models of structureformation in a flat low density universe with omega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.7-0.8for the normalization of the power spectrum. basic methodologies forconstruction of x-ray-selected cluster samples are reviewed and implications ofcluster evolution for cosmological models are discussed.

astro-ph;0301601	recovering the initial condition of our local universe from nog and pscz  catalogues	we apply the ztrace algorithm to the optical nog and infra-red pscz galaxycatalogues to reconstruct the pattern of primordial fluctuations that havegenerated our local universe. we check that the density fields traced by thetwo catalogues are well correlated, and consistent with a linear relation(either in $\delta$ or in log(1+$\delta$)) with relative bias (of nog withrespect to pscz) b_rel = 1.1 $\pm$ 0.1. the relative bias relation is used tofill the optical zone of avoidance at |b| &lt; 20$^\circ$ using the pscz galaxydensity field. we perform extensive testing on simulated galaxy catalogues tooptimize the reconstruction. the quality of the reconstruction is predicted tobe good at large scales, up to a limiting wavenumber k_lim $\simeq$ 0.4 h/mpcbeyond which all information is lost. we find that the improvement due to thedenser sampling of the optical catalogue is compensated by the uncertaintiesconnected to the larger zone of avoidance. the initial conditions reconstructedfrom the nog catalogue are found (analogously to those from the pscz) to beconsistent with gaussian paradigm. we use the reconstructions to produce setsof initial conditions ready to be used for constrained simulations of our localuniverse.

astro-ph;0605575	cosmology with clusters of galaxies	in this chapter i review the role that galaxy clusters play as tools toconstrain cosmological parameters. i will concentrate mostly on the applicationof the mass function of galaxy clusters, while other methods, such as thatbased on the baryon fraction, are covered by other chapters of the book. sincemost of the cosmological applications of galaxy clusters rely on precisemeasurements of their masses, a substantial part of my lectures concentrates onthe different methods that have been applied so far to weight galaxy clusters.i provide in section 2 a short introduction to the basics of cosmic structureformation. in section 3 i describe the press--schechter (ps) formalism toderive the cosmological mass function, then discussing extensions of the psapproach and the most recent calibrations from n--body simulations. in section4 i review the methods to build samples of galaxy clusters at differentwavelengths. section 5 is devoted to the discussion of different methods toderive cluster masses. in section 6 i describe the cosmological constraints,which have been obtained so far by tracing the cluster mass function with avariety of methods. finally, i describe in section 7 the future perspectivesfor cosmology with galaxy clusters and the challenges for clusters to keepplaying an important role in the era of precision cosmology.

astro-ph;0610045	diffuse stellar component in galaxy clusters and the evolution of the  most massive galaxies at z&lt;~1	the high end of the stellar mass function of galaxies is observed to havelittle evolution since z~1. this represents a stringent constraint formerger--based models, aimed at explaining the evolution of the most massivegalaxies in the concordance lambdacdm cosmology. in this letter we show that itis possible to remove the tension between the above observations and modelpredictions by allowing a fraction of stars to be scattered to the diffusestellar component (dsc) of galaxy clusters at each galaxy merger, as recentlysuggested by the analysis of n-body hydrodynamical simulations. to thispurpose, we use the morgana model of galaxy formation in a minimal version, inwhich gas cooling and star formation are switched off after z=1. in this way,any predicted evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function is purely driven bymergers. we show that, even in this extreme case, the predicted degree ofevolution of the high end of the stellar mass function is larger than thatsuggested by data. assuming instead that a significant fraction, ~30 per cent,of stars are scattered in the dsc at each merger event, leads to a significantsuppression of the predicted evolution, in better agreement with observationalconstraints, while providing a total amount of dsc in clusters which isconsistent with recent observational determinations.

astro-ph;9404054	scaling in the universe	the aim of this review article is to give a comprehensive description of thescaling properties detected for the distribution of cosmic structures. due tothe great variety of statistical methods to describe the large-scale structureof the universe, i will mainly concentrate on those methods which revealremarkable regularities and scaling in the structure of the universe. althoughin most cases i prefer not to enter into the technical aspects of howimplementing such methods, more details will be furnishes about the descriptionof galaxy clustering in terms of fractal concepts. despite recent claims for auniverse, which behaves like a fractal at arbitrarily large scales, i will showthat the fractal language can be usefully employed to disprove this picture.the emerging scenario is that of a universe, which behaves like a self-similarstructure at small scales, where fractality is dynamically generated bynon-linear gravitational clustering, while preserving large-scale homogeneity.nevertheless, even at scales $\magcir 10\hm$, where gravity still actslinearly, the distribution of galaxy clusters shows remarkable scale-invariantfeatures, which could give precise hints about the initial conditions for theevolution of the large-scale structure of the universe.

astro-ph;9405003	damped lyman alpha systems vs. cold + hot dark matter	although the cold + hot dark matter (chdm) cosmology provides perhaps thebest fit of any model to all the available data at the current epoch, chdmproduces structure at relatively low redshifts and thus could be ruled out ifthere were evidence for formation of massive objects at high redshifts. dampedly$\alpha$ systems are abundant in quasar absorption spectra and thus providepossibly the most significant evidence for early structure formation, and thusperhaps the most stringent constraint on chdm. using the numbers of halos inn-body simulations to normalize press-schechter estimates of the numberdensities of protogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that chdm with$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the dampedly$\alpha$ data at $\le 2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with thelimited $z&gt;3$ damped ly$\alpha$ data. the situation is uncertain because thereis very little data for $z&gt;3$, and also it is unclear whether all dampedly$\alpha$ systems are associated with collapsed protogalaxies. the predictionsof chdm are quite sensitive to the hot (neutrino) fraction, and we find that$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.675/0.25/0.075$ is compatible even with the$z&gt;3$ data. this corresponds to lowering the neutrino mass from 6.8 to 5.7 ev,for $h_0=50\kmsmpc$. in chdm, the higher redshift damped ly$\alpha$ systems arepredicted to have lower masses, which can be checked by measuring the velocitywidths of the associated metal line systems.

astro-ph;9410022	damped lyman alpha systems vs. cold + hot dark matter	damped ly$\alpha$ systems provide possibly the most significant evidence forearly structure formation, and thus a stringent constraint on the cold + hotdark matter (chdm) cosmology. using the numbers of halos in n-body simulationsto normalize press-schechter (ps) estimates of the number densities ofprotogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that chdm with$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the dampedly$\alpha$ data only at $z&lt;2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with dataat $z&gt;3$. the predictions of chdm are quite sensitive to the neutrino fraction.we find that $\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.725/0.20/0.075$ is compatiblewith the $z&gt;3$ data. with one massive neutrino species, this corresponds tolowering the neutrino mass from 7.0 to 4.7 ev, for $h_0=50\kmsmpc$ and$t=2.726$ k. by analysing our numerical simulations with different resolutionsand box sizes as well as those of ma \&amp; bertchinger (1994), we show that forthe chdm models with $\omega_\nu$=0.2--0.3 the ps approximation should be usedwith gaussian filter with $\delta_c=1.3-1.4$ if one tries to recover the totalmass of a collapsed halo and to include nonlinear effects, due to waves bothlonger and shorter than those within the simulation box.

astro-ph;9511066	the cluster distribution as a test of dark matter models. iii. the  cluster velocity field	we study the large-scale velocity fields traced by galaxy clusters innumerical simulations of a box of side 960 $h^{-1}$ mpc, and compare them withavailable data on real clusters. in order to test the reliability of thesimulations, which are based on an optimized version of the zel'dovichapproximation, we compare their cluster velocities with those of "exact" n-bodysimulations, and find a remarkable agreement between the two according to avariety of statistical tests. we analyse cold dark matter models with densityparameter in the range $0.2\le \omega_0\le 1$, both with and without thecosmological constant term to provide a flat geometry. we also simulate acold+hot dark matter model, with 30% provided by the hot component. comparisonwith real data is performed by applying tests based on the cumulative velocityfrequency distribution (cvfd) and bulk flow statistics. for the cvfd, we useobservational velocity data from different authors. by merging all availabledata in a combined sample, the cvfd test is able to exclude only open modelswith $\omega_0\le 0.4$ and flat models with $\omega_0=0.2$. however, theanalysis of individual observational samples gives contradictory results; inparticular the recent giovanelli data, which imply much lower velocities (withsignificantly smaller uncertainties) than the other data, are actually onlyconsistent with the open $\omega_0=0.4$ and the flat $\omega_0=0.2$ models,i.e. the models which are excluded by the other data. furthermore, cvfd andbulk flow analyses of the branchini et al. reconstructed velocity datadisfavour precisely those models accepted on the grounds of giovanelli'ssample. finally, we confirm that the lauer &amp; postman bulk flow determination isan extremely rare event in the cosmological models we have analysed.

astro-ph;9603150	large-scale structure in mixed dark matter models with a non-thermal  volatile component	we investigate the properties of large--scale structure predicted in a classof mixed dark matter models in which the volatile component (made of particleswith high rms velocity) derives from the decay of a heavier particle. suchmodels based on cold+volatile dark matter (cvdm) differ from the standardmixture of cdm and massive neutrinos, usually known as chdm, in that theyinvolve a component which has a non--thermal phase space distribution function.as a consequence, and differently from chdm models, the value of the redshiftat which volatile particles become non relativistic, $z_{nr}$, can be variedalmost independently of the volatile fraction, $\omega_x$. we compute transferfunctions for a selection of such models, having $0.1\le \omega_x\le 0.5$ anddifferent values of $z_{nr}$. using linear theory and assuming a scale--freeprimordial spectrum, we compare such models with observational constraints onlarge--scale galaxy clustering and bulk flows, as well as on the abundance ofgalaxy clusters and high--redshift damped ly$\alpha$ systems. we find thatthese constraints enable us to discriminate between different $\omega_x$ and$z_{nr}$; within the range of the models inspected, those which can be mosteasily accommodated by the data correspond to the parameter choice$\omega_x\simeq 0.2$ and $z_{nr} \simeq 2\times 10^4\omega_x$.

astro-ph;9709047	the formation of cosmic structures in a light gravitino dominated  universe	we analyse the formation of cosmic structures in models where the dark matteris dominated by light gravitinos with mass of $ 100$ ev -- 1 kev, as predictedby gauge-mediated supersymmetry (susy) breaking models. after evaluating thenumber of degrees of freedom at the gravitinos decoupling ($g_*$), we computethe transfer function for matter fluctuations and show that gravitinos behavelike warm dark matter (wdm) with free-streaming scale comparable to the galaxymass scale. we consider different low-density variants of the wdm model, bothwith and without cosmological constant, and compare the predictions on theabundances of neutral hydrogen within high-redshift damped ly--$\alpha$ systemsand on the number density of local galaxy clusters with the correspondingobservational constraints. we find that none of the models satisfies bothconstraints at the same time, unless a rather small $\omega_0$ value ($\mincir0.4$) and a rather large hubble parameter ($\magcir 0.9$) is assumed.furthermore, in a model with warm + hot dark matter, with hot componentprovided by massive neutrinos, the strong suppression of fluctuation on scalesof $\sim 1\hm$ precludes the formation of high-redshift objects, when thelow--$z$ cluster abundance is required. we conclude that all different variantsof a light gravitino dm dominated model show strong difficulties for whatconcerns cosmic structure formation.  this gives a severe cosmological constraint on the gauge-mediated susybreaking scheme.

astro-ph;9810467	seeking the local convergence depth. the abell cluster dipole flow to  200 mpc/h	we have obtained new tully-fisher (tf) peculiar velocity measurements for 52abell galaxy clusters distributed throughout the sky between ~ 50 and 200mpc/h.the measurements are based on i band photometry and optical rotationcurves for a sample of 522 spiral galaxies, from which an accurate tf templaterelation has been constructed. individual cluster tf relations are referred tothe template to compute cluster peculiar motions.  the reflex motion of the local group of galaxies is measured with respect tothe reference frame defined by our cluster sample and the distant portion ofthe giovanelli et al. (1998) cluster set. we find the local group motion inthis frame to be 565+/-113 km/s in the direction (l,b)=(267,26)+/-10 whenpeculiar velocities are weighted according to their errors. after optimizingthe dipole calculation to sample equal volumes equally, the vector is 509+/-195km/s towards (255,33)+/-22. both solutions agree, to within 1-sigma or better,with the local group motion as inferred from the cosmic microwave background(cmb) dipole. thus, the cluster sample as a whole moves slowly in the cmbreference frame, its bulk flow being at most 200 km/s.

0812.0333	the impact of simulations in cosmology and galaxy formation a summary of  the workshop novicosmo 2008	in the study of the process of cosmic structure formation numericalsimulations are crucial tools to interface observational data to theoreticalmodels and to investigate issues otherwise unexplored. enormous advances havebeen achieved in the last years thanks to the availability of sophisticatedcodes, now allowing to tackle the problem of cosmic structure formation andsubsequent evolution by covering larger and larger dynamical ranges. moreover,computational cosmology is the ideal interpretative framework for theoverwhelming amount of new data from extragalactic surveys and from largesample of individual objects. the workshop novicosmo 2008 "the impact ofsimulations in cosmology and galaxy formation' held in sissa was aimed atproviding the state-of-the-art on the latest numerical simulations in cosmologyand in galaxy formation. particular emphasis was given to the implementation ofnew physical processes in simulation codes, to the comparison between differentcodes and numerical schemes and how to use best supercomputing facilities ofthe next generation. finally, the impact on our knowledge on the physics of theuniverse brought by this new channel of investigation has also been focused.the workshop was divided in three sections corresponding (roughly) to threemain areas of study: reionization and intergalactic medium; dark and luminousmatter in galaxies; clusters of galaxies and large scale structures. this paperwill provide i) a short resume' of the scientific results of the workshop ii)the complete list of the talks and the instructions on how to retrieve the .pdfof the related (powerpoint) presentations iii) a brief presentation of theassociated exhibition "space art"
