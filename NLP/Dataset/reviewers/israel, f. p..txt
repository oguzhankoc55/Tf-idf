0901.1656	disentangling the circumnuclear environs of centaurus a: i. high  resolution molecular gas imaging	we present high resolution images of the 12co(2-1) emission in the central 1'(1 kpc) of ngc 5128 (centaurus a), observed using the sma. we elucidate for thefirst time the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in this regionwith a resolution of 6'.0 x 2'.4 (100 pc x 40 pc). we spatially resolve thecircumnuclear molecular gas in the inner 24'' x 12'' (400 pc x 200 pc), whichis elongated along a position angle p.a. = 155 deg and perpendicular to theradio/x-ray jet. the se and nw components of the circumnuclear gas areconnected to molecular gas found at larger radii. this gas appears as twoparallel filaments at p.a. = 120 deg, which are coextensive with the long sidesof the 3 kiloparsec parallelogram shape of the previously observed dustcontinuum, as well as ionized and pure rotational h2 lines. spatial andkinematical asymmetries are apparent in both the circumnuclear and outer gas,suggesting non-coplanar and/or non-circular motions. we extend to inner radii(r &lt; 200 pc) previously studied warped disk models built to reproduce thecentral parallelogram-shaped structure. adopting the warped disk model we wouldconfirm a gap in emission between the radii r = 200 - 800 pc (12'' - 50''), ashas been suggested previously. although this model explains this prominentfeature, however, our 12co(2-1) observations show relevant deviations from thismodel. namely, the physical connection between the circumnuclear gas and thatat larger radii, brighter se and nw sides on the parallelogram-shaped feature,and an outer curvature of its long sides. overall it resembles more closely ans-shaped morphology, a trend that is also found in other molecular species.hence, we explore qualitatively the possible contribution of a weakbi-symmetric potential which would naturally explain these peculiarities.

0907.0004	spitzer observations of the n157b supernova remnant and its surroundings	(aims): we study the lmc interstellar medium in the field of the nebulan157b, which contains a supernova remnant, an ob association, ionized gas, andhigh-density dusty filaments in close proximity. we investigate the relativeimportance of shock excitation by the snr and photo-ionization by the ob stars,as well as possible interactions between the supernova remnant and itsenvironment. (methods): we apply multiwavelength mapping and photometry, alongwith spatially resolved infrared spectroscopy, to identifying the nature of theism using new infrared data from the spitzer space observatory and x-ray,optical, and radio data from the literature. (results): the n157b snr has noinfrared counterpart. infrared emission from the region is dominated by thecompact blister-type hii region associated with 2mass j05375027-6911071 andexcited by an o8-o9 star. this object is part of an extended infrared emissionregion that is associated with a molecular cloud. we find only weak emissionfrom the shock-indicator [feii], and both the excitation and the heating of theextended cloud are dominated by photo-ionization by the early o stars of lh99.(conclusions): any possible impact by the expanding snr does not now affect theextended cloud of molecules and dust, despite the apparent overlap of snr x-rayemission with infrared and ha emission from the cloud. this implies that thesupernova progenitor cannot have been more massive than about 25 solar masses.

0907.2240	the structure of a low-metallicity giant molecular cloud complex	to understand the impact of low metallicities on giant molecular cloud (gmc)structure, we compare far infrared dust emission, co emission, and dynamics inthe star-forming complex n83 in the wing of the small magellanic cloud. dustemission (measured by spitzer as part of the s3mc and sage-smc surveys) probesthe total gas column independent of molecular line emission and tracesshielding from photodissociating radiation. we calibrate a method to estimatethe dust column using only the high-resolution spitzer data and verify thatdust traces the ism in the hi-dominated region around n83. this allows us toresolve the relative structures of h2, dust, and co within a giant molecularcloud complex, one of the first times such a measurement has been made in alow-metallicity galaxy. our results support the hypothesis that co isphotodissociated while h2 self-shields in the outer parts of low-metallicitygmcs, so that dust/self shielding is the primary factor determining thedistribution of co emission. four pieces of evidence support this view. first,the co-to-h2 conversion factor averaged over the whole cloud is very high 4-11\times 10^21 cm^-2/(k km/s), or 20-55 times the galactic value. second, theco-to-h2 conversion factor varies across the complex, with its lowest (mostnearly galactic) values near the co peaks. third, bright co emission is largelyconfined to regions of relatively high line-of-sight extinction, a_v &gt;~ 2 mag,in agreement with pdr models and galactic observations. fourth, a simple modelin which co emerges from a smaller sphere nested inside a larger cloud canroughly relate the h2 masses measured from co kinematics and dust.

1001.5405	the molecular interstellar medium of the local group dwarf ngc6822	do molecular clouds collapse to form stars at the same rate in allenvironments? in large spiral galaxies, the rate of transformation of h2 intostars (hereafter sfe) varies little. however, the sfe in distant objects (z~1)is much higher than in the large spiral disks that dominate the local universe.some small local group galaxies share at least some of the characteristics ofintermediate-redshift objects, such as size or color. recent work has suggestedthat the star formation efficiency (sfe, defined as the sfrate per unit h2) inlocal dwarf galaxies may be as high as in the distant objects. a fundamentaldifficulty in these studies is the independent measure of the h2 mass inmetal-deficient environments. at 490 kpc, ngc6822 is an excellent choice forthis study; it has been mapped in the co(2-1) line using the multibeam receiverhera on the 30 meter iram telescope, yielding the largest sample of giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) in this galaxy. despite the much lower metallicity, wefind no clear difference in the properties of the gmcs in ngc 6822 and those inthe milky way except lower co luminosities for a given mass. severalindependent methods indicate that the total h2 mass in ngc 6822 is about 5 x10^6 msun in the area we mapped and less than 10^7 msun in the whole galaxy.this corresponds to a nh2/ico ~ 4 x 10^{21} cm^-2 /(kkm/s) over large scales,such as would be observed in distant objects, and half that in individual gmcs.no evidence was found for h2 without co emission. our simulations of theradiative transfer in clouds are entirely compatible with these nh2/ico values.the sfe implied is a factor 5 - 10 higher than what is observed in large localuniverse spirals.

1003.1751	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey ii: warm molecular gas and star  formation in three field spiral galaxies	we present the results of large-area co j=3-2 emission mapping of threenearby field galaxies, ngc 628, ngc 3521, and ngc 3627, completed at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope as part of the nearby galaxies legacy survey. thesegalaxies all have moderate to strong co j=3-2 detections over large areas ofthe fields observed by the survey, showing resolved structure and dynamics intheir warm/dense molecular gas disks. all three galaxies were part of thespitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey sample, and as such have excellentpublished multi-wavelength ancillary data. these data sets allow us to examinethe star formation properties, gas content, and dynamics of these galaxies onsub-kiloparsec scales. we find that the global gas depletion times fordense/warm molecular gas in these galaxies is consistent with other results fornearby spiral galaxies, indicating this may be independent of galaxy propertiessuch as structures, gas compositions, and environments. similar to the resultsfrom the things hi survey, we do not see a correlation of the star formationefficiency with the gas surface density consistent with the schmidt-kennicuttlaw. finally, we find that the star formation efficiency of the dense moleculargas traced by co j=3-2 is potentially flat or slightly declining as a functionof molecular gas density, the co j=3-2/j=1-0 ratio (in contrast to thecorrelation found in a previous study into the starburst galaxy m83), and thefraction of total gas in molecular form.

1005.1865	the herschel revolution: unveiling the morphology of the high mass star  formation sites n44 and n63 in the lmc	we study the structure of the medium surrounding sites of high-mass starformation to determine the interrelation between the hii regions and theenvironment from which they were formed. the density distribution of thesurroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed starsinteracts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a starformation tracer. we present new herschel/spire 250, 350 and 500 mum data oflha 120-n44 and lha 120-n63 in the lmc. we construct average spectral energydistributions (seds) for annuli centered on the ir bright part of the starformation sites. the annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. we use a phenomenological dustmodel to fit these seds to derive the dust column densities, characterise theincident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules. we see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density asa function of radial distance around n63. n44 does not show a systematic trend.we construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-d density profile ofthe surroundings of these two regions. herschel/spire data have proven veryefficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. we find that the radiationfield in the two sources behaves very differently. n63 is more or lessspherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. n44shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably dueto the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complexdistribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1007.1167	hifi spectroscopy of low-level water transitions in m82	we present observations of the rotational ortho-water ground transition, thetwo lowest para-water transitions, and the ground transition of ionisedortho-water in the archetypal starburst galaxy m82, performed with the hifiinstrument on the herschel space observatory. these observations are the firstdetections of the para-h2o(111-000) (1113\,ghz) and ortho-h2o+(111-000)(1115\,ghz) lines in an extragalactic source. all three water lines showdifferent spectral line profiles, underlining the need for high spectralresolution in interpreting line formation processes. using the line shape ofthe para-h2o(111-000) and ortho-h2o+(111-000) absorption profile in conjunctionwith high spatial resolution co observations, we show that the (ionised) waterabsorption arises from a ~2000 pc^2 region within the hifi beam located about~50 pc east of the dynamical centre of the galaxy. this region does notcoincide with any of the known line emission peaks that have been identified inother molecular tracers, with the exception of hco. our data suggest that waterand ionised water within this region have high (up to 75%) area-coveringfactors of the underlying continuum. this indicates that water is notassociated with small, dense cores within the ism of m82 but arises from a morewidespread diffuse gas component.

1008.4058	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey v: the co(j=3-2) distribution and  molecular outflow in ngc~4631	we have made the first map of co(j=3-2) emission covering the disk of theedge-on galaxy, ngc~4631, which is known for its spectacular gaseous halo. thestrongest emission, which we model with a gaussian ring,occurs within a radiusof 5 kpc. weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc, the mostextensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy. from comparisons withinfrared data, we find that co(j=3-2) emission more closely follows the hotdust component, rather than the cold dust,consistent with it being a goodtracer of star formation. the first maps of $r_{3-2/1-0}$, h$_2$ mass surfacedensity and sfe have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region. only 20\%of the sf occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxydisks, rather than of central starbursts. the sfe suggests long gas consumptiontimescales ($&gt;$ $10^9$ yr).  the velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in theregion of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk. avery steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus, providingthe first evidence for a central concentration of mass:m$_{dyn}\,=\,5\,\times\,10^7$ m$_\odot$ within a radius of 282 pc. the velocityfield shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows;one of them is associated with a previously observed co(j=1-0) expanding shell.consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ($z$ up to $1.4$ kpc)co(j=3-2) disk. we suggest that the interaction between ngc~4631 and itscompanion(s) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which waslikely higher in the past than it is now. these may be necessary conditions forseeing prominent halos.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

1201.3281	[feii] as a tracer supernova rate	supernovae play an integral role in the feedback of processed material intothe ismof galaxies and are responsible for most of the chemical enrichment ofthe universe. the rate of supernovae can also reveal the star formationhistories. supernova rate is usually measured through the non-thermal radiocontinuum luminosity, but in this paper we establish a quantitativerelationship between the [feii]1.26 luminosity and supernova rate in a sampleof 11 near-by starburst galaxies. sinfoni data cubes are used to perform apixel pixel analysis of this correlation. using br equivalent width andluminosity as the only observational inputs into starburst 99, the supernovarate is derived at each pixel and a map of supernova rate is created. this isthen compared morphologically and quantitatively to [feii]1.26 luminosity map.we find a strong linear and morphological correlation between supernova rateand [feii]1.26 on a pixel-pixel basis: log snrate yr-1 pc-2 = (1.01 \pm 0.2)\ast log[feii]1.26 ergs-1 pc-2 - 41.17 \pm 0.9 the starburst 99 derivedsupernova rates are also in good agreement with the radio derived supernovarates, which further demonstrates the strength of [feii] as a tracer ofsupernova rate. with the strong correlation found in this sample of galaxies,we now qualitatively use [feii]1.26 to derive supernova rate on either apixel-pixel or integrated galactic basis.

1207.3243	spectrally resolved cii emission in m~33 ({\tt herm33es}): physical  conditions and kinematics around bclmp 691	this work presents high spectral resolution observations of the \cii\ line at158 \micron, one of the major cooling lines of the interstellar medium, takenwith the hifi heterodyne spectrometer on the herschel satellite. in bclmp 691,an \hii\ region far north (3.3 kpc) in the disk of m 33, the \cii\ and co lineprofiles show similar velocities within $0.5 \kms$, while the \hi\ linevelocities are systematically shifted towards lower rotation velocities by$\sim 5\kms$. observed at the same $12"$ angular resolution, the \cii\ linesare broader than those of co by about 50% but narrower than the \hi\ lines. the\cii\ line to far-infrared continuum ratio suggests a photoelectric heatingefficiency of 1.1%. the data, together with published models indicate a uvfield $g_0 \sim 100$ in units of the solar neighborhood value, a gas density$n_h \sim 1000 \cc$, and a gas temperature $t\sim 200$ k. adopting thesevalues, we estimate the c$^+$ column density to be $n_{c^+} \approx 1.3 \times10^{17} \cmt$. the \cii\ emission comes predominantly from the warm neutralregion between the \hii\ region and the cool molecular cloud behind it. frompublished abundances, the inferred c$^+$ column corresponds to a hydrogencolumn density of $n_h \sim 2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$. the co observations suggestthat $n_h = 2 n_{h_2} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ and 21cm measurements, alsoat $12"$ resolution, yield $n_\hi \approx 1.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ within the\cii\ velocity range. thus, some h$_2$ not detected in co must be present, inagreement with earlier findings based on the spire 250 -- 500 $\mu$m emission.

1210.3263	dense gas in m33 (herm33es)	we aim to better understand the emission of molecular tracers of the diffuseand dense gas in giant molecular clouds and the influence that metallicity,optical extinction, density, far-uv field, and star formation rate have onthese tracers. using the iram 30m telescope, we detected hcn, hco+, 12co, and13co in six gmcs along the major axis of m33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and outto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter datafrom herschel and other observatories complement these observations. tointerpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of modelsof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for m33-type subsolarmetallicity. the observed hco+/hcn line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.similarly high ratios have been observed in the large magellanic cloud. thehcn/co ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of m33. the 12co/13coline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffusegas and the centers of gmcs of the milky way. stacking of all spectra allowedhnc and c2h to be detected. the resulting hco+/hnc and hcn/hnc ratios of ~ 8and 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. hcn abundances are lower in the subsolarmetallicity pdr models, while hco+ abundances are enhanced. for hcn this effectis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. the observed hco+/hcn and hcn/coline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar pdr models of low opticalextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -3x10^4 cm^-3, while the fuv field strength only has a small effect on themodeled line ratios. the line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by thesolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play aminor role in influencing these line ratios.

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1212.1567	the excitation of near-infrared h2 emission in ngc 253	because of its large angular size and proximity to the milky way, ngc 253, anarchetypal starburst galaxy, provides an excellent laboratory to study theintricacies of this intense episode of star formation. we aim to characterizethe excitation mechanisms driving the emission in ngc 253. specifically we aimto distinguish between shock excitation and uv excitation as the dominantdriving mechanism, using br\gamma, h_2 and [feii] as diagnostic emission linetracers. using sinfoni observations, we create linemaps of br\gamma,[feii]_{1.64}, and all detected h_2 transitions. by using symmetry arguments ofthe gas and stellar gas velocity field, we find a kinematic center in agreementwith previous determinations. the ratio of the 2-1 s(1) to 1-0 s(1) h_2transitions can be used as a diagnostic to discriminate between shock andfluorescent excitation. using the 1-0 s(1)/2-1 s(1) line ratio as well asseveral other h_2 line ratios and the morphological comparison between h_2 andbr\gamma and [feii], we find that excitation from uv photons is the dominantexcitation mechanisms throughout ngc 253. we employ a diagnostic energy leveldiagram to quantitatively differentiate between mechanisms. we compare theobserved energy level diagrams to pdr and shock models and find that in mostregions and over the galaxy as a whole, fluorescent excitation is the dominantmechanism exciting the h_2 gas. we also place an upper limit of the percentageof shock excited h_2 at 29%. we find that uv radiation is the dominantexcitation mechanism for the h_2 emission. the h_2 emission does not correlatewell with br\gamma but closely traces the pah emission, showing that not onlyis h_2 fluorescently excited, but it is predominately excited by slightly lowermass stars than o stars which excite br\gamma, such as b stars.

(2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

1401.4924	radiative and mechanical feedback into the molecular gas of ngc 253	starburst galaxies are undergoing intense periods of star formation.understanding the heating and cooling mechanisms in these galaxies can give usinsight to the driving mechanisms that fuel the starburst. molecular emissionlines play a crucial role in the cooling of the excited gas. with spire on theherschel space observatory we have observed the rich molecular spectrum towardsthe central region of ngc 253. co transitions from j=4-3 to 13-12 are observedand together with low-j line fluxes from ground based observations, these linestrace the excitation of co. by studying the co excitation ladder and comparingthe intensities to models, we investigate whether the gas is excited by uvradiation, x-rays, cosmic rays, or turbulent heating. comparing the $^{12}$coand $^{13}$co observations to large velocity gradient models and pdr models wefind three main ism phases. we estimate the density, temperature,and masses ofthese ism phases. by adding $^{13}$co, hcn, and hnc line intensities, we areable to constrain these degeneracies and determine the heating sources. thefirst ism phase responsible for the low-j co lines is excited by pdrs, but thesecond and third phases, responsible for the mid to high-j co transitions,require an additional heating source. we find three possible combinations ofmodels that can reproduce our observed molecular emission. although we cannotdetermine which of these are preferable, we can conclude that mechanicalheating is necessary to reproduce the observed molecular emission and cosmicray heating is a negligible heating source. we then estimate the mass of eachism phase; $6\times 10^7$ m$_\odot$ for phase 1 (low-j co lines), $3\times10^7$ m$_\odot$ for phase 2 (mid-j co lines), and $9\times 10^6$ m$_\odot$ forphase 3 (high-j co lines) for a total system mass of $1\times10^{8}$ m$_\odot$.

1407.2055	molecular gas heating in arp 299	understanding the heating and cooling mechanisms in nearby (ultra) luminousinfrared galaxies can give us insight into the driving mechanisms in their moredistant counterparts. molecular emission lines play a crucial role in coolingexcited gas, and recently, with herschel space observatory we have been able toobserve the rich molecular spectrum. co is the most abundant and one of thebrightest molecules in the herschel wavelength range. co transitions areobserved with herschel, and together, these lines trace the excitation of co.we study arp 299, a colliding galaxy group, with one component harboring an agnand two more undergoing intense star formation. for arp 299 a, we present pacsspectrometer observations of high-j co lines up to j=20-19 and jcmtobservations of $^{13}$co and hcn to discern between uv heating and alternativeheating mechanisms. there is an immediately noticeable difference in thespectra of arp 299 a and arp 299 b+c, with source a having brighter high-j cotransitions. this is reflected in their respective spectral energy linedistributions. we find that photon-dominated regions (pdrs) are unlikely toheat all the gas since a very extreme pdr is necessary to fit the high-j colines. in addition, this extreme pdr does not fit the hcn observations, and thedust spectral energy distribution shows that there is not enough hot dust tomatch the amount expected from such an extreme pdr. therefore, we determinethat the high-j co and hcn transitions are heated by an additional mechanism,namely cosmic ray heating, mechanical heating, or x-ray heating. we find thatmechanical heating, in combination with uv heating, is the only mechanism thatfits all molecular transitions. we also constrain the molecular gas mass of arp299 a to 3e9 msun and find that we need 4% of the total heating to bemechanical heating, with the rest uv heating.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

astro-ph;0104196	ci and co in the spiral galaxies ngc 6946 and m 83	multitransition 12co, 13co and 492 ghz [ci] measurements of the late-typespiral galaxies ngc 6946 and m 83 (ngc 5236) show pronounced molecular gasconcentrations in rapid solid-body rotation within a few hundred parsec fromboth nuclei. their 12co, 13co and [ci] relative intensities are nearlyidentical. however, the very different [cii] intensities imply that thephysical conditions are not. the slow decrease of 12co intensities withincreasing rotational level marks the presence of significant amounts of warmand dense molecular gas in both galaxy centers. detailed modelling indicatesthat both galaxiy centers contain at least two distinct molecular components: awarm and dense component with t(kin) = 30-60 k, n(h2) = 3000-10 000 cc, and amore tenuous hotter component with t(kin) = 100-150 k, n(h2) &lt; 1000 cc). atomiccarbon column densities exceed co column densities by a factor of about 1.5 inngc 6946 and about 4 in m 83. unlike ngc 6946, m 83 contains a significantamount of molecular hydrogen associated with ionized carbon rather than co. thecenters of ngc 6946 and m 83 contain nearly identical total (atomic andmolecular) gas masses of about 3 x 10**7 m(sun). despite their prominence, thecentral gas concentrations in these galaxies represent only a few per cent ofthe stellar mass in the same volume. the peak face-on gas mass density is muchhigher in m 83 (120 m(sun)/pc**2) than in ngc 6946 (45 m(sun)/pc**2). the moreintense starburst in m 83 is associated with a more compact and somewhat hotterpdr zone than the milder starburst in ngc 6946.

astro-ph;0112187	neutral atomic carbon in centers of galaxies	we present measurements of the emission from the centers of fifteen spiralgalaxies in the 3p1-3p0 [ci] fine-structure transition at 492 ghz. observedgalaxy centers range from quiescent to starburst to active. the intensities ofneutral carbon, the j=2-1 transition of 13co and the j=4-3 transition of 12coare compared in matched beams. most galaxy centers emit more strongly in [ci]than in 13co, completely unlike the situation pertaining to galactic molecularcloud regions. [ci] intensities are lower than, but nevertheless comparable toj=4-3 12co intensities, again rather different from galactic sources. the ratioof [ci] to 13co increases with the central [ci] luminosity of a galaxy; it islowest for quiescent and mild starburst centers, and highest for strongstarburst centers and active nuclei. comparison with radiative transfer modelcalculations shows that most observed galaxy centers have neutral carbonabundances close to, or exceeding, carbon monoxide abundances, ratherindependent from the assumed model gas parameters. the same models suggest thatthe emission from neutral carbon and carbon monoxide, if assumed to originatein the same volumes, arises from a warm and dense gas rather than a hot andtenuous, or a cold and very dense gas. the observed [ci] intensities togetherwith literature [cii] line and far-infrared continuum data likewise suggestthat a significant fraction of the emission originates in medium-density gas (n= 10**3 - 10**4 cm**-3, subjected to radiation fields of various strengths.

astro-ph;0209444	hi distribution and kinematics of ngc 1569	we present wsrt observations of high sensitivity and resolution of theneutral hydrogen in the starburst dwarf galaxy ngc 1569. assuming a distance of2.2 mpc, we find a total hi mass of 1.3 * 10^8 m_sun to be distributed in theform of a dense, clumpy ridge surrounded by more extended diffuse hi containinga few additional discrete features, such as a western hi arm and an hi bridgereaching out to a small counterrotating companion cloud. about 10% by mass ofall hi in ngc 1569 is at unusually high velocities. some of this hi may beassociated with the mass outflow evident from h-alpha measurements, but somemay also be associated with ngc 1569's hi companion and intervening hi bridge,in which case, infall rather than outflow might be the cause of the discrepantvelocities. no indication of a large bubble structure was found inposition-velocity maps of the high-velocity hi. the galaxy as a whole is inmodest overall rotation, but the hi gas lacks any sign of rotation within 60''(0.6 kpc) from the center, i.e. over most of the optical galaxy. here,turbulent motions resulting from the starburst appear to dominate overrotation. in the outer disk, the rotational velocities reach a maximum of 35\pm 6 km/s, but turbulent motion remains significant. thus, starburst effectsare still noticeable in the outer hi disk, although they are no longer dominantbeyond 0.6 kpc. even excluding the most extreme high-velocity hi clouds, ngc1569 still has an unusually high mean hi velocity dispersion of sigma_v=21.3km/s, more than double that of other dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0504569	molecular gas in compact galaxies	new observations of 11 compact galaxies in the 12co j=2-1 and j=3-2transitions and literature data have been used to construct accurate lineratios in matched beams allowing lvg modelling of physical parameters. fittinga single gas component to observed line ratios tends to produce physicallyunrealistic results, and is often not possible at all. much better results areobtained by modelling two distinct gas components. the molecular gas is usuallywarm (t(kin)=50-150 k) and at least partially dense (n(h2)&gt;3000 cm3). most ofthe gas-phase carbon in these galaxies is in atomic form; only a small fraction(5%) is in carbon monoxide. beam-averaged co column densities are low,typically 10(16) cm2 but molecular hydrogen column densities are high, of theorder of 10(22) cm2 and confirm large co-to-h2 conversion factors, typically x= 10(21)-10(22) cm2(k kms-1) found in low-metallicity environments by othermethods. from co spectroscopy, three different types of molecular environmentare distinguished in compact galaxies. type i (high rotational and isotopicratios) corresponds to hot and dense molecular clouds dominated by star-formingregions. type ii has lower ratios, similar to the mean found forinfrared-luminous galaxies in general, and corresponds to environments engagedin, but not dominated by, star-forming activity. type iii, characterized by low12co (2--1)/(1--0) ratios, corresponds to mostly inactive environments ofrelatively low density.

astro-ph;0505627	photon dominated regions in the spiral arms of m83 and m51	we present ci 3p1-3p0 spectra at four spiral arm positions and the nuclei ofthe nearby galaxies m83 and m51 obtained at the jcmt. this data is complementedwith maps of co 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2, and iso/lws far-infrared data of cii (158micron), oi (63 micron), and nii (122 micron) allowing for the investigation ofa complete set of all major gas cooling lines. from the intensity of the niiline, we estimate that between 15% and 30% of the observed cii emissionoriginate from the dense ionized phase of the ism. the analysis indicates thatemission from the diffuse ionized medium is negligible. in combination with thefir dust continuum, we find gas heating efficiencies below ~0.21% in thenuclei, and between 0.25 and 0.36% at the outer positions. comparison withmodels of photon-dominated regions (pdrs) of kaufman et al. (1999) with thestandard ratios oi(63)/cii_pdr and (oi(63)+cii_pdr) vs. tir, the total infraredintensity, yields two solutions. the physically most plausible solutionexhibits slightly lower densities and higher fuv fields than found when using afull set of line ratios, cii_pdr/ci(1-0), ci(1-0)/co(3-2), co(3-2)/co(1-0),cii/co(3-2), and, oi(63)/cii_pdr. the best fits to the latter ratios yielddensities of 10^4 cm^-3 and fuv fields of ~g_0=20-30 times the averageinterstellar field without much variation. at the outer positions, the observedtotal infrared intensities are in perfect agreement with the derived bestfitting fuv intensities. the ratio of the two intensities lies at 4-5 at thenuclei, indicating the presence of other mechanisms heating the dust.

astro-ph;0609184	irradiated ism: discriminating between cosmic rays and x-rays	the ism of active galaxy centers is exposed to a combination of cosmic ray,fuv and x-ray radiation. we apply pdr models to this ism with both `normal' andhighly elevated (5\times 10^{-15}s^-1) cosmic-ray rates and compare the resultsto those obtained for xdrs. our existing pdr-xdr code is used to constructmodels over a 10^3-10^5 cm^-3 density range and for 0.16-160 erg s^-1 cm^-2impingent fluxes. we obtain larger high j (j&gt;10) co ratios in pdrs when we usethe highly elevated cosmic ray rate, but these are always exceeded by thecorresponding xdr ratios. the [ci] 609 mum/13co(2-1) line ratio is boosted by afactor of a few in pdrs with n~10^3 cm^-3 exposed to a high cosmic ray rate. athigher densities ratios become identical irrespective of cosmic ray flux, whilexdrs always show elevated [ci] emission per co column. the hcn/co and hcn/hco+line ratios, combined with high j co emission lines, are good diagnostics todistinguish between pdrs under either low or high cosmic ray irradiationconditions, and xdrs. hence, the hifi instrument on herschel, which can detectthese co lines, will be crucial in the study of active galaxies.

astro-ph;0610360	diagnostics of irradiated dense gas in galaxy nuclei. ii. a grid of xdr  and pdr models	\abridged the nuclei of active galaxies harbor massive young stars, anaccreting central black hole, or both. in order to determine the physicalconditions that pertain to molecular gas close to the sources of radiation,numerical models are constructed. these models determine the thermal andchemical balance of molecular gas that is exposed to x-rays and far-ultravioletradiation, as a function of depth. we present a grid of xdr and pdr models thatspan ranges in density, irradiation and column density. we find that thefine-structure line ratios of e.g. [siii] 35mum/[cii] 158 mum are larger inxdrs than in pdrs, for a given density, column and irradiation strength. wefind that the line ratios hcn/hco+ and hnc/hcn, as well as the column densityratio cn/hcn, discriminate between pdrs and xdrs. the hcn/hco+ 1-0 ratio is &lt;1(&gt;1) for xdrs (pdrs) if the density exceeds 10^5 cm^-3 and if the columndensity is &gt;10^23 cm^-2. for columns &lt;10^ 22.5 cm^-2 the xdr hcn/hco+ 1-0 ratiobecomes larger than one, although the individual hcn 1-0 and hco+ 1-0 lineintensities are weaker. for modest densities, n=10^4-10^5 cm^-3, and strongradiation fields (&gt;100 erg s^-1 cm^-2), hcn/hco+ ratios can become larger inxdrs than pdrs as well. the hcn/co 1-0 ratio is typically smaller in xdrs, andthe hcn emission in xdrs is boosted with respect to co only for columns&gt;10^{23} cm^{-2} and densities &lt;10^4 cm^-3. co is typically warmer in xdrs thanin pdrs, for the same total energy input. this leads to higher co j=n+1-n/co1-0, n&gt;=1, line ratios in xdrs. lines with n&gt;=10, like co(16-15) and co(10-9)observable with hifi/herschel, discriminate very well between xdrs and pdrs.column density ratios indicate that ch, ch+, no, hoc+ and hco are good pdr/xdrdiscriminators.

astro-ph;9810151	the faint end of the tully-fisher relation	we have studied the relation between hi linewidth and optical luminosity intwo samples of dwarf galaxies, with special attention to the accuracy of theinclination correction. the first sample consists of rotationally supportedgalaxies, and has ddo 154 as a prototype. they have hi linewidths significantlylarger than predicted by an extrapolation of the tully-fisher relation. thedeviation from the extrapolated tully-fisher relation correlates with thedistance-independent mass-to-luminosity ratio m_hi/l_b. the baryonic correctionfor these gas rich galaxies is too small to explain the deviation from thetully-fisher relation, unless a small mass-to-light ratio (m/l_b)_* &lt;= 0.25 forthe stellar population is assumed. the second sample contains dwarf galaxieswith comparable rotational and random velocities. this sample, having leo a asa prototype, is consistent with an extrapolation of the classical tully-fisherrelation to lower luminosities. these dwarf galaxies are not particularly richin gas, but their mass is dominated by baryonic matter within their hi radius.we suggest that any evolution of the deviating galaxies towards thetully-fisher relation will combine a decrease in linewidth by radial transportof hi with an increase in luminosity due to a larger accumulated stellar mass.
