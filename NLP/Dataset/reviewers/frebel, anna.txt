0902.2395	high-resolution spectroscopy of extremely metal-poor stars in the least  evolved galaxies: ursa major ii and coma berenices	we present keck/hires observations of six metal-poor stars in two of theultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way, ursa major ii and comaberenices. these observations include the first high-resolution spectroscopicobservations of extremely metal-poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-3.0) stars not belonging tothe milky way (mw) halo field star population. we obtain abundance measurementsand upper limits for 26 elements between carbon and europium. the entire sampleof stars spans a range of -3.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-2.3, and we confirm that each galaxycontains a large intrinsic spread of fe abundances. a comparison with mw halostars of similar metallicities reveals substantial agreement between theabundance patterns of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and the mw halo for thelight, alpha and iron-peak elements (c to zn). this agreement contrasts withthe results of earlier studies of more metal-rich stars (-2.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.0) inmore luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs), which found significantabundance discrepancies with respect to the mw halo data. the abundances ofneutron-capture elements (sr to eu) in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies areextremely low, consistent with the most metal-poor halo stars, but not with thetypical halo abundance pattern at [fe/h]&gt;-3.0. our results are broadlyconsistent with a galaxy formation model that predicts that massive dwarfgalaxies are the source of the metal-rich component ([fe/h]&gt;-2.5) of the mwhalo, but we also suggest that the faintest known dwarfs may be the primarycontributors to the metal-poor end of the mw halo metallicity distribution.

0902.2591	the role of dwarf galaxies in building large stellar halos	the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smallergalactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. the pastdecade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, drivenin part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. multi-object spectroscopyenabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the milky wayand m31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. improvements inhigh-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundancepatterns of the milky way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained bygalactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.  these breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearbystars in the milky way and luminous red giant stars in m31 and local groupdwarf satellites. in the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allowobservations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, andthey will enable observations of individual stars far out in the galactic halo.the chemical abundance census now available for the milky way will becomepossible for our nearest neighbor, m31. velocity dispersion measurements nowavailable in m31 will become possible for systems beyond the local group suchas sculptor and m81 group galaxies. detailed studies of a greater number ofindividual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satelliteswill test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemicalevolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses indifferent environments.

0904.3105	the end of nucleosynthesis: production of lead and thorium in the early  galaxy	we examine the pb and th abundances in 27 metal-poor stars (-3.1 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-1.4) whose very heavy metal (z &gt; 56) enrichment was produced only by the rapid(r-) nucleosynthesis process. new abundances are derived from hst/stis,keck/hires, and vlt/uves spectra and combined with other measurements from theliterature to form a more complete picture of nucleosynthesis of the heaviestelements produced in the r-process. in all cases, the abundance ratios amongthe rare earth elements and the 3rd r-process peak elements considered (la, eu,er, hf, and ir) are constant and equivalent to the scaled solar systemr-process abundance distribution. we compare the stellar observations withr-process calculations within the classical "waiting-point" approximation. inthese computations a superposition of 15 weighted neutron-density components inthe range 23 &lt; log(n_n) &lt; 30 is fit to the r-process abundance peaks tosuccessfully reproduce both the stable solar system isotopic distribution andthe stable heavy element abundance pattern between ba and u in low-metallicitystars. under these astrophysical conditions, which are typical of the "main"r-process, we find very good agreement between the stellar pb r-processabundances and those predicted by our model. for stars with anomalously highth/eu ratios (the so-called actinide boost), our observations demonstrate thatany nucleosynthetic deviations from the main r-process affect--at most--onlythe elements beyond the 3rd r-process peak, namely pb, th, and u. ourtheoretical calculations also indicate that possible r-process abundance"losses" by nuclear fission are negligible for isotopes along the r-processpath between pb and the long-lived radioactive isotopes of th and u.

0912.4734	linking dwarf galaxies to halo building blocks with the most metal-poor  star in sculptor	current cosmological models indicate that the milky way's stellar halo wasassembled from many smaller systems. based on the apparent absence of the mostmetal-poor stars in present-day dwarf galaxies, recent studies claimed that thetrue galactic building blocks must have been vastly different from thesurviving dwarfs. the discovery of an extremely iron-poor star (s1020549) inthe sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum cast some doubton this conclusion. however, verification of the iron-deficiency andmeasurements of additional elements, such as the alpha-element mg, aremandatory for demonstrating that the same type of stars produced the metalsfound in dwarf galaxies and the galactic halo. only then can dwarf galaxy starsbe conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. here we reporthigh-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in s1020549,confirming the iron abundance of less than 1/4000th that of the sun, andshowing that the overall abundance pattern mirrors that seen in low-metallicityhalo stars, including the alpha-elements. such chemical similarity indicatesthat the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were notfundamentally different from the progenitors of present-day dwarfs, andsuggests that the early chemical enrichment of all galaxies may be nearlyidentical.

1006.2419	stellar archaeology -- exploring the universe with metal-poor stars	the abundance patterns of the most metal-poor stars in the galactic halo andsmall dwarf galaxies provide us with a wealth of information about the earlyuniverse. in particular, these old survivors allow us to study the nature ofthe first stars and supernovae, the relevant nucleosynthesis processesresponsible for the formation and evolution of the elements, early star- andgalaxy formation processes, as well as the assembly process of the stellar halofrom dwarf galaxies a long time ago. this review presents the current state ofthe field of "stellar archaeology" -- the diverse use of metal-poor stars toexplore the high-redshift universe and its constituents. in particular, theconditions for early star formation are discussed, how these ultimately led toa chemical evolution, and what the role of the most iron-poor stars is forlearning about population iii supernovae yields. rapid neutron-capturesignatures found in metal-poor stars can be used to obtain stellar ages, butalso to constrain this complex nucleosynthesis process with observationalmeasurements. moreover, chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor stars indifferent types of dwarf galaxies can be used to infer details on the formationscenario of the halo. and the role of dwarf galaxies as galactic buildingblocks. i conclude with an outlook as to where this field may be heading withinthe next decade. a table of ~1000 metal-poor stars and their abundances ascollected from the literature is provided in electronic format.

1008.0450	an extremely carbon-rich, extremely metal-poor star in the segue 1  system	we report the analysis of high-resolution, high-s/n spectra of an extremelymetal-poor, extremely c-rich red giant, seg 1-7, in the segue 1 system -described in the literature alternatively as an unusually extended globularcluster or an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. the radial velocity of seg 1-7coincides precisely with the systemic velocity of segue 1, and its chemicalabundance signature of [fe/h] = -3.52, [c/fe] = +2.3, [n/fe] = +0.8, [na/fe] =+0.53, [mg/fe] = +0.94, [al/fe] = +0.23 and [ba/fe] &lt; -1.0 is similar to thatof the rare and enigmatic class of galactic halo objects designated cemp-no(carbon-rich, extremely metal-poor and with no enhancement (over solar ratios)of heavy neutron-capture elements). this is the first star in a milky way``satellite'' that unambiguously lies on the metal-poor, c-rich branch of theaoki et al. (2007) bimodal distribution defined by field halo stars in the([c/fe], [fe/h])-plane. available data permit us only to identify seg 1-7 as amember of an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy or as debris from the sgr dwarfspheroidal galaxy. in either case, this demonstrates that at extremely lowabundance, [fe/h ] &lt; -3.0, star formation and associated chemical evolutionproceeded similarly in the progenitors of both the field halo and satellitesystems. by extension, this is consistent with other recent suggestions themost metal-poor dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf satellites were thebuilding blocks of the milky way's outer halo.

1010.1261	chemical signatures of the first galaxies: criteria for one-shot  enrichment	we utilize metal-poor stars in the local, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (ufds;l_tot &lt; 10^5 l_sun) to empirically constrain the formation process of the firstgalaxies. since ufds have much simpler star formation histories than the haloof the milky way, their stellar populations should preserve the fossil recordof the first supernova (sn) explosions in their long-lived, low-mass stars.guided by recent hydrodynamical simulations of first galaxy formation, wedevelop a set of stellar abundance signatures that characterize thenucleosynthetic history of such an early system if it was observed in thepresent-day universe. specifically, we argue that the first galaxies are theproduct of chemical "one-shot" events, where only one (long-lived) stellargeneration forms after the first, population iii, sn explosions. our abundancecriteria thus constrain the strength of negative feedback effects inside thefirst galaxies. we compare the stellar content of ufds with these one-shotcriteria. several systems (ursa major ii, and also coma berenices, bootes i,leo iv, segue 1) largely fulfill the requirements, indicating that theirhigh-redshift predecessors did experience strong feedback effects that shut offstar formation. we term the study of the entire stellar population of a dwarfgalaxy for the purpose of inferring details about the nature and origin of thefirst galaxies "dwarf galaxy archaeology". this will provide clues to theconnection of the first galaxies, the surviving, metal-poor dwarf galaxies, andthe building blocks of the milky way.

1102.1748	metal-poor stars and the chemical enrichment of the universe	metal-poor stars hold the key to our understanding of the origin of theelements and the chemical evolution of the universe. this chapter describes theprocess of discovery of these rare stars, the manner in which their surfaceabundances (produced in supernovae and other evolved stars) are determined fromthe analysis of their spectra, and the interpretation of their abundancepatterns to elucidate questions of origin and evolution. more generally,studies of these stars contribute to other fundamental areas that includenuclear astrophysics, conditions at the earliest times, the nature of the firststars, and the formation and evolution of galaxies -- including our own milkyway. we illustrate this with results from studies of lithium formed during thebig bang; of stars dated to within ~1 gyr of that event; of the most metal-poorstars, with abundance signatures very different from all other stars; and ofthe build-up of the elements over the first several gyr. the combination ofabundance and kinematic signatures constrains how the milky way formed, whilerecent discoveries of extremely metal-poor stars in the milky way's dwarfgalaxy satellites constrain the hierarchical build-up of its stellar halo fromsmall dark-matter dominated systems.

1105.2293	the effects of patchy reionization on satellite galaxies of the milky  way	we combine the high-resolution aquarius simulations with three-dimensionalmodels of reionization based on the initial density field of the aquariusparent simulation, millennium-ii, to study the impact of patchy reionization onthe faint satellite population of milky way halos. because the aquarius suiteconsists of zoom-in simulations of halos in the millennium-ii volume, we followthe formation of substructure and the growth of reionization bubbles due to thelarger environment simultaneously, and thereby determine the reionizationredshifts of satellite candidates. we do this for four different reionizationmodels, and also compare results to instantaneous reionization. using a simpleprocedure for selecting satellites and assigning luminosities in thesimulations, we compare the resulting satellite populations. we find that theoverall number of satellites depends sensitively on the reionization model,with a factor of 3-4 variation between the four models for a given host halo,although the difference is entirely in the population of faint satellites (m_v&gt; -10). in addition, we find that for a given reionization model the totalnumber of satellites differs by 10%-20% between the patchy and homogeneousscenarios, provided that the redshift is chosen appropriately for theinstantaneous case. however, the halo-halo scatter from the six aquarius halosis large, up to a factor of 2-3, and so is comparable to the difference betweenreionization scenarios. in order to use the population of faint dwarf galaxiesaround the milky way as a probe of the local reionization history, then, it isnecessary to first better understand the general distribution of substructurearound milky way-mass halos.

1108.4692	exploring the universe with metal-poor stars	the early chemical evolution of the galaxy and the universe is vital to ourunderstanding of a host of astrophysical phenomena. since the most metal-poorgalactic stars (with metallicities down to [fe/h]\sim-5.5) are relics from thehigh-redshift universe, they probe the chemical and dynamical conditions of themilky way and the origin and evolution of the elements through nucleosynthesis.they also provide constraints on the nature of the first stars, theirassociated supernovae and initial mass function, and early star and galaxyformation. the milky way's dwarf satellites contain a large fraction (~30%) ofthe known most metal-poor stars that have chemical abundances that closelyresemble those of equivalent halo stars. this suggests that chemical evolutionmay be universal, at least at early times, and that it is driven by massive,energetic sne. some of these surviving, ultra-faint systems may show thesignature of just one such popiii star; they may even be surviving firstgalaxies. early analogs of the surviving dwarfs may thus have played animportant role in the assembly of the old galactic halo whose formation can nowbe studied with stellar chemistry. following the cosmic evolution of smallhalos in simulations of structure formation enables tracing the cosmologicalorigin of the most metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies. togetherwith future observations and additional modeling, many of these issues,including the reionization history of the milky way, may be constrained thisway. the chapter concludes with an outlook about upcoming observationalchallenges and ways forward is to use metal-poor stars to constrain theoreticalstudies.

1202.2630	non-lte effects on the lead and thorium abundance determinations for  cool stars	knowing accurate pb abundances of metal-poor stars provides constraints onthe pb production mechanisms in the early galaxy. accurately deriving thabundances permits a nucleo-chronometric age determination of the star. weimprove the calculation of the pb i and th ii lines in stellar atmospheresbased on non-lte line formation and evaluate the influence of departures fromlte on pb and th abundance determinations through a range of stellarparameters. comprehensive model atoms for pb i and th ii are presented. thedepartures from lte lead to systematically depleted total absorption in the pbi lines and positive abundance corrections. non-lte removes the discrepancybetween the solar and the meteoritic pb abundance. with the holweger &amp; mueller(1974) solar model atmosphere, log eps(pb, non-lte) = 2.09. we revise the pband eu abundances of the strongly r-process enhanced (r-ii) stars cs 31082-001and he 1523-0901 and the roederer et al. (2010) stellar sample. our resultsprovide strong evidence for universal pb/eu relative r-process yields duringcourse of the galaxy evolution. the stars with -2.3&lt;[fe/h]&lt; -1.4 have, onaverage, 0.51 dex higher pb/eu ratios compared with that of the r-ii starssuggesting that the s-process synthesis of pb started as early as the time whengalactic metallicity had grown to [fe/h] = -2.3. the average pb/eu ratio of the-1.4&lt;[fe/h]&lt; -0.59 stars is close to the solar value, in line with thepredictions of travaglio et al. (2001) that agb stars with [fe/h] ~ -1 providedthe largest contribution to the solar s-nuclei of pb. non-lte leads to weakenedth ii lines. overall, the abundance correction does not exceed +0.2 dex whencollisions with h i atoms are taken into account in non-lte calculations.

1205.0807	the metallicity of the monoceros stream	we present low-resolution mmt hectospec spectroscopy of 594 candidatemonoceros stream member stars. based on strong color-magnitude diagramoverdensities, we targeted three fields within the stream's footprint, with 178deg &lt; l &lt; 203 deg and -25 deg &lt; b &lt; 25 deg. by comparing the measured ironabundances with those expected from smooth galactic components alone, wemeasure, for the first time, the spectroscopic metallicity distributionfunction for monoceros. we find the stream to be chemically distinct from boththe thick disk and halo, with [fe/h] = -1, and do not detect a trend in thestream's metallicity with galactic longitude. passing from b = +25 deg to b =-25 deg the median monoceros metallicity trends upward by 0.1 dex, thoughuncertainties in modeling sample contamination by the disk and halo make this amarginal detection. in each field, we find monoceros to have an intrinsic[fe/h] dispersion of 0.10-0.22 dex. from the caii k line, we measure [ca/fe]for a subsample of metal poor program stars with -1.1 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.5. in twoof three fields, we find calcium deficiencies qualitatively similar topreviously reported [ti/fe] underabundances in monoceros and the sagittariustidal stream. further, using 90 spectra of thick disk stars in the monocerospointings with b ~ +/-25 deg, we detect a 0.22 dex north/south metallicityasymmetry coincident with known stellar density asymmetry at r_gc ~ 12 kpc and|z| ~ 1.7 kpc. our median monoceros [fe/h] = -1.0 and its relatively lowdispersion naturally fit the expectation for an appropriately luminous m_v ~-13 dwarf galaxy progenitor.

1304.2396	deriving stellar effective temperatures of metal-poor stars with the  excitation potential method	it is well established that stellar effective temperatures determined fromphotometry and spectroscopy yield systematically different results. we describea new, simple method to correct spectroscopically derived temperatures("excitation temperatures") of metal-poor stars based on a literature samplewith -3.3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-2.5. excitation temperatures were determined from fei lineabundances in high-resolution optical spectra in the wavelength range of ~3700to ~7000a, although shorter wavelength ranges, up to 4750 to 6800a, can also beemployed, and compared with photometric literature temperatures. our adjustmentscheme increases the temperatures up to several hundred degrees for cool redgiants, while leaving the near-main-sequence stars mostly unchanged. hence, itbrings the excitation temperatures in good agreement with photometricallyderived values. the modified temperature also influences other stellarparameters, as the fei-feii ionization balance is simultaneously used todetermine the surface gravity, while also forcing no abundance trend on theabsorption line strengths to obtain the microturbulent velocity. as a result ofincreasing the temperature, the often too low gravities and too highmicroturbulent velocities in red giants become higher and lower, respectively.our adjustment scheme thus continues to build on the advantage of derivingtemperatures from spectroscopy alone, independent of reddening, while at thesame time producing stellar chemical abundances that are more straightforwardlycomparable to studies based on photometrically derived temperatures. hence, ourmethod may prove beneficial for comparing different studies in the literatureas well as the many high-resolution stellar spectroscopic surveys that are orwill be carried out in the next few years.

1304.7869	metal-poor stars observed with the magellan telescope i. constraints on  progenitor mass and metallicity of agb stars undergoing s-process  nucleosynthesis	we present a comprehensive abundance analysis of two newly-discoveredcarbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars. he2138-3336 is a s-process-rich starwith [fe/h] = -2.79, and has the highest [pb/fe] abundance ratio measured thusfar, if nlte corrections are included ([pb/fe] = +3.84). he2258-6358, with[fe/h] = -2.67, exhibits enrichments in both s- and r-process elements. thesestars were selected from a sample of candidate metal-poor stars from thehamburg/eso objective-prism survey, and followed up with medium-resolution (r ~2,000) spectroscopy with gemini/gmos. we report here on derived abundances (orlimits) for a total of 34 elements in each star, based on high-resolution (r ~30,000) spectroscopy obtained with magellan-clay/mike. our results are comparedto predictions from new theoretical agb nucleosynthesis models of 1.3 mo with[fe/h] = -2.5 and -2.8, as well as to a set of agb models of 1.0 to 6.0 mo at[fe/h] = -2.3. the agreement with the model predictions suggests that theneutron-capture material in he2138-3336 originated from mass transfer from abinary companion star that previously went through the agb phase, whereas forhe2258-6358, an additional process has to be taken into account to explain itsabundance pattern. we find that a narrow range of progenitor masses (1.0 &lt;m(mo) &lt; 1.3) and metallicities (-2.8 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -2.5) yield the best agreementwith our observed elemental abundance patterns.

1307.2239	the chemical imprint of silicate dust on the most metal-poor stars	we investigate the impact of dust-induced gas fragmentation on the formationof the first low-mass, metal-poor stars (&lt; 1msun) in the early universe.previous work has shown the existence of a critical dust-to-gas ratio, belowwhich dust thermal cooling cannot cause gas fragmentation. assuming the firstdust is silicon-based, we compute critical dust-to-gas ratios and associatedcritical silicon abundances ([si/h]crit). at the density and temperatureassociated with protostellar disks, we find that a standard milky way grainsize distribution gives [si/h]crit = -4.5 +/- 0.1, while smaller grain sizescreated in a supernova reverse shock give [si/h]crit = -5.3 +/- 0.1. otherenvironments are not dense enough to be influenced by dust cooling. we test thesilicate dust cooling theory by comparing to silicon abundances observed in themost iron-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -4.0). several stars have silicon abundances lowenough to rule out dust-induced gas fragmentation with a standard grain sizedistribution. moreover, two of these stars have such low silicon abundancesthat even dust with a shocked grain size distribution cannot explain theirformation. adding small amounts of carbon dust does not significantly changethese conclusions. additionally, we find that these stars exhibit either highcarbon with low silicon abundances or the reverse. a silicate dust scenariothus suggests that the earliest low-mass star formation in the most metal-poorregime may have proceeded through two distinct cooling pathways: fine structureline cooling and dust cooling. this naturally explains both the carbon-rich andcarbon-normal stars at extremely low [fe/h].

1309.3562	the aquarius co-moving group is not a disrupted classical globular  cluster	we present a detailed analysis of high-resolution, high s/n spectra for 5aquarius stream stars observed with the mike spectrograph on the magellan claytelescope. our sample represents one third of the 15 known members in thestream. we find the stream is not mono-metallic: the metallicity ranges from[fe/h] = -0.63 to -1.58. no anti-correlation in na-o abundances is present, andwe find a strong positive mg-al relationship, similar to that observed in thethick disk. we find no evidence that the stream is a result of a disruptedclassical globular cluster, contrary to a previously published claim. high[(na, ni, alpha)/fe] and low [ba/y] abundance ratios in the stream suggests itis not a tidal tail from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, either. the stream ischemically indistinguishable from milky way field stars with the exception ofone candidate, c222531-145437. from its position, velocity, and detailedchemical abundances, c222531-145437 is likely a star that was tidally disruptedfrom omega-centauri. we propose the aquarius stream is galactic in origin, andcould be the result from a disk-satellite perturbation in the milky way thickdisk on the order of a few gyr ago: derived orbits, uvw velocities, and angularmomenta of the aquarius members offer qualitative support for our hypothesis.assuming c222531-145437 is a tidally disrupted member of omega-centauri, thissystem is the most likely disk perturber. in the absence of compelling chemicaland/or dynamical evidence that the aquarius stream is the tidal tail of adisrupted satellite, we advocate the "aquarius group" as a more appropriatedescription. like the canis major over-density, as well as the hercules andmonoceros groups, the aquarius group joins the list of kinematically-identifiedsubstructures that are not actually accreted material: they are simply part ofthe rich complexity of the milky way structure.

1311.5855	metal-poor stars observed with the magellan telescope ii. discovery of  four stars with [fe/h] &lt; -3.5	we report on the discovery of seven low-metallicity stars selected from thehamburg/eso survey, six of which are extremely metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-3.0), withfour having [fe/h]&lt;-3.5. chemical abundances or upper limits are derived forthese stars based on high-resolution (r~35,000) magellan/mike spectroscopy, andare in general agreement with those of other very and extremely metal-poorstars reported in the literature. accurate metallicities and abundance patternsfor stars in this metallicity range are of particular importance for studies ofthe shape of the metallicity distribution function of the milky way's halosystem, in particular for probing the nature of its low-metallicity tail. inaddition, taking into account suggested evolutionary mixing effects, we findthat six of the program stars (with [fe/h]&lt;-3.35) possess atmospheres that werelikely originally enriched in carbon, relative to iron, during theirmain-sequence phases. these stars do not exhibit over-abundances of theirs-process elements, and hence may be additional examples of the so-calledcemp-no class of objects.

0802.3701	the hobby-eberly telescope "chemical abundances of stars in the halo"  (cash) project. i. the lithium-, s-, and r-enhanced metal-poor giant hkii  17435-00532	we present the first detailed abundance analysis of the metal-poor giant hkii17435-00532. this star was observed as part of the university of texaslong-term project "chemical abundances of stars in the halo" (cash). a spectrumwas obtained with the high resolution spectrograph (hrs) on the hobby-eberlytelescope with a resolving power of r~15,000. our analysis reveals that thisstar may be located on the red giant branch, red horizontal branch, or earlyasymptotic giant branch. we find that this metal-poor ([fe/h]=-2.2) star has anunusually high lithium abundance (log eps (li)=+2.1), mild carbon ([c/fe]=+0.7)and sodium ([na/fe]=+0.6) enhancement, as well as enhancement of both s-process([ba/fe]=+0.8) and r-process ([eu/fe]=+0.5) material. the high li abundance canbe explained by self-enrichment through extra mixing that connects theconvective envelope with the outer regions of the h-burning shell. if so, hkii17435-00532 is the most metal-poor star in which this short-lived phase of lienrichment has been observed. the na and n-capture enrichment can be explainedby mass transfer from a companion that passed through the thermally-pulsing agbphase of evolution with only a small initial enrichment of r-process materialpresent in the birth cloud. despite the current non-detection of radialvelocity variations (over ~180 days), it is possible that hkii 17435-00532 isin a long-period or highly-inclined binary system, similar to other stars withsimilar n-capture enrichment patterns.

1403.6116	segue 1: an unevolved fossil galaxy from the early universe	we present magellan/mike and keck/hires high-resolution spectra of six redgiant stars in the dwarf galaxy segue 1. including one additional segue 1 starobserved by norris et al. (2010), high-resolution spectra have now beenobtained for every red giant in segue 1. remarkably, three of these seven starshave metallicities below [fe/h] = -3.5, suggesting that segue 1 is the leastchemically evolved galaxy known. we confirm previous medium-resolution analysesdemonstrating that segue 1 stars span a metallicity range of more than 2 dex,from [fe/h] = -1.4 to [fe/h] = -3.8. all of the segue 1 stars arealpha-enhanced, with [alpha/fe] ~ 0.5. high alpha-element abundances aretypical for metal-poor stars, but in every previously studied galaxy [alpha/fe]declines for more metal-rich stars, which is typically interpreted as ironenrichment from supernova ia. the absence of this signature in segue 1indicates that it was enriched exclusively by massive stars. other lightelement abundance ratios in segue 1, including carbon-enhancement in the threemost metal-poor stars, closely resemble those of metal-poor halo stars.finally, we classify the most metal-rich star as a ch star given its largeoverabundances of carbon and s-process elements. the other six stars showremarkably low neutron-capture element abundances of [sr/h] &lt; -4.9 and [ba/h] &lt;-4.2, which are comparable to the lowest levels ever detected in halo stars.this suggests minimal neutron-capture enrichment, perhaps limited to a singler-process or weak s-process synthesizing event. altogether, the chemicalabundances of segue 1 indicate no substantial chemical evolution, supportingthe idea that it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only oneburst of star formation.

1403.6828	the effects of varying cosmological parameters on halo substructure	we investigate how different cosmological parameters, such as those deliveredby the wmap and planck missions, affect the nature and evolution of dark matterhalo substructure. we use a series of flat $\lambda$ cold dark matter($\lambda$cdm) cosmological $n$-body simulations of structure formation, eachwith a different power spectrum but the same initial white noise field. ourfiducial simulation is based on parameters from the wmap 7th year cosmology. wethen systematically vary the spectral index, $n_s$, matter density, $\omega_m$,and normalization of the power spectrum, $\sigma_8$, for 7 unique simulations.across these, we study variations in the subhalo mass function, mass fraction,maximum circular velocity function, spatial distribution, concentration,formation times, accretion times, and peak mass. we eliminate dependence ofsubhalo properties on host halo mass and average over many hosts to reducevariance. while the "same" subhalos from identical initial overdensity peaks inhigher $\sigma_8, n_s$, and $\omega_m$ simulations accrete earlier and end upless massive and closer to the halo center at $z=0$, the process of continuoussubhalo accretion and destruction leads to a steady state distribution of theseproperties across all subhalos in a given host. this steady state mechanismeliminates cosmological dependence on all properties listed above exceptsubhalo concentration and $v_{max}$, which remain greater for higher $\sigma_8,n_s$ and $\omega_m$ simulations, and subhalo formation time, which remainsearlier. we also find that the numerical technique for computing scale radiusand the halo finder used can significantly affect the concentration-massrelationship computed for a simulation.

1406.0538	hubble space telescope near-ultraviolet spectroscopy of the bright  cemp-no star bd+44 493	we present an elemental-abundance analysis, in the near-ultraviolet (nuv)spectral range, for the extremely metal-poor star bd+44 493, a 9th magnitudesub-giant with [fe/h] = -3.8 and enhanced carbon, based on data acquired withthe space telescope imaging spectrograph on the hubble space telescope. thisstar is the brightest example of a class of objects that, unlike the greatmajority of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars, does not exhibitover-abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements (cemp-no). in this paper, wevalidate the abundance determinations for a number of species that werepreviously studied in the optical region, and obtain strong upper limits forberyllium and boron, as well as for neutron-capture elements from zirconium toplatinum, many of which are not accessible from ground-based spectra. the boronupper limit we obtain for bd+44 493, logeps(b) &lt; -0.70, the first suchmeasurement for a cemp star, is the lowest yet found for very and extremelymetal-poor stars. in addition, we obtain even lower upper limits on theabundances of beryllium, logeps(be) &lt; -2.3, and lead, logeps(pb) &lt; -0.23([pb/fe] &lt; +1.90), than those reported by previous analyses in the opticalrange. taken together with the previously measured low abundance of lithium,the very low upper limits on be and b suggest that bd+44 493 was formed at avery early time, and that it could well be a bona-fide second-generation star.finally, the pb upper limit strengthens the argument for non-s-processproduction of the heavy-element abundance patterns in cemp-no stars.

1406.4554	new detections of arsenic, selenium, and other heavy elements in two  metal-poor stars	we use the space telescope imaging spectrograph on board the hubble spacetelescope to obtain new high-quality spectra covering the 1900 to 2360 angstromwavelength range for two metal-poor stars, hd 108317 and hd 128279. we deriveabundances of cu ii, zn ii, as i, se i, mo ii, and cd ii, which have not beendetected previously in either star. abundances derived for ge i, te i, os ii,and pt i confirm those derived from lines at longer wavelengths. we also deriveupper limits from the non-detection of w ii, hg ii, pb ii, and bi i. the mean[as/fe] ratio derived from these two stars and five others in the literature isunchanged over the metallicity range -2.8 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.6, &lt;[as/fe]&gt; = +0.28+/- 0.14 (std. dev. = 0.36 dex). the mean [se/fe] ratio derived from these twostars and six others in the literature is also constant, &lt;[se/fe]&gt; = +0.16 +/-0.09 (std. dev. = 0.26 dex). the as and se abundances are enhanced relative toa simple extrapolation of the iron-peak abundances to higher masses, suggestingthat this mass region (75 &lt; a &lt; 82) may be the point at which a differentnucleosynthetic mechanism begins to dominate the quasi-equilibrium alpha-richfreezeout of the iron peak. &lt;[cuii/cui]&gt; = +0.56 +/- 0.23 in hd 108317 and hd128279, and we infer that lines of cu i may not be formed in localthermodynamic equilibrium in these stars. the [zn/fe], [mo/fe], [cd/fe], and[os/fe] ratios are also derived from neutral and ionized species, and eachratio pair agrees within the mutual uncertainties, which range from 0.15 to0.52 dex.

1410.2223	carbon-enhanced metal-poor star frequencies in the galaxy: corrections  for the effect of evolutionary status on carbon abundances	we revisit the observed frequencies of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp)stars as a function of the metallicity in the galaxy, using data from theliterature with available high-resolution spectroscopy. our analysis excludesstars exhibiting clear over-abundances of neutron-capture elements, and takesinto account the expected depletion of surface carbon abundance that occurs dueto cn processing on the upper red-giant branch. this allows for the recovery ofthe initial carbon abundance of these stars, and thus for an accurateassessment of the frequencies of carbon-enhanced stars. the correctionprocedure we develope is based on stellar-evolution models, and depends on thesurface gravity, log g, of a given star. our analysis indicates that, for starswith [fe/h]&lt;=-2.0, 20% exhibit [c/fe]&gt;=+0.7. this fraction increases to 43% for[fe/h]&lt;=-3.0 and 81% for [fe/h]&lt;=-4.0, which is higher than have beenpreviously inferred without taking the carbon-abundance correction intoaccount. these cemp-star frequencies provide important inputs for galactic andstellar chemical-evolution models, as they constrain the evolution of carbon atearly times and the possible formation channels for the cemp-no stars. we alsohave developed a public online tool with which carbon corrections using ourprocedure can be easily obtained.

1508.05872	hubble space telescope near-ultraviolet spectroscopy of bright cemp-s  stars	we present an elemental-abundance analysis, in the near-ultraviolet (nuv)spectral range, for the bright carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars hd196944(v = 8.40, [fe/h] = -2.41) and hd201626 (v = 8.16, [fe/h] = -1.51), based ondata acquired with the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on thehubble space telescope. both of these stars belong to the sub-class cemp-s, andexhibit clear over-abundances of heavy elements associated with production bythe slow neutron-capture process. hd196944 has been well-studied in the opticalregion, but we are able to add abundance results for six species (ge, nb, mo,lu, pt, and au) that are only accessible in the nuv. in addition, we providethe first determination of its orbital period, p=1325 days. hd201626 has only alimited number of abundance results based on previous optical work -- here weadd five new species from the nuv, including pb. we compare these results withmodels of binary-system evolution and s-process element production in stars onthe asymptotic giant branch, aiming to explain their origin and evolution. ourbest-fitting models for hd 196944 (m1,i = 0.9mo, m2,i = 0.86mo, for[fe/h]=-2.2), and hd 201626 (m1,i = 0.9mo , m2,i = 0.76mo , for [fe/h]=-2.2;m1,i = 1.6mo , m2,i = 0.59mo, for [fe/h]=-1.5) are consistent with the currentaccepted scenario for the formation of cemp-s stars.

1508.06137	preserving chemical signatures of primordial star formation in the first  low-mass stars	we model early star forming regions and their chemical enrichment bypopulation iii (pop iii) supernovae with nucleosynthetic yields featuring high[c/fe] ratios and pair-instability supernova (pisn) signatures. we aim to testhow well these chemical abundance signatures are preserved in the gas prior toforming the first long-lived low-mass stars (or second-generation stars). ourresults show that second-generation stars can retain the nucleosyntheticsignature of their pop iii progenitors, even in the presence ofnucleosynthetically normal pop iii core-collapse supernovae. we find thatcarbon-enhanced metal-poor stars are likely second-generation stars that formin minihaloes. furthermore, it is likely that the majority of pop iiisupernovae produce high [c/fe] yields. in contrast, metals ejected by a pisnare not concentrated in the first star forming haloes, which may explain theabsence of observed pisn signatures in metal-poor stars. we also find thatunique pop iii abundance signatures in the gas are quickly wiped out by theemergence of pop ii supernovae. we caution that the observed fractions of starswith pop iii signatures cannot be directly interpreted as the fraction of popiii stars producing that signature. such interpretations require modelling themetal enrichment process prior to the second-generation stars' formation,including results from simulations of metal mixing. the full potential ofstellar archaeology can likely be reached in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, wherethe simple formation history may allow for straightforward identification ofsecond-generation stars.

1510.06825	the chemical abundances of stars in the halo (cash) project. iii. a new  classification scheme for carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with s-process  element enhancement	we present a detailed abundance analysis of 23 elements for a newlydiscovered carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) star, he 0414-0343, from thechemical abundances of stars in the halo (cash) project. its spectroscopicstellar parameters are teff = 4863 k, log g = 1.25, vmic = 2.20 km/s, and[fe/h] = -2.24. radial velocity measurements covering seven years indicate he0414-0343 to be a binary. he 0414-0343 has [c/fe] = 1.44 and is stronglyenhanced in neutron-capture elements but its abundances cannot be reproduced bya solar-type s-process pattern alone. traditionally, it could be classified as"cemp-r/s" star. based on abundance comparisons with agb star nucleosynthesismodels, we suggest a new physically-motivated origin and classification schemefor cemp-s stars and the still poorly-understood cemp-r/s. the new schemedescribes a continuous transition between these two so-far distinctly treatedsubgroups: cemp-sa, cemp-sb, and cemp-sc. possible causes for a continuoustransition include the number of thermal pulses the agb companion underwent,the effect of different agb star masses on their nucleosynthetic yields, andphysics that is not well approximated in 1-d stellar models such as protoningestion episodes and rotation. based on a set of detailed agb models, wesuggest the abundance signature of he 0414-0343 to have arisen from a &gt;1.3 msunmass agb star and a late-time mass transfer, that transformed he 0414-0343 intoa cemp-sc star. we also find the [y/ba] ratio well parametrizes theclassification and can thus be used to easily classify any future such stars.

0807.1925	uncovering extremely metal-poor stars in the milky way's ultra-faint  dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies	we present new metallicity measurements for 298 individual red giant branchstars in eight of the least luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs) in themilky way (mw) system. our technique is based on medium resolution keck/deimosspectroscopy coupled with spectral synthesis. we present the firstspectroscopic metallicities at [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 of stars in a dwarf galaxy, withindividual stellar metallicities as low as [fe/h] = -3.3. because our [fe/h]measurements are not tied to empirical metallicity calibrators and aresensitive to arbitrarily low metallicities, we are able to probe this extremelymetal-poor regime accurately. the metallicity distribution of stars in thesedsphs is similar to the mw halo at the metal-poor end. we also demonstrate thatthe luminosity-metallicity relation previously seen in more luminous dsphgalaxies (m_v = -13.4 to -8.8) extends smoothly down to an absolute magnitudeof m_v = -3.7. the discovery of extremely metal-poor stars in dsphs lendssupport to the lcdm galaxy assembly paradigm wherein dwarf galaxies dissolve toform the stellar halo of the mw.

astro-ph;0503021	nucleosynthetic signatures of the first stars	the chemically most primitive stars provide constraints on the nature of thefirst stellar objects that formed in the universe; elements other thanhydrogen, helium and traces of lithium within these objects were generated bynucleosynthesis in the very first stars. the relative abundances of elements inthe surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, becausethe pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. severalmodels have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern ofthe giant star he 0107-5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency ofheavy elements known. here we report the discovery of he 1327-2326, a subgiantor main-sequence star with an iron abundance about a factor of two lower thanthat of he 0107-5240. both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon andnitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundancepatterns. the unexpectedly low li and high sr abundances of he 1327-2326,however, challenge existing theoretical understanding: none predicts the highsr abundance or provides a li depletion mechanism consistent with dataavailable for the most metal-poor stars.

astro-ph;0512543	the oxygen abundance of he 1327-2326	from a newly obtained vlt/uves spectrum we have determined the oxygenabundance of he 1327-2326, the most iron-poor star known to date. uv-oh linesyield a 1d lte abundance of [o/fe]_oh = 3.7 (subgiant case) and [o/fe]_oh = 3.4(dwarf case). using a correction of -1.0 dex to account for 3d effects on ohline formation, the abundances are lowered to [o/fe] = 2.8 and [o/fe] = 2.5,respectively, which we adopt. without 3d corrections, the uv-oh based abundancewould be in disagreement with the upper limits derived from the oi tripletlines: [o/fe]_trip &lt; 2.8 (subgiant) and [o/fe]_trip &lt; 3.0 (dwarf). we alsocorrect the previously determined carbon and nitrogen abundances for 3deffects. knowledge of the o abundance of he 1327-2326 has implications for theinterpretation of its abundance pattern. a large o abundance is in accordancewith he 1327-2326 being an early population ii star which formed from materialchemically enriched by a first generation supernova. our derived abundances,however, do not exclude other possibilities such as a population iii scenario.

astro-ph;0610018	broadband ubvri photometry of horizontal-branch and metal-poor  candidates from the hk and hamburg/eso surveys. i	we report broadband ubv and/or bvri ccd photometry for a total of 1857 starsin the thick-disk and halo populations of the galaxy. the majority of ourtargets were selected as candidate field horizontal-branch or other a-typestars (fhb/a, n = 576), or candidate low-metallicity stars (n = 1221), from thehk and hamburg/eso objective-prism surveys. similar data for a small number ofadditional stars from other samples are also reported.  these data are being used for several purposes. in the case of the fhb/acandidates they are used to accurately separate the lower-gravity fhb starsfrom various higher-gravity a-type stars, a subsample that includes theso-called blue metal poor stars, halo and thick-disk blue stragglers,main-sequence a-type dwarfs, and am and ap stars. these data are also beingused to derive photometric distance estimates to high-velocity hydrogen cloudsin the galaxy and for improved measurements of the mass of the galaxy.photometric data for the metal-poor candidates are being used to refineestimates of stellar metallicity for objects with available medium-resolutionspectroscopy, to obtain distance estimates for kinematic analyses, and toestablish initial estimates of effective temperature for analysis ofhigh-resolution spectroscopy of the stars for which this information nowexists.

astro-ph;0612160	chemical abundance analysis of the extremely metal-poor star he  1300+0157	we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of he 1300+0157, a subgiantwith [fe/h]=-3.9. from a high-resolution, high-s/n subaru/hds spectrum we findthe star to be enriched in c ([c/fe]_1d ~ +1.4) and o ([o/fe]_1d ~ +1.8). withthe exception of these species, he 1300+0157 exhibits an elemental abundancepattern similar to that found in many other very and extremely metal-poorstars. the li abundance is lower than the spite-plateau value, in agreementwith expectation for its evolutionary status. of particular interest, noneutron-capture elements are detected in he 1300+0157. this type of abundancepattern has been found by recent studies in several other metal-poor giants. wesuggest that he 1300+0157 is an unevolved example of this group of stars, whichexhibit high c abundances together with low (or absent) abundances ofneutron-capture elements. several potential enrichment scenarios are presented.the low neutron-capture elements, including sr, ba, and pb, suggests that thecarbon excess observed in he 1300+0157 is not due to mass transfer across abinary system. such a scenario is applied to carbon-rich objects with excessesof s-process elements. the normal observed li abundance supports thisinterpretation. most likely, the high levels of c and o were produced prior tothe birth of this star. it remains unclear whether a single hypernova isresponsible for its overall chemical pattern, or whether one requires asuperposition of yields from a massive population iii object and a normal typeii sn. these scenarios provide important information on the c production in theearly universe, and on the formation of c-rich stars in the early galaxy.

astro-ph;0701395	probing the formation of the first low-mass stars with stellar  archaeology	we investigate the conditions under which the first low-mass stars formed inthe universe by confronting theoretical predictions governing the transitionfrom massive population iii to low-mass population ii stars with recentobservational c and/or o abundance data of metal-poor galactic stars. based onan existing theory, we introduce a new "observer-friendly" function, thetransition discriminant d_trans, which provides empirical constraints as wellas a powerful comparison between the currently available data of metal-poorhalo stars and theoretical predictions of the formation of the first low-massstars (&lt;1 m_sun). specifically, we compare the empirical stellar results withthe theory that fine-structure lines of c and o dominate the transition frompop iii to pop ii in the early universe. we find the observational data forhalo objects as well as for dsph galaxies and globular clusters to beconsistent with this theory. an explanation for the observed lack of metal-poorstars in dsph galaxies and globular clusters is also suggested. finally, wepredict that any star to be found with [fe/h]&lt;-4 should have enhanced c and/oro abundances. the high c and o abundances of the two most iron-poor stars arein line with our prediction.

0811.0020	the minimum stellar metallicity observable in the galaxy	the first stars fundamentally transformed the early universe through theirproduction of energetic radiation and the first heavy chemical elements. theimpact on cosmic evolution sensitively depends on their initial mass function(imf), which can be empirically constrained through detailed studies ofancient, metal-poor halo stars in our galaxy. we compare the lowest magnesiumand iron abundances measured in galactic halo stars with theoreticalpredictions for the minimum stellar enrichment provided by population iii starsunder the assumption of a top-heavy imf. to demonstrate that abundancesmeasured in metal-poor stars reflect the chemical conditions at theirformation, and that they can thus be used to derive constraints on theprimordial imf, we carry out a detailed kinematic analysis of a large sample ofmetal-poor stars drawn from the sdss survey. we assess whether interstellaraccretion has altered their surface abundances. we find that accretion isgenerally negligible, even at the extremely low levels where the primordial imfcan be tested. we conclude that the majority of the first stars were verymassive, but had likely masses below ~140 m.

0812.1227	observing the r-process signature in the oldest stars	the abundance patterns of metal-poor stars provide us a wealth of chemicalinformation about various stages of the chemical evolution of the galaxy. inparticular, these stars allow us to study the formation and evolution of theelements and the involved nucleosynthesis processes. metal-poor stars are thelocal equivalent of the high-redshift universe, and thus offer crucialobservational constraints on a variety of issues regarding the early universe.this review presents an introduction to metal-poor stars and their role as"cosmic lab" for the study of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis processes,particularly that of the r-process. the metal-poor star he 1523-0901 serves asan example for this group of objects. it displays in its spectrum the strongestoverabundance of neutron-capture elements associated with the r-process. heavyneutron-capture elements such as eu, os, and ir were measured, as well as theradioactive elements th and u. abundance of th and u, in conjunction with thoseof stable elements make possible nucleo-chronomtery, i.e., the determination ofstellar ages. he 1523-0901 appears to be ~13 gyr old. age uncertaintites rangefrom 2-5 gyr for individual chronometers, and are largly due to theoreticaluncertainties in the initial production ratio of the employed chronometers. thedecay product of the radioactive elements, lead, can be used to constrainr-process calculations. only few such stars are currently known with detectedu. these objects, however, are crucial for the study of this nucleosynthesisprocess.
