0902.0371	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations ii: covariance matrix of the  matter power spectrum	we use 5000 cosmological n-body simulations of 1(gpc/h)^3 box for theconcordance lcdm model in order to study the sampling variances of nonlinearmatter power spectrum. we show that the non-gaussian errors can be importanteven on large length scales relevant for baryon acoustic oscillations (bao).our findings are (1) the non-gaussian errors degrade the cumulativesignal-to-noise ratios (s/n) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factorof 2 and 4 for redshifts z=1 and 0, respectively. (2) there is littleinformation on the power spectrum amplitudes in the quasi-nonlinear regime,confirming the previous results. (3) the distribution of power spectrumestimators at bao scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by agaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariancecomponent. (4) for the redshift-space power spectrum, the degradation in s/n bynon-gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions. (5) foran actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromisesthe cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but alsomitigates the impact of non-gaussian errors. the s/n is degraded by up to 30%for a wfmos-type survey. (6) the finite survey volume causes additionalnon-gaussian errors via the correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations withthe fluctuations we want to measure, further degrading the s/n values by about30% even at high redshift z=3.

0902.1018	the 21cm signature of early relic \hii regions	we calculate the spin temperature and 21 cm brightness of early \hii regionsaround the first stars. we use outputs from cosmologicalradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the formation and evolution of early\hii regions. in the pre-reionization era, \hii regions around massiveprimordial stars have diameters of a few kpc. the gas within the \hii regionsis almost fully ionized, but begins recombining after the central stars dieoff. the relic \hii regions are then seen as bright {\it emission} sources inhydrogen 21 cm. we make brightness temperature maps of the \hii regions,accounting for radiative coupling with lyman-$\alpha$ photons in a simplifiedmanner. the spin temperature in the relic \hii region is close to the gaskinetic temperature, generally several hundred to several thousand degrees. weshow that the relic \hii region can be as bright as $\delta t_{\rm b} \sim 100$mk in differential temperature against the cosmic microwave background for anangular resolution of sub-arcseconds. while individual early \hii patches willnot be identified by currently planned radio telescopes, the collectivefluctuations from early \hii regions might imprint signatures in the 21 cmbackground.

0908.0113	s-z power spectrum produced by primordial magnetic fields	primordial magnetic fields generated in the very early universe are one ofthe candidates for the origin of magnetic fields observed in galaxy clusters.after recombination, the lorentz force acts on the residual ions and electronsto generate density fluctuations of baryons. accordingly these fluctuationsinduce the early formation of dark halos which cause the sunyaev-zel'dovich(s-z) effect in cosmic microwave background radiation. this additional s-zeffect due to primordial magnetic fields amplifies the angular power spectrumof cosmic microwave temperature anisotropies on small scales. thisamplification depends on the comoving amplitude and the power law index of theprimordial magnetic fields spectrum. comparing with the small scale cmbobservations, we obtained the constraints on the primordial magnetic fields,i.e., b &lt; 2.0 ngauss for n=-2.9 or b &lt; 1.0 ngauss for n=-2.6, where b is thecomoving amplitude of magnetic fields at h^-1 mpc and n is the power law index.future s-z measurements have the potential to give constraints tighter thanthose from temperature anisotropies and polarization of cosmic microwavebackground induced by the magnetic fields at the recombination epoch.

1106.1984	formulation and constraints on decaying dark matter with finite mass  daughter particles	decaying dark matter cosmological models have been proposed to remedy theoverproduction problem at small scales in the standard cold dark matterparadigm. we consider a decaying dark matter model in which one cdm motherparticle decays into two daughter particles, with arbitrary masses. a completeset of boltzmann equations of dark matter particles is derived which isnecessary to calculate the evolutions of their energy densities and theirdensity perturbations. by comparing the expansion history of the universe inthis model and the free-streaming scale of daughter particles with astronomicalobservational data, we give constraints on the lifetime of the mother particle,$\gamma^{-1}$, and the mass ratio between the daughter and the mother particles$m_{\rm d}/m_{\rm m}$. from the distance to the last scattering surface of thecosmic microwave background, we obtain $\gamma^{-1}&gt;$ 30 gyr in the masslesslimit of daughter particles and, on the other hand, we obtain $m_{\rm d} &gt;$0.97$m_{\rm m}$ in the limit $\gamma^{-1}\to 0$. the free-streaming constrainttightens the bound on the mass ratio as $(\gamma^{-1}/10^{-2}{\rm gyr})\lesssim ((1-m_{\rm d1}/m_{\rm m})/10^{-2})^{-3/2}$ for $\gamma^{-1} &lt;h^{-1}(z=3)$.

1211.3097	exploring the origin of the fine structures in the cmb temperature  angular power spectrum	the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)temperature anisotropies is a good probe to look into the primordial densityfluctuations at large scales in the universe. here we re-examine the angularpower spectrum of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data, payingparticular attention to the fine structures (oscillations) at $\ell=100 \sim150$ reported by several authors. using monte-carlo simulations, we confirmthat the gap from the simple power law spectrum is a rare event, about2.5--3$\sigma$, if these fine structures are generated by experimental noiseand the cosmic variance. next, in order to investigate the origin of thestructures, we examine frequency and direction dependencies of the finestructures by dividing the observed quv frequency maps into four sky regions.we find that the structures around $\ell \sim 120$ do not have significantdependences either on frequencies or directions. for the structure around $\ell\sim 140$, however, we find that the characteristic signature found in the allsky power spectrum is attributed to the anomaly only in the south east region.

0802.1808	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations i: growth of large-scale  density fluctuations	we critically examine how well the evolution of large-scale densityperturbations is followed in cosmological $n$-body simulations. we first run alarge volume simulation and perform a mode-by-mode analysis inthree-dimensional fourier space. we show that the growth of large-scalefluctuations significantly deviates from linear theory predictions. thedeviations are caused by {\it nonlinear} coupling with a small number of modesat largest scales owing to finiteness of the simulation volume. we then developan analytic model based on second-order perturbation theory to quantify theeffect. our model accurately reproduces the simulation results. for a singlerealization, the second-order effect appears typically as ``zig-zag'' patternsaround the linear-theory prediction, which imprints artificial ``oscillations''that lie on the real baryon-acoustic oscillations. although an ensemble averageof a number of realizations approaches the linear theory prediction, thedispersions of the realizations remain large even for a large simulation volumeof several hundred megaparsecs on a side. for the standard $\lambda$cdm model,the deviations from linear growth rate are as large as 10 percent for asimulation volume with $l = 500h^{-1}$mpc and for a bin width in wavenumber of$\delta k = 0.005h$mpc$^{-1}$, which are comparable to the intrinsic varianceof gaussian random realizations. we find that the dispersions scales as$\propto l^{-3/2} \delta k^{-1/2}$ and that the mean dispersion amplitude canbe made smaller than a percent only if we use a very large volume of $l &gt;2h^{-1}$gpc. the finite box size effect needs to be appropriately taken intoaccount when interpreting results from large-scale structure simulations forfuture dark energy surveys using baryon acoustic oscillations.

astro-ph;0110313	on the cross-correlation between dark matter distribution and secondary  cmb anisotropies by ionized intergalactic medium	we investigate a cross-correlation between the weak gravitational lensingfield of the large-scale structure, $\kappa$, and the secondary temperaturefluctuation field, $\delta$, of cosmic microwave background (cmb) induced bythomson scattering of cmb photons off the ionized medium in the mildlynonlinear structure. the cross-correlation is expected to observationallyunveil the biasing relation between the dark matter and ionized mediumdistributions in the large-scale structure. we develop a formalism forcalculating the cross-correlation function and its angular power spectrum basedon the small angle approximation. as a result, we find that leadingcontribution to the cross-correlation comes from the secondary cmb fluctuationfield induced by the quadratic doppler effects of the bulk velocity field $v$of ionized medium. the magnitude of the cross-correlation can be estimated as$\kaco{\kappa\delta}\sim 10^{-10}$ on small angular scales ($l\simgt 1000$)under the currently favored cold cdm model of the structure formation and thesimplest scenario of homogeneous reionization after a given redshift of $z_{\rmion}\simgt 5$. interestingly, we find that the density-modulated quadraticdoppler effect of $o(\delta_e v^2)$ produces the cross-correlation with theweak lensing field that has {\em linear} dependence on the electron densityfluctuation field $\delta_e$ or equivalently on the biasing relation betweenthe dark matter and electron distributions. in other words, the angular powerspectrum could be both positive or negative, depending on the positive biasingor antibiasing, respectively. detection of the cross-correlation thus offers anew opportunity to observationally understand the reionization history ofintergalactic medium connected to the dark matter clustering.

astro-ph;0112412	faraday rotation effect of intracluster magnetic field on cosmic  microwave background polarization	the observed magnetic field of microgauss strength in clusters of galaxiesshould induce the faraday rotation effect on the linearly polarized cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation when the cmb radiation propagates througha cluster at low redshift. employing the press-schechter prescription for thecluster abundance under the cold dark matter (cdm) scenario and a plausibleisothermal $\beta$-model for the gas distribution, we compute angular powerspectra of the cmb polarization fields including the faraday rotation mixingeffect under the simple assumption of uniform magnetic field configurationacross a cluster. as a result, we find that a parity-odd b-type polarizationpattern is statistically generated on the observed sky, even when the primarypolarization only contains the parity-even e-mode component, such as in thecase of pure scalar perturbations. the generated b-type polarization has a peakwith amplitude of $\sim0.1 \mu{\rm k}(b_0/0.1 \mu{\rm g})(\nu_0/10 {\rmghz})^{-2}$ at angular scales of $l\approx 1000$ for the currently favoredadiabatic $\lambda$cdm model. this result also implies that, if the magneticfield has a $0.5 \mu{\rm g}$ strength and we observe at lower frequencies suchas $\nu_0\simlt 5 {\rm ghz}$, the secondary signal due to the faraday rotationeffect could be comparable to the magnitude of the primary polarization. thefrequency dependence of the faraday rotation can be then used to discriminatethe effect from primary and other secondary signals on the cmb polarizations.our results therefore offer a new empirical opportunity to measure or constrainthe intracluster magnetic field in the average sense.

astro-ph;0205394	how large is our universe?	we reexamine constraints on the spatial size of closed toroidal models withcold dark matter and the cosmological constant from cosmic microwavebackground. we carry out bayesian analyses using the cosmic background explorer(cobe) data properly taking into account the statistically anisotropiccorrelation, i.e., off-diagonal elements in the covariance. we find that thecobe constraint becomes more stringent in comparison with that using only theangular power spectrum, if the likelihood is marginalized over the orientationof the observer. for some limited choices of orientations, the fit to the cobedata is considerably better than that of the infinite counterpart. the best-fitmatter normalization is increased because of large-angle suppression in thepower and the global anisotropy of the temperature fluctuations. we also studyseveral deformed closed toroidal models in which the fundamental cell isdescribed by a rectangular box. in contrast to the cubic models, thelarge-angle power can be enhanced in comparison with the infinite counterpartsif the cell is sufficiently squashed in a certain direction. it turns out thatconstraints on some slightly deformed models are less stringent. we comment onhow these results affect our understanding of the global topology of ouruniverse.

astro-ph;0208023	statistics of neutral regions during hydrogen re-ionization	we present predictions for two statistical measures of the hydrogenreionization process at high redshift. the first statistic is the number ofneutral segments identified in spectra of high redshift qsos as a function oftheir length. the second is the cross-correlation of neutral regions withpossible sources of ionizing radiation. these independent probes are sensitiveto the topology of the ionized regions. if reionization proceeded from high tolow density regions then the cross-correlation will be negative, while if voidswere ionized first then we expect a positive correlation and a relatively smallnumber of long neutral segments. we test the sensitivity of these statisticsfor reionization by stars in high redshift galaxies. the flux of ionizingradiation emitted from stars is estimated by identifying galaxies in an n-bodysimulation using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. the spatialdistribution of ionized gas is traced in various models for the propagation ofthe ionization fronts. a model with ionization proceeding from high to lowdensity regions is consistent with the observations of becker et al. (2001),while models in which ionization begins in the lowest density regions appear tobe inconsistent with the present data.

astro-ph;0301645	simulations of early structure formation: primordial gas clouds	(abridged) we use large cosmological simulations to study the origin ofprimordial star-forming clouds in a lambda cdm universe, by following theformation of dark matter halos and the cooling of gas within them. to model thephysics of chemically pristine gas, we employ a non-equilibrium treatment ofthe chemistry of 9 species and include cooling by molecular hydrogen. weexplore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts z = 25- 30 with total masses in the range 10^5 - 10^6 msun. the complex interplaybetween the gravitational formation of dark halos and the thermodynamic andchemical evolution of the gas clouds compromises analytic estimates of thecritical h2 fraction. dynamical heating from mass accretion and mergers opposesrelatively inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen, delaying the productionof star-forming clouds in rapidly growing halos. we also investigate the impactof photo-dissociating ultra-violet (uv) radiation on the formation ofprimordial gas clouds. we consider two extreme cases by first including auniform radiation field in the optically thin limit and secondly by accountingfor the maximum effect of gas self-shielding in virialized regions. in both thecases we consider, the overall impact can be described by computing anequilibrium h2 abundance for the radiation flux and defining an effectiveshielding factor.  based on our numerical results, we develop a semi-analytic model of theformation of the first stars, and demonstrate how it can be coupled with largen-body simulations to predict the star formation rate in the early universe.

astro-ph;0305210	the evolution of baryon density fluctuations in multi-component  cosmological simulations	we critically examine how the evolution of the matter density field incosmological simulations is affected by details of setting up initialconditions. we show that it is non-trivial to realise an initial distributionof matter in n-body/hydrodynamic simulations so that the baryon and dark matterdensity fluctuations and their velocities evolve consistently as theoreticallypredicted. we perform a set of cosmological simulations and use them todistinguish and verify an appropriate method for generating initial conditions.we show that a straightforward way of applying the zel'dovich approximation toeach component using distinct transfer functions results in an incorrect growthof density fluctuations and that it is necessary to correct velocities at theinitial epoch. the unperturbed uniform particle distribution must be alsogenerated appropriately to avoid tight coupling of the baryonic and dark mattercomponents. we recommend using independent ``glass'' particle distributions,using distinct transfer functions for baryons and dark matter, and taking intoaccount the difference in the velocity fields at the initialisation epoch. theproposed method will be useful for studies of the evolution of theintergalactic medium and the formation of the first cosmological objects usingnumerical simulations.

astro-ph;0309116	can non-gaussian cosmological models explain the wmap's high optical  depth for reionization?	the first-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data suggest a highoptical depth for thomson scattering of 0.17 +/- 0.04, implying that theuniverse was reionized at an early epoch, z ~ 20. such early reionization islikely to be caused by uv photons from first stars, but it appears that theobserved high optical depth can be reconciled within the standard structureformation model only if star-formation in the early universe was extremelyefficient. with normal star-formation efficiencies, cosmological models withnon-gaussian density fluctuations may circumvent this conflict as high densitypeaks collapse at an earlier epoch than in models with gaussian fluctuations.we study cosmic reionization in non-gaussian models and explore to what extent,within available constraints, non-gaussianities affect the reionizationhistory. for mild non-gaussian fluctuations at redshifts of 30 to 50, theincrease in optical depth remains at a level of a few percent and appearsunlikely to aid significantly in explaining the measured high optical depth. onthe other hand, within available observational constraints, increasing thenon-gaussian nature of density fluctuations can easily reproduce the opticaldepth and may remain viable in underlying models of non-gaussianity with ascale-dependence.

astro-ph;0512364	the epoch of reionization	we have modelled the process of reionization of the igm by photoionization bygalaxies, in order to predict the epoch of reionization. we use a sophisticatedsemi-analytic model to track the formation of galaxies. our study represents amuch more complete and physically consistent modelling of reionization than hasbeen conducted in the past, containing significant improvements in themodelling of the collapse of baryons into dark matter halos, and in the modelfor the cooling and condensation of gas within halos (including photoheatingfrom a self-consistently computed ionizing background and cooling due to h2).we find that reionization can be achieved by z~10-20 in a lcdm cosmologicalmodel with sigma8~0.9. however, a cosmological model with a running spectralindex is only able to achieve reionization before z~9 if extreme assumptionsare made about the physics of feedback at high redshifts. we also consider thegalaxy formation model discussed by baugh et al., and find that it is able toreionize the universe by z~12. the previous results assume that all of theionizing photons produced by stars in galaxies are able to escape and ionizethe igm. if this is not the case, then the redshift of reionization could besubstantially reduced. we find that extended periods of partial reionizationand double reionizations can occur in models in which the first stars formedvia cooling by h2 molecules, are very massive, and in which the escape fractionof ionizing photons ~10-30%. such models do not fully reionize until z~6-7, butpredict an electron scattering optical depth as large as 0.15. models withlower sigma8=0.7-0.8 as suggested by the recent wmap three year data havereduced redshifts of reionization, but can be consistent with the lower opticaldepth also suggested by the wmap three year data.

astro-ph;9711057	cmb anisotropy correlation function and topology from simulated maps for  map	we have simulated cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy maps forseveral cobe-dmr-normalized cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogonies, to makepredictions for the upcoming map experiment. we have studied the sensitivity ofthe simulated map data to cosmology, sky coverage, and instrumental noise. withaccurate knowledge of instrumental noise, map data will discriminate among thecosmogonies considered, and determine the topology of the initial fluctuations.  a correlation function analysis of the simulated map data results in a veryaccurate measurement of the acoustic hubble radius at decoupling. a low-densityopen cdm model with omega_0=0.4 can be distinguished from the omega_0=1fiducial cdm model or a lambda cdm model with &gt; 99% confidence from thelocation of the acoustic "valley" in the correlation function.  a genus analysis of the simulated map data indicates that in cosmogonies withgaussian random-phase initial conditions, a shift of the zero-crossing point ofthe genus curve near the mean temperature threshold level nu=0 should notexceed |delta nu| = 0.01 (0.04) when the total effective fwhm smoothing is 0.3deg (1.0 deg). the asymmetry of the genus curve at the positive and negativethreshold levels should not exceed |delta g/g(nu=1,-1)| = 0.8% (4%) at 0.3 deg(1.0 deg) fwhm smoothing. deviations of the observed map data in excess ofthese small values will be evidence for non-gaussian behavior.  the amplitude of the genus curve is a measure of the shape of the powerspectrum at the smoothing scale. even with the expected amount of instrumentalnoise and partial sky coverage (due to the galaxy), the map data should allowdiscrimination amongst the cosmogonies considered at more than 99% confidencesolely from a genus amplitude analysis.

astro-ph;9805102	observational implications of axionic isocurvature fluctuations	the axion is the most attractive candidate to solve the strong cp problem inqcd. if it exists, the inflationary universe produces axion fluctuations whichare mixtures of isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations in general. weinvestigate how large isocurvature fluctuations are allowed or favored in orderto explain observations of the large scale structure of the present universe.generic flat universe models with mixed (isocurvature + adiabatic) densityfluctuations are studied. it is found that the observations are consistent withthe mixed fluctuation model if the ratio \alpha of the power spectrum ofisocurvature fluctuations to that of adiabatic fluctuations is less than \sim0.1. in particular, the mixed fluctuation model with \alpha \sim 0.05, totalmatter density \omega_{0} =0.4, and hubble parameter h_0=70 km/s/mpc gives avery good fit to the observational data. since the height of the acoustic peakin the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)radiation decreases significantly when the isocurvature fluctuations arepresent, the mixed fluctuation model can be tested in future satelliteexperiments. ratios of the amplitude at the peak location to that at the cobenormalization scale for various models are given. furthermore, we also obtainthe amplitude of isocurvature fluctuations as a function of axion parametersand the hubble parameter during the inflation. we discuss the axionfluctuations in some realistic inflation models and find that a significantamount of the isocurvature fluctuations are naturally produced.

astro-ph;9807298	argo cmb anisotropy measurement constraints on open and flat-lambda cdm  cosmogonies	we use data from the argo cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropyexperiment to constrain cosmogonies. we account for the argo beamwidth andcalibration uncertainties, and marginalize over the offset removed from thedata. our derived amplitudes of the cmb anisotropy detected by the argoexperiment are smaller than those derived previously.  we consider open and spatially-flat-lambda cold dark matter cosmogonies, withclustered-mass density parameter omega_0 in the range 0.1-1, baryonic-massdensity parameter omega_b in the range (0.005-0.029)h^{-2}, and age of theuniverse t_0 in the range (10--20) gyr. marginalizing over all parameters butomega_0, the argo data favors an open (spatially-flat-lambda) model withomega_0= 0.23 (0.1). however, these numerical values are model dependent.  at the 2 sigma confidence level model normalizations deduced from the argodata are consistent with those drawn from the ucsb south pole 1994, max 4+5,white dish, and suzie data sets. the argo open model normalizations are alsoconsistent with those deduced from the dmr data. however, for mostspatially-flat-lambda models the dmr normalizations are more than 2 sigma abovethe argo ones.

astro-ph;9901014	cmb anisotropy constraints on open and flat-lambda cdm cosmogonies from  ucsb south pole, argo, max, white dish, and suzie data	we use combinations of ten small-scale cosmic microwave background anisotropydata sets from the ucsb south pole 1994, argo, max 4 and 5, white dish andsuzie experiments to constrain cosmogonies. we consider open andspatially-flat-lambda cold dark matter cosmogonies. marginalizing over allparameters but $\omega_0$, the combined data favors an omega_0 simeq 1 for bothopen and flat-lambda models. excluding the smallest angular scale suzie data,an omega_0 simeq 0.3 (1.0) open (flat-lambda) model is favored. consideringonly multi-frequency data with error bars consistent with sample variance andnoise considerations, an omega_0 simeq 0.1 (1) open (flat-lambda) model isfavored. for both open and flat-$\lambda$ models, after marginalizing over allthe other parameters, a lower omega_b h^2 (sim 0.005) or younger (t_0 sim 10gyr) universe is favored. however, the data do not rule out other values ofomega_0 in the flat-lambda model and other values of omega_b h^2 in bothmodels.

0810.0813	modeling nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations:  convergence regime of n-body simulations and analytic models	we use a series of cosmological n-body simulations and various analyticmodels to study the evolution of the matter power spectrum in real space in a\lambda cold dark matter universe. we compare the results of n-body simulationsagainst three analytical model predictions; standard perturbation theory,renormalized perturbation theory, and the closure approximation. we include theeffects from finite simulation box size in the comparison. we determine thevalues of the maximum wavenumbers, k^{lim}_{1%} and k^{lim}_{3%}, below whichthe analytic models and the simulation results agree to within 1 and 3 percent,respectively. we then provide a simple empirical function which describes theconvergence regime determined by comparison between our simulations and theanalytical models. we find that if we use the fourier modes within theconvergence regime alone, the characteristic scale of baryon acousticoscillations can be determined within 1% accuracy from future surveys with avolume of a few h^{-3}gpc^3 at z\sim1 or z\sim3 in the absence of anysystematic distortion of the power spectrum.
