0706.2768	towards a holistic view of the heating and cooling of the intracluster  medium	(abridged) x-ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "coolcore" (cc) clusters and "non-cool core" (ncc) clusters. yet relatively littleattention has been given to the origins of this dichotomy and, in particular,to the energetics and thermal histories of the two classes. we develop a modelfor the entropy profiles of clusters starting from the configurationestablished by gravitational shock heating and radiative cooling. at largeradii, gravitational heating accounts for the observed profiles and theirscalings well. however, at small and intermediate radii, radiative cooling andgravitational heating cannot be combined to explain the observed profiles ofeither type of cluster. the inferred entropy profiles of ncc clusters requirethat material is preheated prior to cluster collapse in order to explain theabsence of low entropy (cool) material in these systems. we show that a similarmodification is also required in cc clusters in order to match their propertiesat intermediate radii. in cc clusters, this modification is unstable, and anadditional process is required to prevent cooling below a temperature of a fewkev. we show that this can be achieved by adding a self-consistent agn feedbackloop in which the lowest-entropy, most rapidly cooling material is heated sothat it rises buoyantly to mix with material at larger radii. the resultingmodel does not require fine tuning and is in excellent agreement with a widevariety of observational data. some of the other implications of this model arebriefly discussed.

0905.3392	recent arrival of faint cluster galaxies on the red-sequence: luminosity  functions from 119 square degrees of cfhtls	the global star formation rate has decreased significantly since z ~ 1, forreasons that are not well understood. red-sequence galaxies, dominating ingalaxy clusters, represent the population that have had their star formationshut off, and may therefore be the key to this problem. in this work, we select127 rich galaxy clusters at 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.36, from 119 square degrees of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) optical imaging data, andconstruct the r'-band red-sequence luminosity functions (lfs). we show that thefaint end of the lf is very sensitive to how red-sequence galaxies areselected, and an optimal way to minimise the contamination from the blue cloudis to mirror galaxies on the redder side of the colour-magnitude relation(cmr). the lfs of our sample have a significant inflexion centred at mr' ~-18.5, suggesting a mixture of two populations. combining our survey with lowredshift samples constructed from the sloan digital sky survey, we show thatthere is no strong evolution of the faint end of the lf (or the red-sequencedwarf-to-giant ratio) over the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, but from z ~ 0.2to z ~ 0 the relative number of red-sequence dwarf galaxies has increased by afactor of ~3, implying a significant build-up of the faint end of the clusterred-sequence over the last 2.5 gyr.

0905.3401	the colour of galaxies in distant groups	(abridged) we present new optical and near-infrared imaging for a sample of98 spectroscopically-selected galaxy groups at 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.55. we measure accuratecolours for group members and the surrounding field population, statisticallycomplete above a stellar mass limit of m=1e10 msun. the overall colourdistribution is bimodal in both the field and group samples; but at fixedluminosity the fraction of group galaxies populating the red peak is larger, by20+/-7 per cent, than that of the field. in particular, group members withearly-type morphologies, as identified in hst imaging, exhibit a tight redsequence, similar to that seen for more massive clusters. we show thatapproximately 20-30 per cent of galaxies on the red sequence may bedust-reddened galaxies with non-negligible star formation and early-spiralmorphologies. this is true of both the field and group sample, and shows littledependence on near infrared luminosity. thus, the fraction of bright groupmembers with no sign of star formation or agn activity is 54+/-6 per cent. ourfield sample, which includes galaxies in all environments, contains 35+/-3 percent of such inactive galaxies, consistent with the amount expected if all suchgalaxies are located in groups and clusters. this reinforces our earlierconclusions, that dense environments at z&lt;0.5 are associated with a prematurecessation of star formation in some galaxies; in particular we find no evidencefor significantly enhanced star formation in these environments. simple galaxyformation models predict a quenching of star formation in groups that is tooefficient, overpopulating the red sequence. attempts to fix this by increasingthe timescale of this quenching equally for all group members distorts thecolour distribution in a way that is inconsistent with observations.

0905.3551	stellar black holes and the origin of cosmic acceleration	the discovery of cosmic acceleration has presented a unique challenge forcosmologists. as observational cosmology forges ahead, theorists have struggledto make sense of a standard model that requires extreme fine tuning. thischallenge is known as the cosmological constant problem. the theory ofgravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does notsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theoryvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.in this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and showthat it manifests a uv-ir coupling: aether couples the spacetime metric closeto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity. we then show that using thetrans-planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black holehorizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon.interestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar massblack holes. based on our current understanding of the black hole accretionhistory in the universe, we then make a prediction for how the effective darkenergy density should evolve with redshift, which can be tested with futuredark energy probes.

0908.0750	the accretion of galaxies into groups and clusters	we use the galaxy stellar mass and halo merger tree information from thesemi-analytic model galaxy catalogue of font et al. (2009) to examine theaccretion of galaxies into a large sample of groups and clusters, covering awide range in halo mass (10e12.9 to 10e15.3 msun/h), and selected from each offour redshift epochs (z=0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). we find that clusters at allexamined redshifts have accreted a significant fraction of their final galaxypopulations through galaxy groups. a 10e14.5 msun/h mass cluster at z=0 has, onaverage, accreted ~ 40% of its galaxies (mstellar &gt; 10e9 msun/h) from haloswith masses greater than 10e13 msun/h. further, the galaxies which are accretedthrough groups are more massive, on average, than galaxies accreted throughsmaller halos or from the field population. we find that at a given epoch, thefraction of galaxies accreted from isolated environments is independent of thefinal cluster or group mass. in contrast, we find that observing a cluster ofthe same halo mass at each redshift epoch implies different accretion rates ofisolated galaxies, from 5-6 % per gyr at z=0 to 15% per gyr at z=1.5. we findthat combining the existence of a butcher oemler effect at z=0.5 and theobservations that galaxies within groups display significant environmentaleffects with galaxy accretion histories justifies striking conclusions. namely,that the dominant environmental process must begin to occur in halos of 10e12-- 10e13 msun/h, and act over timescales of &gt; 2 gyrs. this argues in favor of amechanism like "strangulation", in which the hot halo of a galaxy is strippedupon infalling into a more massive halo . this simple model predicts that byz=1.5 galaxy groups and clusters will display little to no environmentaleffects.

0912.0938	implications of the remarkable homogeneity of galaxy groups and clusters	we measure the diversity of galaxy groups and clusters with mass m&gt;1e13/hmsun, in terms of the star formation history of their galaxy populations, forthe purpose of constraining the mass scale at which environmentally-importantprocesses play a role in galaxy evolution. we consider three different groupcatalogues, selected in different ways, with photometry and spectroscopy fromthe sloan digital sky survey. for each system we measure the fraction ofpassively-evolving galaxies within r200 and brighter than either mr=-18 (andwith z&lt;0.05) or mr=-20 (and z&lt;0.1). we use the (u-g) and (r-i) galaxy coloursto distinguish between star-forming and passively-evolving galaxies. byconsidering the binomial distribution expected from the observed number ofmembers in each cluster, we are able to either recover the intrinsic scatter inthis fraction, or put robust 95% confidence upper-limits on its value. theintrinsic standard deviation in the fraction of passive galaxies is consistentwith a small value of &lt;0.1 in most mass bins for all three samples. there is nostrong trend with mass; even groups with m=1e13/h msun are consistent with sucha small, intrinsic distribution. we compare these results with theoreticalmodels of the accretion history to show that, if environment plays a role intransforming galaxies, such effects must occur first at mass scales far belowthat of rich clusters, at most m=1e13 msun.

0912.2356	large-scale structure and dynamics of the most x-ray luminous galaxy  cluster known -- rx j1347-1145	we present photometric, spectroscopic and weak lensing analysis of thelarge-scale structure and dynamics of the most x-ray luminous galaxy clusterknown, rx j1347-1145, at z=0.451. we spectroscopically confirmed 47 new memberswith ldss3 on the magellan telescope. together with previously known members,we measure a new velocity dispersion of 1163(+/-97) km/s. the mass inferredfrom our velocity dispersion is m200 = 1.16^{+0.32}_{-0.27}x10^{15} solar mass,with r200=1.85mpc, under the assumption of a singular isothermal sphere. wealso present a weak lensing analysis using deep cfht data on this cluster, andfind a deprojected mass of 1.47^{+0.46}_{-0.43}x10^{15} solar mass within r200,in excellent agreement with our dynamical estimate. thus, our new dynamicalmass estimate is consistent with that from weak lensing and x-ray studies inthe literature, resolving a previously claimed discrepancy. we photometricallydetect and spectroscopically confirm another massive cluster withsigma=780(+/-100) km/s and m200=3.4^{+1.4}_{-1.1}x10^{14} solar mass ~7mpcsouth-west of rx j1347-1145, which we refer to as rxj1347-sw. our spectroscopicsurvey reveals a possible excess of galaxies in velocity space in the regionbetween rx j1347-1145 and rxj1347-sw; comparing with simulations, this excessappears consistent with that expected from a large filamentary structure tracedby galaxies connecting these two clusters.

0912.3455	constraints on intragroup stellar mass from hostless type ia supernova	we probe the diffuse stellar mass in a sample of 1401 low redshift galaxygroups (10e13 - 10e14 msun/h) by examining the rate of hostless type iasupernova (sne ia) within the groups. we correlate the sample of confirmed sneia from the sdss supernova survey with the positions of our galaxy groups, aswell as with the resolved galaxies within them. we find that 19 of the 59 sneia within the group sample have no detectable host galaxy, with another threeambiguous instances. this gives a robust upper limit that a maximum of 2.69%+1.58%/-1.34% of the group's total mass arises from diffuse stars in theintragroup medium. after correcting for a contribution from "prompt" sneoccurring within galaxies, and including a contribution from those which arisein dwarf galaxies below our photometric limit, we find that only 1.32%+0.78%/-0.70% of the group's total mass is likely in the form of diffusestellar mass. combining this result with the galaxy stellar mass functions ofyang et al., we find that 47% +16%/-15% of the stellar mass in our groups is inthe form of diffuse light, so that stars make up a fraction 0.028 +0.011/-0.010of the total group mass. galaxy groups appear to be very efficient indisrupting stellar mass into a diffuse component; however, stars still make upa small fraction of the group mass, comparable to that seen in rich clusters.this remains a challenge to galaxy formation models.

1002.3170	the redshift one ldss-3 emission line survey (roles) ii: survey method  and z~1 mass-dependent star-formation rate density	motivated by suggestions of 'cosmic downsizing', in which the dominantcontribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (sfrd) proceeds fromhigher to lower mass galaxies with increasing cosmic time, we describe thedesign and implementation of the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey(roles). roles is a k-selected (22.5 &lt; k_ab &lt; 24.0) survey for dwarf galaxies[8.5&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt; 9.5] at 0.89 &lt; z &lt; 1.15 drawn from two extremely deep fields(goods-s and ms1054-fires). using the [oii]3727 emission line, we obtainredshifts and star-formation rates (sfrs) for star-forming galaxies down to alimit of ~0.3 msun/yr. we present the [oii] luminosity function measured inroles and find a faint end slope of alpha_faint ~ -1.5, similar to thatmeasured at z~0.1 in the sdss. by combining roles with higher mass surveys, wemeasure the sfrd as a function of stellar mass using [oii] (with and withoutvarious empirical corrections), and using sed-fitting to obtain the sfr fromthe rest-frame uv luminosity for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. ourbest estimate of the corrected [oii]-sfrd and uv sfrd both independently showthat the sfrd evolves equally for galaxies of all masses between z~1 and z~0.1.the exact evolution in normalisation depends on the indicator used, with the[oii]-based estimate showing a change of a factor of ~2.6 and the uv-based afactor of ~6. we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalisationbetween the indicators, but note that the magnitude of this uncertainty iscomparable to the discrepancy between indicators seen in other z~1 works. ourresult that the shape of the sfrd as a function of stellar mass (and hence themass range of galaxies dominating the sfrd) does not evolve between z~1 andz~0.1 is robust to the choice of indicator.

1002.3172	the local star-formation rate density: assessing calibrations using  [oii], ha and uv luminosities	we explore the use of simple star-formation rate (sfr) indicators (such asmay be used in high-redshift galaxy surveys) in the local universe using [oii],ha, and u-band luminosities from the deeper 275 deg^2 stripe 82 subsample ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) coupled with uv data from the galaxyevolution explorer satellite (galex). we examine the consistency of suchmethods using the star-formation rate density (sfrd) as a function of stellarmass in this local volume, and quantify the accuracy of corrections for dustand metallicity on the various indicators. rest-frame u-band promises to be aparticularly good sfr estimator for high redshift studies since it does notrequire a particularly large or sensitive extinction correction, yet yieldsresults broadly consistent with more observationally expensive methods. wesuggest that the [oii]-derived sfr, commonly used at higher redshifts (z~1),can be used to reliably estimate sfrs for ensembles of galaxies, but for highmass galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10), a larger correction than is typically used isrequired to compensate for the effects of metallicity dependence and dustextinction. we provide a new empirical mass-dependent correction for the[oii]-sfr.

1003.0898	dust accretion and destruction in galaxy groups and clusters	we examine the dust distribution around a sample of 70,000 low redshiftgalaxy groups and clusters derived from the sloan digital sky survey. bycorrelating spectroscopically identified background quasars with the galaxygroups we obtain the relative colour excess due to dust reddening. we present asignificant detection of dust out to a clustercentric distance of 30 mpc/h inall four independent sdss colours, consistent with the expectations of weaklensing masses of similar mass halos and excess galaxy counts. the wavelengthdependence of this colour excess is consistent with the expectations of a milkyway dust law with r_v=3.1. further, we find that the halo mass dependence ofthe dust content is much smaller than would be expected by a simple scaling,implying that the dust-to-gas ratio of the most massive clusters (~10e14msun/h) is ~3% of the local ism value, while in small groups (~10e12.7 msun/h)it is ~55% of the local ism value. we also find that the dust must have acovering fraction on the order of 10% to explain the observed colordifferences, which means the dust is not just confined to the most massivegalaxies. comparing the dust profile with the excess galaxy profile, we findthat the implied dust-to-galaxy ratio falls significantly towards the group orcluster center. this has a significant halo mass dependence, such that the moremassive groups and clusters show a stronger reduction. this suggests thateither dust is destroyed by thermal sputtering of the dust grains by the hot,dense gas or the intrinsic dust production is reduced in these galaxies.

1011.0602	the stellar and hot gas content of low-mass galaxy clusters	we analyse the stellar and hot gas content of 18 nearby, low-mass galaxyclusters, detected in redshift space and selected to have a dynamical mass3e14&lt;m/msun&lt;6e14, as measured from the 2df galaxy redshift survey. we combinex-ray measurements from both chandra and xmm with ground-based near-infraredobservations from ctio, aat and cfht to compare the mass in hot gas and starsto the dynamical mass and state of the clusters. only 13 of the clusters aredetected in x-ray emission, and for these systems we find that a range of 7-20per cent of their baryonic mass, and &lt;3 per cent of their dynamical mass, isdetected in starlight, similar to what is observed in more massive clusters. incontrast, the five undetected clusters are underluminous in x-ray emission, byup to a factor 10, given their stellar mass. although the velocity distributionof cluster members in these systems is indistinguishable from a gaussian, allshow subtle signs of being unrelaxed: either they lack a central, dominantgalaxy, or the bright galaxy distribution is less concentrated and/or moreelongated than the rest of the sample. thus we conclude that low-mass clustersand groups selected from the velocity distribution of their galaxies exhibit adichotomy in their hot gas properties. either they are detected in x-ray, inwhich case they generally lie on the usual scaling relations, or they arecompletely undetected in x-ray emission. the non-detections may be partlyrelated to the apparently young dynamical state of the clusters, but it remainsa distinct possibility that some of these systems are exceptionally devoid ofhot emitting gas as the result of its expulsion or rarefaction.

1011.5509	direct observational evidence for a large transient galaxy population in  groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1	(abridged) we introduce our survey of galaxy groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1, as anextension of the group environment and evolution collaboration (geec). here wepresent the first results, based on gemini gmos-s nod-and-shuffle spectroscopyof seven galaxy groups selected from spectroscopically confirmed, extended xmmdetections in cosmos. in total we have over 100 confirmed group members, andfour of the groups have &gt;15 members. the dynamical mass estimates are in goodagreement with the masses estimated from the x-ray luminosity, with most of thegroups having 13&lt;log(mdyn/msun)&lt;14. our spectroscopic sample is statisticallycomplete for all galaxies with mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun, and for blue galaxies wesample masses as low as mstar=1e8.8 msun. like lower-redshift groups, thesesystems are dominated by red galaxies, at all stellar masses mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun.few group galaxies inhabit the "blue cloud" that dominates the surroundingfield; instead, we find a large and possibly distinct population of galaxieswith intermediate colours. the "green valley" that exists at low redshift isinstead well-populated in these groups, containing ~30 per cent of galaxies.these do not appear to be exceptionally dusty galaxies, and about half showprominent balmer-absorption lines. furthermore, their hst morphologies appearto be intermediate between those of red-sequence and blue-cloud galaxies of thesame stellar mass. we postulate that these are a transient population,migrating from the blue cloud to the red sequence, with a star formation ratethat declines with an exponential timescale 0.6 gyr&lt; tau &lt; 2 gyr. theirprominence among the group galaxy population, and the marked lack of blue,star-forming galaxies, provides evidence that the group environment eitherdirectly reduces star formation in member galaxies, or at least prevents itsrejuvenation during the normal cycle of galaxy evolution.

1012.2388	the dawn of the red: star formation histories of group galaxies over the  past 5 billion years	we examine the star formation properties of group and field galaxies in twosurveys, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss; at z ~ 0.08) and the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec; at z ~ 0.4). using uv imagingfrom the galex space telescope, along with optical and, for geec, near infraredphotometry, we compare the observed spectral energy distributions to largesuites of stellar population synthesis models. this allows us to accuratelydetermine star formation rates and stellar masses. we find that star forminggalaxies of all environments undergo a systematic lowering of their starformation rate between z=0.4 and z=0.08 regardless of mass. nonetheless, thefraction of passive galaxies is higher in groups than the field at bothredshifts. moreover, the difference between the group and field grows with timeand is mass-dependent, in the sense the the difference is larger at low masses.however, the star formation properties of star forming galaxies, as measured bytheir average specific star formation rates, are consistent within the errorsin the group and field environment at fixed redshift. the evolution of passivefraction in groups between z=0.4 and z=0 is consistent with a simple accretionmodel, in which galaxies are environmentally affected 3 gyrs after falling intoa ~ 10e13 msun group. this long timescale appears to be inconsistent with theneed to transform galaxies quickly enough to ensure that star forming galaxiesappear similar in both the group and field, as observed.

1101.3780	a spectroscopic measurement of galaxy formation timescales with roles	we present measurements of the specific star-formation rate (ssfr)-stellarmass relation for star-forming galaxies. our deep spectroscopic samples arebased on the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey, roles, and europeansouthern observatory, eso, public spectroscopy at z=1, and on the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) at z=0.1. these datasets cover an equally deep mass range of8.5&lt;~log(m*/msun)&lt;~11 at both epochs. we find that the ssfr--mass relationevolves in a way which is remarkably independent of stellar mass, as wepreviously found for the star-formation rate density (sfrd)--mass relation. athigher masses, such as those probed by previous surveys, the evolution inssfr--mass is almost independent of stellar mass. at higher masses(log(m*/msun)&gt;10) the shapes of the cumulative cosmic sfrds are very similar atboth z=0.1 and z=1.0, both showing 70% of the total sfrd above a mass oflog(m*/msun)&gt;10. mass functions are constructed for star-forming galaxies andfound to evolve by only &lt;35% between z=1 and z=0.1 over the whole mass range.the evolution is such that the mass function decreases with increasing cosmictime, confirming that galaxies are leaving the star-forming sequence/bluecloud. the observational results are extended to z~2 by adding two recent lymanbreak galaxy samples, and data at these three epochs (z=0.1, 1, 2) are comparedwith the galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. galform predicts anoverall sfr density (sfrd) as a function of stellar mass in reasonableagreement with the observations. the star formation timescales inferred from1/ssfr also give reasonable overall agreement, with the agreement becomingworse at the lowest and highest masses.

0710.0964	ram pressure stripping the hot gaseous halos of galaxies in groups and  clusters	we use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations tostudy the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous halos of galaxies as theyfall into massive groups and clusters. the sensitivity of the results to theorbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. fortypical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ~30% of the initial hotgalactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 gyr. we propose a physicallysimple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulationsremarkably well. the model is analogous to the original formulation of gunn &amp;gott (1972), except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot)gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disk) and takes into accountthat stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic timescale.the model reproduces the results of the simulations to within approximately 10%at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structuralproperties we have explored. the one exception involves unlikely systems wherethe orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10% ofthe group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the modelunder-predicts the stripping following pericentric passage). the proposed modelhas several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressurestripping of both observed and cosmologically-simulated galaxies and as a wayto improve current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. one immediateconsequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies ingroups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with thestandard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.

1201.3676	substructure in the most massive geec groups: field-like populations in  dynamically active groups	the presence of substructure in galaxy groups and clusters is believed to bea sign of recent galaxy accretion and can be used not only to probe theassembly history of these structures, but also the evolution of their membergalaxies. using the dressler-shectman (ds) test, we study substructure in asample of intermediate redshift (z ~ 0.4) galaxy groups from the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec) group catalog. we find that 4 ofthe 15 rich geec groups, with an average velocity dispersion of ~525 km s-1,are identified as having significant substructure. the identified regions oflocalized substructure lie on the group outskirts and in some cases appear tobe infalling. in a comparison of galaxy properties for the members of groupswith and without substructure, we find that the groups with substructure have asignificantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parentcolour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than theoverall group population. in addition, we observe correlations between thedetection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocitydistributions and velocity dispersion profiles. based on this analysis, weconclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and thatthese groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groupswith no detected substructure. these results indicate that the substructuregalaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could beinfalling, do not exhibit signs of environmental effects, since little or nostar-formation quenching is observed in these systems.

0704.3242	line emission in the brightest cluster galaxies of the noao fundamental  plane and sloan digital sky surveys	we examine the optical emission line properties of brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) selected from two large, homogeneous datasets. the first is the x-rayselected national optical astronomy observatory fundamental plane survey(nfps), and the second is the c4 catalogue of optically selected clusters builtfrom the sloan digital sky survey data release ~3 (sdss dr3). our goal is tobetter understand the optical line emission in bcgs with respect to propertiesof the galaxy and the host cluster. throughout the analysis we compare the lineemission of the bcgs to that of a control sample made of the other brightgalaxies near the cluster centre. overall, both the nfps and sdss show a modestfraction of bcgs with emission lines (~15%). no trend in the fraction ofemitting bcgs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion isfound. however we find that, for those bcgs found in cooling flow clusters,71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission. furthermore, if we consider only bcgswithin 50kpc of the x-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-linefraction rises further to 100^{+0}_{-15}%. excluding the cooling flow clusters,only ~10% of bcgs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample ofgalaxies. we show that the physical origin of the emission line activityvaries: in some cases it has liner-like line ratios, whereas in others it is acomposite of star-formation and liner-like activity. we conclude that thepresence of emission lines in bcgs is directly related to the cooling of x-raygas at the cluster centre.

1207.0972	the slowly evolving role of environment in a spectroscopic survey of  star formation in mstar &gt; 5e8 msun galaxies since z=1	we present a deep [oii] emission line survey of faint galaxies (22.5&lt;kab&lt;24)in the chandra deep field south and the fires field. with these data we measurethe star formation rate (sfr) in galaxies in the stellar mass range 8.85 &lt;log(m*/msun) &lt; 9.5 at 0.62&lt;z&lt;0.885, to a limit of sfr = 0.1msun/yr. thepresence of a massive cluster (ms1054-03) in the fires field, and ofsignificant large scale structure in the cdfs field, allows us to study theenvironmental dependence of sfrs amongst this population of low-mass galaxies.comparing our results with more massive galaxies at this epoch, with ourprevious survey (roles) at the higher redshift z=1, and with sdss stripe 82data, we find no significant evolution of the stellar mass function ofstar-forming galaxies between z=0 and z=1, and no evidence that its shapedepends on environment. the correlation between specific star formation rate(ssfr) and stellar mass at z=0.75 has a power-law slope of beta=-0.2, withevidence for a steeper relation at the lowest masses. the normalization of thiscorrelation lies as expected between that corresponding to z=1 and the presentday. the global sfr density is consistent with an evolution of the form (1+z)^2over 0&lt;z&lt;1, with no evidence for a dependence on stellar mass. the ssfr ofthese star-forming galaxies at z=0.75 does not depend upon the density of theirlocal environment. considering just high-density environments, the low-mass endof the ssfr-m* relation in our data is steeper than that in stripe 82 at z=0,and shallower than that measured by roles at z=1. evolution of low-massgalaxies in dense environments appears to be more rapid than in the generalfield.

1208.4849	removal and mixing of the coronal gas from satellites in galaxy groups:  cooling the intragoup gas	the existence of an extended hot gaseous corona surrounding clusters, groupsand massive galaxies is well established by observational evidence andpredicted by current theories of galaxy formation. when a small galaxy collideswith a larger one, their coronae are the first to interact, producingdisturbances that remove gas from the smaller system and settle it into thecorona of the larger one. for a milky-way-size galaxy merging into a low-massgroup, ram pressure stripping and the kelvin-helmholtz instability are the mostrelevant of these disturbances. we argue that the turbulence generated by thelatter mixes the material of both coronae in the wake of the orbiting satellitecreating a "warm phase" mixture with a cooling time a factor of several shorterthan that of the ambient intragroup gas. we reach this conclusion usinganalytic estimates, as well as adiabatic and dissipative high resolutionnumerical simulations of a spherical corona subject to the ablation process ofa constant velocity wind with uniform density and temperature. although this isa preliminary analysis, our results are promising and we speculate that themixture could potentially trigger in situ star formation and/or be accretedinto the central galaxy as a cold gas flow resulting in a new mode of starformation in galaxy groups and clusters.

1210.8407	why does the environmental influence on group and cluster galaxies  extend beyond the virial radius?	in the local universe, galaxies in groups and clusters contain less gas andare less likely to be forming stars than their field counterparts. this effectis not limited to the central group/cluster regions, but is shown by recentobservations to persist out to several virial radii. to gain insight into theextent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite ofhigh-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxiesaround simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log m/m_sun =[13.0, 15.2]). in qualitative agreement with the observations, we find asystematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star formingfraction of galaxies as far out as ~ 5 r200 from the host centre. while asubstantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and arenot infalling for the first time (~ 50 per cent at 2 r200, independent of hostmass) or are affected by `pre-processing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxiesaround groups, increasing to ~ 50 per cent around a massive cluster), even acombination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for theenvironmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content.direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas `halo' surrounding groupsand clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gasatmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ~ 5 r200. we show that this influenceis highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to afactor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies.

1211.3411	quenching star formation in cluster galaxies	in order to understand the processes that quench star formation within richclusters, we construct a library of subhalo orbits drawn from $\lambda$cdmcosmological n-body simulations of four rich clusters. the orbits are combinedwith models of star formation followed by quenching in the cluster environment.these are compared with observed bulge and disc colours and stellar absorptionlinestrength indices of satellite galaxies. models in which the bulge stellarpopulations depend only on the galaxy subhalo mass while the disc quenchingdepends on the cluster environment are acceptable fits to the data. anexponential disc quenching timescale of 3 - 3.5 gyr is preferred. models withshort ($\lesssim 1$ gyr) quenching timescales yield cluster-centric gradientsin disc colours and balmer line indices that are too steep compared toobservations. we also examine models in which there is quenching in lower massgroups prior to cluster infall ("pre-processing"), finding that such models area better fit to the data than models without pre-processing and require similarquenching times. the data slightly prefer models where quenching occurs onlyfor galaxies falling within about 0.5 $r_{200}$. finally, we have examinedmodels with short quenching timescales of 1 gyr, but a long delay time of 3 gyrprior to quenching. all models with short quenching timescales, even such"delayed-then-rapid" quenching models, produce excessively red galaxies nearthe cluster core and are strongly disfavoured by the data. these results implythat the environments of rich clusters must impact star formation rates ofinfalling galaxies on relatively long timescales -- several times longer than atypical halo spends within the virial radius of a cluster. this scenariofavours gentler quenching mechanisms such as slow "strangulation" over morerapid ram-pressure stripping.

1302.2562	efficient satellite quenching at z~1 from the geec2 spectroscopic survey  of galaxy groups	we present deep gmos-s spectroscopy for 11 galaxy groups at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.0, forgalaxies with r_{ab}&lt;24.75. our sample is highly complete (&gt;66%) for eight ofthe eleven groups. using an optical-nir colour-colour diagram, the galaxies inthe sample were separated with a dust insensitive method into three categories:passive (red), star-forming (blue), and intermediate (green). the strongestenvironmental dependence is observed in the fraction of passive galaxies, whichmake up only ~20 per cent of the field in the mass range10^{10.3}&lt;m_{star}/m_\odot&lt;10^{11.0} but are the dominant component of groups.if we assume that the properties of the field are similar to those of the`pre-accreted' population, the environment quenching efficiency (\epsilon_\rho)is defined as the fraction of field galaxies required to be quenched in orderto match the observed red fraction inside groups. the efficiency obtained is~0.4, similar to its value in intermediate-density environments locally. whilegreen (intermediate) galaxies represent ~20 per cent of the star-formingpopulation in both the group and field, at all stellar masses, the average ssfrof the group population is lower by a factor of ~3. the green population doesnot show strong h-delta absorption that is characteristic of starburstgalaxies. finally, the high fraction of passive galaxies in groups, whencombined with satellite accretion models, require that most accreted galaxieshave been affected by their environment. thus, any delay between accretion andthe onset of truncation of star formation (\tau) must be &lt;2 gyr, shorter thanthe 3-7 gyr required to fit data at z=0. the relatively small fraction ofintermediate galaxies requires that the actual quenching process occursquickly, with an exponential decay timescale of \tau_q&lt;1 gyr.

1302.6611	the next generation virgo cluster survey. iv. ngc 4216: a bombarded  spiral in the virgo cluster	we present an investigation into the origins of a series of interlaced narrowfilamentary stellar structures, loops and plumes in the vicinity of the virgocluster, edge-on spiral galaxy, ngc 4216 that were previously identified by theblackbird telescope. using the deeper, higher-resolution and preciselycalibrated optical cfht/megacam images obtained as part of the next generationvirgo cluster survey (ngvs), we confirm the previously identified features andidentify a few additional structures. the ngvs data allowed us to make aphysical study of these low-surface brightness features and investigate theirorigin. the likely progenitors of the structures were identified as eitheralready catalogued vcc dwarfs or newly discovered satellites caught in the actof being destroyed. they have the same g-i color index and likely containsimilar stellar populations. the alignment of three dwarfs along an apparentlysingle stream is intriguing, and we cannot totally exclude that these aresecond-generation dwarf galaxies being born inside the filament from the debrisof an original dwarf. the observed complex structures, including in particulara stream apparently emanating from a satellite of a satellite, point to a highrate of ongoing dwarf destruction/accretion in the region of the virgo clusterwhere ngc 4216 is located. we discuss the age of the interactions and whetherthey occurred in a group that is just falling into the cluster and shows signsof so-called "pre-processing" before it gets affected by the clusterenvironment, or in a group which already ventured towards the central regionsof virgo cluster.

0801.0990	testing cold dark matter with the hierarchical buildup of stellar light	(abridged) we demonstrate that the tenet of hierarchical structure growthleads directly to a robust, falsifiable prediction for the correlation betweenstellar fraction (fstar) and total system mass (m500) of galaxy groups andclusters. this prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonicphysics or cosmological parameters. in particular, if the fstar-m500 relationis fixed and does not evolve with redshift, cdm models predict the logarithmicslope of this relation to be b&gt;-0.3. this constraint can be weakened if thefstar-m500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must beformed in situ in groups at low redshift. conservatively requiring that atleast half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint fromevolution models is b&gt;-0.35. since the most massive clusters (m500=1e15 msun)are observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with m500=5e13 msunmust have fstar&lt;0.03. recent observations by gonzalez et al. (2007) indicate amuch steeper relation, with fstar&gt;0.04 in groups, leading to b=-0.64. ifconfirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today'sclusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from thehigher-redshift progenitors of those groups. we perform a careful analysis ofthese and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties intheir measurements. although correlated uncertainties on stellar and totalmasses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistentwith theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.

0801.1930	tracking down a critical halo mass for killing galaxies through the  growth of the red-sequence	red-sequence galaxies record the history of terminated star-formation in theuniverse and can thus provide important clues to the mechanisms responsible forthis termination. we construct composite samples of published cluster and fieldgalaxy photometry in order to study the build-up of galaxies on thered-sequence, as parameterised by the dwarf-to-giant ratio (dgr). we find thatthe dgr in clusters is higher than that of the field at all redshifts, implyingthat the faint end of the red-sequence was established first in clusters. wefind that the dgr evolves with redshift for both samples, consistent with the``down-sizing'' picture of star formation. we examine the predictions ofsemi-analytic models for the dgr and find that neither the magnitude of itsenvironmental dependence nor its evolution is correctly predicted in themodels. red-sequence dgrs are consistently too high in the models, the mostlikely explanation being that the strangulation mechanism used to remove hotgas from satellite galaxies is too efficient. finally we present a simple toymodel including a threshold mass, below which galaxies are not strangled, andshow that this can predict the observed evolution of the field dgr.

1308.1406	do group dynamics play a role in the evolution of member galaxies?	we examine galaxy groups from the present epoch to z = 1 to explore theimpact of group dynamics on galaxy evolution. we use group catalagues from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss), the group environment and evolutioncollaboration (geec) and the high redshift geec2 sample to study how theobserved member properties depend on galaxy stellar mass, group dynamical massand dynamical state of the host group. we find a strong correlation between thefraction of non-star-forming (quiescent) galaxies and galaxy stellar mass, butdo not detect a significant difference in the quiescent fraction with groupdynamical mass, within our sample halo mass range of 10^13-10^14.5 m_sun, orwith dynamical sate. however, at a redshift of approximately 0.4 we do see someevidence that the quiescent fraction in low mass galaxies (log(m_star/m_sun) &lt;10.5) is lower in groups with substructure. additionally, our results show thatthe fraction of groups with non-gaussian velocity distributions increases withredshift to roughly z = 0.4, while the amount of detected substructure remainsconstant to z = 1. based on these results, we conclude that for massivegalaxies (log(m_star/m_sun_ &gt; 10.5), evolution is most strongly correlated tothe stellar mass of a galaxy with little or no additional effect related toeither the group dynamical mass or dynamical state. for low mass galaxies, wedo see some evidence of a correlation between the quiescent fraction and theamount of detected substructure, highlighting the need to probe further downthe stellar mass function to elucidate the role of the environment in galaxyevolution.

1311.0873	the next generation virgo cluster survey - infrared (ngvs-ir): i. a new  near-uv/optical/near-ir globular cluster selection tool	the ngvs-ir project (next generation virgo survey - infrared) is a contiguousnear-infrared imaging survey of the virgo cluster of galaxies. it complementsthe optical wide-field survey of virgo (ngvs). the current state of ngvs-irconsists of ks-band imaging of 4 deg^2 centered on m87, and j and ks-bandimaging of 16 deg^2 covering the region between m49 and m87. in this paper, wepresent the observations of the central 4 deg^2 centered on virgo's coreregion. the data were acquired with wircam on the canada-france-hawaiitelescope and the total integration time was 41 hours distributed in 34contiguous tiles. a survey-specific strategy was designed to account forextended galaxies while still measuring accurate sky brightness within thesurvey area. the average 5\sigma limiting magnitude is ks=24.4 ab mag and the50% completeness limit is ks=23.75 ab mag for point source detections, whenusing only images with better than 0.7" seeing (median seeing 0.54"). starclusters are marginally resolved in these image stacks, and virgo galaxies with\mu_ks=24.4 ab mag arcsec^-2 are detected. combining the ks data with opticaland ultraviolet data, we build the uik color-color diagram which allows a veryclean color-based selection of globular clusters in virgo. this diagnostic plotwill provide reliable globular cluster candidates for spectroscopic follow-upcampaigns needed to continue the exploration of virgo's photometric andkinematic sub-structures, and will help the design of future searches forglobular clusters in extragalactic systems. equipped with this powerful newtool, future ngvs-ir investigations based on the uik diagram will address themapping and analysis of extended structures and compact stellar systems in andaround virgo galaxies.

1311.5230	the stellar mass function and efficiency of galaxy formation with a  varying initial mass function	several recent observational studies have concluded that the initial massfunction (imf) of stars varies systematically with galaxy properties such asvelocity dispersion. in this paper, we investigate the effect of linking thecircular velocity of galaxies, as determined from the fundamental plane andtully-fisher relations, to the slope of the imf with parameterizations guidedby several of these studies. for each empirical relation, we generate stellarmasses of ~600,000 sdss galaxies at z ~ 0.1, by fitting the optical photometryto large suites of synthetic stellar populations that sample the full range ofgalaxy parameters. we generate stellar mass functions and examine thestellar-to-halo mass relations using sub-halo abundance matching. at themassive end, the stellar mass functions become a power law, instead of thefamiliar exponential decline. as a result, it is a generic feature of thesemodels that the central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation is significantlyflatter at high masses (slope ~ -0.3 to -0.4) than in the case of a universalimf (slope ~ -0.6). we find that regardless of whether the imf variessystematically in all galaxies or just early types, there is still awell-defined peak in the central stellar-to-halo mass ratio at halo masses of ~10e12 solar masses. in general, the imf variations explored here lead tosignificantly higher integrated stellar densities if the assumed dependence oncircular velocity applies to all galaxies, including late-types; in fact themore extreme cases can be ruled out, as they imply an unphysical situation inwhich the stellar fraction exceeds the universal baryon fraction.

1312.4418	star formation and environmental quenching of geec2 group galaxies at  z~1	we present new analysis from the geec2 spectroscopic survey of galaxy groupsat $0.8&lt;z&lt;1$. our previous work revealed an intermediate population between thestar-forming and quiescent sequences and a strong environmental dependence inthe fraction of quiescent galaxies. only $\sim5$ per cent of star-forminggalaxies in both the group and field sample show a significant enhancement instar formation, which suggests that quenching is the primary process in thetransition from the star-forming to the quiescent state. to model theenvironmental quenching scenario, we have tested the use of differentexponential quenching timescales and delays between satellite accretion and theonset of quenching. we find that with no delay, the quenching timescale needsto be long in order to match the observed quiescent fraction, but then thismodel produces too many intermediate galaxies. fixing a delay time of 3 gyr, assuggested from the local universe, produces too few quiescent galaxies. theobserved fractions are best matched with a model that includes a delay that isproportional to the dynamical time and a rapid quenching timescale ($\sim0.25$gyr), but this model also predicts intermediate galaxies h{\delta} strengthhigher than that observed. using stellar synthesis models, we have tested otherscenarios, such as the rejuvenation of star formation in early-type galaxiesand a portion of quenched galaxies possessing residual star formation. ifenvironment quenching plays a role in the geec2 sample, then our work suggeststhat only a fraction of intermediate galaxies may be undergoing this transitionand that quenching occurs quite rapidly in satellite galaxies ($\lesssim0.25$gyr).

0802.2282	mass and redshift dependence of star formation in relaxed galaxy  clusters	we investigate the star-formation properties of dynamically relaxed galaxyclusters as a function of cluster mass for 308 low-redshift clusters drawn fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) c4 cluster catalog. it is important toestablish if cluster star-formation properties have a mass dependence beforecomparing clusters at different epochs, and here we use cluster velocitydispersion as a measure of cluster mass. we find that the total stellar mass,the number of star-forming galaxies, and total star-formation rate scalelinearly with the number of member galaxies, with no residual dependence oncluster velocity dispersion. with the mass-dependence of cluster star-formationrates established, we compare the sdss clusters with a sample of z = 0.75clusters from the literature and find that on average the total h-alphaluminosity of the high-redshift clusters is 10 times greater than that of thelow-redshift clusters. this can be explained by a decline in the h-alphaluminosities of individual cluster galaxies by a factor of up to 10 since z =0.75. the magnitude of this evolution is comparable to that of field galaxiesover a similar redshift interval, and thus the effect of the clusterenvironment on the evolution of star-forming galaxies is at most modest. ourresults suggest that the physical mechanism driving the evolution of clusterstar-formation rates is independent of cluster mass, at least for clusters withvelocity dispersion greater than 450 km/s, and operates over a fairly longtimescale such that the star-formation rates of individual galaxies decline byan order of magnitude over ~7 billion years.

1404.6251	overconsumption, outflows and the quenching of satellite galaxies	the baryon cycle of galaxies is a dynamic process involving the intake,consumption and ejection of vast quantities of gas. in contrast, theconventional picture of satellite galaxies has them methodically turning alarge gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed due toexternal ram pressure. this picture needs revision. our modern understanding ofthe baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of thefresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping eventsoccur, a process we call overconsumption. we compile measurements from theliterature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts todetermine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gasstripping events -- either direct stripping of the disk (ram pressurestripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) -- or frominternally-driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. the observedtimescales show significant deviation from the evolution expected for gasstripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is muchmore efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows quench satellitesbefore orbit-based stripping occurs. given the strong redshift evolution ofstar formation rates, at high redshift (z &gt; 1.5) even moderate outflow rateswill lead to extremely short quenching times with the expectation that suchsatellites will be quenched almost immediately following the cessation ofcosmological inflow, regardless of stripping events. observations of highredshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow ratewith current measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2.5 timesthe star formation rate for galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^{10.5} solarmasses.

1406.4528	the geec2 spectroscopic survey of galaxy groups at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1$	we present the data release of the gemini-south gmos spectroscopy in thefields of 11 galaxy groups at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1$, within the cosmos field. this formsthe basis of the galaxy environment evolution collaboration 2 (geec2) projectto study galaxy evolution in haloes with $m\sim 10^{13}m_\odot$ across cosmictime. the final sample includes $162$ spectroscopically--confirmed members with$r&lt;24.75$, and is $&gt;50$ per cent complete for galaxies within the virialradius, and with stellar mass $m_{\rm star}&gt;10^{10.3}m_\odot$. includinggalaxies with photometric redshifts we have an effective sample size of $\sim400$ galaxies within the virial radii of these groups. we present groupvelocity dispersions, dynamical and stellar masses. combining with the gclasssample of more massive clusters at the same redshift we find the total stellarmass is strongly correlated with the dynamical mass, with$\log{m_{200}}=1.20\left(\log{m_{\rm star}}-12\right)+14.07$. this stellarfraction of $~\sim 1$ per cent is lower than predicted by some halo occupationdistribution models, though the weak dependence on halo mass is in goodagreement. most groups have an easily identifiable most massive galaxy (mmg)near the centre of the galaxy distribution, and we present the spectroscopicproperties and surface brightness fits to these galaxies. the total stellarmass distribution in the groups, excluding the mmg, compares well with an nfwprofile with concentration $4$, for galaxies beyond $\sim 0.2r_{200}$. this ismore concentrated than the number density distribution, demonstrating thatthere is some mass segregation.

1412.2137	evidence for the inside-out growth of the stellar mass distribution in  galaxy clusters since z~1	we study the radial number density and stellar mass density distributions ofsatellite galaxies in a sample of 60 massive clusters at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.26 selectedfrom the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey (meneacs) and the canadian clustercomparison project (cccp). in addition to ~10,000 spectroscopically confirmedmember galaxies, we use deep ugri-band imaging to estimate photometricredshifts and stellar masses, and then statistically subtract fore-, andbackground sources using data from the cosmos survey. we measure the galaxynumber density and stellar mass density distributions in logarithmically spacedbins over 2 orders of magnitude in radial distance from the bcgs. for projecteddistances in the range 0.1&lt;r/r200&lt;2.0, we find that the stellar massdistribution is well-described by an nfw profile with a concentration ofc=2.03+/-0.20. however, at smaller radii we measure a significant excess in thestellar mass in satellite galaxies of about $10^{11}$ msun per cluster,compared to these nfw profiles. we do obtain good fits to generalized nfwprofiles with free inner slopes, and to einasto profiles. to examine howclusters assemble their stellar mass component over cosmic time, we comparethis local sample to the gclass cluster sample at z~1, which represents theapproximate progenitor sample of the low-z clusters. this allows for a directcomparison, which suggests that the central parts (r&lt;0.4 mpc) of the stellarmass distributions of satellites in local galaxy clusters are already in placeat z~1, and contain sufficient excess material for further bcg growth. evolvingtowards z=0, clusters appear to assemble their stellar mass primarily onto theoutskirts, making them grow in an inside-out fashion.

1511.07344	evidence for a change in the dominant satellite galaxy quenching  mechanism at z=1	we present an analysis of galaxies in groups and clusters at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2$,from the gclass and geec2 spectroscopic surveys. we compute a "conversionfraction" $f_{\rm convert}$ that represents the fraction of galaxies that wereprematurely quenched by their environment. for massive galaxies, $m_{\rmstar}&gt;10^{10.3}m_\odot$, we find $f_{\rm convert}\sim 0.4$ in the groups and$\sim 0.6$ in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at $z=0$. thismeans the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final starformation quenching is $t_p\sim 2$ gyr. this is substantially longer than theestimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero onceit starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which littledifferential evolution occurs. in contrast with local observations we findevidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with $t_p$approaching $t_{\rm hubble}$ for $m_{\rm star}\sim 10^{9.5}m_\odot$. the resultsuggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today,but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with asimple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. instead, we find the dataare well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to"overconsumption", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation andexpulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion.dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newlyaccreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at $z=1$.

astro-ph;0004078	the origin of star formation gradients in rich galaxy clusters	we examine the origin of clustercentric gradients in the star formation ratesand colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model whereclusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. the modelassumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation ratesdecline on a timescale of a few gyrs, the typical gas consumption timescale ofdisk galaxies in the field. such behaviour might be expected if tides and rampressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation inspirals over a hubble time. combining these timescales with mass accretionhistories derived from n-body simulations of cluster formation in a lambda-cdmuniverse, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the colordistribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppressionof star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentricradius. the simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxiesbeyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body ofthe cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation inthe outskirts of clusters (and as far out as two virial radii) issystematically suppressed relative to the field. the agreement with the databeyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that strippinghappens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the mainbody of the cluster. we conclude that the star formation rates of clustergalaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion ontomassive virialized systems, and that the cessation of star formation may havetaken place gradually over a few gyrs.

astro-ph;0005485	the spatial and kinematic distributions of cluster galaxies in a lcdm  universe -- comparison with observations	we combine dissipationless n-body simulations and semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation to study the spatial and kinematic distributions of clustergalaxies in a lcdm cosmology. we investigate how the star formation rates,colours and morphologies of galaxies vary as a function of distance from thecluster centre and compare our results with the cnoc1 survey of galaxies from15 x-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.18 to 0.55. in our model,gas no longer cools onto galaxies after they fall into the cluster and theirstar formation rates decline on timescales of 1-2 gyr. galaxies in clustercores have lower star formation rates and redder colours than galaxies in theouter regions because they were accreted earlier. our colour and star formationgradients agree with those those derived from the data. the difference invelocity dispersions between red and blue galaxies observed in the cnoc1clusters is also well reproduced by the model. we assume that the morphologiesof cluster galaxies are determined solely by their merging histories.morphology gradients in clusters arise naturally, with the fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies highest in cluster cores. we compare these gradients withthe cnoc1 data and find excellent agreement for bulge-dominated galaxies. thesimulated clusters contain too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-diskratio, suggesting that additional processes may influence the morphologicalevolution of disk-dominated galaxies in clusters. although the properties ofthe cluster galaxies in our model agree extremely well with the data, the sameis not true of field galaxies. both the star formation rates and the colours ofbright field galaxies appear to evolve much more strongly from redshift 0.2 to0.4 in the cnoc1 field sample than in our simulations.

astro-ph;0103130	the star formation histories of local galaxies: continuous or  intermittent?	we explore a model in which efficient star formation in galaxies is triggeredby merging satellites. we show that the merger/interaction rates predicted byhierarchical galaxy formation models depend strongly on galaxy mass. if amerger of a satellite larger than 1% the mass of the primary triggers efficientstar formation, low-mass dwarf galaxies experience strong bursts separated byquiescent periods lasting several gyr. massive galaxies, such as our own milkyway, are perturbed by a 1% satellite every few hundred million years, and thushave fluctuating, but relatively continuous star formation histories. we studythe spectral signatures of a population of galaxies undergoing intermittentstar formation by combining the models with the latest version of the bruzual &amp;charlot spectral synthesis code. we concentrate on spectral indicators that aresensitive primarily to stellar age, rather than to metallicity and extinction.we show that if a population undergoes intermittent rather than continuous starformation, the signatures of the bursts should be evident from the observeddispersion in the star formation rates, h-delta equivalent widths and gas massfractions of galaxies with 4000 angstrom break strengths indicative of recentor ongoing star formation.

astro-ph;0109022	bubbles, feedback and the intra-cluster medium: three-dimensional  hydrodynamic simulations	we use a three dimensional hydrodynamical code to simulate the effect ofenergy injection on cooling flows in the intracluster medium. specifically, wecompare a simulation of a 10$^{15}$ $m_\odot$ cluster with radiative coolingonly, with a second simulation in which thermal energy is injected 31 $\kpc$off-centre, over 64 kpc$^{3}$ at a rate of $4.9\times 10^{44} \ergs$ for 50myr. the heat injection forms a hot, low density bubble which quickly rises,dragging behind it material from the cluster core. the rising bubble pusheswith it a shell of gas which expands and cools. we find the appearance of thebubble in x-ray temperature and luminosity to be in good qualitative agreementwith recent {\it chandra} observations of cluster cores. toward the end of thesimulation, at 600 myr, the displaced gas begins to fall back toward the core,and the subsequent turbulence is very efficient at mixing the low and highentropy gas. the result is that the cooling flow is disrupted for up to $\sim50$ myr after the injection of energy ceases. thus, this mechanism provides avery efficient method for regulating cooling flows, if the injection eventsoccur with a 1:1 duty cycle.

astro-ph;0109329	physical implications of the x-ray properties of galaxy groups and  clusters	within the standard framework of structure formation, where clusters andgroups of galaxies are built up from the merging of smaller systems, thephysical properties of the intracluster medium, such as the gas temperature andthe total x-ray luminosity, are predicted to possess well defined self-similarscaling relations. observed clusters and groups, however, show strongdeviations from these predicted relations. we argue that these deviations areunlikely to be entirely due to observational biasses; we assume they arephysically based, due to the presence of excess entropy in the intraclustermedium in addition to that generated by accretion shocks during the formationof the cluster. several mechanisms have been suggested as a means of generatingthis entropy. focussing on those mechanisms that preheat the gas before itbecomes a constituent of the virialized cluster environment, we present asimple, intuitive, physically motivated, analytic model that successfullycaptures the important physics associated with the accretion of high entropygas onto group and cluster-scale systems. we use the model to derive the newrelationships between the observable properties of clusters and groups ofgalaxies, as well as the evolution of these relations. these include theluminosity-temperature and luminosity-$\sigma$ relations, as well as thetemperature distribution function and x-ray luminosity function. theseproperties are found to be a more accurate description of the observations thanthose predicted from the standard framework. future observations will thatfurther test the efficacy of the preheated gas scenario are also discussed.

astro-ph;0203189	the cluster gas mass - temperature relation: evidence for a high level  of preheating	recent x-ray observations have been used to demonstrate that the cluster gasmass-temperature relation is steeper than theoretical self-similar predictionsdrawn from numerical simulations that consider the evolution of the cluster gasthrough the effects of gravity and shock heating alone. one possibleexplanation for this is that the gas mass fraction is not constant acrossclusters of different temperature, as is usually assumed. observationally,however, there is no compelling evidence for gas mass fraction variation,especially in the case of hot clusters. seeking an alternative physicalexplanation for the observed trends, we investigate the role in the cluster gasmass - temperature relation of the preheating of the intracluster medium bysome arbitrary source for clusters with emission-weighted mean temperatures ofgreater than about 3 kev. making use of the physically-motivated, analyticmodels developed in 2002 by babul and coworkers, we find that preheating does,indeed, lead to a steeper relation. this is in agreement with previoustheoretical studies on the relation. however, in apparent conflict with thesestudies, we argue that a ``high'' level of entropy injection is required tomatch observations. in particular, an entropy floor of greater than about 300kev cm^2 is required. we also present a new test, namely, the study of therelation within different fixed radii. this allows one to indirectly probe thedensity profiles of clusters, since it samples different fractions of thevirial radius for clusters of different temperature. this test also confirmsthat a high level of preheating is required to match observations.

astro-ph;0205240	modified-entropy models for the intracluster medium	we present a set of cluster models that link the present-day properties ofclusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation. these models treat theentropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamentalproperty. because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient thatrises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster dependentirely on its dark-matter potential and the entropy distribution of itsuncondensed gas. guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropydistribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernovaheating by assuming that the gas-density distribution would be identical tothat of the dark matter. the lowest-entropy gas would then fall below acritical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a hubble time.radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify theentropy of that low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distributionfunction and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. usingsome phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on theexistence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set ofcluster models. the surface-brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, andluminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge fromthese models. by introducing a single adjustable parameter related to theamount of intracluster gas that can cool within a hubble time, we can alsoreproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations ofcooling-flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.

astro-ph;0207360	galaxy properties in low x-ray luminosity clusters at z=0.25	we present the first spectroscopic survey of intrinsically low lx clusters atz&gt;&gt;0, with hst wfpc2 imaging and ground-based spectroscopy. we study 172confirmed cluster members in a sample of ten clusters at z=0.23-0.3, withlx&lt;4.e43 h^{-2} ergs/s. the core of each cluster is imaged with wfpc2 in thef702w filter, and the spectroscopic sample is statistically complete tomr-19.0+5log(h), within an 11' field. the clusters are dynamicallywell-separated from the surrounding field and the velocity dispersions rangefrom ~350-850 km/s. emission line galaxies in these clusters are relativelyrare, comprising only 22 +/- 4% of the sample. there is no evidence that theseemission-line galaxies are dynamically distinct from the majority of thecluster population, though our sample is too small to rule out the ~30%difference that has been observed in more massive clusters. we find elevengalaxies, comprising 6% of the cluster members, which are disk-dominated butshow no sign of emission in their spectrum. most of these are relativelyisolated, spiral galaxies with smooth disks. we find no cluster members with astarburst or post-starburst spectrum. the striking similarity between thespectral and morphological properties of galaxies in these clusters and thoseof galaxies in more massive systems at similar redshifts implies that thephysical processes responsible for truncating star formation in galaxies arenot restricted to the rare, rich cluster environment, but are viable in muchmore common environments. in particular, we conclude that ram pressurestripping or cluster-induced starbursts cannot be solely responsible for thelow star formation rates in these systems.

astro-ph;0302087	cluster sunyaev-zeldovich effect scaling relations	x-ray observations of an "entropy floor" in nearby groups and clusters ofgalaxies offer evidence that important non-gravitational processes, such asradiative cooling and/or "preheating", have strongly influenced the evolutionof the intracluster medium (icm). we examine how the presence of an entropyfloor modifies the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect. a detailed analysisof scaling relations between x-ray and sz effect observables and also betweenthe two primary sz effect observables is presented. we find that relationshipsbetween the central compton parameter and the temperature or mass of a clusterare extremely sensitive to the presence of an entropy floor. the same is truefor correlations between the integrated compton parameter and the x-rayluminosity or the central compton parameter. in fact, if the entropy floor isas high as inferred in recent analyses of x-ray data, a comparison of thesecorrelations with both current and future sz effect observations should show aclear signature of this excess entropy. moreover, because the sz effect isredshift-independent, the relations can potentially be used to track theevolution of the cluster gas and possibly discriminate between the possiblesources of the excess entropy. to facilitate comparisons with observations, weprovide analytic fits to these scaling relations.

astro-ph;0303270	on the relationship between cooling flows and bubbles	a common feature of the x-ray bubbles observed in chandra images of some"cooling flow" clusters is that they appear to be surrounded by bright, coolshells. temperature maps of a few nearby luminous clusters reveal that theshells consist of the coolest gas in the clusters -- much cooler than thesurrounding medium. using simple models, we study the effects of this coolemission on the inferred cooling flow properties of clusters. we find that theintroduction of bubbles into model clusters that do not have cooling flowsresults in temperature and surface brightness profiles that resemble those seenin nearby "cooling flow" clusters. they also approximately reproduce the recentxmm-newton and chandra observations of a high minimum temperature of 1-3 kev.hence, bubbles, if present, must be taken into account when inferring thephysical properties of the icm. in the case of some clusters, bubbles mayaccount entirely for these observed features, calling into question theirdesignation as clusters with cooling flows. however, since not all nearby"cooling flow" clusters show bubble-like features, we suggest that there may bea diverse range of physical phenomena that give rise to the same observedfeatures.

astro-ph;0303451	the sz effect signature of excess entropy in distant, massive clusters	studies of cluster x-ray scaling relations have led to suggestions thatnon-gravitational processes, e.g., radiative cooling and/or "preheating", havesignificantly modified the entropy of the intracluster medium (icm). for thefirst time, we test this hypothesis through a comparison of predicted thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect scaling relations with available data from theliterature. one of the relations that we explore, in principle, depends solelyon sz effect observations, thus offering an x-ray independent probe of the icm.a detailed comparison of the theoretical relations with the largest compilationof high redshift sz effect data to date indicates that the presence of anentropy floor is favored by the data. furthermore, the inferred level of thatfloor, 300 kev cm^2 or higher, is comparable to that found in studies of x-rayscaling relations of nearby massive clusters. thus, we find no evidence forsignificant evolution of the entropy floor out to z = 0.7. we furtherdemonstrate that the high quality data to be obtained from the upcomingsunyaev-zeldovich array (sza) and the (soon-to-be) upgraded owens valley radioobservatory (ovro) array will open powerful new windows into the properties ofthe icm. specifically, the new measurements will allow for accuratemeasurements of the icm entropy for even the most distant galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0304447	on the origin of intracluster entropy	the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium and the shape of itsconfining potential well completely determine the x-ray properties of a relaxedcluster of galaxies, motivating us to explore the origin of intraclusterentropy and to describe how it develops in terms of some simple models. wepresent an analytical model for smooth accretion, including both preheating andradiative cooling, that links a cluster's entropy distribution to its massaccretion history and shows that smooth accretion overproduces the entropyobserved in massive clusters by a factor ~2-3, depending on the mass accretionrate. any inhomogeneity in the accreting gas reduces entropy production at theaccretion shock; thus, smoothing of the gas accreting onto a cluster raises itsentropy level. because smooth accretion produces more entropy than hierarchicalaccretion, we suggest that some of the observed differences between clustersand groups may arise because preheating smooths the smaller-scale lumps of gasaccreting onto groups more effectively than it smooths the larger-scale lumpsaccreting onto clusters. this effect may explain why entropy levels at theoutskirts of groups are ~2-3 times larger than expected from self-similarscaling arguments. the details of how the density distribution of accreting gasaffects the entropy distribution of a cluster are complex, and we suggest howto explore the relevant physics with numerical simulations.

astro-ph;0306342	the difference between clusters and groups: a journey from cluster cores  to their outskirts and beyond	in this review, we take the reader on a journey. we start by looking at theproperties of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters. we have focused on theoverall picture: star formation in clusters is strongly suppressed relative tofield galaxies at the same redshift. we will argue that the increasing activityand blue populations of clusters with redshift results from a greater level ofactivity in field galaxies rather than a change in the transformation imposedby the cluster environment. with this in mind, we travel out from the clusterfocussing firstly on the properties of galaxies in the outskirts of clustersand then on galaxies in isolated groups. at low redshift, we are able toefficiently probe these environments using the sloan and 2df redshift surveys.these allow an accurate comparison of galaxy star formation rates in differentregions. the current results show a strong suppression of star formation abovea critical threshold in local density. the threshold seems similar regardlessof the overall mass of the system. at low redshift at least, only galaxies inclose, isolated pairs have their star formation rate boosted above the globalaverage. at higher redshift, work on constructing homogeneous catalogues ofgalaxies in groups and in the infall regions of clusters is still at an earlystage. in the final section, we draw these strands together, summarising whatwe can deduce about the mechanisms that transform star forming field galaxiesinto their quiescent cluster counter-parts. we discuss what we can learn aboutthe impact of environment on the global star formation history of the universe.

astro-ph;0406266	the bimodal galaxy color distribution: dependence on luminosity and  environment	we analyse the u-r color distribution of 24346 galaxies with mr&lt;=-18 andz&lt;0.08, drawn from the sloan digital sky survey first data release, as afunction of luminosity and environment. the color distribution is well fit withtwo gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue andred population. at fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red)distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant(~3sigma) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14(0.03-0.06) mag with a factor ~100 increase in local density, as characterisedby the surface density of galaxies within a +/-1000 km/s redshift slice. incontrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distributionis a strong function of local density, increasing from ~10-30 per cent of thepopulation in the lowest density environments, to ~70 per cent at the highestdensities. the strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest(-23&lt;mr&lt;-22) and faintest (-19&lt;mr&lt;-18) galaxies in our sample. the fraction ofred galaxies within the virialised regions of clusters shows no significantdependence on velocity dispersion. even at the lowest densities explored, asubstantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. wepropose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that isdetermined primarily by their intrinsic properties, and independent of theirenvironment. any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to redcolors must either occur on a short timescale, or preferentially at highredshift, to preserve the simple gaussian nature of the color distribution. themechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.

astro-ph;0406329	models of the icm with heating and cooling: explaining the global and  structural x-ray properties of clusters	(abridged) theoretical models that include only gravitationally-drivenprocesses fail to match the observed mean x-ray properties of clusters. as aresult, there has recently been increased interest in models in which eitherradiative cooling or entropy injection play a central role in mediating theproperties of the intracluster medium. both sets of models give reasonable fitsto the mean properties of clusters, but cooling only models result in fractionsof cold baryons in excess of observationally established limits and thesimplest entropy injection models do not treat the "cooling core" structurepresent in many clusters and cannot account for entropy profiles revealed byrecent x-ray observations. we consider models that marry radiative cooling withentropy injection, and confront model predictions for the global and structuralproperties of massive clusters with the latest x-ray data. the modelssuccessfully and simultaneously reproduce the observed l-t and l-m relations,yield detailed entropy, surface brightness, and temperature profiles inexcellent agreement with observations, and predict a cooled gas fraction thatis consistent with observational constraints. the model also provides apossible explanation for the significant intrinsic scatter present in the l-tand l-m relations and provides a natural way of distinguishing between clustersclassically identified as "cooling flow" clusters and dynamically relaxed"non-cooling flow" clusters. the former correspond to systems that had onlymild levels (&lt; 300 kev cm^2) of entropy injection, while the latter areidentified as systems that had much higher entropy injection. this is borne outby the entropy profiles derived from chandra and xmm-newton.

astro-ph;0412064	the evolution of [oii] emission from cluster galaxies	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in cluster galaxies.we complement data from the cnoc1 cluster survey (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.6) with measurementsfrom galaxy clusters in the 2df galaxy redshift survey (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1) andmeasurements from recently published work on higher redshift clusters, up toalmost z=1. we focus our attention on galaxies in the cluster core, ie.galaxies with r&lt;0.7h^{-1}_{70}mpc. averaging over clusters in redshift bins, wefind that the fraction of galaxies with strong [oii] emission is &lt; 20% incluster cores, and the fraction evolves little with redshift. in contrast,field galaxies from the survey show a very strong increase over the sameredshift range. it thus appears that the environment in the cores of richclusters is hostile to star formation at all the redshifts studied. we comparethis result with the evolution of the colours of galaxies in cluster cores,first reported by butcher &amp; oemler (1984). using the same galaxies for ouranalysis of the [oii] emission, we confirm that the fraction of blue galaxies,which are defined as galaxies 0.2 mag bluer in the rest frame b-v than the redsequence of each cluster, increases strongly with redshift. since the coloursof galaxies retain a memory of their recent star formation history, whileemission from the [oii] line does not, we suggest that these two results canbest be reconciled if the rate at which the clusters are being assembled ishigher in the past, and the galaxies from which it is being assembled aretypically bluer.

astro-ph;0511768	an analytic investigation of the scatter in the integrated x-ray  properties of galaxy groups and clusters	(abridged) we revisit the scaling relationships between the dark matter massand observed x-ray luminosity and temperature of galaxy clusters and groups inthe local universe. specifically, we compare recent observations with analyticmodels of the intracluster medium in which the gas entropy distribution hasbeen shifted by a variable amount, k0, to investigate the origin of the scatterin these scaling relations, and its influence on the luminosity and temperaturefunctions. we find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch(which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) areinsufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation.instead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately50 kev sq.cm to 700 kev sq.cm, is required to match the data. this range islikely related to the variance in heating and/or cooling efficiency from haloto halo. we demonstrate that these models are consistent with the observedtemperature and luminosity functions of clusters, if scatter in themass-luminosity relation is accounted for. finally, we present predictions forthe redshift evolution of these scaling relations and luminosity/temperaturefunctions. comparison with recent data at z&lt;0.7 shows reasonable agreement witha model that assumes a median entropy floor of k0=200 kev sq.cm. whenobservations are extended to group scales (kt &lt; 1 kev), this evolution willhave the potential to discriminate between an entropy floor that is independentof redshift (for example, in a preheating scenario) and one that depends on thecooling time of the halo.

(0.12 +/- 0.02)(h/0.72)^{-1.5}, wherethe uncertainty reflects the systematic variations between clusters at r500.this is significantly lower than the maximum-likelihood value of the baryonfraction from the recently released wmap 3-year results. we investigatepossible reasons for this discrepancy, including the effects of radiativecooling and non-gravitational heating, and conclude that the most likelysolution is that omega_m is higher than the best-fit wmap value (we findomega_m = 0.36^{+0.11}_{-0.08}), but consistent at the 2-sigma level.degeneracies within the wmap data require that sigma_8 must also be greaterthan the maximum likelihood value for consistency between the data sets.

astro-ph;0701335	modelling shock heating in cluster mergers: i. moving beyond the  spherical accretion model	(abridged) the thermal history of the intracluster medium (icm) is complex.heat input from cluster mergers, agn, and galaxy winds offsets and may evenhalt the cooling of the icm. consequently, the processes that set theproperties of the icm play a key role in determining how galaxies form. in thispaper we focus on the shock heating of the icm during cluster mergers, with theeventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation.  we use a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to track the evolution of the icmin idealised two-body mergers. we find the heating of the icm can be understoodrelatively simply by considering the evolution of the gas entropy during themergers. we examine the processes that generate the entropy in order tounderstand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. we find that: (1)the energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kineticenergy available when the systems first touch. the smaller system penetratesdeep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) for unequal massmergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. theheating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of thefinal system. (3) the bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinctepisodes. the first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock waveis generated that propagates outwards from the centre. this causes the combinedsystem to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. the secondepisode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. thisrevised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physicalunderstanding of cosmological gas simulations.

astro-ph;9906470	differential galaxy evolution in cluster and field galaxies at z=0.3	(abridged) we measure spectral indices for 1823 galaxies in the cnoc1 sampleof fifteen x-ray luminous clusters at 0.18&lt;z&lt;0.55, to investigate themechanisms responsible for differential evolution between the galaxy clusterand field environments. the radial trends of d4000, hdelta and [oii] are allconsistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of starformation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center.throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older meanstellar populations than field galaxies. from the subsample of galaxies moreluminous than m_r=-18.8 + 5log h, we identify a sample of k+a galaxies, whichmay result from recently terminated star formation. corrected for a systematiceffect which results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral indexmeasurements, we estimate that k+a galaxies make up only 1.5 +/- 0.8 % of thecluster sample, and 1.2 +/- 0.8 % of the field. we compare our data withspectrophotometric models and conclude that up to 1.9 +/- 0.8 % of the clusterpopulation may have had its star formation recently truncated without astarburst. however, this is still not significantly greater than the fractionof such galaxies in the field, 3.1 +/- 1.0 %. furthermore, we do not detect anexcess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone a starburst withinthe last 1 gyr. our results imply that these cluster environments are notresponsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxyfraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster--specific phenomenon. wesuggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be agradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disk overfairly long timescales.
