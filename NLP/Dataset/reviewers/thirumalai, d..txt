0901.2891	water-mediated interactions between hydrophobic and ionic species in  cylindrical nanopores	we use metropolis monte carlo and umbrella sampling to calculate the freeenergies of interaction of two methane molecules and their charged derivativesin cylindrical water-filled pores. confinement strongly alters the interactionsbetween the nonpolar solutes, and completely eliminates the solvent separatedminimum (ssm) that is seen in bulk water. the free energy profiles show thatthe methane molecules are either in contact or at separations corresponding tothe diameter and the length of the cylindrical pore. analytic calculations thatestimate the entropy of the solutes, which are solvated at the pore surface,qualitatively explain the shape of the free energy profiles. adding charges ofopposite sign and magnitude $0.4e$ or $e$ (where $e$ is the electronic charge)to the methane molecules decreases their tendency for surface solvation andrestores the ssm. we show that confinement induced ion-pair formation occurswhenever $l_b/d \sim o(1)$, where $l_b$ is the bjerrum length, and $d$ is thepore diameter. the extent of stabilization of the ssm increases with ion chargedensity as long as $l_b/d &lt; 1$. in pores with $d \le 1.2$ nm, in which thewater is strongly layered, increasing the charge magnitude from $0.4e$ to $e$reduces the stability of the ssm. as a result, ion-pair formation which occurswith negligible probability in the bulk, is promoted. in larger diameter poresthat can accomodate a complete hydration layer around the solutes, thestability of the ssm is enhanced.

physics;0609103	hydrophobic and ionic interactions in nano-sized water droplets	we investigate the solvation of methane and methane decorated with charges inspherically confined water droplets. free energy profiles for a single methanemolecule in droplets, ranging in diameter d, from 1 to 4 nm, show that thedroplet surfaces are strongly favorable as compared to the interior. from thetemperature dependence of the free energy in d=3 nm, we show that this effectis entropically driven. the potentials of mean force (pmfs) between two methanemolecules show that the solvent separated minimum in the bulk is completelyabsent in confined water, independent of the droplet size since the soluteparticles are primarily associated with the droplet surface. the tendency ofmethanes with charges (mq+ and mq- with q+ = q- = 0.4e, where e is theelectronic charge) to be pinned at the surface depends dramatically on the sizeof the water droplet. when d=4 nm, the ions prefer the interior whereas for d&lt;4nm the ions are localized at the surface, but with much less tendency than formethanes. increasing the ion charge to e makes the surface stronglyunfavorable. reflecting the charge asymmetry of the water molecule, negativeions have a stronger preference for the surface compared to positive ions ofthe same charge magnitude. with increasing droplet size, the pmfs between mq+and mq- show decreasing influence of the boundary due to the reduced tendencyfor surface solvation. we also show that as the solute charge density decreasesthe surface becomes less unfavorable. the implications of our results for thefolding of proteins in confined spaces are outlined.

q-bio;0310020	thermal denaturation and folding rates of single domain proteins: size  matters	we analyze the dependence of thermal denaturation transition and foldingrates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, n. usinglattice go models we show that deltat/t_f ~ n^-1, where t_f is the foldingtransition temperature and deltat is the folding transition width. this findingis consistent with finite size effects expected for the systems undergoing aphase transition from a disordered to an ordered phase. the dependence of thefolding rates k_f on n for lattice models and the dataset of 57 proteins andpeptides shows that k_f = k_f^0 exp(-cn^beta) provides a good fit, if 0 &lt; beta&lt;= 2/3 and c is a constant. we find that k_f = k_f^0 exp(-1.1n^0.5) with k_f^0=(0.4x10^-6 s)^-1 can estimate optimal protein folding rates to within an orderof magnitude in most cases. by using this fit for a set of proteins withbeta-sheet topology we find that k_f^0 is approximately equal to k_u^0, theprefactor for unfolding rates. the maximum ratio of k_u^0/k_f^0 is 10 for thisclass of proteins.

q-bio;0310023	asymmetry in the shapes of folded and denatured states of proteins	the asymmetry in the shapes of folded and unfolded states are probed usingtwo parameters, one being a measure of the sphericity and the other thatdescribes the shape. for the folded states, whose interiors are densely packed,the radii of gyration (rg) and these two parameters are calculated using thecoordinates of the experimentally determined structures. although rg scales asexpected for maximally compact structures, the distributions of the shapeparameters show that there is considerable asymmetry in the shapes of foldedstructures. the degree of asymmetry is greater for proteins that formoligomers. analysis of the two- and three-body contacts in the nativestructures shows that the presence of near equal number of contacts betweenbackbone and side-chains and between side-chains gives rise to dense packing.we suggest that proteins with relatively large values of shape parameters cantolerate volume mutations without greatly affecting the network of contacts ortheir stability. to probe shape characteristics of denatured states we havedeveloped a model of a ww-like domain. the shape parameters, which arecalculated using langevin simulations, change dramatically in the course ofcoil to globule transition. comparison of the values of shape parametersbetween the globular state and the folded state of ww domain shows that bothenergetic (especially dispersion in the hydrophobic interactions) and stericeffects are important in determining packing in proteins.

q-bio;0405006	proteins associated with diseases show enhanced sequence correlation  between charged residues	function of proteins or a network of interacting proteins often involvescommunication between residues that are well separated in sequence. the classicexample is the participation of distant residues in allosteric regulation.bioinformatic and structural analysis methods have been introduced to inferresidues that are correlated. recently, increasing attention has been paid toobtain the sequence properties that determine the tendency of disease relatedproteins (abeta peptides, prion proteins, transthyretin etc.) to aggregate andform fibrils. motivated in part by the need to identify sequencecharacteristics that indicate a tendency to aggregate, we introduce a generalmethod that probes covariations in charged residues along the sequence in agiven protein family. the method, which involves computing the sequencecorrelation entropy (sce) using the quenched probability psk(i,j) of finding aresidue pair at a given sequence separation sk, allows us to classify proteinfamilies in terms of their sce. our general approach may be a useful way inobtaining evolutionary covariations of amino acid residues on a genome widelevel.

q-bio;0503029	mechanical unfolding of rna hairpins	mechanical unfolding trajectories, generated by applying constant force inoptical tweezer experiments, show that rna hairpins and the p5abc subdomain ofthe group i intron unfold reversibly. we use coarse-grained go-like models forrna hairpins to explore forced-unfolding over a broad range of temperatures. anumber of predictions that are amenable to experimental tests are made. at thecritical force the hairpin jumps between folded and unfolded conformationswithout populating any discernible intermediates. the phase diagram in theforce-temperature (f,t) plane shows that the hairpin unfolds by an all-or-noneprocess. the cooperativity of the unfolding transition increases dramaticallyat low temperatures. free energy of stability, obtained from time averages ofmechanical unfolding trajectories, coincide with ensemble averages whichestablishes ergodicity. the hopping time between the the native basin ofattraction (nba) and the unfolded basin increases dramatically along the phaseboundary. thermal unfolding is stochastic whereas mechanical unfolding occursin "quantized steps" with great variations in the step lengths. refoldingtimes, upon force quench, from stretched states to the nba is "at least anorder of magnitude" greater than folding times by temperature quench. uponforce quench from stretched states the nba is reached in at least three stages.in the initial stages the mean end-to-end distance decreases nearlycontinuously and only in the last stage there is a sudden transition to thenba. because of the generality of the results we propose that similar behaviorshould be observed in force quench refolding of proteins.

q-bio;0601043	forced-unfolding and force-quench refolding of rna hairpins	using coarse-grained model we have explored forced-unfolding of rna hairpinas a function of $f_s$ and the loading rate ($r_f$). the simulations andtheoretical analysis have been done without and with the handles that areexplicitly modeled by semiflexible polymer chains. the mechanisms and timescales for denaturation by temperature jump and mechanical unfolding are vastlydifferent. the directed perturbation of the native state by $f_s$ results in asequential unfolding of the hairpin starting from their ends whereas thermaldenaturation occurs stochastically. from the dependence of the unfolding rateson $r_f$ and $f_s$ we show that the position of the unfolding transition state(ts) is not a constant but moves dramatically as either $r_f$ or $f_s$ ischanged. the ts movements are interpreted by adopting the hammond postulate forforced-unfolding. forced-unfolding simulations of rna, with handles attached tothe two ends, show that the value of the unfolding force increases (especiallyat high pulling speeds) as the length of the handles increases. the pathwaysfor refolding of rna from stretched initial conformation, upon quenching $f_s$to the quench force $f_q$, are highly heterogeneous. the refolding times, uponforce quench, are at least an order of magnitude greater than those obtained bytemperature quench. the long $f_q$-dependent refolding times starting fromfully stretched states are analyzed using a model that accounts for themicroscopic steps in the rate limiting step which involves the trans to gauchetransitions of the dihedral angles in the gaaa tetraloop. the simulations withexplicit molecular model for the handles show that the dynamics of force-quenchrefolding is strongly dependent on the interplay of their contour length andthe persistence length, and the rna persistence length.

q-bio;0609035	size, shape, and flexibility of rna structures	determination of sizes and flexibilities of rna molecules is important inunderstanding the nature of packing in folded structures and in elucidatinginteractions between rna and dna or proteins. using the coordinates of thestructures of rna in the protein data bank we find that the size of the foldedrna structures, measured using the radius of gyration, $r_g$, follows the floryscaling law, namely, $r_g =5.5 n^{1/3}$ \aa where n is the number ofnucleotides. the shape of rna molecules is characterized by the asphericity$\delta$ and the shape $s$ parameters that are computed using the eigenvaluesof the moment of inertia tensor. from the distribution of $\delta$, we findthat a large fraction of folded rna structures are aspherical and thedistribution of $s$ values shows that rna molecules are prolate ($s&gt;0$). theflexibility of folded structures is characterized by the persistence length$l_p$. by fitting the distance distribution function $p(r)$ to the worm-likechain model we extracted the persistence length $l_p$. we find that $l_p\approx1.5 n^{0.33}$ \aa. the dependence of $l_p$ on $n$ implies the average length ofhelices should increases as the size of rna grows. we also analyze packing inthe structures of ribosomes (30s, 50s, and 70s) in terms of $r_g$, $\delta$,$s$, and $l_p$. the 70s and the 50s subunits are more spherical compared tomost rna molecules. the globularity in 50s is due to the presence of anunusually large number (compared to 30s subunit) of small helices that arestitched together by bulges and loops. comparison of the shapes of the intact70s ribosome and the constituent particles suggests that folding of theindividual molecules might occur prior to assembly.

q-bio;0612039	effect of finite size on cooperativity and rates of protein folding	we analyze the dependence of cooperativity of the thermal denaturationtransition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acidresidues, $n$, using lattice models with side chains,off-lattice go models andthe available experimental data. a dimensionless measure of cooperativity,$\omega_c$ ($0 &lt; \omega_c &lt; \infty$), scales as $\omega_c \sim n^{\zeta}$. theresults of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirmthe earlier prediction that $\zeta$ is universal with $\zeta = 1 +\gamma$,where exponent $\gamma$ characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoidingwalk. this finding suggests that the structural characteristics in thedenaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transitiontemperature. the folding rates $k_f$ for the go models and a dataset of 69proteins can be fit using $k_f = k_f^0 \exp(-cn^\beta)$. both $\beta = 1/2$ and2/3 provide a good fit of the data. we find that $k_f = k_f^0\exp(-cn^{{1/2}})$, with the average (over the dataset of proteins) $k_f^0\approx (0.2\mu s)^{-1}$ and $c \approx 1.1$, can be used to estimate foldingrates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. the minimal models giveidentical $n$ dependence with $c \approx 1$. the prefactor for off-lattice gomodels is nearly four orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value.

0911.3530	refolding dynamics of stretched biopolymers upon force quench	single molecule force spectroscopy methods can be used to generate foldingtrajectories of biopolymers from arbitrary regions of the folding landscape. weillustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics and generic aspects of thecollapse of rna and proteins upon force quench, using simulations of an rnahairpin and theory based on the de gennes model for homopolymer collapse. thefolding time, $\tau_f$, depends asymmetrically on $\delta f_s = f_s - f_m$ and$\delta f_q = f_m - f_q$ where $f_s$ ($f_q$) is the stretch (quench) force, and$f_m$ is the transition mid-force of the rna hairpin. in accord withexperiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension, $r(t)$, occursin three stages: a rapid initial decrease in the extension is followed by aplateau, and finally an abrupt reduction in $r(t)$ that occurs as the nativestate is approached.  the duration of the plateau increases as $\lambda =\tau_q/\tau_f$ decreases(where $\tau_q$ is the time in which the force is reduced from $f_s$ to $f_q$).variations in the mechanisms of force quench relaxation as $\lambda$ is alteredare reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy, which iscomputed directly from the folding trajectories. an analytical solution of thede gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage stage kinetics in$r(t)$. the prediction that the initial stages of collapse should also be ageneric feature of polymers is validated by simulation of the kinetics oftoroid (globule) formation in semiflexible (flexible) homopolymers in poorsolvents upon quenching the force from a fully stretched state. our findingsgive a unified explanation for multiple disparate experimental observations ofprotein folding.

0708.2077	kinetics of loop formation in polymer chains	we investigate the kinetics of loop formation in flexible ideal polymerchains (rouse model), and polymers in good and poor solvents. we show for therouse model, using a modification of the theory of szabo, schulten, andschulten, that the time scale for cyclization is $\tau_c\sim \tau_0 n^2$ (where$\tau_0$ is a microscopic time scale and $n$ is the number of monomers),provided the coupling between the relaxation dynamics of the end-to-end vectorand the looping dynamics is taken into account. the resulting analyticexpression fits the simulation results accurately when $a$, the capture radiusfor contact formation, exceeds $b$, the average distance between two connectedbeads. simulations also show that, when $a &lt; b$, $\tau_c\sim n^{\alpha_\tau}$,where $1.5&lt;{\alpha_\tau}\le 2$ in the range $7&lt;n&lt;200$ used in the simulations.by using a diffusion coefficient that is dependent on the length scales $a$ and$b$ (with $a&lt;b$), which captures the two-stage mechanism by which loopingoccurs when $a &lt; b$, we obtain an analytic expression for $\tau_c$ that fitsthe simulation results well. the kinetics of contact formation between the endsof the chain are profoundly affected when interactions between monomers aretaken into account. remarkably, for $n &lt; 100$ the values of $\tau_c$ decreaseby more than two orders of magnitude when the solvent quality changes from goodto poor. fits of the simulation data for $\tau_c$ to a power law in $n$($\tau_c\sim n^{\alpha_\tau}$) show that $\alpha_\tau$ varies from about 2.4 ina good solvent to about 1.0 in poor solvents. loop formation in poor solvents,in which the polymer adopts dense, compact globular conformations, occurs by areptation-like mechanism of the ends of the chain.

1007.3029	theoretical perspectives on protein folding	understanding how monomeric proteins fold under in vitro conditions iscrucial to describing their functions in the cellular context. significantadvances both in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual frameworkfor describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. the experimentaldata and theoretical methods have revealed the multifaceted character ofproteins. proteins exhibit universal features that can be determined using onlythe number of amino acid residues (n) and polymer concepts. the sizes ofproteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the foldingtransition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, andtime scales of folding are to a large extent determined by n. the consequencesof finite n especially on how individual residues order upon folding depends onthe topology of the folded states. such intricate details can be predictedusing the molecular transfer model that combines simulations with measuredtransfer free energies of protein building blocks from water to the desiredconcentration of the denaturant. by watching one molecule fold at a time, usingsingle molecule methods, the validity of the theoretically anticipatedheterogeneity in the folding routes, and the n-dependent time scales for thethree stages in the approach to the native state have been established. despitethe successes of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, weconclude that much remains to be done to solve the "protein folding problem" inthe broadest sense.

1103.1908	polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte effects in synthetic and biological  macromolecules	the nature of electrostatic interactions involving polyanions modulate theproperties of both synthetic and biological macromolecules. although intenselystudied for decades the interplay of many length scales has prevented acomplete resolution of some of the basic questions such as how theelectrostatic persistence length ($l_e$) varies with ionic strength ($i$). inthis review we describe certain characteristics of polyelectrolytes (pas) andpolyampholytes (pas), which are polymers whose monomers have a randomdistribution of opposite charges. after reviewing the current theoreticalunderstanding of the dependence of $l_e$ on $i$ we present experimental datathat conform to two distinct behavior. for rna and dna it is found that that$l_e \sim i^{-1}$ whereas for some proteins and other polyelectrolytes $l_e\sim i^{-1/2}$. a scaling type theory, which delineates charge correlation andpure polyelectrolyte effects for the shape of pas that is valid over a widerange of salt concentration is described. we also use theory and simulations toargue that the distinct stages in the kinetics of collapse of pas (with a netcharge that is small enough to induce globule formation) and pes (relevant forrna folding) are similar. in both cases the major initial conformation changeinvolves formation of metastable pearl-necklace structures. in the coarseningprocess large clusters (pearls) grow at the expense of smaller ones by aprocess that is reminiscent of lifshitz-slyozov mechanism. finally, recenttheories and single molecule experiments on stretching of single stranded dnaand pes further sheds insights into the complex behavior of chargedmacromolecules. the survey, which is limited to very few topics, shows theimportance of polyelectrolyte effects in a wide range of disciplines.

1107.4820	role of water in protein aggregation and amyloid polymorphism	a variety of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the formation ofamyloid plaques. our incomplete understanding of this process underscores theneed to decipher the principles governing protein aggregation. mostexperimental and simulation studies have been interpreted largely from theperspective of proteins: the role of solvent has been relatively overlooked.  in this account, we provide a perspective on how interactions with wateraffect folding landscapes of a$\beta$ monomers, a$\beta_{16-22}$ oligomerformation, and protofilament formation in a sup35 peptide. simulations showthat the formation of aggregation-prone structures (n$^*$) similar to thestructure in the fibril requires overcoming high desolvation barrier. themechanism of protofilament formation in a polar sup35 peptide fragmentillustrates that water dramatically slows down self-assembly. release of watertrapped in the pores as water wires creates protofilament with a dry interface.similarly, one of the main driving force for addition of a solvated monomer toa preformed fibril is the entropy gain of released water.  we conclude by postulating that two-step model for protein crystallizationmust also hold for higher order amyloid structure formation starting fromn$^*$. multiple n$^*$ structures with varying water content results in a numberof distinct water-laden polymorphic structures. in predominantly hydrophobicsequences, water accelerates fibril formation. in contrast, water-stabilizedmetastable intermediates dramatically slow down fibril growth rates inhydrophilic sequences.

1211.0662	hidden complexity in the isomerization dynamics of holliday junctions	a plausible consequence of rugged energy landscapes of biomolecules is thatfunctionally competent folded states may not be unique, as is generallyassumed. indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the dynamics of enzymes andribozymes under folding conditions have recently been identified in singlemolecule experiments. however, systematic quantification and the structuralorigin of the observed complex behavior remain elusive. even for a relativelysimple case of isomerization dynamics in holliday junctions (hjs), molecularheterogeneities persist over a long observation time (tobs ~ 40 sec). here,using concepts in glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, weprovide a quantitative method to analyze the smfret data probing theisomerization in hj dynamics. we show that ergodicity of hj dynamics iseffectively broken; as a result, the conformational space of hjs is partitionedinto a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. whileisomerization dynamics in each cluster occurs rapidly as if the associatedconformational space is fully sampled, distinct patterns of time seriesbelonging to different clusters do not interconvert on tobs. theory suggeststhat persistent heterogeneity of hj dynamics is a consequence of internalmultiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by mg2+ ions. anannealing experiment using mg2+ pulse that changes the mg2+ cocentration fromhigh to low to high values lends support to this idea by explicitly showingthat interconversions can be driven among trajectories with different patterns.

1211.2793	exact solution of the zwanzig-lauritzen model of polymer crystallization  under tension	we solve a two dimensional model for polymer chain folding in the presence ofmechanical pulling force ($f$) exactly using equilibrium statistical mechanics.using analytically derived expression for the partition function we determinethe phase diagram for the model in the $f$-temperature ($t$) plane. a squareroot singularity in the susceptibility indicates a second order phasetransition from a folded to an unfolded state at a critical force ($f_c$) inthe thermodynamic limit of infinitely long polymer chain. surprisingly, thetemperature dependence of $f_c$ shows a reentrant phase transition, which isreflected in an increase in $f_c$ as $t$ increases below a threshold value. fora range of $f$ values, the unfolded state is stable at both low and hightemperatures. the high temperature unfolded state is stabilized by entropywhereas the low temperature unfolded state is dominated by favorable energy.the exact calculation could serve as a bench mark for testing approximatetheories that are used in analyzing single molecule pulling experiments.

1212.6284	manifestation of random first order transition theory in wigner glasses	we use brownian dynamics simulations of a binary mixture of highly chargedspherical colloidal particles to illustrate many of the implications of therandom first order transition (rfot) theory (pra 40 1045 (1989)), which is theonly theory that provides a unified description of both the statics anddynamics of the liquid to glass transition. in accord with the rfot, we findthat as the volume fraction of the colloidal particles \f, the natural variablethat controls glass formation in colloidal systems, approaches \f_a there is aneffective ergodic to non-ergodic dynamical transition, which is signalled by adramatic slowing down of diffusion. in addition, using the energy metric weshow that the system becomes non-ergodic as \f_a is approached. the time t^*,at which the four-point dynamical susceptibility achieves a maximum, alsodiverges near \f_a. remarkably, three independent measures(translationaldiffusion coefficients, ergodic diffusion coefficients,as well t^*) all signalthat at \f_a=0.1 ergodicity is effectively broken. the translation diffusionconstant, the ergodic diffusion constant, and (t^*)^-1 all vanish as(\f_a-\f)^g with both \f_a and g being the roughly the same for all threequantities. below \f_a transport involves crossing suitable free energybarriers. in this regime, the density-density correlation function decays as astretched exponential exp(-t/tau_a)^b with b=0.45. the \f-dependence of therelaxation time \tau_a is well fit using the vft law with the ideal glasstransition occurring at \f_k=0.47. by using an approximate measure of the localentropy (s_3) we show that below \f_a the law of large numbers, which statesthat the distribution of s_3 for a large subsample should be identical to thewhole sample, is not obeyed. the comprehensive analyses provided here forwigner glass forming charged colloidal suspensions fully validate the conceptsof the rfot.

1303.6231	from mechanical folding trajectories to intrinsic energy landscapes of  biopolymers	in single molecule laser optical tweezer (lot) pulling experiments a proteinor rna is juxtaposed between dna handles that are attached to beads in opticaltraps. the lot generates folding trajectories under force in terms oftime-dependent changes in the distance between the beads. how to construct thefull intrinsic folding landscape (without the handles and the beads) from themeasured time series is a major unsolved problem. by using rigorous theoreticalmethods---which account for fluctuations of the dna handles, rotation of theoptical beads, variations in applied tension due to finite trap stiffness, aswell as environmental noise and the limited bandwidth of the apparatus---weprovide a tractable method to derive intrinsic free energy profiles. wevalidate the method by showing that the exactly calculable intrinsic freeenergy profile for a generalized rouse model, which mimics the two-statebehavior in nucleic acid hairpins, can be accurately extracted from simulatedtime series in a lot setup regardless of the stiffness of the handles. we nextapply the approach to trajectories from coarse grained lot molecularsimulations of a coiled-coil protein based on the gcn4 leucine zipper, andobtain a free energy landscape that is in quantitative agreement withsimulations performed without the beads and handles. finally, we extract theintrinsic free energy landscape from experimental lot measurements for theleucine zipper, which is independent of the trap parameters.

1304.4216	a coarse-grained model for predicting rna folding thermodynamics	we present a thermodynamically robust coarse-grained model to simulatefolding of rna in monovalent salt solutions. the model includes stacking,hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions as fundamental components indescribing the stability of rna structures. the stacking interactions areparametrized using a set of nucleotide-specific parameters, which werecalibrated against the thermodynamic measurements for single-base stacks andbase-pair stacks. all hydrogen bonds are assumed to have the same strength,regardless of their context in the rna structure. the ionic buffer is modeledimplicitly, using the concept of counterion condensation and the debye-h\"uckeltheory. the three adjustable parameters in the model were determined by fittingthe experimental data for two rna hairpins and a pseudoknot. a single set ofparameters provides good agreement with thermodynamic data for the three rnamolecules over a wide range of temperatures and salt concentrations. in theprocess of calibrating the model, we establish the extent of counterioncondensation onto the single-stranded rna backbone. the reduced backbone chargeis independent of the ionic strength and is 60% of the rna bare charge at 37degrees celsius. our model can be used to predict the folding thermodynamicsfor any rna molecule in the presence of monovalent ions.

1306.3850	generalized iterative annealing model for the action of rna chaperones	as a consequence of the rugged landscape of rna molecules their folding isdescribed by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a smallfraction ($\phi_f$) reaches the folded state while the remaining fraction ofmolecules is kinetically trapped in misfolded intermediates. the transitionfrom the misfolded states to the native state can far exceed biologicallyrelevant time. thus, rna folding in vivo is often aided by protein cofactors,called rna chaperones, that can rescue rnas from a multitude of misfoldedstructures. we consider two models, based on chemical kinetics and chemicalmaster equation, for describing assisted folding. in the passive model,applicable for class i substrates, transient interactions of misfoldedstructures with rna chaperones alone are sufficient to destabilize themisfolded structures, thus entropically lowering the barrier to folding. forthis mechanism to be efficient the intermediate ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complexbetween collapsed rna and protein cofactor should have optimal stability. wealso introduce an active model (suitable for stringent substrates with small$\phi_f$), which accounts for the recent experimental findings on the action ofcyt-19 on the group i intron ribozyme, showing that rna chaperones does notdiscriminate between the misfolded and the native states. in the active model,the rna chaperone system utilizes chemical energy of atp hydrolysis torepeatedly bind and release misfolded and folded rnas, resulting in substantialincrease of yield of the native state. the theory outlined here shows, inaccord with experiments, that in the steady state the native state does notform with unit probability.

1306.4402	force-induced unzipping transitions in an athermal crowded environment	using theoretical arguments and extensive monte carlo (mc) simulations of acoarse-grained three-dimensional off-lattice model of a \beta-hairpin, wedemonstrate that the equilibrium critical force, $f_c$, needed to unfold thebiopolymer increases non-linearly with increasing volume fraction occupied bythe spherical macromolecular crowding agent. both scaling arguments and mcsimulations show that the critical force increases as $f_c \approx\varphi_c^{\alpha}$. the exponent $\alpha$ is linked to the flory exponentrelating the size of the unfolded state of the biopolymer and the number ofamino acids. the predicted power law dependence is confirmed in simulations ofthe dependence of the isothermal extensibility and the fraction of nativecontacts on $\varphi_c$. we also show using mc simulations that $f_c$ islinearly dependent on the average osmotic pressure ($\mathrm{p}$) exerted bythe crowding agents on the \beta-hairpin. the highly significant linearcorrelation coefficient of 0.99657 between $f_c$ and $\mathrm{p}$ makes itstraightforward to predict the dependence of the critical force on the densityof crowders. our predictions are amenable to experimental verification usinglaser optical tweezers.

1307.5468	urea-induced denaturation of preq1-riboswitch	urea, a polar molecule with a large dipole moment, not only destabilizes thefolded rna structures, but can also enhance the folding rates of largeribozymes. unlike the mechanism of urea-induced unfolding of proteins, which iswell understood, the action of urea on rna has barely been explored. weperformed extensive all atom molecular dynamics (md) simulations to determinethe molecular underpinnings of urea-induced rna denaturation. urea displays itsdenaturing power in both secondary and tertiary motifs of the riboswitch (rs)structure. our simulations reveal that the denaturation of rna structures ismainly driven by the hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions of urea with thebases. through detailed studies of the simulation trajectories, we found thatgeminate pairs between urea and bases due to hydrogen bonds and stacks persistonly ~ (0.1-1) ns, which suggests that urea-base interaction is highly dynamic.most importantly, the early stage of base pair disruption is triggered bypenetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic domain between the rnabases. the infiltration of water into the narrow space between base pairs iscritical in increasing the accessibility of urea to transiently disruptedbases, thus allowing urea to displace inter base hydrogen bonds. thismechanism, water-induced disruption of base-pairs resulting in the formation ofa "wet" destabilized rna followed by solvation by urea, is the exact oppositeof the two-stage denaturation of proteins by urea. in the latter case, initialurea penetration creates a dry-globule, which is subsequently solvated by waterpenetration leading to global protein unfolding. our work shows that theability to interact with both water and polar, non-polar components ofnucleotides makes urea a powerful chemical denaturant for nucleic acids.

1312.0075	sequence-dependent folding landscapes of adenine riboswitch aptamers	prediction of the functions of riboswitches requires a quantitativedescription of the folding landscape so that the barriers and time scales forthe conformational change in the switching region in the aptamer can beestimated. using a combination of all atom molecular dynamics andcoarse-grained model simulations we studied the response of adenine (a) bindingadd and pbue a-riboswitches to mechanical force. the two riboswitches contain astructurally similar three-way junction formed by three paired helices, p1, p2,and p3, but carry out different functions. using pulling simulations, withstructures generated in md simulations, we show that after p1 rips the dominantunfolding pathway in add a-riboswitch is the rupture of p2 followed byunraveling of p3. in the pbue a-riboswitch, after p1 unfolds p3 ruptures aheadof p2. the order of unfolding of the helices, which is in accord with singlemolecule pulling experiments, is determined by the relative stabilities of theindividual helices. our results show that the stability of isolated helicesdetermines the order of assembly and response to force in these non-codingregions. we use the simulated free energy profile for pbue a-riboswitch toestimate the time scale for allosteric switching, which shows that thisriboswitch is under kinetic control lending additional support to theconclusion based on single molecule pulling experiments. a consequence of thestability hypothesis is that a single point mutation (u28c) in the p2 helix ofthe add a-riboswitch, which increases the stability of p2, would make thefolding landscapes of the two riboswitches similar. this prediction can betested in single molecule pulling experiments.

1401.2024	universal aspects of the random first order phase transition theory of  the structural glass transition	we analyze the ways in which the random first order phase transition (rfot)of the glass transition differs from the well-studied regular first order andsecond order (or continuous) phase transitions. just as is the case in thelatter two classes of phase transitions, the rfot also exhibits universalfeatures. here, we discuss these features and compare and contrast the rfotwith other types of transitions with an emphasis on the structural glasstransition problem. an important feature of the complete rfot theory is that ithas at least two distinct transition temperatures, one of which is a dynamical(avoided) transition signaling loss of effective ergodicity, and the other isan equilibrium ideal glass transition. particular attention is paid to thecoherence, or correlation, length associated with these transitions in therfot. we also derive universal scaling relations for several experimentallymeasurable quantities that are valid near the ideal glass transition. inparticular, activated scaling ideas are used to obtain a scaling equation forthe non-linear structural glass susceptibility as the ideal glass transition isapproached. important finite corrections to the ideal glass transitiontemperature are also discussed. our work provides additional criteria forassessing the validity of rfot theory of the liquid to glass transition, andprovides a firm theoretical foundation for analyzing experimental data on thetemperature dependence of the relaxation times.

1402.6030	development and applications of coarse grained models for rna	in contrast to proteins much less attention has been focused on developmentof computational models for describing rna molecules, which are beingrecognized as playing key roles in many cellular functions. current atomicallydetailed force fields are not accurate enough to capture the properties of evensimple nucleic acid constructs. in this article, we review our efforts todevelop coarse-grained (cg) models that capture the underlying physics for theparticular length scale of interest. two models are discussed. one of them isthe three interaction site (tis) model in which each nucleotide is representedby three beads corresponding to sugar, phosphate, and base. the other is theself-organized polymer (sop) model in which each nucleotide is represented as asingle interaction center. applications of the tis model to study thecomplexity of hairpin formation and the effects of crowding in shiftingequilibrium between two conformations in human telomerase pseudoknot aredescribed. the work on crowding illustrates a direct link to the activity oftelomerase. we use the sop model to describe the response of {\it tetrahymena}ribozyme to force. the simulated unfolding pathways agree well with singlemolecule pulling experiments. we also review predictions for the unfoldingpathways for {\it azoarcus} ribozyme. the success of the cg applications todescribe dynamics in rna gives hope that more complex processes involvingrna-protein interactions can be tackled using variants of the proposed models.

1404.6164	dynamical transition and heterogeneous hydration dynamics in rna	enhanced dynamical fluctuations of rnas, facilitated by a network of watermolecules with strong interactions with rna, are suspected to be critical intheir ability to respond to a variety of cellular signals. using atomicallydetailed molecular dynamics simulations at various temperatures of purine(adenine)- and preq$_1$ sensing riboswitch aptamers, we show that watermolecules in the vicinity of rnas undergo complex dynamics depending on thelocal structures of the rnas. the overall lifetimes of hydrogen bonds (hbs) ofsurface bound waters are more than at least 1-2 orders of magnitude longer thanbulk water. slow hydration dynamics, revealed in non-arrhenius behavior of therelaxation time, arises from high activation barriers to break water hydrogenbonds with a nucleotide and by reduced diffusion of water. the relaxationkinetics at specific locations in the two rnas show a broad spectrum of timescales reminiscent of glass-like behavior, suggesting that the hydrationdynamics is highly heterogeneous. both rnas undergo dynamic transition at $t =t_d \gtrsim 200$ k as assessed by the mean square fluctuation of hydrogen atoms$\langle x^2\rangle$, which undergoes an abrupt harmonic-to-anharmonictransition at $t_d$. the near universal value of $t_d$ found for these rnas andpreviously for trna is strongly correlated with changes in hydration dynamicsas $t$ is altered. hierarchical dynamics of waters associated with the rnasurface, revealed in the motions of distinct classes of water withwell-separated time scales, reflects the heterogeneous local environment on themolecular surface of rna. at low temperatures slow water dynamics predominatesover structural transitions. our study demonstrates that the complex interplayof dynamics between water and local environment in the rna structures could bea key determinant of the functional activities of rna.

1406.3376	plasticity of hydrogen bond networks regulates mechanochemistry of cell  adhesion complexes	mechanical forces acting on cell adhesion receptor proteins regulate a rangeof cellular functions by formation and rupture of non-covalent interactionswith ligands. typically, force decreases the lifetimes of intact complexes(slip-bonds), making the discovery that these lifetimes can also be prolonged("catch-bonds"), a surprise. we created a microscopic analytic theory byincorporating the structures of selectin and integrin receptors into aconceptual framework based on the theory of stochastic equations, whichquantitatively explains a wide range of experimental data (includingcatch-bonds at low forces and slip-bonds at high forces). catch-bonds arise dueto force-induced remodeling of hydrogen bond networks, a finding that alsoaccounts for unbinding in structurally unrelated integrin-fibronectin andactomyosin complexes. for the selectin family, remodeling of hydrogen bondnetworks drives an allosteric transition resulting in the formation of maximumnumber of hydrogen bonds determined only by the structure of the receptor andis independent of the ligand. a similar transition allows us to predict theincrease in number of hydrogen bonds in a particular allosteric state of$\alpha_5 \beta_1$ integrin-fibronectin complex, a conformation which is yet tobe crystallized. we also make a testable prediction that a single pointmutation (tyr51phe) in the ligand associated with selectin should dramaticallyalter the nature of the catch-bond compared to the wild type. our work suggeststhat nature utilizes a ductile network of hydrogen bonds to engineer functionover a broad range of forces.

1501.03448	extracting folding landscape characteristics of biomolecules using  mechanical forces	in recent years single molecule force spectroscopy has opened a new avenue toprovide profiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. in thisfield, quantitative analyses of the data employing sound theoretical models,have played a major role in interpreting data and anticipating outcomes ofexperiments. here, we explain how by using temperature as a variable inmechanical unfolding of biomolecules in force spectroscopy, the roughness ofthe energy landscape can be measured without making any assumptions about theunderlying reaction coordinate. estimates of other aspects of the energylandscape such as free energy barriers or the transition state (ts) locationscould depend on the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. weillustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state locationfrom loading rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. because the transitionstate moves as the force or the loading rate is varied, which is reminiscent ofthe hammond effect, it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data.the independence of the ts location on force holds good only for brittle orhard biomolecules whereas the ts location changes considerably if the moleculeis soft or plastic. finally, we discuss the goodness of the end-to-end distance(or pulling) coordinate of the molecule as a surrogate reaction coordinate in asituation like force-induced ligand-unbinding from a gated molecular receptoras well as force-quench refolding of an rna hairpin.

1512.08470	force-dependent switch in protein unfolding pathways and transition  state movements	although known that single domain proteins fold and unfold by parallelpathways, demonstration of this expectation has been difficult to establish inexperiments. unfolding rate, $k_\mathrm{u}(f)$, as a function of force $f$,obtained in single molecule pulling experiments on src sh3 domain, exhibitsupward curvature on a $\log k_\mathrm{u}(f)$ plot. similar observations werereported for other proteins for the unfolding rate $k_\mathrm{u}([c])$. thesefindings imply unfolding in these single domain proteins involves a switch inthe pathway as $f$ or $[c]$ is increased from a low to a high value. we providea unified theory demonstrating that if $\log k_\mathrm{u}$ as a function of aperturbation ($f$ or $[c]$) exhibits upward curvature then the underlyingenergy landscape must be strongly multidimensional. using molecular simulationswe provide a structural basis for the switch in the pathways and dramaticshifts in the transition state ensemble (tse) in src sh3 domain as $f$ isincreased. we show that a single point mutation shifts the upward curvature in$\log k_\mathrm{u}(f)$ to a lower force, thus establishing the malleability ofthe underlying folding landscape. our theory, applicable to any perturbationthat affects the free energy of the protein linearly, readily explains movementin the tse in a $\beta$-sandwich (i27) protein and single chain monellin as thedenaturant concentration is varied. we predict that in the force rangeaccessible in laser optical tweezer experiments there should be a switch in theunfolding pathways in i27 or its mutants.

0705.3029	stretching homopolymers	force induced stretching of polymers is important in a variety of contexts.we have used theory and simulations to describe the response of homopolymers,with $n$ monomers, to force ($f$) in good and poor solvents. in good solventsand for {{sufficiently large}} $n$ we show, in accord with scaling predictions,that the mean extension along the $f$ axis $&lt;z&gt;\sim f$ for small $f$, and$&lt;z&gt;\sim f^{{2/3}}$ (the pincus regime) for intermediate values of $f$. thetheoretical predictions for $\la z\ra$ as a function of $f$ are in excellentagreement with simulations for n=100 and 1600. however, even with n=1600, theexpected pincus regime is not observed due to the the breakdown of theassumptions in the blob picture for finite $n$. {{we predict the pincus scalingin a good solvent will be observed for $n\gtrsim 10^5$}}. the force-dependentstructure factors for a polymer in a poor solvent show that there are ahierarchy of structures, depending on the nature of the solvent. for a weaklyhydrophobic polymer, various structures (ideal conformations, self-avoidingchains, globules, and rods) emerge on distinct length scales as $f$ is varied.a strongly hydrophobic polymer remains globular as long as $f$ is less than acritical value $f_c$. above $f_c$, an abrupt first order transition to arod-like structure occurs. our predictions can be tested using single moleculeexperiments.

0808.0480	force dependent hopping rates of rna hairpins can be estimated from  accurate measurement of the folding landscapes	the sequence-dependent folding landscapes of nucleic acid hairpins reflectmuch of the complexity of biomolecular folding. folding trajectories, generatedusing single molecule force clamp experiments by attaching semiflexiblepolymers to the ends of hairpins have been used to infer their foldinglandscapes. using simulations and theory, we study the effect of the dynamicsof the attached handles on the handle-free rna free energy profile$f^o_{eq}(z_m)$, where $z_m$ is the molecular extension of the hairpin.accurate measurements of $f^o_{eq}(z_m)$ requires stiff polymers with small$l/l_p$, where $l$ is the contour length of the handle, and $l_p$ is thepersistence length. paradoxically, reliable estimates of the hopping rates canonly be made using flexible handles. nevertheless, we show that the equilibriumfree energy profile $f^o_{eq}(z_m)$ at an external tension $f_m$, the force($f$) at which the folded and unfolded states are equally populated, inconjunction with kramers' theory, can provide accurate estimates of theforce-dependent hopping rates in the absence of handles at arbitrary values of$f$. our theoretical framework shows that $z_m$ is a good reaction coordinatefor nucleic acid hairpins under tension.

0808.1692	semiflexible chains in confined spaces	we develop an analytical method for studying the properties of anon-interacting wormlike chain (wlc) in confined geometries. the meanfield-like theory replaces the rigid constraints of confinement with averageconstraints, thus allowing us to develop a tractable method for treating a wlcwrapped on the surface of a sphere, and fully encapsulated within it. theefficacy of the theory is established by reproducing the exact correlationfunctions for a wlc confined to the surface of a sphere. in addition, thecoefficients in the free energy are exactly calculated. we also describe thebehavior of a surface-confined chain under external tension that is relevantfor single molecule experiments on histone-dna complexes. the force-extensioncurves display spatial oscillations, and the extension of the chain, whosemaximum value is bounded by the sphere diameter, scales as $f^{-1}$ at largeforces, in contrast to the unconfined chain that approaches the contour lengthas $f^{-1/2}$. a wlc encapsulated in a sphere, that is relevant for the studyof the viral encapsulation of dna, can also be treated using the mf approach.the predictions of the theory for various correlation functions are inexcellent agreement with langevin simulations. we find that strongly confinedchains are highly structured by examining the correlations using a localwinding axis. the predicted pressure of the system is in excellent agreementwith simulations but, as is known, is significantly lower than the pressuresseen for dna packaged in viral capsids.

0808.3099	minimal models for proteins and rna: from folding to function	we present a panoramic view of the utility of coarse-grained (cg) models tostudy folding and functions of proteins and rna. drawing largely on the methodsdeveloped in our group over the last twenty years, we describe a number of keyapplications ranging from folding of proteins with disulfide bonds to functionsof molecular machines. after presenting the theoretical basis that justifiesthe use of cg models, we explore the biophysical basis for the emergence of afinite number of folds from lattice models. the lattice model simulations ofapproach to the folded state show that non-native interactions are relevantonly early in the folding process - a finding that rationalizes the success ofstructure-based models that emphasize native interactions. applications ofoff-lattice $c_{\alpha}$ and models that explicitly consider side chains($c_{\alpha}$-scm) to folding of $\beta$-hairpin and effects of macromolecularcrowding are briefly discussed. successful application of a new class ofoff-lattice model, referred to as the self-organized polymer (sop), is shown bydescribing the response of green fluorescent protein (gfp) to mechanical force.the utility of the sop model is further illustrated by applications thatclarify the functions of the chaperonin groel and motion of the molecular motorkinesin. we also present two distinct models for rna, namely, the three siteinteraction (tis) model and the sop model, that probe forced unfolding andforce quench refolding of a simple hairpin and {\it azoarcus} ribozyme. thepredictions based on the sop model show that force-induced unfolding pathwaysof the ribozyme can be dramatically changed by varying the loading rate. weconclude with a discussion of future prospects for the use of coarse-grainedmodels in addressing problems of outstanding interest in biology.

cond-mat;0208466	bending rigidity of stiff polyelectrolyte chains: single chain and a  bundle of multichains	we study the bending rigidity of highly charged stiff polyelectrolytes, forboth a single chain and many chains forming a bundle. a theory is developed toaccount for the interplay between competitive binding of counterions and chargecorrelations in softening the polyelectrolyte (pe) chains. the presence of evena small concentration of multivalent counterions leads to a dramatic reductionin the bending rigidity of the chains that are nominally stiffened by therepulsion between their backbone charges. the variation of the bending rigidityas a function of $f_{0}$, the fraction of charged monomers on the chain, doesnot exhibits simple scaling behavior; it grows with increasing $f_{0}$ below acritical value of $f_{0}$. beyond the critical value, however, the chainbecomes softer as $f_{0}$ increases. the bending rigidity also exhibitsintriguing dependence on the concentration of multivalent counterion $n_{2}$;for highly charged pes, the bending rigidity decreases as $n_2$ increases fromzero, while it increases with increasing $n_{2}$ beyond a certain value of$n_{2}$. when polyelectrolyte chains form a $n$-loop condensate (e.g., atoroidal bundle formed by $n$ turns (winds) of the chain), the inter-loopcoupling further softens the condensate, resulting in the bending free energyof the condensate that scales as $n$ for large $n$.

cond-mat;0509657	influence of surface interactions on folding and forced unbinding of  semiflexible chains	we investigate the folding and forced-unbinding transitions of adsorbedsemiflexible polymer chains using theory and simulations. these processesdescribe biologically relevant phenomena that include adhesive interactionsbetween proteins and tethering of receptors to cell walls. the bindinginterface is modeled as a solid surface and the worm-like chain is used for thesemiflexible chain. using langevin simulations we examine the ordering kineticsof racquet-like and toroidal structures in the presence of attractiveinteraction between the surface and the polymer chain. for a range ofinteractions, temperature, and the persistence length l_p we obtained themonomer density distribution n(x) for all the relevant morphologies. thesimulated results for n(x) are in good agreement with theory. the formation oftoroids on the surface appears to be a first order transition. chain-surfaceinteraction is probed by subjecting the surface structures to a pulling forcef. the average extension x as a function of f exhibit sigmoidal profile withsharp all-or-none transition at the unfolding f_c which increases for morestructured states. simulated x compare well with the theoretical predictions.the critical force f_c is a function of l_s/l_c for a fixed temperature, wherel_c, l_s are the length scales that express the strength of the intramolecularand chain-surface attraction, respectively. for a fixed l_s, f_c increases asl_p decreases.

cond-mat;0601324	mapping the energy landscape of biomolecules using single molecule force  correlation spectroscopy (fcs): theory and applications	in the current afm experiments the distribution of unfolding times, p(t), ismeasured by applying a constant stretching force f_s from which the apparentunfolding rate is obtained. to describe the complexity of the underlying energylandscape requires additional probes that can incorporate the dynamics oftension propagation and relaxation of the polypeptide chain upon force quench.we introduce a theory of force correlation spectroscopy (fcs) to map theparameters of the energy landscape of proteins. in the fcs the jointdistribution, p(t,t) of folding and unfolding times is constructed by repeatedapplication of cycles of stretching at constant fs, separated by releaseperiods t during which the force is quenched to f_q&lt;f_s. during the releaseperiod, the protein can collapse to a manifold of compact states or refold. weshow that p(t,t) can be used to resolve the kinetics of unfolding as well asformation of native contacts and to extract the parameters of the energylandscape using chain extension as the reaction coordinate and p(t,t). weillustrate the utility of the proposed formalism by analyzing simulations ofunfolding-refolding trajectories of a coarse-grained protein s1 with beta-sheetarchitecture for several values of f_s, t and f_q=0. the simulations ofstretch-relax trajectories are used to map many of the parameters thatcharacterize the energy landscape of s1.

cond-mat;0601426	kinetics of interior loop formation in semiflexible chains	loop formation between monomers in the interior of semiflexible chainsdescribes elementary events in biomolecular folding and dna bending. wecalculate analytically the interior distance distribution function forsemiflexible chains using a mean-field approach. using the potential of meanforce derived from the distance distribution function we present a simpleexpression for the kinetics of interior looping by adopting kramers theory. forthe parameters, that are appropriate for dna, the theoretical predictions incomparison to the case are in excellent agreement with explicit browniandynamics simulations of worm-like chain (wlc) model. the interior looping times($\tau_{ic}$) can be greatly altered in cases when the stiffness of the loopdiffers from that of the dangling ends. if the dangling end is stiffer than theloop then $\tau_{ic}$ increases for the case of the wlc with uniformpersistence length. in contrast, attachment of flexible dangling ends enhancesrate of interior loop formation. the theory also shows that if the monomers arecharged and interact via screened coulomb potential then both the cyclization($\tau_c$) and interior looping ($\tau_{ic}$) times greatly increase at lowionic concentration. because both $\tau_c$ and $\tau_{ic}$ are determinedessentially by the effective persistence length ($l_p^{(r)}$) we computed$l_p^{(r)}$ by varying the range of the repulsive interaction between themonomers. for short range interactions $l_p^{(r)}$ nearly coincides with thebare persistence length which is determined largely by the backbone chainconnectivity. this finding rationalizes the efficacy of describing a number ofexperimental observations (response of biopolymers to force and cyclizationkinetics) in biomolecules using wlc model with an effective persistence length.

cond-mat;0612433	measuring the energy landscape roughness and the transition state  location of biomolecules using single molecule mechanical unfolding  experiments	single molecule mechanical unfolding experiments are beginning to provideprofiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. in order to obtainreliable estimates of the energy landscape characteristics it is necessary tocombine the experimental measurements with sound theoretical models andsimulations. here, we show how by using temperature as a variable in mechanicalunfolding of biomolecules in laser optical tweezer or afm experiments theroughness of the energy landscape can be measured without making anyassumptions about the underlying reaction oordinate. the efficacy of theformalism is illustrated by reviewing experimental results that have directlymeasured roughness in a protein-protein complex. the roughness model can alsobe used to interpret experiments on forced-unfolding of proteins in whichtemperature is varied. estimates of other aspects of the energy landscape suchas free energy barriers or the transition state (ts) locations could depend onthe precise model used to analyze the experimental data. we illustrate theinherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location from loadingrate or force-dependent unfolding rates. because the transition state moves asthe force or the loading rate is varied it is in general difficult to invertthe experimental data unless the curvature at the top of the one dimensionalfree energy profile is large, i.e the barrier is sharp. the independence of thets location on force holds good only for brittle or hard biomolecules whereasthe ts location changes considerably if the molecule is soft or plastic. wealso comment on the usefulness of extension of the molecule as a surrogatereaction coordinate especially in the context of force-quench refolding ofproteins and rna.

cond-mat;9609178	factors governing the foldability of proteins	we use a three dimensional cubic lattice model of proteins to study theirproperties that determine folding to the native state. the protein chain ismodeled as a sequence of $n$ beads. the interactions between beads are takenfrom a gaussian distribution of energies. we studied 56 sequences with uniqueground states for $n = 15$ and $27$. thermodynamic and kinetic properties weredetermined using monte carlo simulations and exhaustive enumeration. for allsequences we find collapse temperature, $t_{\theta}$, at which the proteincollapses into compact structure, and folding temperature, $t_{f}$, at whichthe protein acquires the native state. we show that parameter $\sigma =(t_{\theta} - t_{f})/t_{\theta}$ correlates extremely well with folding times.fast folders reach the native state via a nucleation collapse mechanism withoutforming any intermediates, whereas for moderate and slow folders only afraction of molecules $\phi $ reaches the native state by this process. theremaining fraction folds via three stage multipathway process. the simultaneousrequirement of native state stability and kinetic accessibility can be achievedfor the sequences with small values of $\sigma $.

cond-mat;9611065	protein folding kinetics: time scales, pathways, and energy landscapes  in terms of sequence dependent properties	the folding kinetics of a number of sequences for off-lattice continuum modelof proteins is studied using langevin simulations at two values of the frictioncoefficient. we show that there is a remarkable correlation between foldingtimes, $\tau _{f}$, and $\sigma = (t_{\theta } - t_{f})/t_{\theta } $, where$t_{\theta }$ and $t_{f}$ are the equilibrium collapse and folding transitiontemperatures, respectively. the microscopic dynamics reveals several scenariosfor the refolding kinetics depending on the values of $\sigma $. proteins withsmall $\sigma $ reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapsemechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by single dominant nativebasin of attraction. proteins with large $\sigma $ get trapped in competingbasins of attraction, in which they adopt misfolded structures. in this caseonly a small fraction of molecules $\phi $ access the native state rapidly, themajority of them approach the native state by a three stage multipathwaymechanism. the partition factor $\phi $ is determined by $\sigma $: smaller thevalue of $\sigma $ larger is $\phi $. the qualitative aspects of our resultsare found to be independent of the friction coefficient. estimates for timescales for folding of small proteins via a nucleation collapse mechanism arepresented.

cond-mat;9805061	linking rates of folding in lattice models of proteins with underlying  thermodynamic characteristics	we investigate the sequence-dependent properties of proteins that determinethe dual requirements of stability of the native state and its kineticaccessibility using simple cubic lattice models. three interaction schemes areused to describe the potentials between residues. we show that, under thesimulation conditions when the native basin of attraction (nba) is stable,there is an excellent correlation between folding times (\tau_{f}) and thedimensionless parameter (\sigma_{t} = (t_{\theta} - t_{f})/t_{\theta}), where(t_{\theta}) is the collapse temperature and (t_{f}) is the folding transitiontemperature. there is also a significant correlation between (\tau_{f}) andz-score (z=(e_{n}-e_{ms})/\delta), where (e_{n}) is the energy of the nativestate, (e_{ms}) is the average energy of the ensemble of misfolded structures,and (\delta) is the dispersion in contact energies. an approximate relationshipbetween (\sigma_{t}) and the z-score is derived, which explains the superiorcorrelation seen between (\tau_{f}) and (\sigma_{t}). for two state folders(\tau_{f}) is linked to the free energy difference between the unfolded statesand the nba.

cond-mat;9810104	stretching dna: role of electrostatic interaction	the effect of electrostatic interactions on the stretching of dna isinvestigated using a simple worm like chain model. in the limit of small forcethere are large conformational fluctuations which are treated using aself-consistent variational approach. for small values of the external force f,we find theoreticlly and by a simple blob picture that the extension scales asfr_d where r_d is the debye screening length. in the limit of large force theelectrostatic effects can be accounted for within the semiflexible chain modelof dna by assuming that only small excursions from rod-like conformations arepossible. in this regime the extension approaches the contour length asf^{-1/2} where f is the magnitude of the external force. the theory is used toanalyze experiments that have measured the extension of double-stranded dnasubject to tension at various salt concentrations. the theory reproduces nearlyquantitatively the elastic response of dna at small and large values of f andfor all concentration of the monovalent counterions. the limitations of thetheory are also pointed out.

0811.0781	crowding effects on the mechanical stability and unfolding pathways of  ubiquitin	the interior of cells is crowded thus making it important to assess theeffects of macromolecules on the folding of proteins. using the self-organizedpolymer (sop) model, which is a coarse-grained representation of polypeptidechains, we probe the mechanical stability of ubiquitin (ub) monomers andtrimers ((ub)$_3$) in the presence of monodisperse spherical crowding agents.crowding increases the volume fraction ($\phi_c$)-dependent average force($&lt;f_u(\phi_c)&gt;$), relative to the value at $\phi_c = 0$, needed to unfold uband the polyprotein. for a given $\phi_c$, the values of $&lt;f_u(\phi_c)&gt;$increase as the diameter ($\sigma_c$) of the crowding particles decreases. theaverage unfolding force $&lt;f_u(\phi_c)&gt;$ depends on the ratio $\frac{d}{r_g}$,where $d \approx \sigma_c (\frac{\pi}{6 \phi_c})^{{1/3}}$ with $r_g$ being theradius of gyration of ub (or (ub)$_3$) in the unfolded state. examination ofthe unfolding pathways shows that, relative to $\phi_c = 0$, crowding promotesreassociation of ruptured secondary structural elements. both the nature of theunfolding pathways and $&lt;f_u(\phi_c)&gt;$ for (ub)$_3$ are altered in the presenceof crowding particles with the effect being most dramatic for the subunit thatunfolds last. we predict, based on sop simulations and theoretical arguments,that $&lt;f_u(\phi_c) &gt; \sim \phi_c^{\frac{1}{3\nu}}$, where $\nu$ is the floryexponent that describes the unfolded (random coil) state of the protein.

cond-mat;9910248	emergence of stable and fast folding protein structures	the number of protein structures is far less than the number of sequences. byimposing simple generic features of proteins (low energy and compaction) on allpossible sequences we show that the structure space is sparse compared to thesequence space. even though the sequence space grows exponentially with n (thenumber of amino acids) we conjecture that the number of low energy compactstructures only scales as ln n. this implies that many sequences must map ontocountable number of basins in the structure space. the number of sequences forwhich a given fold emerges as a native structure is further reduced by the dualrequirements of stability and kinetic accessibility. the factor that determinesthe dual requirement is related to the sequence dependent temperatures,t_\theta (collapse transition temperature) and t_f (folding transitiontemperature). sequences, for which \sigma =(t_\theta-t_f)/t_\theta is small,typically fold fast by generically collapsing to the native-like structures andthen rapidly assembling to the native state. such sequences satisfy the dualrequirements over a wide temperature range. we also suggest that the functionalrequirement may further reduce the number of sequences that are biologicallycompetent. the scheme developed here for thinning of the sequence space thatleads to foldable structures arises naturally using simple physicalcharacteristics of proteins. the reduction in sequence space leading to theemergence of foldable structures is demonstrated using lattice models ofproteins.

0812.1274	probing the mechanisms of fibril formation using lattice models	using exhaustive monte carlo simulations we study the kinetics and mechanismof fibril formation using lattice models as a function of temperature and thenumber of chains. while these models are, at best, caricatures of peptides, weshow that a number of generic features thought to govern fibril assembly arepresent in the toy model. the monomer, which contains eight beads made fromthree letters (hydrophobic, polar, and charged), adopts a compact conformationin the native state. the kinetics of fibril assembly occurs in three distinctstages. in each stage there is a cascade of events that transforms the monomersand oligomers to ordered structures. in the first "burst" stage highly mobileoligomers of varying sizes form. the conversion to the aggregation-proneconformation occurs within the oligomers during the second stage. as timeprogresses, a dominant cluster emerges that contains a majority of the chains.in the final stage, the aggregation-prone conformation particles serve as atemplate onto which smaller oligomers or monomers can dock and undergoconversion to fibril structures. the overall time for growth in the latterstages is well described by the lifshitz-slyazov growth kinetics forcrystallization from super-saturated solutions.
