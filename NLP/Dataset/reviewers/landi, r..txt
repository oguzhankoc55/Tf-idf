0901.2499	the nature of the asca/integral source ax j183039-1002: a new  compton-thick agn?	we report on the identification of the x/soft gamma-ray source axj183039-1002 detected with asca and integral/ibis. the source, which has anobserved 20-100 kev flux of about 8.6 x 10^-11 erg/cm^2/s, is inside a diffuseradio supernova remnant (snr) and is spatially coincident with a compact radiosource. we analyzed archival chandra and xmm-newton observations in order toidentify the asca/integral source. a point-like chandra x-ray object was foundto be positionally coincident with the compact radio source and within theerror circle of the asca and integral sources. although the association of acompact radio/x-ray source with a radio supernova remnant could be indicativeof a pulsar wind nebula (pwn), the xmm-newton x-ray spectrum is compatible withan absorbed, seyfert-2 like agn, since it provides evidence for an ironemission line of about 1 kev equivalent width; furthermore the x-ray sourcespectrum is similar to that of other compton thick agn where the &lt;2 kev dataare associated to a warm reflector and the &gt;10 kev one to a cold reflector.

0902.0249	the x-ray spectral evolution of cyg x-2 in the framework of bulk  comptonization	we used the newly developed thermal plus bulk comptonization model comptb toinvestigate the spectral evolution of the neutron star lmxb cyg x-2 along itsz-track. we selected a single source in order to trace in a quantitative waythe evolution of the physical parameters of the model. we analyzed archivalbroad-band bepposax spectra of cyg x-2. five broad-band spectra have been newlyextracted according to the source position in the z-track described in thecolour-colour and colour-intensity diagrams. we have fitted the spectra of thesource with two comptb components. the first one, with bulk parameter delta=0,dominates the overall source broad-band spectrum and its origin is related tothermal upscattering (comptonization) of cold seed photons off warm electronsin high-opacity enviroment. we attribute the origin of these seed photons tothe part of the disk which illuminates the outer coronal region (transitionlayer) located between the accretion disk itself and the neutron star surface.this thermal component is roughly constant with time and with inferred massaccretion rate. the second comptb model describes the overall comptonization(thermal plus bulk, delta &gt; 0) of hotter seed photons which come from both theinner transition layer and from the neutron star surface. the appearance ofthis component in the colour-colour or hardness-intensity diagram is morepronounced in the horizontal branch and is progressively disappearing towardsthe normal branch, where a pure blackbody spectrum is observed. the spectralevolution of cyg x-2 is studied and interpreted in terms of changes in theinnermost environmental conditions of the system, leading to a variablethermal-bulk comptonization efficiency.

0706.2547	swift-xrt observation of 34 new integral/ibis agns: discovery of compton  thick and other peculiar sources	for a significant number of the sources detected at high energies (&gt;10 kev)by the integral/ibis and swift/bat instruments there is either a lackinformation about them in the 2-10 kev range or they are totally unidentified.herein, we report on a sample of 34 ibis agn or agn candidate objects for whichthere is x-ray data in the swift/xrt archive. thanks to these x-ray follow upobservations, the identification of the gamma ray emitters has been possibleand the spectral shape in terms of photon index and absorption has beenevaluated for the first time for the majority of our sample sources. thesample, enlarged to include 4 more agn already discussed in the literature, hasbeen used to provide photon index and column density distribution. we obtain amean value of 1.88 with a dispersion of 0.12, i.e. typical of an agn sample.sixteen objects (47%) have column densities in excess of 10^{22} cm^{-2} and,as expected, a large fraction of the absorbed sources are within the sey 2sample. we have provided a new diagnostic tool (nh versusf(2-10)kev/f(20-100)kev softness ratio) to isolate peculiar objects; we find atleast one absorbed sey 1 galaxy, 3 compton thick agn candidates; and one secureexample of a "true" type 2 agn. within the sample of 10 still unidentifiedobjects, 3 are almost certainly agn of type 2; 3 to 4 have spectral slopestypical of agn; and two are located high on the galactic plane and are strongenough radio emitters so that can be considered good agn candidates.

0706.3460	the agn nature of 11 out of 12 swift/rxte unidentified sources through  optical and x-ray spectroscopy	the swift burst alert telescope (bat) is performing a high galactic latitudesurvey in the 14-195 kev band at a flux limit of ~10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},leading to the discovery of new high energy sources, most of which have not sofar been properly classified. a similar work has also been performed with therxte slew survey leading to the discovery of 68 sources detected above 8 kev,many of which are still unclassified. follow-up observations with the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) provide, for many of these objects, source localizationwith a positional accuracy of few arcsec, thus allowing the search for opticalcounterparts to be more efficient and reliable. we present the results ofoptical/x-ray follow-up studies of 11 swift bat detections and one agn detectedin the rxte slew survey, aimed at identifying their counterparts and atassessing their nature. these data allowed, for the first time, the opticalclassification of 8 objects and a distance determination for 3 of them. foranother object, a more refined optical classification than that available inthe literature is also provided. for the remaining sources, opticalspectroscopy provides a characterization of the source near in time to thex-ray measurement. the sample consists of 6 seyfert 2 galaxies, 5 seyferts ofintermediate type 1.2-1.8, and one object of galactic nature - an intermediatepolar (i.e., magnetic) cataclysmic variable. out of the 11 agns, 8 (~70%)including 2 seyferts of type 1.2 and 1.5, are absorbed with nh &gt; 10^{22}cm^{-2}. up to 3 objects could be compton thick (i.e. nh &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24}cm^{-2}), but only in one case (swift j0609.1-8636) does all the observationalevidence strongly suggests this possibility.

0707.0832	hess j1616-508: likely powered by psr j1617-5055	hess j1616-508 is one of the brightest emitters in the tev sky. recentobservations with the ibis/isgri telescope on board the integral spacecrafthave revealed that a young, nearby and energetic pulsar, psr j1617-5055, is apowerful emitter of soft gamma-rays in the 20-100 kev domain. in this paper wepresent an analysis of all available data from the integral, swift, bepposaxand xmm-newton telescopes with a view to assessing the most likely counterpartto the hess source. we find that the energy source that fuels the x/gamma-rayemissions is derived from the pulsar, both on the basis of the positionalmorphology, the timing evidence and the energetics of the system. likewise, the1.2% of the pulsar's spin down energy loss needed to power the 0.1-10 tevemission is also fully consistent with other hess sources known to beassociated with pulsars. the relative sizes of the x/gamma-ray and vhe sourcesare consistent with the expected lifetimes against synchrotron and comptonlosses for a single source of parent electrons emitted from the pulsar. we findthat no other known object in the vicinity could be reasonably considered as aplausible counterpart to the hess source. we conclude that there is goodevidence to assume that the hess j1616-508 source is driven by psr j1617-5055in which a combination of synchrotron and inverse compton processes combine tocreate the observed morphology of a broad-band emitter from kev to tevenergies.

0910.0954	hard x-ray properties of magnetic cataclysmic variables	hard x-ray surveys have proven remarkably efficient in detecting intermediatepolars and asynchronous polars, two of the rarest type of cataclysmic variable(cv). here we present a global study of hard x-ray selected intermediate polarsand asynchronous polars, focusing particularly on the link between hard x-rayproperties and spin/orbital periods. to this end, we first construct a newsample of these objects by cross-correlating candidate sources detected inintegral/ibis observations against catalogues of known cvs. we find 23cataclysmic variable matches, and also present an additional 9 (of which 3 aredefinite) likely magnetic cataclysmic variables (mcvs) identified by othersthrough optical follow-ups of ibis detections. we also include in our analysishard x-ray observations from swift/bat and suzaku/hxd in order to make ourstudy more complete. we find that most hard x-ray detected mcvs havep_{spin}/p_{orb}&lt;0.1 above the period gap. in this respect we also point outthe very low number of detected systems in any band betweenp_{spin}/p_{orb}=0.3 and p_{spin}/p_{orb}=1 and the apparent peak of thep_{spin}/p_{orb} distribution at about 0.1. the observational features of thep_{spin} - p_{orb} plane are discussed in the context of mcv evolutionscenarios. we also present for the first time evidence for correlations betweenhard x-ray spectral hardness and p_{spin}, p_{orb} and p_{spin}/p_{orb}. anattempt to explain the observed correlations is made in the context of mcvevolution and accretion footprint geometries on the white dwarf surface.

1201.1906	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  ix. 22 more identifications, and a glance into the far hard x-ray universe	(abridged) since its launch in october 2002, the integral satellite hasrevolutionized our knowledge of the hard x-ray sky thanks to its unprecedentedimaging capabilities and source detection positional accuracy above 20 kev.nevertheless, many of the newly-detected sources in the integral sky surveysare of unknown nature. the combined use of available information at longerwavelengths (mainly soft x-rays and radio) and of optical spectroscopy on theputative counterparts of these new hard x-ray objects allows us to pinpointtheir exact nature. continuing our long-standing program that has been runningsince 2004, and using 6 different telescopes of various sizes, we report theclassification through optical spectroscopy of 22 more unidentified or poorlystudied high-energy sources detected with the ibis instrument onboard integral.we found that 16 of them are active galactic nuclei (agns), while the remaining6 objects are within our galaxy. among the identified extragalactic sources, 14are type 1 agns; of these, 6 lie at redshift larger than 0.5 and one has z =3.12, which makes it the second farthest object detected in the integralsurveys up to now. the remaining agns are of type 2, and one of them is a pairof interacting seyfert 2 galaxies. the galactic objects are identified as twocataclysmic variables, one high-mass x-ray binary, one symbiotic binary and twochromospherically active stars. we thus still find that agns are the mostabundant population among hard x-ray objects identified through opticalspectroscopy. moreover, we note that the higher sensitivity of the more recentintegral surveys is now enabling the detection of high-redshift agns, thusallowing the exploration of the most distant hard x-ray emitting sources andpossibly of the most extreme blazars.

0711.0648	integral observations of psr j1811-1925 and its associated pulsar wind  nebula	we present spectral measurements made in the soft (20-100 kev) gamma-ray bandof the region containing the composite supernova remnant g11.2-0.3 and itsassociated pulsar psr j1811-1925. analysis of integral/ibis data allowscharacterisation of the system above 10 kev. the ibis spectrum is best fittedby a power law having photon index of 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} and a 20-100 kev fluxof 1.5e{-11} erg/cm^2/s. analysis of archival chandra data over differentenergy bands rules out the supernova shell as the site of the soft gamma-rayemission while broad band (1-200 kev) spectral analysis strongly indicates thatthe integral/ibis photons originate in the central zone of the system whichcontains both the pulsar and its nebula. the composite x-ray and soft gamma-rayspectrum indicates that the pulsar provides around half of the emission seen inthe soft gamma-ray domain; its spectrum is hard with no sign of a cut off up toat least 80 kev. the other half of the emission above 10 kev comes from thepwn; with a power law slope of 1.7 its spectrum is softer than that of thepulsar. from the ibis/isgri mosaics we are able to derive 2 sigma upper limitsfor the 20-100 kev flux from the location of the nearby tev source hessj1809-193 to be 4.8e{-12} erg/cm^2/s. we have also examined the likelihood ofan association between psr j1811-1925 and hess j1809-193. although psrj1811-1925 is the most energetic pulsar in the region, the only one detectedabove 10 kev and thus a possible source of energy to fuel the tev fluxes, thereis no morphological evidence to support this pairing, making it an unlikelycounterpart.

(2001); this is possibly due to theproperties of dust in the circumnuclear obscuring torus of the agn.

0704.3682	igr j16194-2810: a new symbiotic x-ray binary	we here report on the multiwavelength study which led us to theidentification of x-ray source igr j16194-2810 as a new symbiotic x-ray binary(syxb), that is, a rare type of low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) composed of am-type giant and a compact object. using the accurate x-ray position allowed byswift/xrt data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a m2 iii star. besides,the combined use of the spectral information afforded by xrt and integral/ibisshows that the 0.5-200 kev spectrum of this source can be described with anabsorbed comptonization model, usually found in lmxbs and, in particular, insyxbs. no long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the ibisdata. the time coverage afforded by xrt reveals shot-noise variability typicalof accreting galactic x-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore thepresence of x-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. byusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source suchas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and x-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the0.5-200 kev band), and we give a description for this system (typical of syxbs)in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind ofits m-type giant companion. we also draw some comparisons between igrj16194-2810 and other sources belonging to this subclass, finding that thisobject resembles syxbs 4u 1700+24 and 4u 1954+31.

1211.1270	spectral evolution of the x-ray nova xte j1859+226 during its outburst  observed by bepposax and rxte	we report results of an extensive analysis of the x-ray nova xte j1859+226observed with bepposax and rxte during its 1999 outburst. we modelled thesource spectrum with a multicolour blackbody-like feature plus the genericcomptonization model bmc which has the advantage of providing spectraldescription of the emitted-radiation properties without assumptions on theunderlying physical process. the multicolour component is attributed to thegeometrically thin accretion disk, while the comptonization spectrum is claimedto originate in the innermost sub-keplerian region of the system (transitionlayer). we find that xte j1859+226 covers all the spectral states typical ofblack-hole sources during its evolution across the outburst, however during thevery high state, when the disk contribution to the total luminosity is morethan 70% and the root mean square variability &gt; 5%, the high-energy photonindex is closer to a hard state value (gamma ~ 1.8). the bmc normalization andphoton index gamma well correlate with the radio emission, and we also observeda possible saturation effect of gamma at the brightest radio emission levels. astrong positive correlation was found between the fraction of comptonized seedphotons and the observed integrated root mean square variability, whichstrengthens the idea that most of the fast variability in these systems isprovided by the innermost compton cloud, which may be also identified as a jet.

0712.2134	probing the nature of igr j16493-4348: spectral and temporal analysis of  the 1-100 kev emission	igr j16493-4348 was one of the first new sources to be detected by theintegral gamma-ray telescope in the 18-100 kev energy band. based upon spatialcoincidence the source was originally associated with the free radio pulsar psrj1649-4349. presented here are the results of 2.8 ms of observations made bythe integral mission and a 5.6 ks observation with the swift x-ray telescope.spectral analysis indicates that the source is best modeled by an absorbedpower law with a high energy cut-off at e$_{cut}$~15 kev and a hydrogenabsorbing column of nh=5.4$^{+1.3}_{-1}$ x 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. analysis of thelight curves indicates that the source is a weak, persistent gamma-ray emittershowing indications of variability in the 2-9 and 22-100 kev bands. the averagesource flux is ~1.1 x 10^{-10} erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 1-100 kev energyband. no coherent timing signal is identified at any timescale in the integralor swift data.  the refined source location and positional uncertainty of igr j16493-4348places psr j1649-4349 outside of the 90% error circle. we conclude that igrj16493-4348 is not associated with psr j1649-4349. combining the integralobservations with swift/xrt data and information gathered by rxte and chandrawe suggest that igr j16493-4348 is an x-ray binary; and that the sourcecharacteristics favour a high mass x-ray binary although an lmxb nature cannotbe ruled out.

0805.0377	measuring the cosmological parameters with the ep,i-eiso correlation of  gamma-ray bursts	we have used the ep,i-eiso correlation of grbs to measure the cosmologicalparameter omega_m. by adopting a maximum likelihood approach which allows us tocorrectly quantify the extrinsic (i.e. non--poissonian) scatter of thecorrelation, we constrain (for a flat universe) omega_m to 0.04-0.40 (68%confidence level), with a best fit value of omega_m ~ 0.15, and exclude omega_m= 1 at 99.9% confidence level. if we release the assumption of a flat universe,we still find evidence for a low value of omega_m (0.04-0.50 at 68% confidencelevel) and a weak dependence of the dispersion of the ep,i-eiso correlation onomega_lambda (with an upper limit of omega_lambda ~ 1.15 at 90% confidencelevel). our approach makes no assumptions on the ep,i-eiso correlation and itdoes not use other calibrators to set the "zero' point of the relation,therefore our treatment of the data is not affected by circularity and theresults are independent of those derived via type ia sne (or other cosmologicalprobes). unlike other multi-parameters correlations, our analysis grounds ononly two parameters, then including a larger number (a factor ~3) of grbs andbeing less affected by systematics. simulations based on realisticextrapolations of ongoing (and future) grb experiments (e.g., swift,konus-wind, glast) show that: i) the uncertainties on cosmological parameterscan be significantly decreased; ii) future data will allow us to get clues onthe "dark energy" evolution.

0806.4824	first high energy observations of narrow line seyfert 1s with  integral/ibis	narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1) are very interesting objects whichdisplay peculiar properties when compared to their broad line analogues (bls1).although well studied in many wavebands, their behaviour at &gt;10 kev is poorlystudied and yet important to discriminate between models invoked to explain thecomplexity observed in the x-ray band. here we present for the first time highenergy observations (17-100 kev) of five nls1 galaxies (3 bona fide and 2candidates) detected by integral/ibis and provide for all of them a broad bandspectral analysis using data obtained by swift/xrt below 10 kev. the combinedintegral spectrum is found to be steeper (gamma=2.6 +/- 0.3) than those ofclassical seyfert 1 objects. this is due to a high energy cutoff, which isrequired in some individual fits as in the average broad band spectrum. thelocation of this high energy cutoff is at lower energies (e &lt; 60 kev) thantypically seen in classical type 1 agns; a reflection component may also bepresent but its value (r &lt; 0.8) is compatible with those seen in standardseyfert 1s. we do not detect a soft excess in individual objects but only intheir cumulative spectrum. our results suggest a lower plasma temperature forthe accreting plasma which combined to the high accretion rates (close to theeddington rate) point to different nuclear conditions in broad and narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxies, likely related to different evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0110140	bepposax view of ngc 526a: a seyfert 1.9 galaxy with a flat spectrum	in the present work we report the bepposax observation of the seyfert 1.9galaxy ngc 526a in the band 0.1-150 kev. the high energy instrument onboard,pds, has succeeded in measuring for the first time the spectrum of this sourcein the 13-150 kev range. the combined analysis of all narrow field instrumentsprovides a power law spectral index of ~ 1.6 and confirms the flat spectralnature of this source. although ngc 526a varies strongly in the 2-10 kev overperiod of months/years, its spectral shape remains constant over thesetimescales. an fe k-alpha line, characterized by a complex structure, has beendetected in the 6-7 kev range. the line, which has an equivalent width of 120ev, is not compatible with being produced in an absorbing torus with n_h ~10^22 cm^-2, but most likely originates by reflection in an accretion diskviewed at an intermediate inclination angle of ~ 42 deg. the reflectioncomponent is however small (r &lt; 0.7) and so it is not sufficient to steepen thespectrum to photon index values more typical of agns. instead, we find that thedata are more consistent with a flat power law spectrum cut-off at around 100kev plus a small reflection component which could explain the observed ironline. thus ngc 526a is the only bona-fide seyfert 2 galaxy which maintains a"flat spectrum" even when broad band data are considered: in this sense itsproperties, with respect to the general class of seyfert 2's, are analogous tothose of ngc 4151 with respect to the vast majority of seyfert 1's.

astro-ph;0407166	prompt and afterglow x-ray emission from the x-ray flash of 2002 april  27	we report on the x-ray observations of the x-ray flash (xrf) which occurredon 2002 april 27, three days before bepposax was switched off. the event wasdetected with the bepposax wide field cameras but not with the gamma ray burstmonitor. a follow-up observation with the bepposax narrow field instruments wassoon performed and a candidate afterglow source was discovered. we present theresults obtained. we also include the results obtained from the observations ofthe xrf field with the chandra x-ray satellite. the spectral analysis of theprompt emission shows that the peak energy of the ef(e) spectrum is lower than5.5 kev, with negligible spectral evolution. the x-ray afterglow spectrum isconsistent with a power law model with photon index of about 2, while the 2-10kev flux fades as a power law with a decay index -1.33. both these indices aretypical of grbs. a very marginal excess around 4.5-5 kev is found in theafterglow spectrum measured by bepposax . as for many grbs, the extrapolationof the 2-10 kev fading law back to the time of the prompt emission isconsistent with the x-ray flux measured during the second part of the event. weestimate a possible range of values of the redshift and discuss our results inthe light of current models of xrfs.

astro-ph;0504602	the puzzling case of grb 990123: multiwavelength afterglow study	we report on the bepposax data analysis of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 990123, one of the brightest grbs detected by bepposax. mainly due to itsexceptional brightness, this is the only source for which the wide fieldcameras have allowed an early detection of the x-ray afterglow between about 20and 60 min after the grb trigger. besides, again for the first time,high-energy emission from the afterglow was detected up to 60 kev. for thex-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha = 1.46 +/- 0.04;the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index gamma about 1.9. thebackward extrapolation of the afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the lategrb emission, thus suggesting that both emissions are produced by the samephenomenon. an extensive set of multiwavelength observations for the grb 990123afterglow made during the bepposax pointing was collected from the literature.the hard x-ray to radio range coverage allowed to construct a spectral fluxdistribution and to perform an analysis of the grb afterglow in the context ofthe "fireball" model. we also report the results of temporal and spectralanalysis of an x-ray source serendipitously observed about 22 arcmin north ofthe grb afterglow, along with the optical spectroscopy of its possiblecounterpart to establish the nature of this source.

astro-ph;0506237	bepposax/pds serendipitous detections at high galactic latitudes	at a flux limit of ~10^(-11) erg/cm2/s in the 20-100 kev band, the pdsinstrument on-board bepposax offers the opportunity to study the extragalacticsky with an unprecedented sensitivity. in this work we report on the results ofa search in the bepposax archive for serendipitous high energy sources at highgalactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 13 deg). we have defined a set of twelve regions inwhich the pds/mecs cross-calibration constant is higher than the nominal value.we attribute this mismatch to the presence of a serendipitous source in the pdsfield of view.in four cases the likely high energy emitter is also present inthe mecs field of view. in these cases, we have performed a broad band spectralanalysis (1.5-100 kev) so as to understand the source spectral behaviour andcompare it with previous bepposax observations when available. in eight casesthe identification of the source likely to provide the pds spectrum is based onindirect evidence (extrapolation to lower energies and/or comparison toprevious observations). this approach leads to the discovery of six new hardx-ray emitting objects (pks 2356-611, 2masx j14585116-1652223, ngc 1566, ngc7319, pks 0101-649 and eso 025-g002) and to the presentation the pds spectrumof ngc 3227 for the first time. in the remaining five cases we provide extrabepposax observations that can be compared with measurements which are alreadypublished and/or in the archive.

astro-ph;0509123	integral observations of agn in the galactic plane	we present results on approximately one year of integral observations of sixagn detected during the regular scans of the galactic plane. the sample iscomposed by five seyfert 2 objects (mcg -05-23-16, ngc 4945, the circinusgalaxy, ngc 6300, eso 103-g35) and the radio galaxy centaurus a. the continuumemission of each of these sources is well represented by a highly absorbed (nh&gt; 1e22 1/cm^2) power law, with average spectral index gamma = 1.9 +/- 0.3. ahigh energy exponential cut-off at ec ~ 50 kev is required to fit the spectrumof the circinus galaxy, whereas a lower limit of 130 kev has been found for ngc4945 and no cut-off has been detected for ngc 6300 in the energy range coveredby these integral data. the flux of centaurus a was found to vary by a factorof ~ 2 in 10 months, showing a spectral change between the high and low state,which can be modelled equally well by a change in the absorption (nh from 17e22to 33e22 1/cm^2) or by the presence of a cut-off at &gt;~ 120 kev in the low statespectrum. a comparison with recently reprocessed bepposax/pds data shows ageneral agreement with integral results. the high energy cut-off in the hardx-ray spectra appears to be a common but not universal characteristic ofseyfert 2 and to span a wide range of energies.

astro-ph;0606488	integral observations of agn obscured by the galactic plane	in this paper we present integral observations of 7 agns: two newlydiscovered type 1 seyferts, igr j18027-1455 and igr j21247+5058, and five wellknown seyferts, ngc 6814 (type 1.5), cyg a (type 2), mcg-05-23-16 (type 2), eso103-g035 (type2) and grs1734-292. for igr j18027-1455 and igr j21247+5058 onlyintegral/ibis data were available, while broadband spectra are presented anddiscussed for the remaining 5 sources for which either bepposax or asca datawere used in conjunction with integral measurements. in the cases of ngc 6814and grs 1734-292, data taken in different periods indicate variability in theflux: in the case of ngc 6814 by a factor of 16 over a period of about 10years. although limited in size, our sample can be used to investigate theparameter space of both the photon index and cut-off energy. the mean photonindex is 1.8, while the cut-off energy ranges from 30-50 kev to greater than200 kev; in the particular case of mcg-05-23-16, eso 103-g035 and grs 1734-292the cut-off energy is well constrained at or below 100 kev. we have also testedan enlarged sample, which includes integral data of 3 more agns, against thecorrelation found by a number of authors between the photon index and thecut-off energy but have found no evidence for a relation between these twoparameters. our analysis indicates that there is a diversity in cut-offenergies in the primary continuum of seyfert galaxies.

0810.1844	integral/ibis and swift/xrt observations of hard cataclysmic variables	the analysis of the third integral/ibis survey has revealed several newcataclysmic variables, most of which turned out to be intermediate polars, thusconfirming that these objects are strong emitters in hard x-rays. here wepresent high energy spectra of all 22 cataclysmic variables detected in the 3rdibis survey and provide the first average spectrum over the 20-100 kev band forthis class. our analysis indicates that the best-fit model is a thermalbremsstrahlung with an average temperature of &lt;kt&gt; ~22 kev. recently, eleven(ten intermediate polars and one polar) of these systems have been followed-upby swift/xrt (operating in the 0.3-10 kev energy band), thus allowing us toinvestigate their spectral behaviour over the range ~0.3-100 kev. thanks tothis wide energy coverage, it was possible for these sources to simultaneouslymeasure the soft and hard components and estimate their temperatures. the softemission, thought to originate in the irradiated poles of the white dwarfatmosphere, is well described by a blackbody model with temperatures in therange ~60-120 ev. the hard emission, which is supposed to be originated fromoptically thin plasma in the post-shock region above the magnetic poles, isindeed well modelled with a bremsstrahlung model with temperatures in the range~16-33 kev, similar to the values obtained from the integral data alone. inseveral cases we also find the presence of a complex absorber: one totally(with nh ~(0.4-28) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}) and one partially (with nh ~(0.7-9) x10^{23} cm^{-2}) covering the source. only in four cases (v709 cas, gk per, igrj06253+7334 and igr j17303-0601), we find evidence for the presence of an ironline at 6.4 kev. we discuss our findings in the light of the systems parametersand cataclysmic variables/intermediate polars modelling scenario.

0811.4085	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  vii. identification of 20 galactic and extragalactic hard x-ray sources	within the framework of our program of assessment of the nature ofunidentified or poorly known integral sources, we present here spectroscopy ofoptical objects, selected through positional cross-correlation with soft x-raydetections (afforded with satellites such as swift, rosat, chandra and/orxmm-newton) as putative counterparts of hard x-ray sources detected with theibis instrument onboard integral. using 6 telescopes of various sizes andarchival data from two on-line spectroscopic surveys we are able to identify,either for the first time or independent of other groups, the nature of 20integral hard x-ray sources. our results indicate that: 11 of these objects areactive galactic nuclei (agns) at redshifts between 0.014 and 0.978, 7 of whichdisplay broad emission lines, 2 show narrow emission lines only, and 2 haveunremarkable or no emission lines (thus are likely compton thick agns); 5 arecataclysmic variables (cvs), 4 of which are (possibly magnetic) dwarf novae andone is a symbiotic star; and 4 are galactic x-ray binaries (3 with high-masscompanions and one with a low-mass secondary). it is thus again found that themajority of these sources are agns or magnetic cvs, confirming our previousfindings. when possible, the main physical parameters for these hard x-raysources are also computed using the multiwavelength information available inthe literature. these identifications support the importance of integral in thestudy of the hard x-ray spectrum of all classes of x-ray emitting objects, andthe effectiveness of a strategy of multi-catalogue cross-correlation plusoptical spectroscopy to securely pinpoint the actual nature of unidentifiedhard x-ray sources.
