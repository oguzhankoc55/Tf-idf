0901.3256	north ecliptic pole wide field survey of akari: survey strategy and data  characteristics	we present the survey strategy and the data characteristics of the northecliptic pole (nep) wide survey of akari. the survey was carried out for aboutone year starting from may 2006 with 9 passbands from 2.5 to 24 micron and theareal coverage of about 5.8 sq. degrees centered on nep. the survey depthreaches to 21.8 ab magnitude near infrared (nir) bands, and ~ 18.6 abmaggnitude at the mid infrared (mir) bands such as 15 and 18 micron. the totalnumber of sources detected in this survey is about 104,000, with more sourcesin nir than in the mir. we have cross matched infrared sources with opticallyidentified sources in cfht imaging survey which covered about 2 sq. degreeswithin nep-wide survey region in order to characterize the nature of infraredsources. the majority of the mid infrared sources at 15 and 18 micron band arefound to be star forming disk galaxies, with smaller fraction of early typegalaxies and agns. we found that a large fraction (60~80 %) of bright sourcesin 9 and 11 micron stars while stellar fraction decreases toward faintersources. we present the histograms of the sources at mid infrared bands at 9,11, 15 and 18 micron. the number of sources per magnitude thus varies as m^0.6for longer wavelength sources while shorter wavelength sources show steepervariation with m, where m is the ab magnitude.

0704.1182	an optical source catalog of the north ecliptic pole region	we present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of thesources in the north ecliptic pole (nep) region based on deep observations madewith megacam at cfht. the source catalog covers about 2 square degree areacentered at the nep and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands,about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection overan 1 arcsec aperture). the total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'=23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. fromthe investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagramsand color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources aremostly (u*-r') &lt; 3.0 and (g'-z') &gt; 0.5. this can be used to separate theextended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint sourcedomain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly workefficiently. we have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the redsequence galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey data. by applying thisrelation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities,we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.

0903.2922	the mid-infrared view of red sequence galaxies in abell 2218 with akari	we present the {\it akari} infrared camera (irc) imaging observation ofearly-type galaxies in a2218 at z $\simeq$ 0.175. mid-infrared (mir) emissionfrom early-type galaxies traces circumstellar dust emission from agb starsor/and residual star formation. including the unique imaging capability at 11and 15 $\mu$m, our {\it akari} data provide an effective way to investigate mirproperties of early-type galaxies in the cluster environment. among ourflux-limited sample of 22 red sequence early-type galaxies with precisedynamical and line strength measurements ($&lt;$ 18 mag at 3 $\mu m$), we findthat at least 41% have mir-excess emission. the $n3-s11$ versus $n3$ (3 and 11$\mu$m) color-magnitude relation shows the expected blue sequence, but themir-excess galaxies add a red wing to the relation especially at the fainterend. a sed analysis reveals that the dust emission from agb stars is the mostlikely cause for the mir-excess, with low level of star formation being thenext possible explanation. the mir-excess galaxies show a wide spread of$n3-s11$ colors, implying a significant spread (2--11 gyr) in the estimatedmean ages of stellar populations. we study the environmental dependence ofmir-excess early-type galaxies over an area out to a half virial radius($\sim$1 mpc). we find that the mir-excess early-type galaxies arepreferentially located in the outer region. from these evidences, we suggestthat the fainter, mir-excess early-type galaxies have just joined the redsequence, possibly due to the infall and subsequent morphological/spectraltransformation induced by the cluster environment.

1002.0889	probing the nature of high-z short grb 090426 with its early optical and  x-ray afterglows	grb 090426 is a short duration burst detected by swift ($t_{90}\sim 1.28$ sin the observer frame, and $t_{90}\sim 0.33$ s in the burst frame at$z=2.609$). its host galaxy properties and some $\gamma$-ray relatedcorrelations are analogous to those seen in long duration grbs, which arebelieved to be of a massive-star origin (so-called type ii grbs). we presentthe results of its early optical observations with the 0.8-m tnt telescope atxinglong observatory, and the 1-m loao telescope at mt. lemmon opticalastronomy observatory in arizona. our well-sampled optical afterglow lightcurvecovers from $\sim 90$ seconds to $\sim 10^4$ seconds post the grb trigger. itshows two shallow decay episodes that are likely due to energy injection, whichend at $\sim 230$ seconds and $\sim 7100$ seconds, respectively. the decayslopes post the injection phases are consistent with each other ($\alpha\simeq1.22$). the x-ray afterglow lightcurve appears to trace the optical, althoughthe second energy injection phase was missed due to visibility constraintsintroduced by the {\em swift} orbit. the x-ray spectral index is $\beta_x\sim1.0$ without temporal evolution. its decay slope is consistent with theprediction of the forward shock model. both x-ray and optical emission isconsistent with being in the same spectral regime above the cooling frequency($\nu_c$). the fact that $\nu_c$ is below the optical band from the very earlyepoch of the observation provides a constraint on the burst environment, whichis similar to that seen in classical long duration grbs. we therefore suggestthat death of a massive star is the possible progenitor of this short burst.

0708.3140	optical identification of 15 micron sources in the akari performance  verification field toward the north ecliptic pole	we present the results of optical identifications for 257 mid-infraredsources detected with a deep 15um survey over approximately 80 arcmin^2 area inthe akari performance verification field near the north ecliptic pole. the 15umfluxes of the sources range from 1 mjy down to 40 ujy, approximately a half ofwhich are below 100 ujy. optical counterparts were searched for within a 2-3arcsec radius in both the bvri'z' catalog generated by using the deepsubaru/suprime-cam field which covers one-third of the performance verificationfield, and the g'r'i'z' catalog based on observations made with megacam atcfht. we found b-r and r-z' colours of sources with successful opticalidentifications are systematically redder than that of the entire opticalsample in the same field. moreover, approximately 40% of the 15um sources showcolours r-l15&gt;5, which cannot be explained by the spectral energy distribution(sed) of normal quiescent spiral galaxies, but are consistent with seds ofredshifted (z&gt;1) starburst or ultraluminous infrared galaxies. this resultindicates that the fraction of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in our faint15um sample is much larger than that in our brighter 15um sources, which isconsistent with the evolving mid-infrared luminosity function derived by recentstudies based on the spitzer 24um deep surveys. based on an sed fittingtechnique, the nature of the faint 15um sources is further discussed for aselected number of sources with available k_s-band data.

1011.6408	merging galaxy cluster abell 2255 in mid-infrared	we present the mid-infrared (mir) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster,abell 2255 by the akari space telescope. using the akari's continuouswavelength coverage between 3-24 micron and the wide field of view, weinvestigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall ofthe galaxies, the cluster substructures, and the cluster-cluster mergerinfluence their evolution. we show that the excess of mir (11 micron) flux is agood indicator to discriminate galaxies at different evolutionary stages, anddivide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong mir-excess (n3-s11&gt;0.2)galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies, weakmir-excess (-2.0&lt;n3-s11&lt;-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (&gt;5 gyr)galaxies where the mir emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dustaround agb stars, and intermediate mir-excess (-1.2&lt;n3-s11&lt;0.2) galaxies inbetween the two classes that are less than a few gyrs old past the prime starformation activity. with the mir-excess diagnostics, we investigate how localand cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. we derive thetotal star formation rate of ~130 msun/yr for a2255 using the strong mir-excessgalaxies, which is consistent with other clusters of galaxies at similarredshifts and with similar masses. we find no strong evidence that supportsenhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructureregion. the intermediate mir-excess galaxies, representing galaxies intransition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are locatedpreferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures. ourfindings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxiesinto red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core,which can be well-explained by the ram-pressure stripping as previoussimulation suggests.

1012.1112	new estimators of black hole mass in active galactic nuclei with  hydrogen paschen lines	more than 50% of active galactic nuclei (agns) are suspected to be red andaffected by dust-obscuration. meanwhile, popular spectral diagnostics of agnsare based on optical or ultraviolet light, making the dust obscuration as aprimary concern for understanding the general nature of agns and supermassiveblack holes residing in them. to provide with a method of investigatingproperties of the dusty agns, we derive new black hole (bh) mass estimatorsbased on velocity widths and luminosities of near infrared (nir) hydrogenemission lines such as p$\alpha$ and p$\beta$, and also investigate the lineratios of these hydrogen lines. to derive the bh mass ($m_{\rm bh}$)estimators, we used a sample of 37 unobscured type-1 agns with a $m_{\rm bh}$range of $10^{6.8}$-$10^{9.4} m_{\odot}$, where $m_{\rm bh}$ come from eitherreverberation mapping method or single-epoch measurement method using balmerlines. our work shows that $m_{\rm bh}$ can be estimated from the paschen lineluminosities and the velocity widths to the accuracy of 0.18 - 0.24 dex (rmsscatter). we also show that the mean line ratios of the paschen lines and thebalmer lines are $\mathrm{\frac{h\alpha}{p\alpha}} \simeq 9.00$,$\mathrm{\frac{h\beta}{p\alpha}} \simeq 2.70$, which are consistent with a caseb recombination under a typical agn broad line region environment. these ratioscan be used as reference points when estimating the amount of dust extinctionover the broad line region (blr) for red agns. we expect the future applicationof the new bh mass estimators on red, dusty agns to provide a fresh view ofobscured agns.

1110.3259	dust properties in afterglow of grb 071025 at z~5	at high redshift, the universe was so young that core-collapse supernovae(sne) are suspected to be the dominant source of dust production. however, someobservations indicate that the dust production by sne is an inefficientprocess, casting doubts on the existence of abundant sne-dust in the earlyuniverse. recently, perley et al. (2010) reported that the afterglow of grb071025 - an unusually red grb at z ~ 5 - shows evidence for the sne-produceddust. since this is perhaps the only high redshift grb exhibiting compellingevidence for sne-dust but the result could easily be affected by smallsystematics in photometry, we re-examined the extinction properties of grb071025 using our own optical/near-infrared data at a different epoch. inaddition, we tested sne-dust models with different progenitor masses and dustdestruction efficiencies to constrain the dust formation mechanisms. bysearching for the best-fit model of the afterglow spectral energy distribution,we confirm the previous claim that the dust in grb 071025 is most likely tooriginate from sne. we also find that the sne-dust model of 13 or 25m_{\odot}without dust destruction fits the extinction property of grb 071025 best, whilepair-instability sne (pisne) models with a 170m_{\odot} progenitor poorly fitthe data. our results indicate that, at least in some systems at high redshift,sne with intermediate masses within 10 - 30m_{\odot} were the main contributorsfor the dust enrichment, and the dust destruction effect due to reverse shockwas negligible.

1210.1644	the 3.3 micron pah emission as a star formation rate indicator	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features dominate themid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and can be useful to calibratestar formation rates and diagnose ionized states of grains. however, the pah3.3 micron feature has not been studied as much as other pah features since itis weaker than others and resides outside of spitzer capability. in order todetect and calibrate the 3.3 micron pah emission and investigate its potentialas a star formation rate indicator, we carried out an akari mission program,akari mjy unbiased survey of extragalactic survey (amuses) and compare itssample with various literature samples. we obtained 2 ~5 micron low resolutionspectra of 20 flux-limited galaxies with mixed sed classes, which yields thedetection of the 3.3 micron pah emission from three out of 20 galaxies. for thecombined sample of amuses and literature samples, the 3.3 micron pahluminosities correlate with the infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies,albeit with a large scatter (1.5 dex). the correlation appears to break down atthe domain of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), and the power of the3.3 micron pah luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity is hampered atlog[l(pah3.3)/(erg/sec)] &gt; -42.0. possible origins for this deviation in thecorrelation are discussed, including contribution from agn and stronglyobscured ysos, and the destruction of pah molecules in ulirgs.

1212.2610	variability at the edge: optical near/ir rapid cadence monitoring of  newly outbursting fu orionis object hbc 722	we present the detection of day-timescale periodic variability in the r-bandlightcurve of newly outbursting fu orionis-type object hbc 722, taken from &gt; 42nights of observation with the cquean instrument on the mcdonald observatory2.1m telescope. the optical/near-ir lightcurve of hbc 722 shows a complex arrayof periodic variability, clustering around 5.8 day (0.044 mag amplitude) and1.28 day (0.016 mag amplitude) periods, after removal of overall baselinevariation. we attribute the unusual number of comparable strength signals to aphenomenon related to the temporary increase in accretion rate associated withfuors. we consider semi-random "flickering", magnetic braking/field compressionand rotational asymmetries in the disk instability region as potential sourcesof variability. assuming the 5.8 day period is due to stellar rotation and the1.28 day period is indicative of keplerian rotation at the inner radius of theaccretion disk (at 2 r(star)), we derive a b-field strength of 2.2-2.7 kg,slightly larger than typical t tauri stars. if instead the 5.8 day signal isfrom a disk asymmetry, the instability region has an outer radius of 5.4r(star), consistent with models of fuor disks. further exploration of the timedomain in this complicated source and related objects will be key tounderstanding accretion processes.

1307.6356	a relation of the pah 3.3 um feature with star-forming activity for  galaxies with a wide range of infrared luminosity	for star-forming galaxies, we investigate a global relation betweenpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission luminosity at 3.3 um, l_pah3.3,and infrared (8-1000 um) luminosity, l_ir, to understand how the pah 3.3 umfeature relates to the star formation activity. with akari, we performednear-infrared (2.5-5 um) spectroscopy of 184 galaxies which have l_ir \sim 10^8- 10^13 l_sun. we classify the samples into infrared galaxies (irgs; l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun), luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs; l_ir \sim 10^11 -10^12 l_sun)and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs; l_ir &gt; 10^12 l_sun). we excludesources which are likely contaminated by agn activity, based on the rest-frameequivalent width of the pah emission feature (&lt; 40 nm) and the power-law indexrepresenting the slope of continuum emission (gamma &gt; 1; f_nu \proptolambda^gamma). of these samples, 13 irgs, 67 lirgs and 20 ulirgs show pahemission feature at lambda_rest= 3.3 um in their spectra. we find that thel_pah3.3/l_ir ratio considerably decreases toward the luminous end. utilizingthe mass and temperature of dust grains as well as the bralpha emission for thegalaxies, we discuss the cause of the relative decrease in the pah emissionwith l_ir.

1309.7353	a tale of two feedbacks: star-formation in the host galaxies of  radio-agn	several lines of argument support the existence of a link between activity atthe nuclei of galaxies, in the form of an accreting supermassive black hole,and star-formation activity in these galaxies. the exact nature of this link isstill under debate. radio jets have long been argued to be an ideal mechanismthat allows agn to interact with their host galaxy and regulate star-formation.in this context, we are using a sample of radio sources in the north eclipticpole (nep) field to study the nature of the putative link between agn activityand star-formation. this is done by means of spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting. we use the excellent spectral coverage of the akari infrared spacetelescope together with the rich ancillary data available in the nep to buildseds extending from uv to far-ir wavelengths. through sed fitting we constrainboth the agn and host galaxy components. we find a significant agn component inour sample of relatively faint radio-sources ($&lt;$mjy), that increases in powerwith increasing radio-luminosity. at the highest radio-luminosities, thepresence of powerful jets dominates the radio emission of these sources. apositive correlation is found between the luminosity of the agn component andthat of star-formation in the host galaxy, independent of the radio luminosity.by contrast, for a given redshift and agn luminosity, we find that increasingradio-luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star-formation rate. themost radio-loud agn are found to lie on the main sequence of star-formation fortheir respective redshifts. for the first time, such a two-sided feedbackprocess is seen in the same sample. we conclude that radio jets do suppressstar-formation in their host galaxies but appear not to totally quench it. ourresults therefore support the maintenance nature of "radio-mode" feedback fromradio-agn jets.

1504.00058	rest-frame optical spectra and black hole masses of 3&lt;z&lt;6 quasars	we present the rest-frame optical spectral properties of 155 luminous quasarsat 3.3&lt;z&lt;6.4 taken with the akari space telescope, including the firstdetection of h$\alpha$ emission line as far out as z~6. we extend the scalingrelation between the rest-frame optical continuum and line luminosity of activegalactic nuclei (agns) to the high luminosity, high redshift regime that hasrarely been probed before. remarkably, we find that a single log-linearrelation can be applied to the 5100${\rm \aa}$ and h$\alpha$ agn luminositiesover a wide range of luminosity (10$^{42}$&lt;$l_{5100}$&lt;10$^{47}$ergs/s) orredshift (0&lt;z&lt;6), suggesting that the physical mechanism governing thisrelation is unchanged from z=0 to 6, over five decades in luminosity. similarscaling relations are found between the optical and the uv continuumluminosities or line widths. applying the scaling relations to the h$\beta$black hole mass ($m_{\rm bh}$) estimator of local agns, we derive the $m_{\rmbh}$ estimators based on h$\alpha$, mgii, and civ lines, finding that theuv-line based masses are overall consistent with the balmer-line based, butwith a large intrinsic scatter of 0.40dex for the civ estimates. our 43 $m_{\rmbh}$ estimates from h$\alpha$ confirm the existence of bhs as massive as~10$^{10}m_{\odot}$ out to z~5, and provide a secure footing for previousmgii-line based studies that a rapid $m_{\rm bh}$ growth has occurred in theearly universe.

1505.00230	correlation between galaxy mergers and luminous agn	it is not yet clear what triggers the activity of active galactic nuclei(agns), but galaxy merging has been suspected to be one of the main mechanismsfuelling the activity. using deep optical images taken at various ground-basedtelescopes, we investigate the fraction of galaxy mergers in 39 luminous agns(m$_{r}\, \lesssim$ -22.6 mag) at $z \leq$ 0.3 (a median redshift of 0.155), ofwhich the host galaxies are generally considered as early-type galaxies.through visual inspection of the images, we find that 17 of 39 agn hostgalaxies (43.6%) show the evidence for current or past mergers like tidaltails, shells, and disturbed morphology. in order to see if this fraction isabnormally high, we also examined the merging fraction of normal early-typegalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) strip 82 data (a medianredshift of 0.04), of which the surface-brightness limit is comparable to ourimaging data. to correct for the effects related to the redshift difference ofthe two samples, we performed an image simulation by putting a bright pointsource as an artificial agn in the images of sdss early-type galaxies andplacing them onto the redshifts of agns. the merging fraction in this realisticsample of simulated agns is only $\sim 5 - 15\%$ ($1/4$ to $1/8$ of that ofreal agns). our result strongly suggests that luminous agn activity isassociated with galaxy merging.

1506.08821	evolution of mid-infrared galaxy luminosity functions from the entire  akari nep-deep field with new cfht photometry	we present infrared galaxy luminosity functions (lfs) in the akari northecliptic pole (nep) deep field using recently-obtained, wider cfhtoptical/near-ir images. akari has obtained deep images in the mid-infrared(ir), covering 0.6 deg$^2$ of the nep deep field. however, our previous workwas limited to the central area of 0.25 deg$^2$ due to the lack of opticalcoverage of the full akari nep survey. to rectify the situation, we recentlyobtained cfht optical and near-ir images over the entire akari nep deep field.these new cfht images are used to derive accurate photometric redshifts,allowing us to fully exploit the whole akari nep deep field. akari's deep,continuous filter coverage in the mid-ir wavelengths (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11,15, 18, and 24$\mu$m) exists nowhere else, due to filter gaps of other spacetelescopes. it allows us to estimate restframe 8$\mu$m and 12$\mu$mluminosities without using a large extrapolation based on spectral energydistribution (sed) fitting, which was the largest uncertainty in previousstudies. total infrared luminosity (tir) is also obtained more reliably due tothe superior filter coverage. the resulting restframe 8$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m, andtir lfs at $0.15&lt;z&lt;2.2$ are consistent with previous works, but with reduceduncertainties, especially at the high luminosity-end, thanks to the wide fieldcoverage. in terms of cosmic infrared luminosity density($\omega_{\mathrm{ir}}$), we found that the $\omega_{\mathrm{ir}}$ evolves as$\propto (1+z)^{4.2\pm 0.4}$.

1507.02396	linking galaxies to dark matter haloes at $z\sim1$ : dependence of  galaxy clustering on stellar mass and specific star formation rate	we study the dependence of angular two-point correlation functions on stellarmass ($m_{*}$) and specific star formation rate (ssfr) of$m_{*}&gt;10^{10}m_{\odot}$ galaxies at $z\sim1$. the data from ukidss dxs andcfhtls covering 8.2 deg$^{2}$ sample scales larger than 100 $h^{-1}$mpc at$z\sim1$, allowing us to investigate the correlation between clustering,$m_{*}$, and star formation through halo modeling. based on halo occupationdistributions (hods) of $m_{*}$ threshold samples, we derive hods for $m_{*}$binned galaxies, and then calculate the $m_{*}/m_{\rm halo}$ ratio. the ratiofor central galaxies shows a peak at $m_{\rm halo}\sim10^{12}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$,and satellites predominantly contribute to the total stellar mass in clusterenvironments with $m_{*}/m_{\rm halo}$ values of 0.01--0.02. using star-forminggalaxies split by ssfr, we find that main sequence galaxies ($\rmlog\,ssfr/yr^{-1}\sim-9$) are mainly central galaxies in $\sim10^{12.5}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ haloes with the lowest clustering amplitude, while lower ssfrgalaxies consist of a mixture of both central and satellite galaxies wherethose with the lowest $m_{*}$ are predominantly satellites influenced by theirenvironment. considering the lowest $m_{\rm halo}$ samples in each $m_{*}$ bin,massive central galaxies reside in more massive haloes with lower ssfrs thanlow mass ones, indicating star-forming central galaxies evolve from a low$m_{*}$--high ssfr to a high $m_{*}$--low ssfr regime. we also find that themost rapidly star-forming galaxies ($\rm log\,ssfr/yr^{-1}&gt;-8.5$) are in moremassive haloes than main sequence ones, possibly implying galaxy mergers indense environments are driving the active star formation. these results supportthe conclusion that the majority of star-forming galaxies follow secularevolution through the sustained but decreasing formation of stars.

1507.08843	host galaxy properties and black hole mass of swift j164449.3+573451  from multi-wavelength long-term monitoring and hst data	we study the host galaxy properties of the tidal disruption object, swiftj164449.3+573451 using long-term optical to near-infrared (nir) data. first, wedecompose the galaxy surface brightness distribution and analyze the morphologyof the host galaxy using high resolution \emph{hst} wfc3 images. we concludethat the host galaxy is a bulge-dominant galaxy that is well described by asingle s\'{e}rsic model with s\'{e}rsic index $n=3.43\pm0.05$. adding a diskcomponent, the bulge to total host galaxy flux ratio (b/t) is $0.83\pm0.03$,which still indicates a bulge-dominant galaxy. second, we estimate multi-bandfluxes of the host galaxy through long-term light curves. our long-term nirlight curves reveal the pure host galaxy fluxes $\sim500$ days after the burst.we fit spectral energy distribution (sed) models to the multi-band fluxes fromthe optical to nir of the host galaxy and determine its properties. the stellarmass, the star formation rate, and the age of stellar population are$\log(m_{\star}/m_{\odot}) = 9.14^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$, $0.03^{+0.28}_{-0.03}\,m_{\odot}$/yr, and $0.63^{+0.95}_{-0.43}$ gyr. finally, we estimate the mass ofthe central super massive black hole which is responsible for the tidaldisruption event. the black hole mass is estimated to be $10^{6.7\pm0.4}\,m_{\odot}$ from $m_{\mathrm{bh}}$ - $m_{\star,\mathrm{bul}}$ and$m_{\mathrm{bh}}$ - $l_{\mathrm{bul}}$ relations for the $k$ band, although asmaller value of $\sim10^5\, m_{\odot}$ cannot be excluded convincingly if thehost galaxy harbors a pseudobulge.

1510.03887	accretion rates of red quasars from the hydrogen p$\beta$ line	red quasars are thought to be an intermediate population betweenmerger-driven star-forming galaxies in dust-enshrouded phase and normalquasars. if so, they are expected to have high accretion ratios, but theirintrinsic dust extinction hampers reliable determination of eddington ratios.here, we compare the accretion rates of 16 red quasars at $z \sim 0.7$ to thoseof normal type 1 quasars at the same redshift range. the red quasars areselected by their red colors in optical through near-infrared (nir) and radiodetection. the accretion rates of the red quasars are derived from the p$\beta$line in nir spectra, which is obtained by the spex on the infrared telescopefacility (irtf) in order to avoid the effects of dust extinction. we find thatthe measured eddington ratios ($l_{\rm bol}$/$l_{\rm edd} \simeq 0.69$) of redquasars are significantly higher than those of normal type 1 quasars, which isconsistent with a scenario in which red quasars are the intermediate populationand the black holes of red quasars grow very rapidly during such a stage.

1511.01585	discovery of a faint quasar at z~6 and implications for cosmic  reionization	recent studies suggest that faint active galactic nuclei may be responsiblefor the reionization of the universe. confirmation of this scenario requiresspectroscopic identification of faint quasars ($m_{1450}&gt;-24$ mag) at $z\gtrsim6$, but only a very small number of such quasars have beenspectroscopically identified so far. here, we report the discovery of a faintquasar ims j220417.92+011144.8 at z~6 in a 12.5 deg$^{2}$ region of the sa22field of the infrared medium-deep survey (ims). the spectrum of the quasarshows a sharp break at $\sim8443~\rm{\aa}$, with emission lines redshifted to$z=5.944 \pm 0.002$ and rest-frame ultraviolet continuum magnitude$m_{1450}=-23.59\pm0.10$ ab mag. the discovery of ims j220417.92+011144.8 isconsistent with the expected number of quasars at z~6 estimated from quasarluminosity functions based on previous observations of spectroscopicallyidentified low-luminosity quasars . this suggests that the number of$m_{1450}\sim-23$ mag quasars at z~6 may not be high enough to fully accountfor the reionization of the universe. in addition, our study demonstrates thatfaint quasars in the early universe can be identified effectively with amoderately wide and deep near-infrared survey such as the ims.

1512.09282	massive structures of galaxies at high redshifts in the great  observatories origins deep survey fields	if the universe is dominated by cold dark matter and dark energy as in thecurrently popular lcdm cosmology, it is expected that large scale structuresform gradually, with galaxy clusters of mass m &gt; ~10^14 msun appearing ataround 6 gyrs after the big bang (z ~ 1). here, we report the discovery of 59massive structures of galaxies with masses greater than a few x 10^13 msun atredshifts between z=0.6 and 4.5 in the great observatories origins deep surveyfields. the massive structures are identified by running top-hat filters on thetwo dimensional spatial distribution of magnitude-limited samples of galaxiesusing a combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. we analyze themillennium simulation data in a similar way to the analysis of theobservational data in order to test the lcdm cosmology. we find that there aretoo many massive structures (m &gt; 7 x 10^13 msun) observed at z &gt; 2 incomparison with the simulation predictions by a factor of a few, giving aprobability of &lt; 1/2500 of the observed data being consistent with thesimulation. our result suggests that massive structures have emerged early, butthe reason for the discrepancy with the simulation is unclear. it could be dueto the limitation of the simulation such as the lack of key, unrecognizedingredients (strong non-gaussianity or other baryonic physics), or simply adifficulty in the halo mass estimation from observation, or a fundamentalproblem of the lcdm cosmology. on the other hand, the over-abundance of massivestructures at high redshifts does not favor heavy neutrino mass of ~ 0.3 ev orlarger, as heavy neutrinos make the discrepancy between the observation and thesimulation more pronounced by a factor of 3 or more.

0807.1334	decomposition of the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei using  hubble space telescope images	investigating the link between supermassive black hole and galaxy evolutionrequires careful measurements of the properties of the host galaxies. weperform simulations to test the reliability of a two-dimensional image-fittingtechnique to decompose the host galaxy and the active galactic nucleus (agn),especially on images obtained using cameras onboard the hubble space telescope(hst), such as the wide-field planetary camera 2, the advanced camera forsurveys, and the near-infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer. wequantify the relative importance of spatial, temporal, and color variations ofthe point-spread function (psf). to estimate uncertainties in agn-to-hostdecompositions, we perform extensive simulations that span a wide range inagn-to-host galaxy luminosity contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and host galaxyproperties (size, luminosity, central concentration). we find that realisticpsf mismatches that typically afflict actual observations systematically leadto an overestimate of the flux of the host galaxy. part of the problem iscaused by the fact that the hst psfs are undersampled. we demonstrate that thisproblem can be mitigated by broadening both the science and the psf images tocritical sampling without loss of information. other practical suggestions aregiven for optimal analysis of hst images of agn host galaxies.

0807.1337	the origin of the intrinsic scatter in the relation between black hole  mass and bulge luminosity for nearby active galaxies	we investigate the origin of the intrinsic scatter in the correlation betweenblack hole mass (mbh) and bulge luminosity [l(bulge)] in a sample of 45massive, local (z &lt; 0.35) type~1 active galactic nuclei (agns). we derive mbhfrom published optical spectra assuming a spherical broad-line region, andl(bulge) from detailed two-dimensional decomposition of archival optical hubblespace telescope images. agns follow the mbh-l(bulge) relation of inactivegalaxies, but the zero point is shifted by an average of \delta log mbh ~ -0.3dex. we show that the magnitude of the zero point offset, which is responsiblefor the intrinsic scatter in the mbh-l(bulge) relation, is correlated withseveral agn and host galaxy properties, all of which are ultimately related to,or directly impact, the bh mass accretion rate. at a given bulge luminosity,sources with higher eddington ratios have lower mbh. the zero point offset canbe explained by a change in the normalization of the virial product used toestimate mbh, in conjunction with modest bh growth (~ 10%--40%) during the agnphase. galaxy mergers and tidal interactions appear to play an important rolein regulating agn fueling in low-redshift agns.

astro-ph;0011092	the deep groth strip survey x: number density and luminosity function of  field e/s0 galaxies at z &lt; 1	we present the luminosity function and color-redshift relation of amagnitude-limited sample of 145 mostly red field e/s0 galaxies at z &lt; 1 fromthe deep groth strip survey (gss). most of the e/s0s (86%) form a red envelopein the redshift-color diagram, consistent with predictions of spectralsynthesis models in which the dominant stellar population is formed atredshifts z &gt; 1.5. constructing a luminosity function of the full sample of  145 e/s0s, we find that there is about 1.1--1.9 magnitude brightening inrest-frame b band luminosity back to z = 0.8 from z=0, consistent with otherstudies.  together with the red colors, this brightening favors models in which thebulk of stars in red field e/s0s formed before z_{for} &gt; 1.5 and have beenevolving rather quiescently with few large starbursts since then.  evolution in the number density of field e/s0 galaxies is harder to measure,and uncertainties in the raw counts and their ratio to local samples mightamount to as much as a factor of two.  within that uncertainty, the number density of red e/s0s to z = 0.8 seemsrelatively static, being comparable to or perhaps moderately less than that oflocal e/s0s depending on the assumed cosmology. a doubling of e/s0 numberdensity since z = 1 can be ruled out with high confidence (97%) if\omega_{m}=1.  taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that themajority of luminous field e/s0s were already in place by z = 1, that the bulkof their stars were already fairly old, and that their number density has notchanged by large amounts since then.

astro-ph;0105389	are there blue, massive e/s0s at z &lt; 1 ?: kinematics of blue spheroidal  galaxy candidates	several recent studies find that 10 - 50% of morphologically selected fieldearly-type galaxies at redshifts z &lt;= 1 have blue colors indicative of recentstar formation. such ``blue spheroids''might be massive early-type galaxieswith active star formation, perhaps induced by recent merger events.  alternatively, they could be starbursting, low-mass spheroids. to distinguishbetween these two choices, we have selected 10 ``blue spheroid candidates''  (hereafter, bscs) from a quantitatively selected e/s0 sample and studiedtheir properties, including kinematics from keck spectra obtained as part ofthe deep groth strip survey (gss). most bscs (70%) turn out to belong to twobroad categories, while the remaining objects are likely to be misclassifiedobjects. type-1 bscs have underlying red stellar components with bluer innercomponents. type-2 bscs do not show an obvious sign of the underlying redstellar component, and their overall colors are quite blue ((u-b)_rest &lt; 0).  both type-1 and type-2 bscs have internal velocity dispersions measured fromemission lines sigma &lt; 80$ km/sec and estimated dynamical masses of only a fewtimes 10^10 m_sun or less. for type-1 bscs, we estimate sigma of the redcomponent using the fundamental plane relation of distant field absorption-linegalaxies and find that these sigma estimates are similar to the sigma measuredfrom emission lines. overall, we conclude that our type-1 and type-2 bscs aremore likely to be star-forming low mass spheroids than star-forming, massive,early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0307242	the deep groth strip survey ix: evolution of the fundamental plane of  field galaxies	fundamental plane studies provide an excellent means of understanding theevolutionary history of early-type galaxies. using the low resolution imagingspectrograph on the keck telescope, we obtained internal stellar kinematicinformation for 36 field galaxies in the groth strip--21 early-type and 15 diskgalaxies. their redshifts range from 0.3--1.0, with a median redshift 0.8. theslope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope.however, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset dueto evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening atz=1. we see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction, which is agood surrogate for galaxy type. correcting for the luminosity evolution reducesthe orthogonal scatter in the fundamental plane to 8%, consistent with thelocal scatter. this scatter is measured for our sample, and does not includeresults from other studies which may have different selection effects. thedifference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and publishedcluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for fieldgalaxies compared to z&gt;2.0 for cluster galaxies. the magnitude differenceimplies that the field early-type galaxies are about 2 gyr younger than thecluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models. however, the samemodels imply a significant change in the rest-frame u-b color from then topresent, which is not seen in our sample. continuous low-level star formation,however, would serve to explain the constant colors over this large magnitudechange. a consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initialburst, using an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e-foldingtime of 5 gyr.

astro-ph;0506480	optical-near infrared color gradients of elliptical galaxies and their  environmental dependence	we have studied the environmental effect on optical-nir color gradients of273 nearby elliptical galaxies. color gradient is a good tool to study theevolutionary history of elliptical galaxies, since the steepness of the colorgradient reflects merging history of early types. when an elliptical galaxygoes through many merging events, the color gradient can be get less steep orreversed due to mixing of stars. one simple way to measure color gradient is tocompare half-light radii in different bands. we have compared the optical andnear infrared half-light radii of 273 early-type galaxies from pahre(1999). notsurprisingly, we find that r$_{e}$(v)s (half-light radii measured in v-band)are in general larger than r$_{e}$(k)s (half-light radii measured in k-band).however, when divided into different environments, we find that ellipticalgalaxies in the denser environment have gentler color gradients than those inthe less dense environment. our finding suggests that elliptical galaxies inthe dense environment have undergone many merging events and the mixing ofstars through the merging have created the gentle color gradients.

astro-ph;0601316	constraints on the star formation rate in active galaxies	the [o ii] 3727 emission line is often used as an indicator of star formationrate in extragalactic surveys, and it can be an equally effective tracer ofstar formation in systems containing luminous active galactic nuclei (agns). inorder to investigate the ongoing star formation rate of the host galaxies ofagns, we measured the strength of [o ii] and other optical emission lines froma large sample (~ 3600) of broad-line (type 1) agns selected from the sloandigital sky survey. we performed a set of photoionization calculations to helpevaluate the relative contribution of stellar and nonstellar photoionization tothe observed strength of [o ii]. consistent with the recent study of ho (2005),we find that the observed [o ii] emission can be explained entirely byphotoionization from the agn itself, with little or no additional contributionfrom hii regions. this indicates that the host galaxies of type 1 agnsexperience very modest star formation concurrent with the optically activephase of the nucleus. by contrast, we show that the sample of ``type 2''quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey does exhibit substantiallystronger hii emission consistent with an elevated level of star formation, aresult that presents a challenge to the simplest form of the agn unificationmodel.

astro-ph;0605370	the deep groth strip survey vi. spectroscopic, variability, and x-ray  detection of agn	we identify active galactic nuclei (agn) in the groth-westphal survey strip(gss) using the independent and complementary selection techniques of opticalspectroscopy and photometric variability. we discuss the x-ray properties ofthese agn using chandra/xmm data for this region. from a sample of 576 galaxieswith high quality spectra we identify 31 galaxies with agn signatures. seven ofthese have broad emission lines (type 1 agns). we also identify 26 galaxiesdisplaying nuclear variability in hst wfpc2 images of the gss separated by ~7years. the primary overlap of the two selected agn samples is the set ofbroad-line agns, of which 80% appear as variable. only a few narrow-line agnsapproach the variability threshold. the broad-line agns have an averageredshift of z~1.1 while the other spectroscopic agns have redshifts closer tothe mean of the general galaxy population (z~0.7). eighty percent of theidentified broad-line agns are detected in x-rays and these are among the mostluminous x-ray sources in the gss. only one narrow-line agn is x-ray detected.of the variable nuclei galaxies within the x-ray survey, 27% are x-raydetected. we find that 1.9+/-0.6% of gss galaxies to v=24 are broad-line agns,1.4+/-0.5% are narrow-line agns, and 4.5+/-1.4% contain variable nuclei. thefraction of spectroscopically identified blagns and nlagns at z~1 reveals amarginally significant increase of 1.3+/-0.9% when compared to the localpopulation.

astro-ph;0611411	the host galaxy of the quasar he 0450-2958	a recent study suggests that the quasar he 0450-2958 is hosted by a galaxysubstantially fainter than that inferred from the correlation between blackhole mass and bulge luminosity. as this result has significant bearings ongalaxy and black hole evolution, we revisit the issue by performing anindependent analysis of the data, using a two-dimensional image fittingtechnique. we indeed find no evidence of a host galaxy either, but, due to thebrightness of the quasar and uncertainties in the point-spread function, thelimits are fairly weak. to derive an upper limit on the host galaxy luminosity,we perform simulations to deblend the quasar from the host under conditionssimilar to those actually observed. we find that the host galaxy has anabsolute magnitude upper limit of -20 &lt; m_v &lt; -21, in good agreement with theprevious determination. since this limit is consistent with the value predictedfrom the current best estimate of the black hole mass, there is no compellingevidence that the quasar he 0450-2958 has an abnormally underluminous hostgalaxy. we also show that, contrary to previous claims, the companion galaxy tohe 0450-2958 should not be be regarded as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy.

astro-ph;9508131	new "einstein cross" gravitational lens candidates in hst wfpc2 survey  images	we report the serendipitous discovery of ``einstein cross'' gravitationallens candidates using the hubble space telescope. we have so far discovered twogood examples of such lenses, each in the form of four faint blue imageslocated in a symmetric configuration around a red elliptical galaxy. the highresolution of hst has facilitated the discovery of this optically selectedsample of faint lenses with small (~1 arcsec) separations between the (i ~25-27) lensed components and the much brighter (i ~ 19-22) lensing galaxies.the sample has been discovered in the routine processing of hst fields throughthe medium deep survey pipeline, which fits simple galaxy models to broad bandfilter images of all objects detected in random survey fields using wfpc2.  we show that the lens configuration can be modeled using the gravitationalfield potential of a singular isothermal ellipsoidal mass distribution. withthis model the lensing potential is very similar, both in ellipticity andorientation, to the observed light distribution of the elliptical galaxy, aswould occur when stars are a tracer population. the model parameters andassociated errors have been derived by 2-dimensional analysis of the observedimages. the maximum likelihood procedure iteratively converges simultaneouslyon the model for the lensing elliptical galaxy and the source of the lensedcomponents. a systematic search is in progress for other gravitational lenscandidates in the hst medium deep survey. this should eventually lead to a goodstatistical estimate for lensing probabilities, and enable us to probe thecosmological component of the observed faint blue galaxy population.

astro-ph;9611105	a measurement of the cosmological constant using elliptical galaxies as  strong gravitational lenses	we have identified seven (field) elliptical galaxies acting as stronggravitational lenses and have used them to measure cosmological parameters. tofind the most likely value for omega_m (= omega_matter) and lambda, we haveused the combined probabilities of these lens systems having the observedcritical radii (or image deflection) for the measured or estimated values oflens redshifts, source redshifts, and lens magnitudes. our measurement giveslambda=0.64 (+0.15 -0.26) if omega_m + lambda = 1, and the omega_m = 1 model isexcluded at the 97 % confidence level. we also find, at the 68 % (omega = 0) --82 % (omega = 0.3) confidence level, that an open universe is less likely thana flat universe with non-zero lambda. except for the possibility of strongperturbations due to cluster potentials and the systematic overestimate of thelens magnitudes, other possible systematic errors do not seem to influence ourresults strongly: correction of possible systematic errors seems to increasethe significance of the result in favor of a non-zero lambda model.

0810.0529	galaxy clusters at 0.9&lt;z&lt;1.7 in the akari nep deep field	there is a huge gap between properties of red-sequence selected massivegalaxy clusters at z&lt;1 and lyman-break selected proto-clusters at z&gt;3. it isimportant to understand when and how the z&gt;3 proto-clusters evolve into passiveclusters at z&lt;1.  we aim to fill this cluster desert by using the space-based n4(4um) imagingwith the akari. the z'-n4 color is a powerful separator of cluster galaxies atz&gt;1, taking advantage of the 4000a break and the 1.6um bump. we carefullyselected 16 promising cluster candidates at 0.9&lt;z&lt;1.7, which all show obviousover-density of galaxies and a prominent red-sequence.  at this redshift range, the mid-infrared s15um/s9um flux ratio is anextinction-free indicator of galaxy star formation activity due to theredshifted pah emission lines (6.2,7.7 and 8.6um). we show statistically thatthe cluster galaxies have a lower s15um/s9um flux ratio than field galaxies,i.e., cluster galaxies already have lower star-formation activity at 0.9&lt;z&lt;1.7,pushing the formation epoch of these galaxy clusters to a higher redshift.

0812.2814	overdensities of galaxies at z ~ 3.7 in cdf-s	we report the discovery of possible overdensities of galaxies at z ~ 3.7 inthe chandra deep field south (cdf-s). these overdensities are identified fromthe photometric redshift selected sample, and the bvz-selected sample. oneover-density is identified in the proximity of 2 agns and lbgs at z=3.66 andz=3.70 at 7-sigma significance level. the other over-density is lesssignificant. it is identified around six z_{spec} ~ 3.6 galaxies at 3-sigmasignificance level. the line of sight velocity dispersions of theseoverdensities are found to be sigma_{v} ~ 500-800 km/sec, comparable to thevelocity dispersions of clusters of galaxies today. through the spectral energydistribution (sed) fitting, we find ~15 massive galaxies with m &gt; 10^{11}m_sunaround the z ~ 3.7 overdensity. the mass of the z ~ 3.7 overdensity is found tobe a few times 10^{14}m_sun. our result suggests that high redshift over-denseregions can be found in a supposedly blank field, and that the emergence ofmassive structures can be traced back to redshift as high as z ~ 3.7.
