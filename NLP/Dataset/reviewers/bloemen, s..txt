1005.2997	spin-resolved spectroscopy of the intermediate polar dq her	we present high-speed spectroscopic observations of the intermediate polar dqherculis. doppler tomography of two he i lines reveals a spiral densitystructure in the accretion disc around the white dwarf primary. the spiralslook very similar to the spirals seen in dwarf novae during outburst. dq her isthe first well established intermediate polar in which spirals are seen, thatare in addition likely persistent because of the system's high mass transferrate. spiral structures give an alternative explanation for sidebands of the wdspin frequency that are found in ip light curves. the doppler tomogram of he ii4686 indicates that a large part of the emission is not disc-like. spin trailsof spectra reveal a pulsation in the he ii 4686 emission that is believed toresult from reprocessing of x-rays from the white dwarf's magnetic poles in theaccretion flow close to the wd. we confirm the previous finding that thepulsation is only visible in the red-shifted part of the line when the beampoints to the back side of the disc. the absence of reprocessed light from thefront side of the disc can be explained by obscuration by the front rim of thedisc, but the absence of extra emission from the blue-shifted back side of thedisc is puzzling. reprocessing in accretion curtains can be an answer to theproblem and can also explain the highly non-keplerian velocity components thatare found in the he ii 4686 line. our spin trails can form a strong test forfuture accretion curtain models, with the possibility of distinguishing betweena spin period of 71s or 142s. spin trails of data taken at selected orbitalphases show little evidence for a significant contribution of the bright spotto the pulsations and allow us to exclude a recent suggestion that 71s is thebeat period and 70.8s the spin period.

1006.4267	2m1938+4603: a rich, multimode pulsating sdb star with an eclipsing dm  companion observed with kepler	2m1938+4603 (kic 9472174) displays a spectacular light curve dominated by astrong reflection effect and rather shallow, grazing eclipses. the orbitalperiod is 0.126 days, the second longest period yet found for an eclipsingsdb+dm, but still close to the minimum 0.1-d period among such systems. thephase-folded light curve was used to detrend the orbital effects from thedataset, and the resulting amplitude spectrum shows a rich collection ofpulsation peaks spanning frequencies from ~50 to 4500 uhz. the presence of acomplex pulsation spectrum in both the p-mode and the g-mode regions has neverbeen seen before in a compact pulsator. eclipsing sdb+dm stars are very rare,with only seven systems known and only one with a pulsating primary. pulsatingstars in eclipsing binaries are especially important since they permit massesderived from seismological model fits to be cross checked with orbital massconstraints. we present a first analysis of this star based on the kepler9.7-day commissioning light curve and extensive ground-based photometry andspectroscopy that allow us to set useful bounds on the system parameters. wederive a radial-velocity amplitude k_1 = 65.7 +/- 0.6 km/s, inclination angle i= 69.45 +/- 0.20 degrees, and find that the masses of the components are m_1 =0.48 +/- 0.03 and m_2 = 0.12 +/- 0.01 solar masses.

1007.3170	first kepler results on compact pulsators i. survey target selection and  the first pulsators	we present results from the first two quarters of a survey to search forpulsations in compact stellar objects with the kepler spacecraft. the surveysample and the various methods applied in its compilation are described, andspectroscopic observations are presented to separate the objects into accurateclasses. from the kepler photometry we clearly identify nine compact pulsators,and a number of interesting binary stars. of the pulsators, one shows thestrong, rapid pulsations typical for a v361 hya type sdb variable (sdbv), sevenshow long-period pulsations characteristic of v1093 her type sdbvs, and oneshows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. we deriveeffective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf b stars inthe sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdbpulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. for the stars hotter thanthis boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators (&lt;10 per cent) isconfirmed. interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitudemode in the long-period region, and several of the v1093 her pulsators show lowamplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviourmay be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature regionwhere hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.

1008.0553	first kepler results on compact pulsators v: slowly pulsating subdwarf b  stars in short-period binaries	the survey phase of the kepler mission includes a number of hot subdwarf b(sdb) stars to search for nonradial pulsations. we present our analysis of twosdb stars that are found to be g-mode pulsators of the v1093 her class. thesetwo stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdb starswith a close m-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day.because the orbital period is so short, the stars should be in synchronousrotation, and if so, the rotation period should imprint itself on the multipletstructure of the pulsations. however, we do not find clear evidence for suchrotational splitting. though the stars do show some frequency spacings that areconsistent with synchronous rotation, they also display multiplets withsplittings that are much smaller. longer-duration time series photometry willbe needed to determine if those small splittings are in fact rotationalsplitting, or caused by slow amplitude or phase modulation. further data shouldalso improve the signal-to-noise, perhaps revealing lower amplitudeperiodicities that could confirm the expectation of synchronous rotation. thepulsation periods seen in these stars show period spacings that are suggestiveof high-overtone g-mode pulsations.

1008.0582	first kepler results on compact pulsators iii: subdwarf b stars with  v1093~her and hybrid (dw~lyn) type pulsations	we present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in five hot subdwarf b (sdb)stars based on 27 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using thekepler spacecraft. we find that every sdb star cooler than $\approx 27\,500\,$kthat kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of thev1093~her (pg~1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods.the apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here.  the v1093~her periods range from one to 4.5~h and are associated with$g-$mode pulsations. three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of$p-$modes with periods of 2 to 5~m and in addition, these stars exhibitperiodicities between both classes from 15 to 45~m. we detect the coolest andlongest-period v1093~her-type pulsator to date, kic010670103 ($t_eff\approx20\,900\,$k, $p_max\approx 4.5$~h) as well as a suspected hybrid pulsator,kic002697388 which is extremely cool ($t_{\rm eff}\approx 23\,900\,$k) and forthe first time hybrid pulsators which have larger $g-$mode amplitudes than$p-$mode ones. all of these pulsators are quite rich with many frequencies andwe are able to apply asymptotic relationships to associate periodicities withmodes for kic010670103. kepler data are particularly well-suited for thesestudies as they are long-duration, extremely high duty cycle observations withwell-behaved noise properties.

1008.2356	first kepler results on compact pulsators ii: kic 010139564, a new  pulsating subdwarf b (v361 hya) star with an additional low-frequency mode	we present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in a hot subdwarf b starbased on 30.5 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using the\emph{kepler} spacecraft. kic 010139564 is found to be a short-period pulsatorof the v361 hya (ec 14026) class with more than 10 independent pulsation modeswhose periods range from 130 to 190 seconds. it also shows one periodicity at aperiod of 3165 seconds. if this periodicity is a high order g-mode, then thisstar may be the hottest member of the hybrid dw lyn stars. in addition to theresolved pulsation frequencies, additional periodic variations in the lightcurve suggest that a significant number of additional pulsation frequencies maybe present. the long duration of the run, the extremely high duty cycle, andthe well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of theperiodic variations, and to place strong constraints on how many of them areindependent stellar oscillation modes. we find that most of the identifiedperiodicities are indeed stable in phase and amplitude, suggesting a rotationperiod of 2-3 weeks for this star, but further observations are needed toconfirm this suspicion.

1010.2747	kepler observations of the beaming binary kpd 1946+4340	the kepler mission has acquired 33.5d of continuous one-minute photometry ofkpd 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of an sdb and a whitedwarf. in the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepestoccurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdb (0.4%) andthe more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdb eclipses the white dwarf. asexpected, the sdb is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. spectacularly, avery strong doppler beaming (aka doppler boosting) effect is also clearlyevident at the 0.1% level. this originates from the sdb's orbital velocity,which we measure to be 164.0\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. wepresent light curve models that account for all these effects, as well asgravitational lensing. we derive system parameters and uncertainties from thelight curve using markov chain monte carlo simulations. adopting a theoreticalwhite dwarf mass-radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be0.47\pm0.03 msun and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59\pm0.02 msun. theeffective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900\pm300k. with a spectroscopiceffective temperature of teff = 34 730\pm250k and a surface gravity of log g =5.43\pm0.04, the sdb is in a shell he burning stage. the detection of dopplerbeaming in kepler light curves potentially allows one to measure radialvelocities without the need of spectroscopic data. for the first time, aphotometrically observed doppler beaming amplitude is compared to aspectroscopically established value. the sdb's radial velocity amplitudederived from the photometry 168\pm4 km/s is in perfect agreement with thespectroscopic value. after subtracting our best model for the orbital effects,we searched the residuals for stellar oscillations but did not find anysignificant pulsation frequencies.

1101.4150	first kepler results on compact pulsators vi. targets in the final half  of the survey phase	we present results from the final six months of a survey to search forpulsations in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf stars with the kepler spacecraft.spectroscopic observations are used to separate the objects into accurateclasses, and we explore the physical parameters of the subdwarf b (sdb) starsand white dwarfs in the sample. from the kepler photometry and ourspectroscopic data, we find that the sample contains 5 new pulsators of thev1093 her type, one am cvn type cataclysmic variable, and a number of otherbinary systems. this completes the survey for compact pulsators with kepler. nov361 hya type of short-period pulsating sdb stars were found in this half,leaving us with a total of one single multiperiodic v361 hya and 13 v1093 herpulsators for the full survey. except for the sdb pulsators, no other clearlypulsating hot subdwarfs or white dwarfs were found, although a fewlow-amplitude candidates still remain. the most interesting targets discoveredin this survey will be observed throughout the remainder of the kepler mission,providing the most long-term photometric datasets ever made on such compact,evolved stars. asteroseismic investigations of these datasets will beinvaluable in revealing the interior structure of these stars, and will boostour understanding of their evolutionary history.

1202.0686	discovery of a stripped red giant core in a bright eclipsing binary star	we report the serendipitous discovery from wasp archive photometry of abinary star in which an apparently normal a-type star (j0247-25a) eclipses asmaller, hotter subdwarf star (j0247-25b). the kinematics of j0247-25a showthat it is a blue-straggler member of the galactic thick-disk. we presentfollow-up photometry and spectroscopy from which we derive approximate valuesfor the mass, radius and luminosity for j0247-25b assuming that j0247-25a hasthe mass appropriate for a normal thick-disk star. we find that the propertiesof j0247-25b are well matched by models for a red giant stripped of its outerlayers and currently in a shell hydrogen-burning stage. in this scenario,j0247-25b will go on to become a low mass white dwarf (m~0.25 solar masses)composed mostly of helium. j0247-25b can be studied in much greater detail thanthe handful of pre helium white dwarfs (pre-he-wd) identified to-date. theseresults have been published by maxted et al., 2011. we also present apreliminary analysis of more recent observations of j0247-25 with the uvesspectrograph, from which we derive much improved masses for both stars in thebinary. we find that both stars are more massive than expected and thatj0247-25a rotates sub-synchronously by a factor of about 2. we also presentlightcurves for 5 new eclipsing pre-he-wd subsequently identified from the wasparchive photometry, 4 of which have mass estimates for the subdwarf companionbased on a pair of radial velocity measurements.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1202.5553	mass ratio from doppler beaming and r{\o}mer delay versus ellipsoidal  modulation in the kepler data of koi-74	we present a light curve analysis and radial velocity study of koi-74, aneclipsing a star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. aside from newspectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publiclyavailable kepler observations and present the first complete light curvefitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidalmodulation, reflection, and doppler beaming. markov chain monte carlosimulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertaintyestimates. our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that wefind an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower thanthe previously published value. we find that the mass ratio derived from theradial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived fromthe ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). this wasfound before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even largerthan previously reported. accounting for the rapid rotation of the a-star isfound to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio toq=0.047 \pm 0.004. these results indicate that one has to be extremely carefulin using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary todetermine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.the radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected doppler beaming inthe light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radialvelocity determination. we also report the first measurement of r{\o}mer delayin a light curve of a compact binary. this delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and isconsistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. thefirm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubtthat the companion of koi-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

1206.3841	a pulsation zoo in the hot subdwarf b star kic 10139564 observed by  kepler	we present our analyses of 15 months of kepler data on kic 10139564. wedetected 57 periodicities with a variety of properties not previously observedall together in one pulsating subdwarf b star. ten of the periodicities werefound in the low-frequency region, and we associate them with nonradialg-modes. the other periodicities were found in the high-frequency region, whichare likely p-modes. we discovered that most of the periodicities are componentsof multiplets with a common spacing. assuming that multiplets are caused byrotation, we derive a rotation period of 25.6(1.8) days. the multiplets alsoallow us to identify the pulsations to an unprecedented extent for this classof pulsator. we also detect l&lt;=2 multiplets, which are sensitive to thepulsation inclination and can constrain limb darkening via geometriccancellation factors. while most periodicities are stable, we detected severalregions that show complex patterns. detailed analyses showed these regions arecomplicated by several factors. two are combination frequencies that originatein the supernyquist region and were found to be reflected below the nyquistfrequency. the fourier peaks are clear in the supernyquist region, but theorbital motion of kepler smears the nyquist frequency in the barycentricreference frame and this effect is passed on to the subnyquist reflections.others are likely multiplets but unstable in amplitudes and/or frequencies. thedensity of periodicities also make kic 10139564 challenging to explain usingpublished models. this menagerie of properties should provide tight constraintson structural models, making this subdwarf b star the most promising forapplying asteroseismology.

1206.3872	three ways to solve the orbit of kic11558725: a 10 day beaming sdb+wd  binary with a pulsating subdwarf	the recently discovered subdwarf b (sdb) pulsator kic11558725 features a richg-mode frequency spectrum, with a few low-amplitude p-modes at short periods,and is a promising target for a seismic study aiming to constrain the internalstructure of this star, and of sdb stars in general.  we have obtained ground-based spectroscopic balmer-line radial-velocitymeasurements of kic11558725, spanning the 2010 and 2011 observing seasons. fromthese data we have discovered that kic11558725 is a binary with period p=10.05d, and that the radial-velocity amplitude of the sdb star is 58 km/s.consequently the companion of the sdb star has a minimum mass of 0.63 m\odot,and is therefore most likely an unseen white dwarf.  we analyse the near-continuous 2010-2011 kepler light curve to reveal orbitaldoppler-beaming light variations at the 238 ppm level, which is consistent withthe observed spectroscopic orbital radial-velocity amplitude of the subdwarf.we use the strongest 70 pulsation frequencies in the kepler light curve of thesubdwarf as clocks to derive a third consistent measurement of the orbitalradial-velocity amplitude, from the orbital light-travel delay.  we use our high signal-to-noise average spectra to study the atmosphericparameters of the sdb star, deriving teff = 27 910k and log g = 5.41 dex, andfind that carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are underabundant relative to the solarmixture.  furthermore, we extract more than 160 significant frequencies from the keplerlight curve. we investigate the pulsation frequencies for expected periodspacings and rotational splittings. we find period-spacing sequences ofspherical-harmonic degrees \ell=1 and \ell=2, and we associate a large fractionof the g-modes in kic11558725 with these sequences. from frequency splittingswe conclude that the subdwarf is rotating subsynchronously with respect to theorbit.

1209.3336	spin down of the core rotation in red giants	the space mission kepler provides us with long and uninterrupted photometrictime series of red giants. we are now able to probe the rotational behaviour intheir deep interiors using the observations of mixed modes. we aim to measurethe rotational splittings in red giants and to derive scaling relations forrotation related to seismic and fundamental stellar parameters. we havedeveloped a dedicated method for automated measurements of the rotationalsplittings in a large number of red giants. ensemble asteroseismology, namelythe examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of theirevolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. we havemeasured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. we havealso shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. under theassumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, weobserve a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giantbranch. alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump starscompared to the red giant branch. we also show that, at fixed stellar radius,the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. ensembleasteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: ourinterpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusionthat the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giantphase. the slow-down occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. thisspinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured inwhite dwarfs

1306.6011	atmospheric parameters of 169 f, g, k and m-type stars in the kepler  field	the asteroseismic and planetary studies, like all research related to stars,need precise and accurate stellar atmospheric parameters as input. we aim atderiving the effective temperature (teff), the surface gravity (log g), themetallicity ([fe/h]), the projected rotational velocity (v sin i) and the mktype for 169 f, g, k, and m-type kepler targets which were observedspectroscopically from the ground with five different instruments. we use twodifferent spectroscopic methods to analyse 189 high-resolution,high-signal-to-noise spectra acquired for the 169 stars. for 67 stars, thespectroscopic atmospheric parameters are derived for the ?first time. kic9693187 and 11179629 are discovered to be double-lined spectroscopic binarysystems. the results obtained for those stars for which independentdeterminations of the atmospheric parameters are available in the literatureare used for a comparative analysis. as a result, we show that for solar-typestars the accuracy of present determinations of atmospheric parameters is +/-150 k in teff, +/- 0.15 dex in [fe/h], and +/-? 0.3 dex in log g. finally, wecon?rm that the curve-of-growth analysis and the method of spectral synthesisyield systematically different atmospheric parameters when they are applied tostars hotter than 6,000 k.

1310.4863	el cvn-type binaries - discovery of 17 helium white dwarf precursors in  bright eclipsing binary star systems	the star 1swasp j024743.37-251549.2 was recently discovered to be a binarystar in which an a-type dwarf star eclipses the remnant of a disrupted redgiant star (wasp0247-25b). the remnant is in a rarely-observed state evolvingto higher effective temperatures at nearly constant luminosity prior tobecoming a very low-mass white dwarf composed almost entirely of helium, i.e.,it is a pre-he-wd. we have used the wasp photometric database to find 17eclipsing binary stars with orbital periods p=0.7 to 2.2 days with similarlightcurves to 1swasp j024743.37-251549.2. the only star in this grouppreviously identified as a variable star is the brightest one, el cvn, which weadopt as the prototype for this class of eclipsing binary star. thecharacteristic lightcurves of el cvn-type stars show a total eclipse by ana-type dwarf star of a smaller, hotter star and a secondary eclipse ofcomparable depth to the primary eclipse. we have used new spectroscopicobservations for 6 of these systems to confirm that the companions to thea-type stars in these binaries have very low masses (approximately 0.2 solarmasses). this includes the companion to el cvn which was not previously knownto be a pre-he-wd. el cvn-type binary star systems will enable us to study theformation of very low-mass white dwarfs in great detail, particularly in thosecases where the pre-he-wd star shows non-radial pulsations similar to thoserecently discovered in wasp0247-25b.

1312.4500	pulsating red giant stars in eccentric binary systems discovered from  kepler space-based photometry	the unparalleled photometric data obtained by nasa's kepler space telescopeled to an improved understanding of red giant stars and binary stars.seismology allows us to constrain the properties of red giants. in addition toeclipsing binaries, eccentric non-eclipsing binaries, exhibiting ellipsoidalmodulations, have been detected with kepler. we aim to study the properties ofeccentric binary systems containing a red giant star and derive the parametersof the primary giant component. we apply asteroseismic techniques to determinemasses and radii of the primary component of each system. for a selectedtarget, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques are applied toextract the parameters of the system. the effects of stellar on the binarysystem are studied. the paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radiiwere constrained. the orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to440days. from radial velocity measurements we find eccentricities between e=0.2to 0.76. as a case study we present a detailed analysis of kic5006817. fromseismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least165 d, roughly twice the orbital period. the stellar core rotates 13 timesfaster than the surface. from the spectrum and radial velocities we expect thatthe doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300ppm in thelight curve. through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondarycomponent to be 0.29$\pm$0.03\,$m_\odot$. for kic5006817 we excludepseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. the comparison ofthe results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possiblealignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2$\sigma$ level. red gianteccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hotsubdwarf b stars.

1312.6997	magnetic activity of f stars observed by kepler	the study of stellar activity is important because it can provide newconstraints for dynamo models, when combined with surface rotation rates andthe depth of the convection zone. we know that the dynamo mechanism, which isbelieved to be the main process to rule the magnetic cycle of solar-like starsat least, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation,convection, and magnetic field. the kepler mission has been collecting data fora large number of stars during 4 years allowing us to investigate magneticstellar cycles. we investigated the kepler light curves to look for magneticactivity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. based on the photometricdata we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magneticactivity of the stars. we selected a sample of 22 solar-like f stars that havea rotation period smaller than 12 days. we performed a time-frequency analysisusing the morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy. we computed the magneticindex s_ph as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index&lt;s_ph&gt; that is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of lengthfive times the rotation period of the star. we defined new indicators to takeinto account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for allthe stars, such as the contrast between high and low activity. we also inferredthe rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background. thisanalysis shows different types of behaviours in the 22 f stars. two stars showbehaviours very similar to magnetic activity cycles. five stars show long-livedspots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. twostars of our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in thetemporal variation of the magnetic proxies. finally the last group of starsshow magnetic activity (with presence of spots) but no sign of cycle.

1410.8178	detecting non-uniform period spacings in the kepler photometry of gamma  doradus stars: methodology and case studies	context. the analysis of stellar oscillations is one of the most reliableways to probe stellar interiors. recent space missions such as kepler haveprovided us with an opportunity to study these oscillations with unprecedenteddetail. for many multi-periodic pulsators such as {\gamma} doradus stars, thisled to the detection of dozens to hundreds of oscillation frequencies thatcould not be found from ground-based observations. aims. we aim to detectnon-uniform period spacings in the fourier spectra of a sample of {\gamma}doradus stars observed by kepler. such detection is complicated by both thelarge number of significant frequencies in the space photometry and byoverlapping non-equidistant rotationally split multiplets. methods. guided bytheoretical properties of gravity-mode oscillation of {\gamma} doradus stars,we developed a period-spacing detection method and applied it to keplerobservations of a few stars, after having tested the performance fromsimulations. results. the application of the technique resulted in the cleardetection of non-uniform period spacing series for three out of the fivetreated kepler targets. disadvantages of the technique are also discussed, andinclude the disability to distinguish between different values of the sphericaldegree and azimuthal order of the oscillation modes without additionaltheoretical modelling. conclusions. despite the shortcomings, the method isshown to allow solid detections of period spacings for {\gamma} doradus stars,which will allow future asteroseismic analyses of these stars.

1410.8310	narrow-band search of continuous gravitational-wave signals from crab  and vela pulsars in virgo vsr4 data	in this paper we present the results of a coherent narrow-band search forcontinuous gravitational-wave signals from the crab and vela pulsars conductedon virgo vsr4 data. in order to take into account a possible small mismatchbetween the gravitational wave frequency and two times the star rotationfrequency, inferred from measurement of the electromagnetic pulse rate, a rangeof 0.02 hz around two times the star rotational frequency has been searched forboth the pulsars. no evidence for a signal has been found and 95$\%$ confidencelevel upper limits have been computed both assuming polarization parameters arecompletely unknown and that they are known with some uncertainty, as derivedfrom x-ray observations of the pulsar wind torii. for vela the upper limits arecomparable to the spin-down limit, computed assuming that all the observedspin-down is due to the emission of gravitational waves. for crab the upperlimits are about a factor of two below the spin-down limit, and represent asignificant improvement with respect to past analysis. this is the first timethe spin-down limit is significantly overcome in a narrow-band search.

1510.03474	a search of the orion spur for continuous gravitational waves using a  "loosely coherent" algorithm on data from ligo interferometers	we report results of a wideband search for periodic gravitational waves fromisolated neutron stars within the orion spur towards both the inner and outerregions of our galaxy. as gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter,the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. one search disk(a) is $6.87^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29"$, and the other(b) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151"$. we explored thefrequency range of 50-1500 hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times10^{-9}$ hz/s. a multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probingmore deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence lengthwith every stage.  rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70candidates, to be examined manually. none of those 70 candidates proved to beconsistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidencelevel upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. near $169$hz we achieve our lowest 95% cl upper limit on worst-case linearly polarizedstrain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of ourfrequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ forall polarizations and sky locations.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

1511.06160	internal rotation of the red-giant star kic 4448777 by means of  asteroseismic inversion	in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the earlyred-giant star kic 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of thedipole mixed modes obtained from {\it kepler} observations. in order toovercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods toextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. we find not onlythat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversionresults generated for other red giants (deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but wealso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core witha spatial resolution of $\delta r=0.001r$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharpdiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (deheuvels et al. 2014). theresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity ofabout $\langle\omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nhz and provide evidence for anangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part ofthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize therotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. theangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burningshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reachingan average value in the convective envelope of$\langle\omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nhz. hence, the core in kic~4448777 isrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficientto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the densecore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiativeregion and in the convective envelope.
