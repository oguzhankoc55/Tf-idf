0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

1001.5322	morphological classification of galaxies and its relation to physical  properties	we extend a recently developed galaxy morphology classification method,quantitative multiwavelength morphology (qmm), to connect galaxy morphologiesto their underlying physical properties. the traditional classification ofgalaxies approaches the problem separately through either morphologicalclassification or, in more recent times, through analysis of physicalproperties. a combined approach has significant potential in producing aconsistent and accurate classification scheme as well as shedding light on theorigin and evolution of galaxy morphology. here we present an analysis of avolume limited sample of 31703 galaxies from the fourth data release of thesloan digital sky survey. we use an image analysis method called pixel-z toextract the underlying physical properties of the galaxies, which is thenquantified using the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (cas) parameters.the galaxies also have their multiwavelength morphologies quantified using qmm,and these results are then related to the distributed physical propertiesthrough a regression analysis. we show that this method can be used to relatethe spatial distribution of physical properties with the morphologicalproperties of galaxies.

1009.0614	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): survey diagnostics and core data  release	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has been operating since february2008 on the 3.9-m anglo-australian telescope using the aaomega fibre-fedspectrograph facility to acquire spectra with a resolution of r~1300 for120,862 sdss selected galaxies. the target catalogue constitutes threecontiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (g09), 12h (g12) and 14.5h (g15)each of 12 x 4 sq.deg to limiting fluxes of r &lt; 19.4, r &lt; 19.8, and r &lt; 19.4mag respectively (and additional limits at other wavelengths). spectra andreliable redshifts have been acquired for over 98 per cent of the galaxieswithin these limits. here we present the survey footprint, progression, datareduction, redshifting, re-redshifting, an assessment of data quality after 3years, additional image analysis products (including ugrizyjhk photometry,sersic profiles and photometric redshifts), observing mask, and construction ofour core survey catalogue (gamacore). from this we create three science readycatalogues: gamacoredr1 for public release, which includes data acquired duringyear 1 of operations within specified magnitude limits (february 2008 to april2008); gamacoremainsurvey containing all data above our survey limits for useby the gama team and collaborators; and gamacoreatlassv containing year 1, 2and 3 data matched to herschel-atlas science demonstration data. thesecatalogues along with the associated spectra, stamps and profiles can beaccessed via the gama website: http://www.gama-survey.org/

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1106.1994	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the gama galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1)	using the complete gama-i survey covering ~142 sq. deg. to r=19.4, of which~47 sq. deg. is to r=19.8, we create the gama-i galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1),generated using a friends-of-friends (fof) based grouping algorithm. ouralgorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock gama lightcones,constructed from lambda-cdm n-body simulations populated with semi-analyticgalaxies. recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopersand are median unbiased in the most important respects. g3cv1 contains 14,388galaxy groups (with multiplicity &gt;= 2$), including 44,186 galaxies out of apossible 110,192 galaxies, implying ~40% of all galaxies are assigned to agroup. the similarities of the mock group catalogues and g3cv1 are multiple:global characteristics are in general well recovered. however, we do find anoticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in gama comparedto the mocks. additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatialcompleteness, g3cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with 5 or moremembers, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. thesetwo differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included ofthe current gama lightcone mock. further studies using a variety of galaxyformation models are required to confirm their exact origin.

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1205.3368	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy environments and star formation  rate variations	we present a detailed investigation into the effects of galaxy environment ontheir star formation rates (sfr) using galaxies observed in the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). we use three independent volume-limited samples ofgalaxies within z &lt; 0.2 and mr &lt; -17.8. we investigate the known sfr-densityrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of sfr on stellar mass anddensity. we show that the sfr-density trend is only visible when we include thepassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. thissfr-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-formingpopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. while there is a strongdependence of the ewh?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that thesetrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationshipis absent when considering a "star-forming" sample of galaxies. we find thatstellar mass has the strongest influence on sfr and ewh?a with the environmenthaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the starforming population. we also show that the sfr-density relationship is absentfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. we conclude that thestellar mass has the largest impact on the current sfr of a galaxy, and anyenvironmental effect is not detectable. the observation that the trends withdensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies thatthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the sfr in infallinggalaxies. alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into denseenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1208.4293	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): in search of milky-way magellanic cloud  analogues	analysing all galaxy and mass assembly (gama) galaxies within a factor two(+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the milky way (mw), there is a 11.9%chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within aprojected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is atleast as massive as the large magellanic cloud (lmc). two close companions atleast as massive as the small magellanic cloud (smc) are rare at the 3.4%level. two full analogues to the mw- lmc-smc system were found in gama (allgalaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of closetogether, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of mw massgalaxies (in the range where we could observe both the lmc and smc) have such asystem. in summary, the mw-lmc-smc system is a 2.7? event (when recast intogaussian statistics).  using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference forsmc- lmc binary pair analogues to be located within 2 mpc of a range ofdifferent lumi- nosity groups. there is a particular preference is for suchbinaries to be located near lg luminosity systems. when these groups aresubdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, thebinaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gapsystems. these systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer thesame amount of gravitational dark matter. this suggests that binaries such asthe smc-lmc might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorousmerger events. details of a particularly striking analogue to the mw-smc-lmcand m31 complex are included.

1208.6306	the atlas 5.5 ghz survey of the extended chandra deep field south:  catalogue, source counts and spectral indices	star forming galaxies are thought to dominate the sub-mjy radio population,but recent work has shown that low luminosity agn can still make a significantcontribution to the faint radio source population. spectral indices are animportant tool for understanding the emission mechanism of the faint radiosources. we have observed the extended chandra deep field south at 5.5 ghzusing a mosaic of 42 pointings with the australia telescope compact array(atca). our image reaches an almost uniform sensitivity of ~12 microjy rms over0.25 deg^2 with a restoring beam of 4.9 x 2.0 arcsec, making it one of thedeepest 6cm surveys to date. we present the 5.5 ghz catalogue and source countsfrom this field. we take advantage of the large amounts of ancillary data inthis field to study the 1.4 to 5.5 ghz spectral indices of the sub-mjypopulation. for the full 5.5 ghz selected sample we find a flat median spectralindex, alpha_med = -0.40, which is consistent with previous results. however,the spectral index appears to steepen at the faintest flux density levels(s_{5.5 ghz} &lt; 0.1 mjy), where alpha_med = -0.68. we performed stackinganalysis of the faint 1.4 ghz selected sample (40 &lt; s_{1.4 ghz} &lt; 200 microjy)and also find a steep average spectral index, alpha = -0.8, consistent withsynchrotron emission. we find a weak trend of steepening spectral index withredshift. several young agn candidates are identified using spectral indices,suggesting gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) sources are as common in the mjypopulation as they are at jy levels.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1301.7129	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the life and times of l* galaxies	in this work we investigate in detail the effects local environment (groupsand pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the milky-way (l*galaxies). a volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determineemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. this sampleallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass andgroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.  we observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role inshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is ingathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. dominant pairgalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratiois close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in anunpaired system. the minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by itscompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressedrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower stillwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.  we find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as afunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. we find evidence of alocal peak of interactions for milky-way stellar mass galaxies in milky-wayhalo mass groups. low mass halos, and in particular local group mass halos, arean important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of aunit of stellar mass.  we find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission classconformity is dominant in pairs. this suggests that group scale conformity isthe result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilstpair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1302.4276	gama/h-atlas: linking the properties of sub-mm detected and undetected  early-type galaxies: i. z$\le$0.06 sample	we present two large, nearby (0.013$\le$z$\le$0.06) samples of early-typegalaxies (etgs): a visually classified sample of 220 etgs, created usingsource-matched data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) database withfir/sub-mm detections from $herschel$-atlas; and a visually classified sampleof 551 etgs which are undetected with $herschel$-atlas. active galactic nuclei(agn) are removed from our samples using optical emission line diagnostics.these samples are scrutinised to determine characteristics of sub-mm detectedversus undetected etgs. we find similarities in the stellar mass distributionsof the two etg samples but testing other properties uncovers significantdifferences. the sub-mm detected sample is shown to have lower concentrationand s\'ersic indices than those in the undetected sample - a result which maybe linked to the presence of dust in the former. optical and uv-optical coloursare also shown to be much bluer, indicating that the dust is linked with recentstar formation. the intrinsic effective radii are on average 1.5 times largerfor the sub-mm detected etgs. surface densities and groups data from the gamadatabase are examined for the two samples, leading to the conclusion that dustyetgs inhabit sparser environments than non-dusty etgs in the nearby universe,although environments of the brightest etgs are shown to differ the least.modified planck functions are fit to the h-atlas detected pacs and spire fluxesfor etgs with sub-mm flux densities of at least 3$\sigma$ in the 350$\mu$mspire band, giving a resultant mean cold dust temperature of t$_{d}$=22.1k,with a range of 9-30k. the corresponding mean dust mass is1.8$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$, with a range of(0.08-35.0)$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$. the dust masses calculated from thesefits, normalised by stellar mass, are shown to increase with decreasing stellarmass and bluer colours.

1304.3889	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the connection between metals,  specific-sfr, and hi gas in galaxies: the z-ssfr relation	we study the interplay between gas phase metallicity (z), specific starformation rate (ssfr) and neutral hydrogen gas (hi) for galaxies of differentstellar masses. our study uses spectroscopic data from gama and sdss starforming galaxies, as well as hi-detection from the alfalfa and gass publiccatalogues. we present a model based on the z-ssfr relation that shows that ata given stellar mass, depending on the amount of gas, galaxies will followopposite behaviours. low-mass galaxies with a large amount of gas will showhigh ssfr and low metallicities, while low-mass galaxies with small amounts ofgas will show lower ssfr and high metallicities. in contrast, massive galaxieswith a large amount of gas will show moderate ssfr and high metallicities,while massive galaxies with small amounts of gas will show low ssfr and lowmetallicities. using alfalfa and gass counterparts, we find that the amount ofgas is related to those drastic differences in z and ssfr for galaxies of asimilar stellar mass.

1305.5308	galaxy and mass assembly: evolution of the halpha luminosity function  and star formation rate density up to z&lt;0.35	measurements of the low-z halpha luminosity function have a large dispersionin the local number density of sources, and correspondingly in the sfr density.the possible causes for these discrepancies include limited volume sampling,biases arising from survey sample selection, different methods of correctingfor dust obscuration and agn contamination. the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and sloan digital sky survey (sdss) provide deep spectroscopicobservations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample ofstar-forming galaxies spanning 0.001&lt;sfr(halpha)&lt;100 with which to robustlymeasure the evolution of the sfr density in the low-z universe. the largenumber of high sfr galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurementof the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease innumber density of sources at bright luminosities is best described by asaunders functional form rather than the traditional schechter function. thisresult is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the fir andradio. for gama and sdss we find the r-band apparent magnitude limit, combinedwith the subsequent requirement for halpha detection leads to an incompletenessdue to missing bright halpha sources with faint r-band magnitudes.

1306.1583	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): a deeper view of the mass, metallicity,  and sfr relationships	a full appreciation of the role played by gas metallicity (z), star-formationrate (sfr), and stellar mass is fundamental to understanding how galaxies formand evolve. the connections between these three parameters at differentredshifts significantly affect galaxy evolution, and thus provide importantconstraints for galaxy evolution models. using data from the sloan digital skysurvey-data release 7 (sdss-dr7) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)surveys we study the relationships and dependencies between sfr, z, and stellarmass, as well as the fundamental plane for star-forming galaxies. we combineboth surveys using volume-limited samples up to a redshift of z ~ 0.36. thegama and sdss surveys complement each other when analyzing the relationshipsbetween sfr, mass and z. we present evidence for sfr and metallicity evolutionto z ~ 0.2. we study the dependencies between sfr, mass, z, and specificstar-formation rate (ssfr) on the m-z, m-sfr, m-ssfr, z-sfr, and z-ssfrrelations, finding strong correlations between all. based on thosedependencies, we propose a simple model that allows us to explain the differentbehaviour observed between low and high mass galaxies. finally, our analysisallows us to confirm the existence of a fundamental plane, for which mass=f(z,sfr) in star-forming galaxies.

1306.2424	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): linking star formation histories and  stellar mass growth	we present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (m* &lt;10^10 msun) galaxies from observations within the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. for ~73,000 galaxies between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, we calculate starformation rates (sfr) and specific star formation rates (ssfr = sfr/m*) fromspectroscopic halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived frombalmer decrements. we find a dependence of ssfr on stellar mass, such thatssfrs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and forthe full sample, ssfrs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. we usesimple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories toinvestigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale andthe formation redshift. we find that parametrizations previously fit to samplesof z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of ssfrs and stellar massesobserved in the gama sample between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32. in particular, a large numberof low-mass (m* &lt; 10^10 msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher ssfrsthan can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. for such alarge number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such highssfrs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining sfhwith stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.

1306.5752	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): witnessing the assembly of the cluster  abell 1882	we present a combined optical and x-ray analysis of the rich cluster abell1882 with the aim of identifying merging substructure and understanding therecent assembly history of this system. our optical data consist of spectradrawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey, which lends itself tothis kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopiccompleteness. we use 283 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detectand characterize substructure. we complement the optical data with x-ray datataken with both chandra and xmm. our analysis reveals that a1882 harbors twomain components, a1882a and a1882b, which have a projected separation of 2mpcand a line of sight velocity difference of v_{los}=-428km/s. the primarysystem, a1882a, has velocity dispersion sigma_v=500km/s and chandra (xmm)temperature kt=3.57kev (3.31kev) while the secondary, a1882b, hassigma_v=457km/s and chandra (xmm) temperature kt=2.39kev (2.12kev). the opticaland x-ray estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within theuncertainties and indicate that there is twice as much mass in a1882a(m_{500}=1.5-1.9x10^{14}msolar) when compared with a1882b(m_{500}=0.8-1.0x10^{14}msolar). we interpret the a1882a/a1882b system as beingobserved prior to a core passage. supporting this interpretation is the largeprojected separation of a1882a and a1882b and the dearth of evidence for arecent (&lt;2gyr) major interaction in the x-ray data. two-body analyses indicatethat a1882a and a1882b form a bound system with bound incoming solutionsstrongly favored. we compute blue fractions of f_b=0.28 and 0.18 for thespectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within r_{500} of the centers ofa1882a and a1882b, respectively. these blue fractions do not differsignificantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusterswith similar mass and redshift.

1308.2985	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): resolving the role of environment in  galaxy evolution	we present observations of 18 galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey made with the spiral optical integral field unit (ifu) on theanglo-australian telescope. the galaxies are selected to have a narrow range instellar mass (6x10^9msolar &lt; m* &lt;2x10^10 msolar) in order to focus on theeffects of environment. local galaxy environments are measured quantitativelyusing 5th nearest neighbour surface densities. we find that the total starformation rates (sfr) measured from the ifu data are consistent with total sfrsmeasured from aperture correcting either gama or sloan digital sky surveysingle-fibre observations. the mean differences are sfr_gama/sfr_ifu =1.26+/-0.23, sigma=0.90 and for the sloan digital sky survey we similarly findsfr_brinchmann/sfr_ifu = 1.34+/-0.17, sigma=0.67. examining the relationshipswith environment, we find off-centre and clumpy halpha emission is notsignificantly dependent on environment, being present in 2/7 (29^+20_-11 percent) galaxies in high-density environments (&gt;0.77 mpc^-2), and 5/11(45^+15_-13 per cent) galaxies in low-density environments (&lt;0.77 mpc^-2). wefind a weak but not significant relationship of the total star formation ratesof star-forming galaxies with environment. due to the size of our sample andthe scatter observed we do not draw a definitive conclusion about a possiblesfr dependence on environment. examining the spatial distribution of the halphaemission, we find no evidence for a change in shape or amplitude of the radialprofile of star-forming galaxies with environment. if these observations areborne out in larger samples this would infer that any environment-drivenstar-formation suppression must either act very rapidly (the`infall-and-quench' model) or that galaxies must evolve in a density-dependentmanner (an `in-situ evolution' model).

1401.0837	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mid-infrared properties and empirical  relations from $wise$	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey furnishes a deep redshift catalogthat, when combined with the wide-field infrared explorer ($wise$), allows usto explore for the first time the mid-infrared properties of $&gt; 110, 000$galaxies over 120 deg$^2$ to $z\simeq 0.5$. in this paper we detail theprocedure for producing the matched gama-$wise$ catalog for the g12 and g15fields, in particular characterising and measuring resolved sources; thecomplete catalogs for all three gama equatorial fields will be made availablethrough the gama public releases. the wealth of multiwavelength photometry andoptical spectroscopy allows us to explore empirical relations between opticallydetermined stellar mass (derived from synthetic stellar population models) and3.4micron and 4.6micron wise measurements. similarly dust-correctedhalpha-derived star formation rates can be compared to 12micron and 22micronluminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples to$z&lt;0.5$. to illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12micronstar formation prescription to investigate the behavior of specific starformation within the gama-wise sample and underscore the ability of wise todetect star-forming systems at $z\sim0.5$. within galaxy groups (determined bya sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies witha neighbor within 100$\,h^{-1} $kpc have, on average, lower specific starformation rates than typical gama galaxies with the same stellar mass.

1402.4139	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): testing galaxy formation models through  the most massive galaxies in the universe	we have analysed the growth of brightest group galaxies and brightest clustergalaxies (bggs/bcgs) over the last 3 billion years using a large sample of 883galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly survey. by comparing the stellarmass of bggs and bcgs in groups and clusters of similar dynamical masses, wefind no significant growth between redshift $z=0.27$ and $z=0.09$. we alsoexamine the number of bggs/bcgs that have line emission, finding thatapproximately 65 per cent of bggs/bcgs show h$\alpha$ in emission. from thegalaxies where the necessary spectroscopic lines were accurately recovered (54per cent of the sample), we find that half of this (i.e. 27 per cent of thesample) harbour on-going star formation with rates up to$10\,$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample)have an active nucleus (agn) at the centre. bggs are more likely to haveongoing star formation, while bcgs show a higher fraction of agn activity. byexamining the position of the bggs/bcgs with respect to their host dark matterhalo we find that around 13 per cent of them do not lie at the centre of thedark matter halo. this could be an indicator of recent cluster-cluster mergers.we conclude that bggs and bcgs acquired their stellar mass rapidly at higherredshifts as predicted by semi-analytic models, mildly slowing down at lowredshifts.

1409.7396	galaxy evolution across the optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams?	the discovery of the m-sigma relation, the local galaxy bimodality, and thelink between black-hole and host-galaxy properties, have raised the questionwhether agn play a role in galaxy evolution. several theoretical modelsimplement agn feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, andpossibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies intopassive ellipticals. to understand the importance of agn feedback, a study ofthe agn populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial. a mass sequencelinking star-forming galaxies and agn has been already noted in previous works,and it is now investigated as possible evolutionary sequence. we observed asample of 119 intermediate-redshift (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.4) sdss-first radio emitters withthe effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 and 10.45 ghz and obtained spectralindices. we find indications of spectral index flattening in high-metallicitystar-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, and seyferts. this "flatteningsequence" along the [nii]-based emission-line diagnostic diagram is consistentwith the hardening of galaxy ionizing field, due to nuclear activity. aftercombining our data with first measurements at 1.4 ghz, we find that thethree-point radio spectra of seyferts and liners show substantial differences,attributable to small radio core components and larger (arcsecond sized)jet/lobe components, respectively. a visual inspection of first images seems toconfirm this hypothesis. galaxies along this sequence are hypothesized to betransitioning from the active star-forming galaxies (blue cloud) to the passiveelliptical galaxies (red sequence). this supports the suggestion that agn playa role in shutting down star-formation, and allow the transition from onegalaxy class to the other.

1507.00735	dark matter halo properties of gama galaxy groups from 100 square  degrees of kids weak lensing data	the kilo-degree survey (kids) is an optical wide-field survey designed to mapthe matter distribution in the universe using weak gravitational lensing. inthis paper, we use these data to measure the density profiles and masses of asample of $\sim \mathrm{1400}$ spectroscopically identified galaxy groups andclusters from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we detect a highlysignificant signal (signal-to-noise-ratio $\sim$ 120), allowing us to study theproperties of dark matter haloes over one and a half order of magnitude inmass, from $m \sim 10^{13}-10^{14.5} h^{-1}\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$. we interpretthe results for various subsamples of groups using a halo model framework whichaccounts for the mis-centring of the brightest cluster galaxy (used as thetracer of the group centre) with respect to the centre of the group's darkmatter halo. we find that the density profiles of the haloes are well describedby an nfw profile with concentrations that agree with predictions fromnumerical simulations. in addition, we constrain scaling relations between themass and a number of observable group properties. we find that the mass scaleswith the total r-band luminosity as a power-law with slope $1.16 \pm 0.13$(1-sigma) and with the group velocity dispersion as a power-law with slope$1.89 \pm 0.27$ (1-sigma). finally, we demonstrate the potential of weaklensing studies of groups to discriminate between models of baryonic feedbackat group scales by comparing our results with the predictions from thecosmo-overwhelmingly large simulations (cosmo-owls) project, ruling out modelswithout agn feedback.

1509.01344	the atlas 5.5 ghz survey of the extended chandra deep field south: the  second data release	we present a new image of the 5.5 ghz radio emission from the extendedchandra deep field south. deep radio observations at 5.5 ghz were obtained in2010 and presented in the first data release. a further 76 hours of integrationhas since been obtained, nearly doubling the integration time. this paperpresents a new analysis of all the data. the new image reaches 8.6 microjy rms,an improvement of about 40% in sensitivity. we present a new catalogue of 5.5ghz sources, identifying 212 source components, roughly 50% more than weredetected in the first data release. source counts derived from this sample areconsistent with those reported in the literature for s_{5.5ghz} &gt; 0.1 mjy butsignificantly lower than published values in the lowest flux density bins(s_{5.5ghz} &lt; 0.1 mjy), where we have more detected sources and improvedstatistical reliability. the 5.5 ghz radio sources were matched to 1.4 ghzsources in the literature and we find a mean spectral index of -0.35 +- 0.10for s_{5.5ghz} &gt; 0.5 mjy, consistent with the flattening of the spectral indexobserved in 5 ghz sub-mjy samples. the median spectral index of the wholesample is \alpha_{med} = -0.58, indicating that these observations may bestarting to probe the star forming population. however, even at the faintestlevels (0.05 &lt; s_{5.5ghz} &lt; 0.1 mjy), 39% of the 5.5 ghz sources have flat orinverted radio spectra. four flux density measurements from our data, acrossthe full 4.5 to 6.5 ghz bandwidth, are combined with those from literature andwe find 10% of sources (s_{5.5ghz} &gt;~ 0.1 mjy) show significant curvature intheir radio spectral energy distribution spanning 1.4 to 9 ghz.

1509.02159	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): projected galaxy clustering	we measure the projected 2-point correlation function of galaxies in the 180deg$^2$ equatorial regions of the gama ii survey, for four different redshiftslices between z = 0.0 and z=0.5. to do this we further develop the cole (2011)method of producing suitable random catalogues for the calculation ofcorrelation functions. we find that more r-band luminous, more massive andredder galaxies are more clustered. we also find that red galaxies havestronger clustering on scales less than ~3 $h^{-1}$ mpc. we compare to twodifferent versions of the galform galaxy formation model, lacey et al (inprep.) and gonzalez-perez et al. (2014), and find that the models reproduce thetrend of stronger clustering for more massive galaxies. however, the modelsunder predict the clustering of blue galaxies, can incorrectly predict thecorrelation function on small scales and under predict the clustering in oursample of galaxies with ~3$l_r$ . we suggest possible avenues to explore toimprove these cluster- ing predictions. the measurements presented in thispaper can be used to test other galaxy formation models, and we make themeasurements available online to facilitate this.

1509.03931	the askap/emu source finding data challenge	the evolutionary map of the universe (emu) is a proposed radio continuumsurvey of the southern hemisphere up to declination +30 deg., with theaustralian square kilometre array pathfinder (askap). emu will use an automatedsource identification and measurement approach that is demonstrably optimal, tomaximise the reliability, utility and robustness of the resulting radio sourcecatalogues. as part of the process of achieving this aim, a "data challenge"has been conducted, providing international teams the opportunity to test avariety of source finders on a set of simulated images. the aim is to quantifythe accuracy of existing automated source finding and measurement approaches,and to identify potential limitations. the challenge attracted nine independentteams, who tested eleven different source finding tools. in addition, thechallenge initiators also tested the current askapsoft source-finding tool toestablish how it could benefit from incorporating successful features of theother tools. here we present the results of the data challenge, identifying thesuccesses and limitations for this broad variety of the current generation ofradio source finding tools. as expected, most finders demonstrate completenesslevels close to 100% at 10sigma dropping to levels around 10% by 5sigma. thereliability is typically close to 100% at 10sigma, with performance to lowersensitivities varying greatly between finders. all finders demonstrate theusual trade-off between completeness and reliability, whereby maintaining ahigh completeness at low signal-to-noise comes at the expense of reducedreliability, and vice-versa. we conclude with a series of recommendations forimproving the performance of the askapsoft source-finding tool.

1511.02245	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): growing up in a bad neighbourhood - how  do low-mass galaxies become passive?	both theoretical predictions and observations of the very nearby universesuggest that low-mass galaxies (log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;9.5) are likelyto remain star-forming unless they are affected by their local environment. totest this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of bothpassive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. we find that passive fractions are higher inboth interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,and that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. we also findthat essentially all passive log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;8.5 galaxies arefound in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with amore massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. we find that theeffects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in formingpassive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that thisis potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient timefor the galaxy to become passive via starvation. we then present a simplisticmodel to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, itis consistent with our observed results.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.

astro-ph;0103253	towards a resolution of the discrepancy between different estimators of  star formation rate	different wavelength regimes and methods for estimating the space density ofthe star-formation rate (sfr) result in discrepant values. while it isrecognised that ultra-violet (uv) and h-alpha emission line data must becorrected for the effects of extinction, the magnitude of the requiredcorrection is uncertain. even when these corrections are made there remains asignificant discrepancy between sfrs derived from uv and h-alpha measurementscompared with those derived from far-infrared (fir) and radio luminosities.since the fir/radio derived sfrs are not affected by extinction, and simplecorrections to reconcile the uv and h-alpha measurement with these do not fullyaccount for the discrepancies, a more sophisticated correction may be required.recent results suggest that at least part of the solution may be a form ofextinction which increases with increasing sfr (or luminosity, given the commonassumption that sfr is proportional to luminosity). we present an analysis ofthe effects of a dust reddening dependent on star formation rate applied toestimators of sfr. we show (1) that the discrepancies between h-alpha andfir/radio sfr estimates may be explained by such an effect, and we present aniterative method for applying the correction; and (2) uv-based estimates of sfrare harder to reconcile with fir/radio estimates using this method, althoughthe extent of the remaining discrepancy is less than for a non-sfr-dependentcorrection. particularly at high redshift, our understanding of extinction atuv wavelengths may require a still more complex explanation.

astro-ph;0110570	a new source detection algorithm using fdr	the false discovery rate (fdr) method has recently been described by milleret al (2001), along with several examples of astrophysical applications. fdr isa new statistical procedure due to benjamini and hochberg (1995) forcontrolling the fraction of false positives when performing multiple hypothesistesting. the importance of this method to source detection algorithms isimmediately clear. to explore the possibilities offered we have developed a newtask for performing source detection in radio-telescope images, sfind 2.0,which implements fdr. we compare sfind 2.0 with two other source detection andmeasurement tasks, imsad and sextractor, and comment on several issues arisingfrom the nature of the correlation between nearby pixels and the necessaryassumption of the null hypothesis. the strong suggestion is made thatimplementing fdr as a threshold defining method in other existingsource-detection tasks is easy and worthwhile. we show that the constraint onthe fraction of false detections as specified by fdr holds true even for highlycorrelated and realistic images. for the detection of true sources, which arecomplex combinations of source-pixels, this constraint appears to be somewhatless strict. it is still reliable enough, however, for a priori estimates ofthe fraction of false source detections to be robust and realistic.

astro-ph;0306621	star formation rate indicators in the sloan digital sky survey	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) first data release provides a database of106000 unique galaxies in the main galaxy sample with measured spectra. asample of star-forming (sf) galaxies are identified from among the 3079 ofthese having 1.4 ghz luminosities from first, by using optical spectraldiagnostics. using 1.4 ghz luminosities as a reference star formation rate(sfr) estimator insensitive to obscuration effects, the sfrs derived from themeasured sdss halpha, [oii] and u-band luminosities, as well as far-infraredluminosities from iras, are compared. it is established that straightforwardcorrections for obscuration and aperture effects reliably bring the sdssemission line and photometric sfr estimates into agreement with those at 1.4ghz, although considerable scatter (~60%) remains in the relations. it thusappears feasible to perform detailed investigations of star formation for largeand varied samples of sf galaxies through the available spectroscopic andphotometric measurements from the sdss. we provide herein exact prescriptionsfor determining the sfr for sdss galaxies. the expected strong correlationbetween [oii] and halpha line fluxes for sf galaxies is seen, but with a medianline flux ratio f_[oii]/f_halpha=0.23, about a factor of two smaller than thatfound in the sample of kennicutt (1992). this correlation, used in deriving the[oii] sfrs, is consistent with the luminosity-dependent relation found byjansen et al.

astro-ph;0307377	the phoenix deep survey: x-ray properties of faint radio sources	in this paper we use a 50ks xmm-newton pointing overlapping with the phoenixdeep survey, a homogeneous radio survey reaching mujy sensitivities, to explorethe x-ray properties and the evolution of star-forming galaxies. uv, opticaland nir photometry is available and is used to estimate photometric redshiftsand spectral types for radio sources brighter than r=21.5mag (total of 82).sources with r&lt;21.5mag and spiral galaxy seds (34) are grouped into tworedshift bins with a median of z=0.240 and 0.455 respectively. stackinganalysis for both the 0.5-2 and 2-8kev bands is performed on these subsamples.a high confidence level signal (&gt;3.5sigma) is detected in the 0.5-2kev bandcorresponding to a mean flux of ~3e-16cgs for both subsamples. this fluxtranslates to mean luminosities of ~5e40 and 1.5e41cgs for the z=0.240 and0.455 subsamples respectively. only a marginally significant signal (2.6sigma)is detected in the 2-8kev band for the z=0.455 subsample. we argue that thestacked signal above is dominated by star-formation. the mean l_x/l_b ratio andthe mean l_x of the two subsamples are found to be higher than opticallyselected spirals and similar to starbursts. we also find that the mean l_x andl_1.4 of the faint radio sources studied here are consistent with the l_x-l_1.4correlation of local star-forming galaxies. moreover, the x-ray emissivity ofsub-mjy sources to z~0.3 is found to be elevated compared to local hiigalaxies. the observed increase is consistent with l_x evolution of the form(1+z)^3. assuming that our sample is indeed dominated by starbursts this isdirect evidence for evolution of such systems at x-ray wavelengths. using anempirical l_x to sfr conversion we estimate a global sfr density at z~0.3 of\~0.029m_o/yr/mpc in agreement with previous studies.

astro-ph;0407078	the phoenix deep survey: the radio properties of the hard x-ray selected  sample	the radio properties of hard (2-8kev) x-ray selected sources are explored bycombining a single 50ks xmm-newton pointing with the ultra-deep and homogeneousphoenix radio (1.4ghz) survey (hopkins et al. 2003). a total of 43 sources aredetected above the x-ray flux limit f_x(2-8kev)=7.7e-15cgs with 14 of themexhibiting radio emission above ~40mujy (3sigma). the x-ray/radio matchedpopulation lies in the borderline between radio loud and quiet agns andcomprises sources with both soft and hard x-ray spectral properties suggestingboth obscured and unobscured systems. the spectroscopically identifiedsub-sample (total of 6 x-ray/radio matches) comprises narrow emission line agns(4) with hard x-ray spectral properties and broad line sources (2) with softx-ray spectra. we find evidence that the fraction of x-ray/radio matchesincreases from ~20% for sources with rest-frame column density n_h&lt;1e22cm^-2 to\~50% for more absorbed systems. poor statistics however, limit thesignificance of the above result to the ~2sigma level. also, the x-ray/radiomatched sources have flatter coadded x-ray spectrum(gamma=1.78^{+0.05}_{-0.03}) compared to sources without radio emission(gamma=2.00^{+0.03}_{-0.04}). a possible explanation for the higher fraction ofabsorbed sources with radio emission at the mujy level is the presence ofcircum-nuclear starburst activity that both feeds and obscures the centralengine. for a small sub-sample of z~0.4 radio emitting agns with n_h&gt;1e22cm^-2their combined spectrum exhibits a soft x-ray component that may be associatedwith star-formation activity, although other possibilities cannot be excluded.we also find that radio emitting agns make up about 13-20% of the hard-bandx-ray background depending on the adopted normalisation.

astro-ph;0407170	on the evolution of star forming galaxies	the evolution in the comoving space density of the global average galaxy starformation rate (sfr) out to a redshift around unity is well established. beyondz~1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is flat or even increasing,contrary to early indications of a turnover. some recent analyses of z~6photometric dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z=3 to z~6, but there isstill very little constraint on the extent of dust obscuration at such highredshifts. in less than a decade, numerous measurements of galaxy sfr densityspanning z=0 to as high as z~6 have rapidly broadened our understanding ofgalaxy evolution, and a summary of existing sfr density measurements ispresented here. this global star formation history compilation is found to beconsistent to within factors of about three over essentially the entire range$0&lt;z\lesssim6$, and it can be used to constrain the evolution of the luminosityfunction (lf) for star forming (sf) galaxies. the lf evolution for sf galaxieshas been previously explored using optical source counts, as well as radiosource counts at 1.4 ghz, and a well-known degeneracy between luminosityevolution ($l\propto(1+z)^q$) and density evolution ($\phi\propto(1+z)^p$) isfound. combining the constraints from the global sfr density evolution withthose from the 1.4 ghz radio source counts at sub-millijansky levels allowsthis degeneracy to be broken, and a best fitting evolutionary form to beestablished. the preferred evolution in a $h_0=70, \omega_m=0.3,\omega_\lambda=0.7$ cosmology from these combined constraints is$q=2.70\pm0.60$, $p=0.15\pm0.60$.

(1996) andthen cross-correlating the resulting density maps with the ero positions. ouranalysis provides direct evidence that eros are associated with overdensitiesat redshifts z&gt;1. we also exploit the deep radio 1.4ghz data (limiting flux60microjy) available to explore the association of eros and faint radio sourcesand whether the two populations trace similar large scale structures.cross-correlation of the two samples (after excluding 17eros with radiocounterparts) gives a 2sigma signal only for the sub-sample of high-z radiosources (z&gt;0.6). although the statistics are poor this suggests that it is thehigh-z radio sub-sample that traces similar structures with eros.

astro-ph;0411578	the phoenix deep survey: spectroscopic catalog	the phoenix deep survey is a multi-wavelength survey based on deep 1.4 ghzradio imaging, reaching well into the sub-100 microjy level. one of the aims ofthis survey is to characterize the sub-mjy radio population, exploring itsnature and evolution. in this paper we present the catalog and results of thespectroscopic observations aimed at characterizing the optically ``bright''(r&lt;~ 21.5 mag) counterparts of faint radio sources. out of 371 sources withredshift determination, 21% have absorption lines only, 11% show agnsignatures, 32% are star-forming galaxies, 34% show narrow emission lines thatdo not allow detailed spectral classification (due to poor signal-to-noiseratio and/or lack of diagnostic emission lines) and the remaining 2% areidentified with stars. for the star-forming galaxies with a balmer decrementmeasurement we find a median extinction of a(ha)=1.9 mag, higher than that ofoptically selected samples. this is a result of the radio selection, which isnot biased against dusty systems. using the available spectroscopicinformation, we estimate the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxiesin two independent redshift bins at z~0.1 and 0.3 respectively. we find directevidence for strong luminosity evolution of these systems consistent with l(1.4ghz) ~ (1+z)^(2.7).

astro-ph;0505418	the star formation history of damped lyman alpha absorbers	the local power law relationship between the surface densities of neutralhydrogen gas and star formation rate (sfr) can be used to explore the sfrproperties of damped lyman alpha (dla) systems at higher redshift. we find thatwhile the sfr densities for dla systems are consistent with luminous starforming galaxies at redshifts below z~0.6, at higher redshifts their sfrdensity is too low for them to provide a significant contribution to the cosmicstar formation history (sfh). this suggests that the majority of dlas may be adistinct population from the lyman break galaxies (lbgs) or submillimeterstar-forming galaxies that together dominate the sfr density at high redshift.it is also possible that the dlas do not trace the bulk of the neutral gas athigh redshift. the metallicity properties of dlas are consistent with thisinterpretation. the dlas show a metal mass density lower by two orders ofmagnitude at all redshifts than that inferred from the sfh of the universe.these results are consistent with dlas being dominated by low mass systemshaving low sfrs or a late onset of star formation, similar to the starformation histories of dwarf galaxies in the local universe.

astro-ph;0512138	the phoenix deep survey: the star-formation rates and the stellar masses  of eros	we estimate the star-formation rates and the stellar masses of the extremelyred objects (eros) detected in a 180arcmin2 ks-band survey (ks~20mag). thissample is complemented by sensitive 1.4ghz radio observations (12micro-jy;1sigma rms) and multiwaveband photometric data (ubvrij) as part of the phoenixdeep survey. for bright k&lt;19.5mag eros in this sample (i-k&gt;4mag; total of 177)we use photometric methods to discriminate dust-enshrouded active systems fromearly-type galaxies and to constrain their redshifts. radio stacking is thenemployed to estimate mean radio flux densities of 8.6 (3sigma) and 6.4micro-jy(2.4sigma) for the dusty and early-type subsamples respectively. assuming thatdust enshrouded active eros are powered by star-formation the above radio fluxdensity at the median redshift of z=1 translates to a radio luminosity of4.5e22w/hz and a star-formation rate of sfr=25mo/yr. combining this result withphotometric redshift estimates we find a lower limit to the star-formation ratedensity of ~0.02mo/yr/mpc^3 for the k&lt;19.5mag dusty eros in the rangez=0.85-1.35. comparison with the sfr density estimated from previous erosamples (with similar selection criteria) using optical emission lines,suffering dust attenuation, suggests a mean dust reddening of at leaste(b-v)~0.5 for this population. we further use the ks-band luminosity as proxyto stellar mass and argue that the dust enshrouded eros in our sample aremassive systems, m&gt;5e10mo. we also find that eros represent a sizable fraction(~50%) of the number density of galaxies more massive than m=5e10mo at z~1,with almost equal contributions from dusty and early types. similarly, we findthat eros contribute about half of the mass density of the universe at z~1after taking into account incompleteness because of the limit k=19.5mag.

astro-ph;0602088	the evolution of galaxy mergers and morphology at z&lt;1.2 in the extended  groth strip	we present the quantitative rest-frame b morphological evolution and galaxymerger fractions at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 as observed by the all-wavelength extendedgroth strip international survey (aegis). we use the gini coefficent and m_20to identify major mergers and classify galaxy morphology for a volume-limitedsample of 3009 galaxies brighter than 0.4 l_b^*, assuming pure luminosityevolution of 1.3 m_b per unit redshift. we find that the merger fractionremains roughly constant at 10 +/- 2% for 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. the fraction ofe/s0/sa increases from 21+/- 3% at z ~ 1.1 to 44 +/- 9% at z ~ 0.3, while thefraction of sb-ir decreases from 64 +/- 6% at z ~ 1.1 to 47 +/- 9% at z ~ 0.3.the majority of z &lt; 1.2 spitzer mips 24 micron sources with l(ir) &gt; 10^11 l_sunare disk galaxies, and only ~ 15% are classified as major merger candidates.edge-on and dusty disk galaxies (sb-ir) are almost a third of the red sequenceat z ~ 1.1, while e/s0/sa makeup over 90% of the red sequence at z ~ 0.3.approximately 2% of our full sample are red mergers. we conclude (1) the galaxymerger rate does not evolve strongly between 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2; (2) the decrease inthe volume-averaged star-formation rate density since z ~ 1 is a result ofdeclining star-formation in disk galaxies rather than a disappearing populationof major mergers; (3) the build-up of the red sequence at z &lt; 1 can beexplained by a doubling in the number of spheroidal galaxies since z ~ 1.2.

astro-ph;0606323	the dragons survey: a search for high redshift radio galaxies and  heavily obscured agns	we present the first results from the distant radio galaxies opticallynon-detected in the sdss (dragons) survey. using a novel selection techniquefor identifying high redshift radio galaxy (hzrg) candidates, a large sample ofbright (s_{1.4ghz} &gt; 100mjy) radio sources from the first survey having nooptical counterpart in the sdss is compiled. k-band imaging with the flamingosinstrument on the 4-meter telescope at kitt peak for 96 such candidates allowspreliminary identification of hzrg candidates through the well-known k-zrelation. of the initial candidates, we identify 70 with magnitudes brighterthan k \approx 19.5, and compute limiting magnitudes for the remainder.assigning redshifts based on the k-z hubble diagram gives a mean redshift forour sample of z=2.5 and a median redshift of z=2.0. this selection is alsosensitive to a previously unseen population of anomalously red radio galaxies(r-k &gt; 6.5-7), which may indicate significant obscuration at moderateredshifts. these obscured objects can be used to test the completeness of qsosurveys to the effects of reddenning. more than ten percent of our sample fallsinto this category, which may represent a sizable radio loud population missingfrom current optically selected agn samples. we additionally identify 479bright extremely red objects (eros) in the fields surrounding our hzrgcandidates, to a magnitude of k=17.5, within a non-contiguous area of 2.38square degrees. this constitutes a small overdensity of eros surrounding theradio galaxy candidates over random fields, and we see possible evidence for aphysical association of the eros with the radio galaxies. however, examiningthe clustering of all k &lt; 19.0 galaxies around the radio targets reveals noevidence of a global galaxy excess.
