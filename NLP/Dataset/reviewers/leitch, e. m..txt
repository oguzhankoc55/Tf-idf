0906.1181	measurement of cosmic microwave background polarization power spectra  from two years of bicep data	background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization (bicep) is abolometric polarimeter designed to measure the inflationary b-mode polarizationof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) at degree angular scales. during threeseasons of observing at the south pole (2006 through 2008), bicep mapped ~2% ofthe sky chosen to be uniquely clean of polarized foreground emission. here wepresent initial results derived from a subset of the data acquired during thefirst two years. we present maps of temperature, stokes q and u, e and b modes,and associated angular power spectra. we demonstrate that the polarization dataare self-consistent by performing a series of jackknife tests. we studypotential systematic errors in detail and show that they are sub-dominant tothe statistical errors. we measure the e-mode angular power spectrum with highprecision at 21 &lt; ell &lt; 335, detecting for the first time the peak expected atell ~ 140. the measured e-mode spectrum is consistent with expectations from alcdm model, and the b-mode spectrum is consistent with zero. thetensor-to-scalar ratio derived from the b-mode spectrum is r = 0.03+0.31-0.26,or r &lt; 0.72 at 95% confidence, the first meaningful constraint on theinflationary gravitational wave background to come directly from cmb b-modepolarization.

0906.4069	characterization of the bicep telescope for high-precision cosmic  microwave background polarimetry	the bicep experiment was designed specifically to search for the signature ofinflationary gravitational waves in the polarization of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). using a novel small-aperture refractor and 49 pairs ofpolarization-sensitive bolometers, bicep has completed 3 years of successfulobservations at the south pole beginning in 2006 february. to constrain theamplitude of the inflationary b-mode polarization, which is expected to be atleast 7 orders of magnitude fainter than the 3 k cmb intensity, precise controlof systematic effects is essential. this paper describes the characterizationof potential systematic errors for the bicep experiment, supplementing acompanion paper on the initial cosmological results. using the analysispipelines for the experiment, we have simulated the impact of systematic errorson the b-mode polarization measurement. guided by these simulations, we haveestablished benchmarks for the characterization of critical instrumentalproperties including bolometer relative gains, beam mismatch, polarizationorientation, telescope pointing, sidelobes, thermal stability, and timestreamnoise model. a comparison of the benchmarks with the measured values shows thatwe have characterized the instrument adequately to ensure that systematicerrors do not limit bicep's 2-year results, and identifies which futurerefinements are likely necessary to probe inflationary b-mode polarization downto levels below a tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.1.

0911.2444	sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster profiles measured with the south pole  telescope	we present sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters obtained with the south pole telescope. the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) cluster signals are measured at 150 ghz, and concurrent 220 ghz data areused to reduce astrophysical contamination. radial profiles are computed usinga technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. inseveral clusters, significant sz decrements are detected out to a substantialfraction of the virial radius. the profiles are fit to the beta model and to ageneralized nfw pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe theiraverage behavior. we find model parameters that are consistent with previousstudies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized nfw model. bothmodels fit the spt data comparably well, and both are consistent with theaverage sz profile out to the virial radius. the integrated compton-y parametery_sz is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent andmodel-independent techniques, and the results are compared to x-ray estimatesof cluster parameters. we find that y_sz scales with y_x and gas mass with lowscatter. since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, ourresults point to a tight mass-observable relation for the spt cluster survey.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.4315	angular power spectra of the millimeter wavelength background light from  dusty star-forming galaxies with the south pole telescope	we use data from the first 100 square-degree field observed by the south poletelescope (spt) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperatureanisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) at millimeter wavelengths. from the auto and cross-correlation of 150and 220 ghz spt maps, we significantly detect both poisson distributed and, forthe first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from abackground of dsfgs. the spectral indices between 150 and 220 ghz of thepoisson and clustered components are found to be 3.86 +- 0.23 and 3.8 +- 1.3respectively, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2.the poisson and clustered power detected in spt, blast (at 600, 860, and 1200ghz), and spitzer (1900 ghz) data can be understood in the context of a simplemodel in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dustemissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature t_d = 34 k. in this model,half of the 150 ghz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. wealso use the spt data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum at l = 3000 of 13 uk^2 at 95% confidence.

0912.4317	measurements of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  the south pole telescope	we report cosmic microwave background (cmb) power spectrum measurements fromthe first 100 sq. deg. field observed by the south pole telescope (spt) at 150and 220 ghz. on angular scales where the primary cmb anisotropy is dominant,ell ~&lt; 3000, the spt power spectrum is consistent with the standard lambdacdmcosmology. on smaller scales, we see strong evidence for a point sourcecontribution, consistent with a population of dusty, star-forming galaxies.after we mask bright point sources, anisotropy power on angular scales of 3000&lt; ell &lt; 9500 is detected with a signal-to-noise &gt; 50 at both frequencies. wecombine the 150 and 220 ghz data to remove the majority of the point sourcepower, and use the point source subtracted spectrum to detectsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) power at 2.6 sigma. at ell=3000, the sz power in thesubtracted bandpowers is 4.2 +/- 1.5 uk^2, which is significantly lower thanthe power predicted by a fiducial model using wmap5 cosmological parameters.this discrepancy may suggest that contemporary galaxy cluster modelsoverestimate the thermal pressure of intracluster gas. alternatively, thisresult can be interpreted as evidence for lower values of sigma8. when combinedwith an estimate of the kinetic sz contribution, the measured sz amplitudeshifts sigma8 from the primary cmb anisotropy derived constraint of 0.794 +/-0.028 down to 0.773 +/- 0.025. the uncertainty in the constraint on sigma8 fromthis analysis is dominated by uncertainties in the theoretical modelingrequired to predict the amplitude of the sz power spectrum for a given set ofcosmological parameters.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1003.0005	optical redshift and richness estimates for galaxy clusters selected  with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008 south pole telescope  observations	we present redshifts and optical richness properties of 21 galaxy clustersuniformly selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature. these clusters, plusan additional, unconfirmed candidate, were detected in a 178 square-degree areasurveyed by the south pole telescope in 2008. using griz imaging from theblanco cosmology survey and from pointed magellan telescope observations, aswell as spectroscopy using magellan facilities, we confirm the existence ofclustered red-sequence galaxies, report red-sequence photometric redshifts,present spectroscopic redshifts for a subsample, and derive r_200 radii andm_200 masses from optical richness. the clusters span redshifts from 0.15 togreater than 1, with a median redshift of 0.74; three clusters are estimated tobe at z &gt; 1. redshifts inferred from mean red-sequence colors exhibit 2% rmsscatter in sigma_z/(1+z) with respect to the spectroscopic subsample for z &lt; 1.we show that m_200 cluster masses derived from optical richness correlate withmasses derived from south pole telescope data and agree with previously derivedscaling relations to within the uncertainties. optical and infrared imaging isan efficient means of cluster identification and redshift estimation in largesunyaev-zel'dovich surveys, and exploiting the same data for richnessmeasurements, as we have done, will be useful for constraining cluster massesand radii for large samples in cosmological analysis.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1012.4788	improved constraints on cosmic microwave background secondary  anisotropies from the complete 2008 south pole telescope data	we report measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) powerspectrum from the complete 2008 south pole telescope (spt) data set. we analyzetwice as much data as the first spt power spectrum analysis, using an improvedcosmological parameter estimator which fits multi-frequency models to the spt150 and $220\,$ghz bandpowers. we find an excellent fit to the measuredbandpowers with a model that includes lensed primary cmb anisotropy, secondarythermal (tsz) and kinetic (ksz) sunyaev-zel'dovich anisotropies, unclusteredsynchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. in addition tomeasuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, thedata primarily constrain a linear combination of the ksz and tsz anisotropycontributions at $150\,$ghz and $\ell=3000$: $d^{tsz}_{3000} +0.5\,d^{ksz}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm k}^2$. the 95% confidence upperlimits on secondary anisotropy power are $d^{tsz}_{3000} &lt; 5.3\,\mu{\rm k}^2$and $d^{ksz}_{3000} &lt; 6.5\,\mu{\rm k}^2$. we also consider the potentialcorrelation of dusty and tsz sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tszupper limit. these results increase the significance of the lower than expectedtsz amplitude previously determined from spt power spectrum measurements. wefind that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusterspredict tsz power in better agreement with the spt data. combining the tszpower measurement with primary cmb data halves the statistical uncertainty on$\sigma_8$. however, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantlybetween tsz models. improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tszpower spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of thetsz power.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1103.0289	a millimeter-wave galactic plane survey with the bicep polarimeter	in addition to its potential to probe the inflationary cosmological paradigm,millimeter-wave polarimetry is a powerful tool for studying the milky waygalaxy's composition and magnetic field structure. towards this end, presentedhere are stokes i, q, and u maps of the galactic plane from the millimeter-wavepolarimeter bicep covering the galactic longitude range 260 - 340 degrees inthree atmospheric transmission windows centered on 100, 150, and 220 ghz. themaps sample an optical depth 1 &lt; av &lt; 30, and are consistent with previouscharacterizations of the galactic millimeter-wave frequency spectrum and thelarge-scale magnetic field structure permeating the interstellar medium.polarized emission is detected over the entire region within two degrees of thegalactic plane and indicates that the large-scale magnetic field is orientedparallel to the plane of the galaxy. an observed trend of decreasingpolarization fraction with increasing total intensity rules out the simplestmodel of a constant galactic magnetic field throughout the galaxy. includingwmap data in the analysis, the degree-scale frequency spectrum of galacticpolarization fraction is plotted between 23 and 220 ghz for the first time. agenerally increasing trend of polarization fraction with electromagneticfrequency is found, which varies from 0.5%-1.5%at frequencies below 50 ghz to2.5%-3.5%above 90 ghz. the bicep and wmap data are fit to a two-component(synchrotron and dust) model showing that the higher frequency bicep data arenecessary to tightly constrain the amplitude and spectral index of galacticdust. furthermore, the dust amplitude predicted by this two-component fit isconsistent with model predictions of dust emission in the bicep bands.

1112.4215	frequency multiplexed squid readout of large bolometer arrays for cosmic  microwave background measurements	a technological milestone for experiments employing transition edge sensor(tes) bolometers operating at sub-kelvin temperature is the deployment ofdetector arrays with 100s--1000s of bolometers. one key technology for sucharrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensorssimultaneously on the same set of wires. this paper describes afrequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for anddeployed on the apex-sz and south pole telescope millimeter wavelengthreceivers. in this system, the detector array is divided into modules of sevendetectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ~mhzsinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are wellseparated in frequency space. the currents from all bolometers in a module aresummed together and pre-amplified with superconducting quantum interferencedevices (squids) operating at 4 k. room-temperature electronics demodulate thecarriers to recover the bolometer signals, which are digitized separately andstored to disk. this readout system contributes little noise relative to thedetectors themselves, is remarkably insensitive to unwanted microphonicexcitations, and provides a technology pathway to multiplexing larger numbersof sensors.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1202.0546	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the microwave background using  south pole telescope data	we use south pole telescope data from 2008 and 2009 to detect thenon-gaussian signature in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) produced bygravitational lensing and to measure the power spectrum of the projectedgravitational potential. we constrain the ratio of the measured amplitude ofthe lensing signal to that expected in a fiducial lcdm cosmological model to be0.86 +/- 0.16, with no lensing disfavored at 6.3 sigma. marginalizing over lcdmcosmological models allowed by the wmap7 results in a measurement ofa_lens=0.90+/-0.19, indicating that the amplitude of matter fluctuations overthe redshift range 0.5 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 5 probed by cmb lensing is in good agreementwith predictions. we present the results of several consistency checks. theseinclude a clear detection of the lensing signature in cmb maps filtered to haveno overlap in fourier space, as well as a "curl" diagnostic that is consistentwith the signal expected for lcdm. we perform a detailed study of bias in themeasurement due to noise, foregrounds, and other effects and determine thatthese contributions are relatively small compared to the statisticaluncertainty in the measurement. we combine this lensing measurement withresults from wmap7 to improve constraints on cosmological parameters whencompared to those from wmap7 alone: we find a factor of 3.9 improvement in themeasurement of the spatial curvature of the universe, omega_k=-0.0014+/-0.0172;a 10% improvement in the amplitude of matter fluctuations within lcdm,sigma_8=0.810+/ 0.026; and a 5% improvement in the dark energy equation ofstate, w=-1.04+/-0.40. when compared with the measurement of w provided by thecombination of wmap7 and external constraints on the hubble parameter, theaddition of the lensing data improve the measurement of w by 15% to givew=-1.087+/-0.096.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1207.4369	redshifts, sample purity, and bcg positions for the galaxy cluster  catalog from the first 720 square degrees of the south pole telescope survey	we present the results of the ground- and space-based optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up of 224 galaxy cluster candidates detected withthe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect in the 720 deg^2 of the south pole telescope(spt) survey completed in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons. we use theoptical/nir data to establish whether each candidate is associated with anoverdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. most photometricredshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshiftestimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of \deltaz/(1+z)=0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clustersfor which we have spectroscopic redshifts. we successfully measure redshiftsfor 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates.the redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z=1.35 with amedian of z_{med}=0.57. approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshiftslies at z&gt;0.8. we estimate a lower limit to the purity of this spt sz-selectedsample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in thespt data. we show that the cumulative purity at detection significance \xi&gt;5(\xi&gt;4.5) is &gt;= 95 (&gt;= 70%). we present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rbcg)positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the spt candidateposition and the rbcg. the radial distribution of offsets is similar to thatseen in x-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that sz-selectedcluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers thanx-ray-selected cluster samples.

1208.3368	high-redshift cool-core galaxy clusters detected via the  sunyaev--zel'dovich effect in the south pole telescope survey	we report the first investigation of cool-core properties of galaxy clustersselected via their sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) effect. we use 13 galaxy clustersuniformly selected from 178 deg^2 observed with the south pole telescope (spt)and followed up by the chandra x-ray observatory. they form an approximatelymass-limited sample (&gt; 3 x 10^14 m_sun h^-1_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt;1.1. using previously published x-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare twoproxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (csb) andcuspiness ({\alpha}). we find that csb is better constrained. we measure csbfor the spt sample and find several new z &gt; 0.5 cool-core clusters, includingtwo strong cool cores. this rules out the hypothesis that there are no z &gt; 0.5clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4{\sigma} level. thefraction of strong cool-core clusters in the spt sample in this redshift regimeis between 7% and 56% (95% confidence). although the spt selection function issignificantly different from the x-ray samples, the high-z csb distribution forthe spt sample is statistically consistent with that of x-ray-selected samplesat both low and high redshifts. the cool-core strength is inversely correlatedwith the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the x-ray centroid,providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength ofthe cluster. larger sz-selected samples will be crucial in understanding theevolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.

1210.7231	a measurement of the cosmic microwave background damping tail from the  2500-square-degree spt-sz survey	we present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperaturepower spectrum using data from the recently completed south pole telescopesunyaev-zel'dovich (spt-sz) survey. this measurement is made from observationsof 2540 deg$^2$ of sky with arcminute resolution at $150\,$ghz, and improvesupon previous measurements using the spt by tripling the sky area. we reportcmb temperature anisotropy power over the multipole range $650&lt;\ell&lt;3000$. wefit the spt bandpowers, combined with the seven-year wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap7) data, with a six-parameter lcdm cosmological model andfind that the two datasets are consistent and well fit by the model. adding sptmeasurements significantly improves lcdm parameter constraints; in particular,the constraint on $\theta_s$ tightens by a factor of 2.7. the impact ofgravitational lensing is detected at $8.1\, \sigma$, the most significantdetection to date. this sensitivity of the spt+wmap7 data to lensing bylarge-scale structure at low redshifts allows us to constrain the meancurvature of the observable universe with cmb data alone to be$\omega_k=-0.003^{+0.014}_{-0.018}$. using the spt+wmap7 data, we measure thespectral index of scalar fluctuations to be $n_s=0.9623 \pm 0.0097$ in the lcdmmodel, a $3.9\,\sigma$ preference for a scale-dependent spectrum with $n_s&lt;1$.the spt measurement of the cmb damping tail helps break the degeneracy thatexists between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and $n_s$ in large-scale cmbmeasurements, leading to an upper limit of $r&lt;0.18$ (95%,c.l.) in the lcdm+$r$model. adding low-redshift measurements of the hubble constant ($h_0$) and thebaryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature to the spt+wmap7 data leads tofurther improvements. the combination of spt+wmap7+$h_0$+bao constrains$n_s=0.9538 \pm 0.0081$ in the lcdm model, a $5.7\,\sigma$ detection of $n_s &lt;1$, ...

(2007). by contrast, the radio spectrum ofbn is consistent with p+/e- free-free emission from a dense (n_e ~ 5x10^7cm^{-3}), but otherwise conventional, hypercompact hii region. the source isbecoming optically thin at 229 ghz, and the h30alpha recombination line, atvlsr = 23.2 +/- 0.5 km/sec, is prominent in its spectrum. a lyman continuumflux of 5x10^{45} photons/sec, consistent with that expected from a b star, isrequired to maintain the ionization. supplementary 90 ghz observations weremade to measure the h41alpha and h42alpha recombination lines toward bn.published 43 and 86 ghz data suggest that srci brightened with respect to bnover the 15 year period from 1994 to 2009.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1312.6646	measurement of the cosmic microwave background polarization lensing  power spectrum with the polarbear experiment	gravitational lensing due to the large-scale distribution of matter in thecosmos distorts the primordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) and therebyinduces new, small-scale $b$-mode polarization. this signal carries detailedinformation about the distribution of all the gravitating matter between theobserver and cmb last scattering surface. we report the first direct evidencefor polarization lensing based on purely cmb information, from using thefour-point correlations of even- and odd-parity $e$- and $b$-mode polarizationmapped over $\sim30$ square degrees of the sky measured by the polarbearexperiment. these data were analyzed using a blind analysis framework andchecked for spurious systematic contamination using null tests and simulations.evidence for the signal of polarization lensing and lensing $b$-modes is foundat 4.2$\sigma$ (stat.+sys.) significance. the amplitude of matter fluctuationsis measured with a precision of $27\%$, and is found to be consistent with thelambda cold dark matter ($\lambda$cdm) cosmological model. this measurementdemonstrates a new technique, capable of mapping all gravitating matter in theuniverse, sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses, and essential for cleaningthe lensing $b$-mode signal in searches for primordial gravitational waves.

1312.7877	self-calibration of bicep1 three-year data and constraints on  astrophysical polarization rotation	cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarimeters aspire to measure the faint$b$-mode signature predicted to arise from inflationary gravitational waves.they also have the potential to constrain cosmic birefringence which wouldproduce non-zero expectation values for the cmb's $tb$ and $eb$ spectra.however, instrumental systematic effects can also cause these $tb$ and $eb$correlations to be non-zero. in particular, an overall miscalibration of thepolarization orientation of the detectors produces $tb$ and $eb$ spectra whichare degenerate with isotropic cosmological birefringence, while alsointroducing a small but predictable bias on the $bb$ spectrum. the \bicepthree-year spectra, which use our standard calibration of detector polarizationangles from a dielectric sheet, are consistent with a polarization rotation of$\alpha = -2.77^\circ \pm 0.86^\circ \text{(statistical)} \pm 1.3^\circ\text{(systematic)}$. we revise the estimate of systematic error on thepolarization rotation angle from the two-year analysis by comparing multiplecalibration methods. we investigate the polarization rotation for the \bicep100 ghz and 150 ghz bands separately to investigate theoretical models thatproduce frequency-dependent cosmic birefringence. we find no evidence in thedata supporting either these models or faraday rotation of the cmb polarizationby the milky way galaxy's magnetic field. if we assume that there is no cosmicbirefringence, we can use the $tb$ and $eb$ spectra to calibrate detectorpolarization orientations, thus reducing bias of the cosmological $b$-modespectrum from leaked $e$-modes due to possible polarization orientationmiscalibration. after applying this "self-calibration" process, we find thatthe upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreases slightly, from $r&lt;0.70$to $r&lt;0.65$ at $95\%$ confidence.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1412.4760	a measurement of the cosmic microwave background gravitational lensing  potential from 100 square degrees of sptpol data	we present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)gravitational lensing potential using data from the first two seasons ofobservations with sptpol, the polarization-sensitive receiver currentlyinstalled on the south pole telescope (spt). the observations used in this workcover 100 deg$^2$ of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 ghz. using aquadratic estimator, we make maps of the cmb lensing potential fromcombinations of cmb temperature and polarization maps. we combine these lensingpotential maps to form a minimum-variance (mv) map. the lensing potential ismeasured with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than one for angularmultipoles between $100&lt; l &lt;250$. this is the highest signal-to-noise mass mapmade from the cmb to date and will be powerful in cross-correlation with othertracers of large-scale structure. we calculate the power spectrum of thelensing potential for each estimator, and we report the value of the mv powerspectrum between $100&lt; l &lt;2000$ as our primary result. we constrain the ratioof the spectrum to a fiducial $\lambda$cdm model to be $a_{\rm mv}=0.92 \pm0.14 {\rm\, (stat.)} \pm 0.08 {\rm\, (sys.)}$. restricting ourselves topolarized data only, we find $a_{\rm pol}=0.92 \pm 0.24 {\rm\, (stat.)} \pm0.11 {\rm\, (sys.)}$. this measurement rejects the hypothesis of no lensing at$5.9 \sigma$ using polarization data alone, and at $14 \sigma$ using bothtemperature and polarization data.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1503.02315	measurements of sub-degree b-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave  background from 100 square degrees of sptpol data	we present a measurement of the $b$-mode polarization power spectrum (the$bb$ spectrum) from 100 $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of sky observed with sptpol, apolarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the south poletelescope. the observations used in this work were taken during 2012 and early2013 and include data in spectral bands centered at 95 and 150 ghz. we reportthe $bb$ spectrum in five bins in multipole space, spanning the range $300 \le\ell \le 2300$, and for three spectral combinations: 95 ghz $\times$ 95 ghz, 95ghz $\times$ 150 ghz, and 150 ghz $\times$ 150 ghz. we subtract small ($&lt; 0.5\sigma$ in units of statistical uncertainty) biases from these spectra andaccount for the uncertainty in those biases. the resulting power spectra areinconsistent with zero power but consistent with predictions for the $bb$spectrum arising from the gravitational lensing of $e$-mode polarization. if weassume no other source of $bb$ power besides lensed $b$ modes, we determine apreference for lensed $b$ modes of $4.9 \sigma$. after marginalizing overtensor power and foregrounds, namely polarized emission from galactic dust andextragalactic sources, this significance is $4.3 \sigma$. fitting for a singleparameter, $a_\mathrm{lens}$, that multiplies the predicted lensed $b$-modespectrum, and marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, we find$a_\mathrm{lens} = 1.08 \pm 0.26$, indicating that our measured spectra areconsistent with the signal expected from gravitational lensing. the datapresented here provide the best measurement to date of the $b$-mode powerspectrum on these angular scales.
