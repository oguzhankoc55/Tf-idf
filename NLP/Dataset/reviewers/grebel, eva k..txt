0902.1846	testing fundamental physics with distant star clusters: theoretical  models for pressure-supported stellar systems	we investigate the mean velocity dispersion and the velocity dispersionprofile of stellar systems in mond, using the n-body code n-mody, which is aparticle-mesh based code with a numerical mond potential solver developed byciotti, londrillo and nipoti (2006). we have calculated mean velocitydispersions for stellar systems following plummer density distributions withmasses in the range of $10^4 m_\odot$ to $10^9 m_\odot$ and which are eitherisolated or immersed in an external field. our integrations reproduce previousanalytic estimates for stellar velocities in systems in the deep mond regime($a_i, a_e \ll a_0$), where the motion of stars is either dominated by internalaccelerations ($a_i \gg a_e$) or constant external accelerations ($a_e \gga_i$). in addition, we derive for the first time analytic formulae for theline-of-sight velocity dispersion in the intermediate regime ($a_i \sim a_e\sim a_0$). this allows for a much improved comparison of mond with observedvelocity dispersions of stellar systems. we finally derive the velocitydispersion of the globular cluster pal 14 as one of the outer milky way haloglobular clusters that have recently been proposed as a differentiator betweennewtonian and mondian dynamics.

0909.1329	structural parameters of seven smc intermediate-age and old star  clusters	we present structural parameters for the seven intermediate-age and old starclusters ngc121, lindsay 1, kron 3, ngc339, ngc416, lindsay 38, and ngc419 inthe small magellanic cloud. we fit king profiles and elson, fall, and freemanprofiles to both surface-brightness and star count data taken with the advancedcamera for surveys aboard the hubble space telescope. clusters older than 1 gyrshow a spread in cluster core radii that increases with age, while the youngestclusters have relatively compact cores. no evidence for post core collapseclusters was found. we find no correlation between core radius and distancefrom the smc center, although consistent with other studies of dwarf galaxies,some relatively old and massive clusters have low densities. the oldest smcstar cluster, the only globular ngc121, is the most elliptical object of thestudied clusters. no correlation is seen between ellipticity and distance fromthe smc center. the structures of these massive intermediate-age (1-8 gyr) smcstar clusters thus appear to primarily result from internal evolutionaryprocesses.

0909.3298	the splash survey: a spectroscopic analysis of the metal-poor,  low-luminosity m31 dsph satellite andromeda x	andromeda x (and x) is a newly discovered low-luminosity m31 dwarf spheroidalgalaxy (dsph) found by zucker et al. (2007) in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss - york et al. 2000). in this paper, we present the first spectroscopicstudy of individual red giant branch stars in and x, as a part of the splashsurvey (spectroscopic and photometric landscape of andromeda's stellar halo).using the keck ii telescope and multiobject deimos spectrograph, we target twospectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocitiesfor ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. the velocityhistogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sightline: foreground milky way dwarfs at small negative velocities, m31 halo redgiants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike''consisting of 22 stars belonging to and x with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. bycarefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of thesestars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsicvelocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for and x, which for itssize, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of m/l =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming themass traces the light. based on the clean sample of member stars, we measurethe median metallicity of and x to be [fe/h] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slightradial metallicity gradient. the dispersion in metallicity is large,sigma([fe/h]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of itschemical enrichment products. we discuss the potential for better understandingthe formation and evolution mechanisms for m31's system of dsphs through(current) kinematic and chemical abundance studies, especially in relation tothe milky way sample.

1003.0861	dwarf spheroidals in the m81 group - metallicity distribution functions  and population gradients	we study the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the nearby m81 group in order toconstruct their photometric metallicity distributions and to investigate thepotential presence of population gradients. we select all the dwarf spheroidalswith available hubble space telescope / advanced camera for surveys archivalobservations, nine in total. we interpolate isochrones so as to assign aphotometric metallicity to each star within a selection box in thecolor-magnitude diagram of each dwarf galaxy. we assume that the dwarfspheroidals contain mainly an old stellar population. in order to search formetallicity gradients, we examine the spatial distribution of two stellarpopulations that we separate according to their metallicities. as a result, wepresent the photometric metallicity distribution functions, the cumulativehistograms and smoothed density maps of the metal-poor and metal-rich stars aswell as of the intermediate-age stars. from our photometric data we find thatall the dwarf spheroidals show a wide range in metallicities, with mean valuesthat are typical for old and metal-poor systems, with the exception of onedwarf spheroidal, namely ikn. some of our dwarf spheroidals exhibitcharacteristics of transition-type dwarfs. compared to the local grouptransition type dwarfs, the m81 group ones appear to have mean metallicityvalues slightly more metal-rich at a given luminosity. all the dwarfspheroidals considered here appear to exhibit either population gradients orspatial variations in the centroids of their metal-poor and metal-richpopulation. in addition, there are luminous agb stars detected in all of themwith spatial distributions suggesting that they are well mixed with the oldstars.

1004.1247	ages and luminosities of young smc/lmc star clusters and the recent star  formation history of the clouds	in this paper we discuss the age and spatial distribution of young(age$&lt;$1gyr) smc and lmc clusters using data from the magellanic cloudphotometric surveys. luminosities are calculated for all age-dated clusters.ages of 324 and 1193 populous star clusters in the small and the largemagellanic cloud have been determined fitting padova and geneva isochronemodels to their resolved color-magnitude diagrams. the clusters cover an agerange between 10myr and 1gyr in each galaxy. for the smc a constant distancemodulus of $(m-m)_0$ = 18.90 and a metallicity of z = 0.004 were adopted. forthe lmc, we used a constant distance modulus of $(m-m)_0$ = 18.50 and ametallicity of z = 0.008. for both galaxies, we used a variable color excess toderive the cluster ages. we find two periods of enhanced cluster formation inboth galaxies at 160myr and 630myr (smc) and at 125myr and 800myr (lmc). wepresent the spatially resolved recent star formation history of both cloudsbased on young star clusters. the first peak may have been triggered by a closeencounter between the smc and the lmc. in both galaxies the youngest clustersreside in the supergiant shells, giant shells, the inter-shell regions, andtoward regions with a high h$\alpha$ content, suggesting that their formationis related to expansion and shell-shell interaction. most of the clusters areolder than the dynamical age of the supergiant shells. no evidence for clusterdissolution was found. computed v band luminosities show a trend for faintermagnitudes with increasing age as well as a trend for brighter magnitudes withincreasing apparent cluster radii.

0708.1853	a wide-field view of leo ii -- a structural analysis using the sdss	using sdss i data, we have analysed the stellar distribution of the leo iidwarf spheroidal galaxy (distance of 233 kpc) to search for evidence of tidaldeformation. the existing sdss photometric catalogue contains gaps in regionsof high stellar crowding, hence we filled the area at the centre of leo iiusing the daophot algorithm applied to the sdss images. the combineddaophot-sdss dataset contains three-filter photometry over a 4x4 square degreeregion centred on leo ii. by defining a mask in three-filter colour-magnitudespace, we removed the majority of foreground field stars. we have measured thefollowing leo ii structural parameters: a core radius of r_c = 2.64 +/- 0.19arcmin (178 +/- 13 pc), a tidal radius of r_t = 9.33 +/- 0.47 arcmin (632 +/-32 pc) and a total v-band luminosity of l_v = (7.4 +/- 2.0) times 10^5 l_sun(m_v = -9.9 +/- 0.3). our comprehensive analysis of the leo ii structure didnot reveal any significant signs of tidal distortion. the internal structure ofthis object contains only mild isophotal twisting. a small overdensity wasdiscovered appoximately 4.5 tidal radii from the leo ii centre, however weconclude it is unlikely to be material tidally stripped from leo ii based onits stellar population, and is most likely a foreground overdensity of stars.our results indicate that the influence of the galactic graviational field onthe structure of leo ii has been relatively mild. we rederived themass-to-light ratio of this system using existing kinematic data combined withour improved structural measurements, and favour the scenario in which leo iiis strongly dominated by dark matter with (m/l)_v ~ 100 in solar units.

1008.2966	search for extratidal features around 17 globular clusters in the sloan  digital sky survey	the dynamical evolution of a single globular cluster and also of the entiregalactic globular cluster system has been studied theoretically in detail. inparticular, simulations show how the 'lost' stars are distributed in tidaltails emerging from the clusters. we investigate the distribution of galacticglobular cluster stars on the sky to identify such features like tidal tails.the sloan digital sky survey provides consistent photometry of a large part ofthe sky to study the projected two dimensional structure of the 17 globularclusters in its survey area. we use a color-magnitude weighted countingalgorithm to map (potential) cluster member stars on the sky. we recover thealready known tidal tails of pal 5 and ngc 5466. for ngc 4147 we have found atwo arm morphology. possible indications of tidal tails are also seen aroundngc 5053 and ngc 7078, supporting earlier suggestions. moreover, we findpotential tails around ngc 5904 and pal 14. especially for the palomar clustersthan pal 5, deeper data are needed in order to confirm or to rule out theexistence of tails. for many of the remaining clusters in our sample we observea pronounced extratidal halo, which is particularly large for ngc 7006 and pal1. in some cases, the extratidal halos may be associated with the stream of thesagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (e.g.,ngc 4147, ngc 5024, ngc 5053).

1012.2127	the dawning of the stream of aquarius in rave	we identify a new, nearby (0.5 &lt; d &lt; 10 kpc) stream in data from the radialvelocity experiment (rave). as the majority of stars in the stream lie in theconstellation of aquarius we name it the aquarius stream. we identify 15members of the stream lying between 30 &lt; l &lt; 75 and -70&lt; b &lt;-50, withheliocentric line-of-sight velocities v_los~-200 km/s. the members are outliersin the radial velocity distribution, and the overdensity is statisticallysignificant when compared to mock samples created with both the besan\c{c}ongalaxy model and newly-developed code galaxia. the metallicity distributionfunction and isochrone fit in the log g - t_eff plane suggest the streamconsists of a 10 gyr old population with [m/h]~-1.0. we explore relations toother streams and substructures, finding the stream cannot be identified withknown structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the galaxy's halo. usinga simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy we account for thelocalization of the stream. we find that the stream is dynamically young andtherefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globularcluster. the aquarius stream is thus a specimen of ongoing hierarchical galaxyformation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.

1103.6234	satellites in the local group and other nearby groups	in recent years the census of known satellites in our own local group and innearby galaxy groups has increased substantially due to sensitive wide-areasurveys. in the local group these surveys have more than doubled its knowngalaxy content and extended the galaxy luminosity function to very faint totalmagnitudes. deep ground-based imaging and spectroscopic observations as well ashigh-resolution imaging with the hubble space telescope have revolutionized ourunderstanding of the chemical evolution and star formation histories of thesatellites. we often find long-lasting star formation episodes with low starformation efficiencies. there is evidence for localized, stochastic enrichment,and recent searches are now beginning to uncover even extremely metal-deficientstars. in many satellites evidence for two or more distinct stellarsubpopulations is found. differing fractions of old populations have beendetected in all satellites studied in sufficient detail so far. kinematicmeasurements support a picture in which satellites are dark-matter dominated,although recent results indicate that the proposed common mass scale for dwarfspheroidal galaxies may not hold for very low-mass satellites. when consideringsatellite ensembles, we find global morphology-distance and gas-content -distance relations in all groups studied thus far, but individual starformation histories also strongly depend on a given satellite's intrinsicproperties.

1105.3691	observational properties of the metal-poor thick disk of the milky way  galaxy and insights into its origins	we have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematicproperties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected fromthe rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to differentiate among thepresent scenarios of the formation of the thick disk. in this paper, we reporton a sample of 214 red giant branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74main-sequence/sub-giant branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment ourprevious sample of only giant stars. we find that the thick disk [alpha/fe]ratios are enhanced, and have little variation (&lt;0.1 dex), in agreement withour previous study. the augmented sample further allows, for the first time,investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, &lt;0.03 +/- 0.02dex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radialgradient and a -0.09 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc vertical gradient in iron abundance. inaddition, we show that the peak of the distribution of orbital eccentricitiesfor our sample agrees better with models in which the stars that comprise thethick disk were formed primarily in the galaxy, with direct accretion of starscontributing little. our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars fromdwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick diskpopulation, but cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thickdisk, such as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of apre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migrationof stars.

1108.2032	a two-dimensional map of color excess in ngc 3603	using archival hst/wfc3 images centered on the young hd 97950 star cluster inthe giant hii region ngc 3603, we computed the pixel-to-pixel distribution ofthe color excess, e(b-v)g, of the gas associated with this cluster from itsh_alpha/pa_beta flux ratio. at the assumed distance of 6.9 kpc, the resultingmedian color excess within 1 pc from the cluster center is e(b-v)g =1.51 \pm0.04 mag. outside the cluster (at r &gt; 1 pc), the color excess is seen toincrease with cluster-centric distance towards both north and south, reaching avalue of about 2.2 mag at r = 2 pc from the cluster center. the radialdependence of e(b-v)g westward of the cluster appears rather flat at about 1.55mag over the distance range 1.2 pc &lt; r &lt; 3 pc. in the eastern direction,e(b-v)g steadily increases from 1.5 mag at r = 1 pc to 1.7 mag at r = 2 pc, andstays nearly constant at 1.7 mag for 2 pc &lt; r &lt; 3 pc. the different radialprofiles and the pixel-to-pixel variations of e(b-v)g clearly indicate thepresence of significant differential reddening across the 4.9 pc \times 4.3 pcarea centered on the hd 97950 star cluster. we interpret the variations ofe(b-v)g as the result of stellar radiation and stellar winds interacting withan inhomogeneous dusty local interstellar medium (ism) whose density variesspatially. from the e(b-v)g values measured along the rims of the prominentpillars mm1 and mm2 in the southwest and southeast of the hd 97950 cluster weestimate an h2 column density of log10(n(h2))=21.7 and extrapolate it tolog10(n(h2))=23 in the pillars' interior. we find the pillars to be closer tous than the central ionizing cluster and suggest that star formation may beoccurring in the pillar heads.

1109.3916	building the galactic halo from globular clusters: evidence from  chemically unusual red giants	we present a spectroscopic search for halo field stars that originally formedin globular clusters. using moderate-resolution sdss-iii/segue-2 spectra of 561red giants with typical halo metallicities (-1.8 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -1.0), we identify16 stars, 3% of the sample, with cn and ch bandstrength behavior indicatingdepleted carbon and enhanced nitrogen abundances relative to the rest of thedata set. since globular clusters are the only environment known in which starsform with this pattern of atypical light-element abundances, we claim thatthese stars are second-generation globular cluster stars that have been lost tothe halo field via normal cluster mass-loss processes. extrapolating fromtheoretical models of two-generation globular cluster formation, this resultsuggests that globular clusters contributed significant numbers of stars to theconstruction of the galactic halo: we calculate that a minimum of 17% of thepresent-day mass of the stellar halo was originally formed in globularclusters. the ratio of cn-strong to cn-normal stars drops with galactocentricdistance, suggesting that the inner-halo population may be the primaryrepository of these stars.

1111.1165	dwarf spheroidal galaxy kinematics and spiral galaxy scaling laws	kinematic surveys of the dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellites of the milky wayare revealing tantalising hints about the structure of dark matter (dm) haloesat the low-mass end of the galaxy luminosity function. at the bright end,modelling of spiral galaxies has shown that their rotation curves areconsistent with the hypothesis of a universal rotation curve whose shape issupported by a cored dark matter halo. in this paper, we investigate whetherthe internal kinematics of the milky way dsphs are consistent with theparticular cored dm distributions which reproduce the properties of spiralgalaxies. although the dm densities in dsphs are typically almost two orders ofmagnitude higher than those found in (larger) disk systems, we find consistencybetween dsph kinematics and burkert dm haloes whose core radii r0 and centraldensities {\rho}0 lie on the extrapolation of the scaling law seen in spiralgalaxies: log {\rho}0 \simeq {\alpha} log r0 + const with 0.9 &lt; {\alpha} &lt; 1.1.we similarly find that the dsph data are consistent with the relation between{\rho}0 and baryon scale length seen in spiral galaxies. while the origin ofthese scaling relations is unclear, the finding that a single dm halo profileis consistent with kinematic data in galaxies of widely varying size,luminosity and hubble type is important for our understanding of observedgalaxies and must be accounted for in models of galaxy formation.

1111.1623	metal-poor lithium-rich giants in the radial velocity experiment survey	we report the discovery of eight lithium-rich field giants found in a highresolution spectroscopic sample of over 700 metal-poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5)selected from the rave survey. the majority of the li-rich giants in our sampleare very metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-1.9), and have a li abundance (in the form of7li), a(li)=log(n(li)/n(h))+12, between 2.30 and 3.63, well above the typicalupper red giant branch limit, a(li)&lt;0.5, while two stars, with a(li)~1.7-1.8,show similar lithium abundances to normal giants at the same gravity. wefurther included two metal-poor, li-rich globular cluster giants in our sample,namely the previously discovered m3-iv101 and newly discovered (in this work)m68-a96. this comprises the largest sample of metal-poor li-rich giants todate. we performed a detailed abundance analysis of all stars, finding that themajority our sample stars have elemental abundances similar to that ofli-normal halo giants. although the evolutionary phase of each li-rich giantcannot be definitively determined, the li-rich phase is likely connected toextra mixing at the red giant branch bump or early asymptotic giant branch thattriggers cool bottom processing in which the bottom of the outer convectiveenvelope is connected to the h-burning shell in the star. the surface of a starbecomes li-enhanced as 7be (which burns to 7li) is transported to the stellarsurface via the cameron-fowler mechanism. we discuss and discriminate amongseveral models for the extra mixing that can cause li-production, given thedetailed abundances of the li-rich giants in our sample.

1111.6586	metallicity distribution functions of the old populations of the  magellanic clouds from rr lyrae stars	we present the first metallicity distribution functions of the old fieldpopulations in the magellanic clouds. our metallicities are based on thefourier decomposition of type ab rr lyrae light curves from the opticalgravitational lensing experiment (ogle-iii). on the metallicity scale of zinn &amp;west; we find a mean metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.50 +/- 0.24 dex based on 16776rr lyrae stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). for the small magellaniccloud (smc) we obtain -1.70 +/- 0.27 dex based on 1831 rr lyrae stars. theseuncertainties represent the intrinsic spread in the population rather than thestandard deviation of the mean. our results are in good agreement with the fewexisting spectroscopic metallicity determinations for lmc rr lyrae stars fromthe literature. for both the lmc and the smc the metallicity spread exceeds 1dex in [fe/h]. the distribution of metallicities in both clouds is veryuniform, and no significant metallicity gradient is detectable. we also do notfind any pronounced populations of extremely metal-poor rr lyrae candidateswith metallicities well below -2 dex, although we need to caution that thephotometric method used may overestimate the metallicities of metal-deficientstars. moreover, because of stellar evolutionary effects one does not expect toobserve many rr lyrae stars among very metal-poor horizontal branch stars. wesuggest that the magellanic clouds experienced fairly rapid and efficient earlyenrichment involving pre-enriched gas as well as possibly gas infall, whilemetal loss through outflows does not seem to have played a significant role.moreover we suggest that the differences in the metallicities of the oldpopulation of lmc and smc make an origin from a single, common progenitorunlikely, unless the separation happened very early on.

0710.4135	virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies with the sloan digital sky  survey. iv. the color-magnitude relation	we present an analysis of the optical colors of 413 virgo cluster early-typedwarf galaxies (des), based on sloan digital sky survey imaging data. our studycomprises (1) a comparison of the color-magnitude relation (cmr) of thedifferent de subclasses that we identified in paper iii of this series, (2) acomparison of the shape of the cmr in low and high-density regions, (3) ananalysis of the scatter of the cmr, and (4) an interpretation of the observedcolors with ages and metallicities from population synthesis models. we findthat the cmrs of nucleated (de(n)) and non-nucleated des (de(nn)) aresignificantly different from each other, with similar colors at faintermagnitudes (r &gt; 17 mag), but increasingly redder colors of the de(n)s atbrighter magnitudes. we interpret this with older ages and/or highermetallicities of the brighter de(n)s. the des with disk features have similarcolors as the de(n)s and seem to be only slightly younger and/or lessmetal-rich on average. furthermore, we find a small but significant dependenceof the cmr on local projected galaxy number density, consistently seen in allof u-r, g-r, and g-i, and weakly i-z. we deduce that a significant intrinsiccolor scatter of the cmr is present, even when allowing for a distance spreadof our galaxies. no increase of the cmr scatter at fainter magnitudes isobserved down to r = 17 mag (mr = -14 mag). the color residuals, i.e., theoffsets of the data points from the linear fit to the cmr, are clearlycorrelated with each other in all colors for the de(n)s and for the full desample. we conclude that there must be at least two different formationchannels for early-type dwarfs in order to explain the heterogeneity of thisclass of galaxy.

1205.5716	"counterpart" method for abundance determinations in hii regions	we suggest a new way of the determining abundances and electron temperaturesin hii regions from strong emission lines. our approach is based on thestandard assumption that hii regions with similar intensities of strongemission lines have similar physical properties and abundances. a "counterpart"for a studied hii region may be chosen among hii regions with well-measuredabundances (reference hii regions) by comparison of carefully chosencombinations of strong line intensities. then the abundances in theinvestigated hii region can be assumed to be the same as that in itscounterpart. in other words, we suggest to determine the abundances in hiiregions "by precedent". to get more reliable abundances for the considered hiiregion, a number of reference hii regions is selected and then the abundancesin the target hii region is estimated through extra-/interpolation. we willrefer to this method of abundance determination as the counterpart method or,for brevity, the c method. we define a sample of reference hii regions andverify the validity of the c method. we find that this method produces reliableabundances. finally, the c method is used to obtain the radial abundancedistributions in the extended discs of the spiral galaxies m83, ngc4625 and ngc628.

1206.4999	chemical abundances of metal-poor rr lyrae stars in the magellanic  clouds	we present for the first time a detailed spectroscopic study of chemicalelement abundances of metal-poor rr lyrae stars in the large and smallmagellanic cloud (lmc and smc). using the mage echelle spectrograph at the 6.5mmagellan telescopes, we obtain medium resolution (r ~ 2000 - 6000) spectra ofsix rr lyrae stars in the lmc and three rr lyrae stars in the smc. these starswere chosen because their previously determined photometric metallicities wereamong the lowest metallicities found for stars belonging to the old populationsin the magellanic clouds. we find the spectroscopic metallicities of thesestars to be as low as [fe/h]_{spec} = -2.7dex, the lowest metallicity yetmeasured for any star in the magellanic clouds. we confirm that for metal-poorstars, the photometric metallicities from the fourier decomposition of thelightcurves are systematically too high compared to their spectroscopiccounterparts. however, for even more metal-poor stars below [fe/h]_{phot} &lt;-2.8dex this trend is reversed and the spectroscopic metallicities aresystematically higher than the photometric estimates. we are able to determineabundance ratios for ten chemical elements, which extend the abundancemeasurements of chemical elements for rr lyrae stars in the clouds beyond[fe/h] for the first time. for the overall [alpha/fe] ratio, we obtain anoverabundance of 0.36dex, which is in very good agreement with results frommetal-poor stars in the milky way halo as well as from the metal-poor tail indwarf spheroidal galaxies. comparing the abundances with those of the stars inthe milky way halo we find that the abundance ratios of stars of bothpopulations are consistent with another. therefore we conclude that from achemical point of view early contributions from magellanic-type galaxies to theformation of the galactic halo as claimed in cosmological models are plausible.

1207.5537	observed versus modelled u,g,r,i,z-band photometry of local galaxies -  evaluation of model performance	we test how well available stellar population models can reproduce observedu,g,r,i,z-band photometry of the local galaxy population (0.02&lt;=z&lt;=0.03) asprobed by the sdss. our study is conducted from the perspective of a user ofthe models, who has observational data in hand and seeks to convert them intophysical quantities. stellar population models for galaxies are created bysynthesizing star formations histories and chemical enrichments using singlestellar populations from several groups (starburst99, galaxev, maraston2005,galev). the role of dust is addressed through a simplistic, but observationallymotivated, dust model that couples the amplitude of the extinction to the starformation history, metallicity and the viewing angle. moreover, the influenceof emission lines is considered (for the subset of models for which thiscomponent is included). the performance of the models is investigated by: 1)comparing their prediction with the observed galaxy population in the sdssusing the (u-g)-(r-i) and (g-r)-(i-z) color planes, 2) comparing predictedstellar mass and luminosity weighted ages and metallicities, specific starformation rates, mass to light ratios and total extinctions with literaturevalues from studies based on spectroscopy. strong differences between thevarious models are seen, with several models occupying regions in thecolor-color diagrams where no galaxies are observed. we would therefore like toemphasize the importance of the choice of model. using our preferred model wefind that the star formation history, metallicity and also dust content can beconstrained over a large part of the parameter space through the use ofu,g,r,i,z-band photometry. however, strong local degeneracies are present dueto overlap of models with high and low extinction in certain parts of colorspace.

1207.5576	the star cluster formation history of the lmc	the large magellanic cloud is one of the nearest galaxies to us and is one ofonly few galaxies where the star formation history can be determined fromstudying resolved stellar populations. we have compiled a new catalogue ofages, luminosities and masses of lmc star clusters and used it to determine theage distribution and dissolution rate of lmc star clusters. we find that thefrequency of massive clusters with masses m&gt;5000 msun is almost constantbetween 10 and 200 myr, showing that the influence of residual gas expulsion islimited to the first 10 myr of cluster evolution or clusters less massive than5000 msun. comparing the cluster frequency in that interval with the absolutestar formation rate, we find that about 15% of all stars in the lmc were formedin long-lived star clusters that survive for more than 10 myr. we also findthat the mass function of lmc clusters younger than 1 gyr can be fitted by apower-law mass function with slope \alpha=-2.3, while older clusters follow asignificantly shallower slope and interpret this is a sign of the ongoingdissolution of low-mass clusters. our data shows that for ages older than 200myr, about 90% of all clusters are lost per dex of lifetime. the impliedcluster dissolution rate is significantly faster than that based on analyticestimates and n-body simulations. our cluster age data finally shows evidencefor a burst in cluster formation about 1 gyr ago, but little evidence forbursts at other ages.

1208.2894	metal-poor galaxies in the local universe	a galaxy's mean metallicity is usually closely correlated with its luminosityand mass. consequently the most metal-poor galaxies in the local universe aredwarf galaxies. blue compact dwarfs and tidal dwarfs tend to deviate from themetallicity-luminosity relation by being too metal-poor or too metal-rich fortheir luminosity, respectively. a less pronounced offset separates dwarfspheroidal (dsph) and dwarf irregular galaxies, making the former toometal-rich for their luminosity, which indicates different formation conditionsfor these two types of dwarfs. while environment (photo-evaporation throughlocal re-ionization by massive galaxies, tidal and ram pressure stripping)govern the observed morphology-distance relation, intrinsic properties (inparticular total mass) play a decisive role in dwarf galaxy evolution withrespect to the time and duration of star formation and the amount ofenrichment. the metallicity distribution functions of nearby dwarfs can beunderstood taking pre-enrichment, gas infall, and winds into account. manydwarfs show evidence for inhomogeneous, localized enrichment. ultra-faintdsphs, which may have formed their metal-poor stars at high redshift via h2cooling, show an overabundance of metal-deficient stars as compared to the(inner) galactic halo, but may, along with classical dsphs, have contributedsignificantly to the build-up of the outer halo. the abundance ratios measuredin the irregular large magellanic cloud are consistent with the postulatedearly accretion of irregulars to form the inner galactic halo.

1211.3764	giant galaxies, dwarfs, and debris survey. i. dwarf galaxies and tidal  features around ngc 7331	the giant galaxies, dwarfs, and debris survey concentrates on the nearbyuniverse to study how galaxies have interacted in groups of differentmorphology, density, and richness. in these groups we select the dominantspiral galaxy and search its surroundings for dwarf galaxies and tidalinteractions. this paper presents the first results from deep wide-fieldimaging of ngc 7331, where we detect only four low luminosity candidate dwarfcompanions and a stellar stream that may be evidence of a past tidalinteraction. the dwarf galaxy candidates have surface brightnesses of mu_{r} ~23-25 mag/arcsec^{2} with (g-r) colors of 0.57-0.75mag in the sloan digital skysurvey filter system, consistent with their being dwarf spheroidal galaxies(dsph). a faint stellar stream structure on the western edge of ngc 7331 hasmu_{g} ~27 mag/arcsec^{2} and a relatively blue color of (g-r)=0.15mag. if itis tidal debris, then this stream could have probably formed from a rare typeof interaction between ngc 7331 and a dwarf irregular or transition-type dwarfgalaxy. we compare the structure and local environments of ngc 7331 to those ofother nearby giant spirals in small galaxy groups. ngc 7331 has a much lower(2%) stellar mass in the form of early-type satellites than found for m31 andlacks the presence of nearby companions like luminous dwarf elliptical galaxiesor the magellanic clouds. however, our detection of a few dsph candidatessuggests that it is not deficient in low-luminosity satellites.

1212.4566	on the origin of mass segregation in ngc 3603	we present deep hubble space telescope/wide field and planetary camera 2photometry of the young hd 97950 star cluster in the giant h {\sc ii} regionngc 3603. the data were obtained in 1997 and 2007 permitting us to derivemembership based on proper motions of the stars. our data are consistent withan age of 1 myr for the hd 97950 cluster. a possible age spread, if present inthe cluster, appears to be small. the global slope of theincompleteness-corrected mass function for member stars within 60$"$ is $\rm\gamma=-0.88\pm0.15$, which is flatter than the value of a salpeter slope of-1.35. the radially varying mass function shows pronounced mass segregationranging from slopes of $-0.26 \pm 0.32$ in the inner $5"$ to $-0.94\pm 0.36$ inthe outermost annulus ($40"$ -- $60"$). stars more massive than 50 m$_{\odot}$are found only in the cluster center. the $\lambda$ minimum spanning treetechnique confirms significant mass segregation down to 30 m$_{\odot}$. thedependence of $\lambda$ on mass, i.e., that high-mass stars are more segregatedthan low mass stars, and the (weak) dependence of the velocity dispersion onstellar mass might imply that the mass segregation is dynamical in origin.while primordial segregation cannot be excluded, the properties of the masssegregation indicate that dynamical mass segregation may have been the dominantprocess for segregation of high-mass stars.

1301.5010	mass segregation in the diffuse outer-halo globular cluster palomar 14	we present an analysis of the radial dependence of the stellar mass functionin the diffuse outer-halo globular cluster palomar 14. using archival hst/wfpc2data of the cluster's central 39 pc (corresponding to ~0.85*r_h) we find thatthe mass function in the mass range of 0.55 to 0.85 solar masses is wellapproximated by a power-law at all radii. the mass function steepens withincreasing radius, from a shallow power-law slope of 0.66+/-0.32 in thecluster's centre to a slope of 1.61+/-0.33 beyond the core radius, showing thatthe cluster is mass-segregated. this is seemingly in conflict with its longpresent-day half-mass relaxation time of ~20 gyr, and with the recent findingby beccari et al. (2011), who interpret the cluster's non-concentratedpopulation of blue straggler stars as evidence that dynamical segregation hasnot affected the cluster yet. we discuss this apparent conflict and argue thatthe cluster must have either formed with primordial mass segregation, or thatits relaxation time scale must have been much smaller in the past, i.e. thatthe cluster must have undergone a significant expansion.

1309.4270	new distances to rave stars	probability density functions are determined from new stellar parameters forthe distance moduli of stars for which the radial velocity experiment (rave)has obtained spectra with s/n&gt;=10. single-gaussian fits to the pdf in distancemodulus suffice for roughly half the stars, with most of the other half havingsatisfactory two-gaussian representations. as expected, early-type stars rarelyrequire more than one gaussian. the expectation value of distance is largerthan the distance implied by the expectation of distance modulus; the latter isitself larger than the distance implied by the expectation value of theparallax. our parallaxes of hipparcos stars agree well with the values measuredby hipparcos, so the expectation of parallax is the most reliable distanceindicator. the latter are improved by taking extinction into account. theeffective temperature absolute-magnitude diagram of our stars is significantlyimproved when these pdfs are used to make the diagram. we use the method ofkinematic corrections devised by schoenrich, binney &amp; asplund to check forsystematic errors for general stars and confirm that the most reliable distanceindicator is the expectation of parallax. for cool dwarfs and low-gravitygiants &lt;pi&gt; tends to be larger than the true distance by up to 30 percent. themost satisfactory distances are for dwarfs hotter than 5500 k. we compare ourdistances to stars in 13 open clusters with cluster distances from theliterature and find excellent agreement for the dwarfs and indications that weare over-estimating distances to giants, especially in young clusters.

1309.4285	galactic kinematics and dynamics from rave stars	we analyse the kinematics of ~400000 rave stars. we split the sample into hotand cold dwarfs, red-clump and non-clump giants. the kinematics of the clumpgiants are consistent with being identical with those of non-clump giants. wefit gaussian velocity ellipsoids to the meridional-plane components of velocityof each star class and give formulae from which the shape and orientation ofthe velocity ellipsoid can be determined at any location. the data areconsistent with the giants and the cool dwarfs sharing the same velocityellipsoids; sigma_z rises from 21 kms in the plane to sim 55 kms at |z|=2 kpc,while sigma_r rises from 37 kms to 82 kms. at (r,z) the longest axis of one ofthese velocity ellipsoids is inclined to the galactic plane by an angle ~0.8arctan(z/r). we use a novel formula to obtain precise fits to the highlynon-gaussian distributions of v_phi components.  we compare the observed velocity distributions with the predictions of adynamical model fitted to the velocities of stars that lie within ~150 pc ofthe sun and star counts towards the galactic pole. the model accuratelyreproduces the non-gaussian nature of the v_r and v_z distributions andprovides excellent fits to the data for v_z at all locations. the model v_phidistributions for the cool dwarfs fit the data extremely well, while those forthe hot dwarfs have displacements to low v_phi that grow with |z| from verysmall values near the plane. at |z|&gt;0.5 kpc, the theoretical v_phidistributions for giants show a deficit of stars with large v_phi and the modelv_r distributions are too narrow. systematically over-estimating distances by20 per cent introduces asymmetry into the model v_r and v_z distributions nearthe plane and but significantly improves the fits to the data at |z|&gt;0.5 kpc.the quality of the fits lends credence to the assumed, disc-dominated,gravitational potential.

1404.6001	hierarchical star formation in nearby legus galaxies	hierarchical structure in ultraviolet images of 12 late-type legus galaxiesis studied by determining the numbers and fluxes of nested regions as afunction of size from ~1 to ~200 pc, and the number as a function of flux. twostarburst dwarfs, ngc 1705 and ngc 5253, have steeper number-size and flux-sizedistributions than the others, indicating high fractions of the projected areasfilled with star formation. nine subregions in 7 galaxies have similarly steepnumber-size slopes, even when the whole galaxies have shallower slopes. theresults suggest that hierarchically structured star-forming regions severalhundred parsecs or larger represent common unit structures. small galaxiesdominated by only a few of these units tend to be starbursts. theself-similarity of young stellar structures down to parsec scales suggests thatstar clusters form in the densest parts of a turbulent medium that also formsloose stellar groupings on larger scales. the presence of super star clustersin two of our starburst dwarfs would follow from the observed structure ifcloud and stellar subregions more readily coalesce when self-gravity in theunit cell contributes more to the total gravitational potential.

1407.2937	mass segregation in the outer halo globular cluster palomar 14	we present evidence for mass segregation in the outer-halo globular clusterpalomar 14, which is intuitively unexpected since its present-day two-bodyrelaxation time significantly exceeds the hubble time. based on archival hubblespace telescope imaging, we analyze the radial dependence of the stellar massfunction in the cluster's inner 39.2 pc in the mass range of 0.53-0.80 m_sun,ranging from the main-sequence turn-off down to a v-band magnitude of 27.1 mag.the mass function at different radii is well approximated by a power law andrises from a shallow slope of 0.6+/-0.2 in the cluster's core to a slope of1.6+/-0.3 beyond 18.6 pc. this is seemingly in conflict with the finding bybeccari et al. (2011), who interpret the cluster's non-segregated population of(more massive) blue straggler stars, compared to (less massive) red giants andhorizontal branch stars, as evidence that the cluster has not experienceddynamical segregation yet. we discuss how both results can be reconciled. ourfindings indicate that the cluster was either primordially mass-segregatedand/or used to be significantly more compact in the past. for the latter case,we propose tidal shocks as the mechanism driving the cluster's expansion, whichwould imply that palomar 14 is on a highly eccentric orbit. conversely, if thecluster formed already extended and with primordial mass segregation, thiscould support an accretion origin of the cluster.

1407.4119	stellar age spreads in clusters as imprints of cluster-parent clump  densities	it has recently been suggested that high-density clusters have stellar agedistributions narrower than that of the orion nebula cluster, indicating apossible trend of narrower age distributions for denser clusters. we show thiseffect to likely arise from star formation being faster in gas with a higherdensity. we model the star formation history of molecular clumps in equilibriumby associating a star formation efficiency (sfe) per free-fall time, \eff, totheir volume density profile. our model predicts a steady decline of the starformation rate (sfr), which we quantify with its half-life time, namely, thetime needed for the sfr to drop to half its initial value.  given the uncertainties affecting the sfe per free-fall time, we consider twodistinct values: 0.1 and 0.01. for isothermal spheres, \eff=0.1 leads to ahalf-life time of order the clump free-fall time, \tff. therefore, the agedistributions of stars formed in high-density clumps have smaller full-widthsat half-maximum than those of stars formed in low-density clumps. when\eff=0.01, the half-life time is 10 times longer. we explore what happens ifthe star formation duration is shorter than 10\tff, that is, if the half-lifetime of the sfr cannot be defined. there, we build on the invariance of theshape of the young cluster mass function to show that an anti-correlationbetween clump density and star formation duration is expected. therefore,regardless of whether the star formation duration is longer than the sfrhalf-life time, denser molecular clumps yield narrower star age distributionsin clusters.  published densities and stellar age spreads of young clusters actuallysuggest that the time-scale for star formation is of order 1-4\tff. we concludethat there is no need to invoke the existence of multiple cluster formationmechanisms to explain the observed range of stellar age spreads in clusters.

1504.07483	on the influence of minor mergers on the radial abundance gradient in  disks of milky way-like galaxies	we investigate the influence of stellar migration caused by minor mergers(mass ratio from 1:70 to 1:8) on the radial distribution of chemical abundancesin the disks of milky way-like galaxies during the last four gyr. a gpu-basedpure n-body tree-code model without hydrodynamics and star formation was used.we computed a large set of mergers with different initial satellite masses,positions, and orbital velocities. we find that there is no significantmetallicity change at any radius of the primary galaxy in the case of accretionof a low-mass satellite of 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$ (mass ratio 1:70) except for thespecial case of prograde satellite motion in the disk plane of the host galaxy.the accretion of a satellite of a mass $\gtrsim3\times10^9$ m$_{\odot}$ (massratio 1:23) results in an appreciable increase of the chemical abundances atgalactocentric distances larger than $\sim10$ kpc. the radial abundancegradient flattens in the range of galactocentric distances from 5 to 15 kpc inthe case of a merger with a satellite with a mass $\gtrsim3\times10^9$m$_{\odot}$. there is no significant change in the abundance gradient slope inthe outer disk (from $\sim15$ kpc up to 25 kpc) in any merger while the scatterin metallicities at a given radius significantly increases for most of thesatellite's initial masses/positions compared to the case of an isolatedgalaxy. this argues against attributing the break (flattening) of the abundancegradient near the optical radius observed in the extended disks of milkyway-like galaxies only to merger-induced stellar migration.

1504.08323	legus discovery of a light echo around supernova 2012aw	we have discovered a luminous light echo around the normal type ii-plateausupernova (sn) 2012aw in messier 95 (m95; ngc 3351), detected in imagesobtained approximately two years after explosion with the wide field channel 3on-board the hubble space telescope (hst) by the legacy extragalacticultraviolet survey (legus). the multi-band observations span from thenear-ultraviolet through the optical (f275w, f336w, f438w, f555w, and f814w).the apparent brightness of the echo at the time was ~21--22 mag in all of thesebands. the echo appears circular, although less obviously as a ring, with aninhomogeneous surface brightness, in particular, a prominent enhancedbrightness to the southeast. the sn itself was still detectable, particularlyin the redder bands. we are able to model the light echo as the time-integratedsn light scattered off of diffuse interstellar dust in the sn environment. wehave assumed that this dust is analogous to that in the milky way with r_v=3.1.the sn light curves that we consider also include models of the unobservedearly burst of light from the sn shock breakout. our analysis of the echosuggests that the distance from the sn to the scattering dust elements alongthe echo is ~45 pc. the implied visual extinction for the echo-producing dustis consistent with estimates made previously from the sn itself. finally, ourestimate of the sn brightness in f814w is fainter than that measured for thered supergiant star at the precise sn location in pre-sn images, possiblyindicating that the star has vanished and confirming it as the likely snprogenitor.

0805.1067	comparing cn and ch line strengths in a homogeneous spectroscopic sample  of 8 galactic globular clusters	our work focuses on the understanding of the origin of cno-anomalies, whichhave been detected in several galactic globular clusters (gcs). this study isbased on a homogeneous data set of hundreds of medium resolution spectra ofstars in eight gcs. two of the clusters are believed to be former members ofthe sagittarius dsph galaxy. our sample comprises stars in differentevolutionary states, namely the main sequence turn-off (msto) region, thesubgiant branch (sgb), and the base of the red giant branch (rgb). we comparethe relative cn and ch line strengths of stars in the same evolutionary states.the majority of the examined clusters show significant variations in their cnand ch abundances at the base of the rgb. the two former sgr dsph clusters donot exhibit any cn-strong stars. our results suggest that the environment inwhich the clusters influences existence of cn-strong stars. we confirm theknown anticorrelation between cn and ch for most of the observed gcs. althoughthe signal of cn absorption is weaker for the hotter stars on the msto and sgbwe observed the same anticorrelation in these less evolved stars for thecn-bimodal clusters. the inclusion of structural parameters taken fromliterature reveals that the existence of the cn-bifurcation seems to beindependent of most other cluster characteristics. in particular, we do notconfirm the correlation between cluster ellipticity and number of cn-strongstars. however, there may be a trend of an increased percentage of cn-strongstars with increasing cluster tidal radius and total luminosity. we argue thatour findings are consistent with pollution by intermediate agb stars and/orfast rotating massive stars and two generations of star formation in luminousclusters with larger tidal radii at larger galactocentric distances.

1506.03153	red runaways: hypervelocity stars, hills ejecta and other outliers in  the f-m star regime	in this paper we analyze a sample of metal-rich (&gt;-0.8 dex) main sequencestars in the extended solar neighborhood, investigating kinematic outliers fromthe background population. the data, which are taken from the sloan digital skysurvey, are kinematically profiled as a function of distance from the galacticplane using full six dimensional phase space information. each star is examinedin the context of these kinematic profiles and likelihoods are assigned toquantify whether a star matches the underlying profile. since some of thesestars are likely to have been ejected from the disc, we trace back their orbitsin order to determine potential ejection radii. we find that objects with lowprobability (i.e. `outliers') are typically more metal poor, faster and, mostimportantly, have a tendency to originate from the inner galaxy compared to theunderlying population.  we also compose a sample of stars with velocities exceeding the local escapevelocity. although we do not discount that our sample could be contaminated byobjects with spurious proper motions, a number of stars appear to have beenejected from the disc with exceptionally high velocities. some of these areconsistent with being ejected from the spiral arms and hence are a richresource for further study. finally we look at objects whose orbits areconsistent with them being ejected at high speeds from the galactic center. ofthese objects we find that one, j135855.65+552538.19, is inconsistent withhalo, bulge and disk kinematics and could plausibly have been ejected from thegalactic nucleus via a hills mechanism.

(1989) and fitzpatrick etal. (1999). it is closer to the extinction law derived by calzetti et al.(2000) for starburst galaxies, where the 0.2175 $\rm \mu m$ bump is absent.this indicates an anomalous extinction in the hd 97950 cluster, which may dueto the clumpy dust distribution within the cluster, and the size of dust grainsbeing larger than the average galactic ism.

astro-ph;0003155	the morphologies of the small magellanic cloud	we compare the distribution of stars of different spectral types, and hencemean age, within the central smc and find that the asymmetric structures arealmost exclusively composed of young main sequence stars. because of therelative lack of older stars in these features, and the extremely regulardistribution of red giant and clump stars in the smc central body, we concludethat tides alone are not responsible for the irregular appearance of thecentral smc. the dominant physical mechanism in determining the current-dayappearance of the smc must be star formation triggered by a hydrodynamicinteraction between gaseous components. these results extend the results ofpopulation studies (cf. gardiner and hatzidimitriou) inward in radius and alsoconfirm the suggestion of the spheroidal nature of the central smc based onkinematic arguments (dopita et al; hardy, suntzeff &amp; azzopardi). finally, wefind no evidence in the underlying older stellar population for a ``bar'' or``outer arm'', again supporting our classification of the central smc as aspheroidal body with highly irregular recent star formation.

astro-ph;0108100	new insights on the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy from sdss: a larger  radius and no tidal tails	we have investigated the spatial extent and structure of the draco dwarfspheroidal galaxy using deep wide-field multicolor ccd photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). our study covers an area of 27 square degreesaround the center of the draco dwarf. we show that the spatial distribution ofdraco's red giants, red horizontal branch stars and subgiants down to i=21.7mag does not provide evidence for the existence of tidally induced tails or ahalo of unbound stars. the radial profile can be fit by king models as well asby a generalized exponential. the core radius and the limiting (or tidal)radius along the major axis are 7.7' and 40.1', respectively, making draco 40%larger than previously measured. down to our magnitude limit tidal effects canonly exist at a level of 10^-3 of the central surface density of draco orbelow. the regular structure of draco found from the new data argues against itbeing a portion of an unbound tidal stream and lends support to the assumptionof dynamical equilibrium. we estimate draco's total mass to be 2.2 - 3.5 times10^7 solar masses. we obtain an overall mass-to-light ratio of 146+-42 or92+-28 solar masses depending on the details of the mass and luminosityestimates. in summary, our results strengthen the case for a strongly darkmatter dominated, bound stellar system.

(1999) catalogue we studied the star cluster systemof the lmc and provide a new catalogue of all binary and multiple clustercandidates found. we performed monte carlo simulations and produced artificialcluster distributions that we compared with the real one in order to check howmany of the found cluster pairs and groups can be expected statistically due tochance superposition on the plane of the sky. we found that, depending on thecluster density, between 56% (bar region) and 12% (outer lmc) of the detectedpairs can be explained statistically. we studied in detail the properties ofthe multiple cluster candidates. the binary cluster candidates seem to show atendency to form with components of similar size. when possible, we studied theage structure of the cluster groups and found that the multiple clusters arepredominantly young with only a few cluster groups older than 300 myr. thespatial distribution of the cluster pairs and groups coincides with thedistribution of clusters in general; however, old groups or groups with largeinternal age differences are mainly located in the densely populated barregion. thus, they can easily be explained as chance superpositions. ourfindings show that a formation scenario through tidal capture is not onlyunlikely due to the low probability of close encounters of star clusters, andthus the even lower probability of tidal capture, but the few groups with largeinternal age differences can easily be explained with projection effects. wefavour a formation scenario as suggested by fujimoto &amp; kumai (1997) in whichthe components of a binary cluster formed together and thus should be coeval orhave small age differences compatible with cluster formation time scales.

astro-ph;0301025	the progenitors of dwarf spheroidal galaxies	dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies present an evolutionary puzzle that weexplore in 40 early- and late-type dwarfs in the local group and nearby field.although dsphs formed stars over extended periods, today all but one are freeof detectable interstellar matter (ism), even in the fornax dsph, where starsstill formed 100 myr ago. combining metallicities for red giants with hi datafrom the literature, we show that the well-known offset inluminosity-metallicity (l-z) relations for dsphs and dwarf irregular (dirr)galaxies exists also when comparing only their old stellar populations: dsphshave higher mean stellar metallicities for a fixed luminosity. evidentlyyounger dsphs experienced more efficient enrichment than young dirrs. dwarfgalaxies, whose locus in the l-z diagram is consistent with that of dsphs evenfor baryonic luminosities, are the ``transition-type dwarfs'' phoenix, ddo210,lgs3, antlia, and kkr25. they have mixed dirr/dsph morphologies, low stellarmasses, low angular momentum, and hi contents of less than a few 10^6 solarmasses. unlike dirrs, many transition-type dwarfs would closely resemble dsphsif their gas were removed; they are likely dsph progenitors. as gas removal iskey, we consider the empirical evidence for various gas removal processes. wesuggest that internal gas removal mechanisms are inadequate and favor rampressure stripping to make dsphs. a combination of initial conditions andenvironment seems to support the formation of dsphs, which appear to form fromsmall galaxies with active early star formation, whose evolution halts due toexternally induced gas loss. transition-type dwarfs then are dsphs that kepttheir ism, and therefore should replace dsphs in isolated locations wherestripping is ineffective.

astro-ph;0301029	a low latitude halo stream around the milky way	we present evidence for a ring of stars in the plane of the milky way,extending at least from l = 180 deg to l = 227 deg with turnoff magnitude $g\sim 19.5$; the ring could encircle the galaxy. we infer that the low galacticlatitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of r = 18 +/- 2 kpc fromthe galactic center above the galactic plane, and has r = 20 +/- 2 kpc in theregion sampled below the galactic plane. the evidence includes five hundredsdss spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30 degrees of the plane.the velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found tobe 27 km/s at (l,b) = (198, -27), 22 km/s at (l,b) = (225, 28), 30 km/s at(l,b) = (188, 24), and 30 km/s at (l,b) = (182, 27) degrees. the structurerotates in the same prograde direction as the galactic disk stars, but with acircular velocity of 110+/-25 km/s. the narrow measured velocity dispersion isinconsistent with power law spheroid or thick disk populations. we compare thevelocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars inthe sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocitydispersion of 20 km/s at (l, b) = (165, -55) deg. we estimate a preliminarymetallicity from the ca ii (k) line and color of the turnoff stars of [fe/h] =-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistentwith that of the spheroid population. we interpret our measurements as evidencefor a tidally disrupted satellite of $2 \times 10^7$ to $5 \times 10^8 \rmm_\odot$ which rings the galaxy.

astro-ph;0301360	observing the dark matter density profile of isolated galaxies	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we probe the halo massdistribution by studying the velocities of satellites orbiting isolatedgalaxies. in a subsample that covers 2500 sq. degrees on the sky, we detectabout 3000 satellites with absolute blue magnitudes going down to m_b = -14;most of the satellites have m_b=-16 to -18, comparable to the magnitudes of m32and the magellanic clouds. after a careful, model-independent removal ofinterlopers, we find that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellitesdeclines with distance to the primary. for an l* galaxy the r.m.s.line-of-sight velocity changes from ~120 km/s at 20 kpc to ~60 km/s at 350 kpc.this decline agrees remarkably well with theoretical expectations, as allmodern cosmological models predict that the density of dark matter in theperipheral parts of galaxies declines as rho_dm propto r^{-3}. thus, for thefirst time we find direct observational evidence of the density declinepredicted by cosmological models; we also note that this result contradictsalternative theories of gravity such as mond. we also find that the velocitydispersion of satellites within 100 kpc scales with the absolute magnitude ofthe central galaxy as sigma propto l^{0.3}; this is very close to thetully-fisher relation for normal spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0308011	cn variations in ngc 7006	rotationally induced mixing with subsequent dredge-up of nucleosynthesizedmaterial is discussed as a second parameter of the horizontal branch morphologyin globular clusters. cno abundances have been proposed as tracers of thedredge up of processed material. \ngc is a prominent example of a secondparameter gc: its hb morphology is too red for its metallicity. we presentspectroscopic measurements of cn molecular band strengths s(3839) and ch bandch(4300) strengths for 12 giants in \ngc to test rotationally-driven mixing asa second parameter in this cluster. our observations reveal (i) a scatter instar-to-star cn absorption strengths with the same amplitude as seen in othergcs of the same metallicity, but different hb morphologies; (ii) a possiblecontinuous distribution of cn absorption strength with a preference forcn-enriched stars, and (iii) a possible weak radial gradient in the numberratio of cn-strong and cn-weak stars. we argue against the hypothesis thatcn-variations are directly correlated with the second parameter effect of thehb morphology. however, the small sample of stars measured in \ngc prevents usfrom drawing firm conclusions. finally, we identify one star of our sample as aforeground dwarf carbon star.

astro-ph;0308178	the near-ir properties and continuum shapes of high redshift quasars  from the sloan digital sky survey	we present j-h-k' photometry for a sample of 45 high redshift quasars foundby the sloan digital sky survey. the sample was originally selected on thebasis of optical colors and spans a redshift range from 3.6 to 5.03. ourphotometry reflects the rest-frame  sed longward of ly alpha for all redshifts. the results show that the near-ircolors of high redshift quasars are quite uniform. we have modelled thecontinuum shape of the quasars (from just beyond ly alpha to ~4000 a) with apower law of the form f_nu \propto nu^alpha, and find &lt;alpha &gt; =-0.57 with ascatter of 0.33. this value is similar to what is found for lower redshiftquasars over the same restframe wavelength range, and we conclude that there ishardly any evolution in the continuum properties of optically selected quasarsup to redshift 5. the spectral indices found by combining near-ir with opticalphotometry are in general consistent but slightly flatter than what is foundfor the same quasars using the optical spectra and photometry alone, showingthat the continuum region used to determine the spectral indices can somewhatinfluence the results.

astro-ph;0310644	low-surface-brightness galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  search method and test sample	in this paper we present results of a pilot study to use imaging data fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to search for low-surface-brightness (lsb)galaxies. for our pilot study we use a test sample of 92 galaxies from thecatalog of impey et al. (1996) distributed over 93 sdss fields of the earlydata release (edr). many galaxies from the test sample are either lsb or dwarfgalaxies. to deal with the sdss data most effectively a new photometry softwarewas created, which is described in this paper. we present the results of theselection algorithms applied to these 93 edr fields. two galaxies from theimpey et al. test sample are very likely artifacts, as confirmed by follow-upimaging. with our algorithms, we were able to recover 87 of the 90 remainingtest sample galaxies, implying a detection rate of $\sim$96.5%. the threemissed galaxies fall too close to very bright stars or galaxies. in addition,42 new galaxies with parameters similar to the test sample objects were foundin these edr fields (i.e., $\sim$47% additional galaxies). we present the mainphotometric parameters of all identified galaxies and carry out firststatistical comparisons. we tested the quality of our photometry by comparingthe magnitudes for our test sample galaxies and other bright galaxies withvalues from the literature. all these tests yielded consistent results. webriefly discuss a few unusual galaxies found in our pilot study, including anlsb galaxy with a two-component disk and ten new giant lsb galaxies.

astro-ph;0401098	a new giant stellar structure in the outer halo of m31	the sloan digital sky survey has revealed an overdensity of luminous redgiant stars ~ 3 degrees (40 projected kpc) to the northeast of m31, which wehave called andromeda ne. the line-of-sight distance to andromeda ne is withinapproximately 50 kpc of m31; andromeda ne is not a physically unrelatedprojection. andromeda ne has a g-band absolute magnitude of ~ -11.6 and centralsurface brightness of ~ 29 mag/sq.arcsec, making it nearly two orders ofmagnitude more diffuse than any known local group dwarf galaxy at thatluminosity. based on its distance and morphology, andromeda ne is likelyundergoing tidal disruption. andromeda ne's red giant branch color is unlikethat of m31's present-day outer disk or the stellar stream reported by ibata etal. (2001), arguing against a direct link between andromeda ne and thesestructures. however, andromeda ne has a red giant branch color similar to thatof the g1 clump; it is possible that these structures are both material tornoff of m31's disk in the distant past, or that these are both part of oneancient stellar stream.

astro-ph;0403222	the evolutionary history of local group irregular galaxies	irregular (irr) galaxies are gas-rich objects with recent or ongoing starformation. in absence of spiral density waves, star formation occurs largelystochastically. the scattered star-forming regions tend to be long-lived andmigrate slowly. older populations have a spatially more extended and regulardistribution. in fast-rotating irrs high star formation rates with strongerconcentration toward the galaxies' center are observed, and cluster formationis facilitated. in slowly or nonrotating dwarf irrs (dirrs) star formationoccurs more quiescently, and the formation of ob associations is common. irrsand dirrs tend to experience continuous star formation with amplitudevariations and to continue to form stars for another hubble time. irrs exhibitlower effective yields than spirals, and [alpha/fe] ratios below the solarvalue. this may be indicative of fewer type ii sne and lower astration rates intheir past. alternatively, many metals may be lost from the shallow galaxypotential wells due to selective winds. the differences in themetallicity-luminosity relation between dirrs and dwarf spheroidals (which,despite their lower masses, tend to have too high a metallicity for theirluminosity as compared to dirrs) further supports the idea of slow astrationand slow enrichment in dirrs. the current data on age-metallicity relations arestill too sparse to distinguish between infall, leaky-box, and closed-boxmodels. the preferred location of dirrs in the outer parts of galaxy groups andclusters and in the field as well as the positive correlation between gascontent and distance from massive galaxies indicate that these dirrs probablyhave not yet experienced significant interactions or galaxy harassment.(abridged)

astro-ph;0407117	impact of reionization on the stellar populations of nearby dwarf  galaxies	cold dark matter models for galaxy formation predict that low-mass systemswill be the first sites of star formation. as these objects have shallowgravitational potential wells, the subsequent growth of their stellarpopulations may be halted by heating and gas loss due to reionization. thiseffect has been suggested to have profoundly influenced properties ofpresent-day dwarf galaxies, including their stellar populations and evensurvival as visible galaxies. in this letter we draw on results fromquantitative studies of local group dwarf galaxy star formation histories,especially for milky way satellites, to show that no clear signature exists fora widespread evolutionary impact from reionization. all nearby dwarf galaxiesstudied in sufficient detail contain ancient populations indistinguishable inage from the oldest galactic globular clusters. ancient star formation activityproceeded over several gyr, and some dwarf spheroidal galaxies even experiencedfairly continuous star formation until just a few gyr ago. despite theiruniformly low masses, their star formation histories differ considerably. theevolutionary histories of nearby dwarf galaxies appear to reflect influencesfrom a variety of local processes rather than a dominant effect fromreionization.

astro-ph;0502447	on the origin of the radial mass density profile of the galactic halo  globular cluster system	we investigate what may be the origin of the presently observed spatialdistribution of the mass of the galactic old halo globular cluster system. wepropose its radial mass density profile to be a relic of the distribution ofthe cold baryonic material in the protogalaxy. assuming that this one arisesfrom the profile of the whole protogalaxy minus the contribution of the darkmatter (and a small contribution of the hot gas by which the protoglobularclouds were bound), we show that the mass distributions around the galacticcentre of this cold gas and of the old halo agree satisfactorily. in order todemonstrate our hypothesis even more conclusively, we simulate the evolutionwith time, up to an age of 15 gyr, of a putative globular cluster system whoseinitial mass distribution in the galactic halo follows the profile of the coldprotogalactic gas. we show that beyond a galactocentric distance of order 2 to3 kpc, the initial shape of such a mass density profile is preserved in spiteof the complete destruction of some globular clusters and the partialevaporation of some others. this result is almost independent of the choice ofthe initial mass function for the globular clusters, which is stillill-determined. the shape of these evolved cluster system mass density profilesalso agree with the presently observed profile of the old halo globular clustersystem, thus strengthening our hypothesis. our result might suggest that theflattening shown by the old halo mass density profile at short distance fromthe galactic centre is, at least partly, of primordial origin.

astro-ph;0509150	near-field cosmology with local group dwarf spheroidals	the local group offers an excellent laboratory for near-field cosmology bypermitting us to use the resolved stellar content of its constituent galaxiesas probes of galaxy formation and evolution, which in turn is an importantmeans for testing cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation. inthis review, we discuss the the least massive, yet most numerous type of galaxyin the local group, the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and compare their propertiesto cosmological predictions. in particular, we point out problems found with asimple building block scenario and with effects expected from reionization. weshow that the star formation histories of dsphs are inconsistent with thepredicted cessation of star formation after reionization; instead, extendedstar formation episodes are observed. the galactic dsphs contain in partprominent intermediate-age populations, whereas the galactic halo does not.conversely, the m31 dsphs are almost entirely old, while the m31 halo containsa substantial intermediate-age population. these differences in the populationstructure as well as the differences in the modes of star formation inferredfrom [alpha/fe] ratios make dsphs unlikely major contributors to the build-upof the galactic and m31 halo unless most of the accretion occurred at earlyepochs. on the other hand, there is clear evidence for ongoing harassment andaccretion of a number of dsphs.

astro-ph;0604216	virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies with the sloan digital sky  survey. i. on the possible disk nature of bright early-type dwarfs	we present a systematic search for disks in 476 virgo cluster early-typedwarf (de) galaxies. disk features (spiral arms, edge-on disks, or bars) wereidentified by applying unsharp masks to a combined image from three bands (g,r, i), as well as by subtracting the axisymmetric light distribution of eachgalaxy from that image. 14 objects are unambiguous identifications of disks, 10objects show 'probable disk' features, and 17 objects show 'possible disk'features. the number fraction of these galaxies, for which we introduce theterm dedi, reaches more than 50% at the bright end of the de population, anddecreases to less than 5% for magnitudes b&gt;16. the luminosity function of ourfull de sample can be explained by a superposition of dedis and ordinary des,strongly suggesting that dedis are a distinct type of galaxy. this is supportedby the projected spatial distribution: dedis show basically no clustering androughly follow the spatial distribution of spirals and irregulars, whereasordinary des are distributed similarly to the strongly clustered e/s0 galaxies.while the flattening distribution of ordinary des is typical for spheroidalobjects, the distribution of dedis is significantly different and agrees withtheir being flat oblate objects. we therefore conclude that the dedis are notspheroidal galaxies that just have an embedded disk component, but are insteada population of genuine disk galaxies. several dedis display well-definedspiral arms with grand design features that clearly differ from the flocculent,open arms typical for late-type spirals that have frequently been proposed asprogenitors of early-type dwarfs. this raises the question of what process isable to create such spiral arms - with pitch angles like those of sab/sbgalaxies - in bulgeless dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0608294	virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies with the sloan digital sky  survey. ii. early-type dwarfs with central star formation	despite the common picture of an early-type dwarf (de) as a quiescent galaxywith no star formation and little gas, we identify 23 des that have bluecentral colors caused by recent or ongoing star formation in our sample of 476virgo cluster des. in addition, 14 objects that were mostly classified as(candidate) bcds have similar properties. among the certain cluster members,the des with blue centers reach a fraction of more than 15% of the depopulation at brighter (b&lt;=16) magnitudes. a spectral analysis of the centersof 16 galaxies reveals in all cases an underlying old population that dominatesthe mass, with m(old)&gt;=90% for all but one object. therefore the majority ofthese galaxies will appear like ordinary des within ~one gigayear or less afterthe last episode of star formation. their overall gas content is less than thatof dwarf irregular galaxies, but higher than that of ordinary des. theirflattening distribution suggests the shape of a thick disk, similar to what hasbeen found for des with disk features in paper i of this series. theirprojected spatial distribution shows no central clustering, and theirdistribution with projected local density follows that of irregular galaxies,indicative of an unrelaxed population. this is corroborated by their velocitydistribution, which displays two side peaks characteristic of recent infall. wediscuss possible formation mechanisms (ram-pressure stripping, tidally inducedstar formation, harassment) that might be able to explain both the disk shapeand the central star formation of the des with blue centers.

astro-ph;0608472	the tully-fisher relation and its residuals for a broadly selected  sample of galaxies	we measure the relation between galaxy luminosity and disk circular velocity(the tully-fisher [tf] relation), in the g, r, i, and z-bands, for a broadlyselected sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey, with the goal ofproviding well defined observational constraints for theoretical models ofgalaxy formation. the input sample of 234 galaxies has a roughly flatdistribution of absolute magnitudes in the range -18.5 &gt; mr &gt; -22, and our onlymorphological selection is an axis-ratio cut b/a &lt; 0.6 to allow accurateinclination corrections. long-slit spectroscopy yields usable h-alpha rotationcurves for 162 galaxies. observational errors, including distance errors due topeculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the tfrelation. the slope of the forward tf relation steepens from -5.5 +/- 0.2mag/log(km/s) in the g-band to -6.6 +/- 0.2 mag/log(km/s) in the z-band. theintrinsic scatter is approximately 0.4 mag in all bands. the scatter is notdominated by rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, though itdrops slightly, to 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to nearly bulgelesssystems. correlations of tf residuals with other galaxy properties are weak:bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than average in the g-band but onlymarginally brighter in the i-band; more concentrated galaxies are slightlyfainter than average; and the tf residual is virtually independent ofhalf-light radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominantdisks. the observed residual correlations do not account for most of theintrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely byvariations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk galaxypopulation.

astro-ph;0609121	empirical color transformations between sdss photometry and other  photometric systems	we present empirical color transformations between the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) ugriz photometry and johnson-cousins ubvri system and becker'srgu system, respectively. owing to the magnitude of data that is becomingavailable in the sdss photometric system it is particularly important to beable to convert between this new system and traditional photometric systems.unlike earlier published transformations we based our calculations on starsactually measured by the sdss with the sdss 2.5-m telescope. the photometricdatabase of the sdss provides in a sense a single-epoch set of 'tertiarystandards' covering more than one quarter of the sky. our transformationsshould facilitate their use to easily and reliably derive the correspondingapproximate johnson-cousins or rgu magnitudes. the sdss survey covers a numberof areas that were previously established as standard fields in thejohnson-cousins system, in particular, fields established by landolt and bystetson. we used these overlapping fields to create well-photometered starsamples on which our calculated transformations are based. for the rguphotometry we used fields observed in the framework of the new baselhigh-latitude field star survey. we calculated empirical color transformationsbetween sdss photometry and johnson-cousins ubvri and becker's rgu system. forall transformations we found linear relations to be sufficient. furthermore weshowed that the transformations between the johnson-cousins and the sdss systemhave a slight dependence on metallicity.

astro-ph;0701429	virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies with the sloan digital sky  survey. iii. subpopulations: distributions, shapes, origins	from a quantitative analysis of 413 virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies(des) with sloan digital sky survey imaging data, we find that the de class canbe divided into multiple subpopulations that differ significantly in theirmorphology and clustering properties. three de subclasses are shaped like thickdisks and show no central clustering: (1) des with disk features like spiralarms or bars, (2) des with central star formation, and (3) ordinary, bright desthat have no or only a weak nucleus. these populations probably formed frominfalling progenitor galaxies. in contrast, ordinary nucleated des follow thepicture of classical dwarf elliptical galaxies in that they are spheroidalobjects and are centrally clustered like e and s0 galaxies, indicating thatthey have resided in the cluster since a long time, or were formed along withit. these results define a morphology-density relation within the de class. wefind that the difference in the clustering properties of nucleated des and deswith no or only a weak nucleus is not caused by selection biases, as opposed topreviously reported suggestions. the correlation between surface brightness andobserved axial ratio favors oblate shapes for all subclasses, but ourderivation of intrinsic axial ratios indicates the presence of at least sometriaxiality. we discuss possible interrelations and formation mechanisms(ram-pressure stripping, tidally induced star formation, harassment) of thesede subpopulations.

astro-ph;9512143	on the nature of the blue giants in ngc 330	the young smc cluster ngc 330 contains a number of blue stars that lie abovethe main-sequence turnoff found from our isochrone fitting and below theposition of the blue supergiants. we used our own, new spectroscopy andpublished data on these stars to investigate their possible nature. problems ininterpreting the evolutionary status of the blue giants have been found inseveral preceding studies. in theoretical h-r diagrams, these stars lie in therapidly traversed post main-sequence gap, similar to the unexpectedconcentration found by fitzpatrick &amp; garmany (1990) in the h-r diagram of thelmc. we argue that these stars probably are core h burning main-sequence starsthat appear as blue stragglers resulting from binary evolution as described inthe simulations of pols \&amp; marinus (1994) and effects of rapid rotation. manyof the blue stragglers are be stars and likely rapid rotators. we suggest thatthere is evidence for the presence of blue stragglers also in ngc 1818, ngc2004, and ngc 2100. we point out that blue stragglers may be a generalphenomenon in the cmds of young clusters in the magellanic clouds and discussthe implications for imf and age determinations.

astro-ph;9611046	ring nebula and bipolar outflows associated with the b1.5 supergiant  sher #25 in ngc 3603	we have identified a ring-shaped emission-line nebula and a possible bipolaroutflow centered on the b1.5 supergiant sher #25 in the galactic giant hiiregion ngc 3603 (distance 6 kpc). the clumpy ring around sher #25 appears to betilted by 64 deg against the plane of the sky. its semi-major axis (positionangle approx. 165 deg) is 6.9" long, which corresponds to a ring diameter of0.4 pc. the bipolar outflow filaments, presumably located above and below thering plane on either side of sher #25, show a separation of approx. 0.5 pc fromthe central star.  high-resolution spectra show that the ring has a systemic velocity of v_lsr =+19 km/s and a de-projected expansion velocity of 20 km/s, and that one of thebipolar filaments has an outflow speed of approx. 83 km/s. the spectra alsoshow high [nii]/halpha ratio, suggestive of strong n enrichment. sher #25 mustbe an evolved blue supergiant (bsg) past the red supergiant (rsg) stage. wefind that the ratio of equatorial to polar mass-loss rate during the redsupergiant phase was approx 16. we discuss the results in the framework ofrsg-bsg wind evolutionary models.  we compare sher #25 to the progenitor of sn 1987a, which it resembles in manyaspects.

astro-ph;9709138	the hourglass nebulae of sher 25 and sn 1987 a: two of a kind?	we have performed a detailed study of the morphology and kinematics of thehourglass-shaped nebula around the blue supergiant sher 25 in the galacticgiant hii region ngc 3603. near-infrared high resolution adaptive optics imagesin the br gamma line and hst/nicmos images in the hei 1.08mu line were comparedwith iso-velocity maps in the h alpha and [nii] lines. the adaptive opticsobservations clearly resolved the width of the ring (0.9", i.e., 0.027 pc),yielding delta r / r = 1:8. we show that the h alpha and [nii] lines trace theentire silhouette of the hourglass. the bipolar lobes of the hourglass expandat 70 km/s, whereas the ring around the waist of the hourglass expands at 30km/s. both the ring and the bipolar lobes have about the same dynamical age,indicating a common origin and a major outburst and mass-loss event 6630 yrago. the ionized mass within the hourglass is between 0.3 mo and 0.6 mo - quitecomparable to the total mass suggested for the expanding (pre-supernova) shellaround sn 1987 a. the hourglass structure around sher 25 is similar to that ofsn 1987 a in spatial extent, mass, and velocities. the major differencesbetween these two nebulae might arise from environmental effects. both internaland external ionization sources are available for sher 25's nebula.furthermore, sher 25 and its hourglass-shaped nebula appear to be moving to thesouth-west with respect to the ambient interstellar medium, and ram pressurehas apparently deformed the hourglass. we conclude that the circumstellarnebulae around sn 1987 a and sher 25 are very similar and define a new class ofnebulae around blue supergiants in their final evolutionary stage.

astro-ph;9812443	evolutionary histories of dwarf galaxies in the local group	the star formation histories of local group (lg) dwarf galaxies and moredistant potential lg members are reviewed. problems in defining the spatialextent of the lg and membership are briefly discussed. the morphological typesfound in the lg are presented, and it is suggested that we see continuousevolution from low-mass dwarf irregulars (dirrs) to dwarf spheroidal galaxies(dsph) in the lg.  star formation histories for lg dwarfs and nearby lg candidates are compiledusing population boxes. no two dwarfs, irrespective of morphological type, showthe same evolutionary history, and all vary widely in ages of theirsubpopulations and in their enrichment history. the lack of gas in dsphs anddes may be explained by a new photoionization scenario. old populations, oftenspatially very extended, may be a common property of dwarf galaxies, thoughtheir fractions can be very small. almost all types of dwarf galaxies studiedin detail so far show spatial variations in ages and abundances such as radialage/metallicity gradients. the observed star formation histories imposeconstraints on merger and accretion scenarios.  properties of the milky way dsphs are compared to the m31 dsphs and discussedin the framework of the ram pressure/tidal stripping scenario. it isdemonstrated that the newly discovered lg dwarfs follow the same relationshipfor central surface brightness, mean metallicity, and absolute magnitude as theother lg dwarfs.

astro-ph;9910426	hubble space telescope photometry of hodge 301: an "old" star cluster in  30 doradus	we present hubble space telescope planetary camera uvi data for thelittle-studied cluster hodge 301 3' northwest of 30 doradus' central ionizingcluster r136. the average reddening of hodge 301 is found to be &lt;e(b-v)&gt; =(0.28+-0.05) mag from published infrared and ultraviolet photometry. using twodifferent sets of evolutionary models, we derive an age of ~ 20-25 myr forhodge 301, which makes it roughly 10 times as old as r136. hodge 301 is themost prominent representative of the oldest population in the 30 dor starburstregion; a region that has undergone multiple star formation events. this rangeof ages is an important consideration for the modelling of starburst regions.hodge 301 shows a widened upper main sequence largely caused by be stars. wepresent a list of be star candidates. the slope of the initial mass functionfor intermediate-mass main sequence stars ranging from 10 to 1.3 solar massesis found to be -1.4+-0.1 in good agreement with a salpeter law. there is noindication for a truncation or change of slope of the imf within this massrange. in accordance with the age of hodge 301 no obvious pre-main-sequencestars are seen down to 1 solar mass. we estimate that up to 41+-7 stars withmore than 12 solar masses may have turned into supernovae since the formationof the cluster. multiple supernova explosions are the most likely origin of theextremely violent gas motions and the diffuse x-ray emission observed in thecluster surroundings.

astro-ph;9912529	star clusters in local group galaxies	in about 40% of the local group galaxies star clusters have been detected sofar, but the census is still incomplete. the properties of these clusters arebriefly reviewed, and the impact of galaxy environment on the evolution andsurvival of star clusters is discussed. several (but not all) local groupgalaxies seem to share a common epoch of the earliest globular clusterformation. the most massive galaxies show a tendency for rapid enrichment intheir oldest cluster population near their centers as compared to clusters atlarger galactocentric radii. the galactocentric dependence of cluster sizes andhorizontal branch morphology may be intrinsic to the globular cluster formationprocess rather than to the accretion of dwarf galaxies. the observed propertiesof globular clusters in the least massive dwarfs suggest that their parentgalaxies may originally have been substantially more massive. clusterdestruction mechanisms and time scales are a function of galaxy environment andgalaxy mass. the most recent enhancement of star cluster formation in themagellanic clouds may have been triggered by their close encounter with eachother and the milky way.

0706.0004	the accretion origin of the milky way's stellar halo	we have used data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 toexplore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the milkyway using about 4 million color-selected main sequence turn-off stars. we fitoblate and triaxial broken power-law models to the data, and found a `best-fit'oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5&lt;c/a&lt;0.8, and halo stellar masses betweengalactocentric radii of 1 and 40kpc of (3.7+/-1.2)x10^8 m_sun. the densityprofile of the stellar halo is approximately r^{-3}; it is possible that thepower law slope is shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside that radius. yet,we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to thedistribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal ofspatial substructure. we quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxialmodel using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales &gt;~100pc,after accounting for the (known) contribution of poisson uncertainties. thefractional rms deviation of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth,parameterized halo model is &gt;~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highlystructured. we compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellarhalos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmologicalcontext by analysing the simulations in the same way as the data. while themasses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellarhalos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure inthe milky way's halo match well the properties of a `typical' stellar halobuilt exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. ourresults therefore point towards a picture in which an important fraction of themilky way's stellar halo has been accreted from satellite galaxies.
