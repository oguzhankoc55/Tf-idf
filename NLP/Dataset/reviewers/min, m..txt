0902.3092	radiative transfer in very optically thick circumstellar disks	in this paper we present two efficient implementations of the diffusionapproximation to be employed in monte carlo computations of radiative transferin dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. the aim is to improve theaccuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computationtime. the accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in variouscorners of parameter space are investigated. the effects of using these methodson the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained fromhydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. two methods arepresented. first, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve theaccuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,where photon counts are low. second, a modified random walk approximation isemployed to decrease the computation time. this modified random walk ensuresthat the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape tothe lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in thedisk is still computed accurately. a new radiative transfer code, mcmax, ispresented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. thesecan be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decreasestatistical noise. we conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fastand accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structureand observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.

0903.1231	benchmark problems for continuum radiative transfer. high optical  depths, anisotropic scattering, and polarisation	solving the continuum radiative transfer equation in high opacity mediarequires sophisticated numerical tools. in order to test the reliability ofsuch tools, we present a benchmark of radiative transfer codes in a 2d discconfiguration. we test the accuracy of seven independently developed radiativetransfer codes by comparing the temperature structures, spectral energydistributions, scattered light images, and linear polarisation maps that eachmodel predicts for a variety of disc opacities and viewing angles. the testcases have been chosen to be numerically challenging, with midplane opticaldepths up 10^6, a sharp density transition at the inner edge and complexscattering matrices. we also review recent progress in the implementation ofthe monte carlo method that allow an efficient solution to these kinds ofproblems and discuss the advantages and limitations of monte carlo codescompared to those of discrete ordinate codes. for each of the test cases, thepredicted results from the radiative transfer codes are within good agreement.the results indicate that these codes can be confidently used to interpretpresent and future observations of protoplanetary discs.

0906.4718	analysis of the infrared spectra of the peculiar post-agb stars eplyr  and hd52961	aim: we aim to study in detail the peculiar mineralogy and structure of thecircumstellar environment of two binary post-agb stars, eplyr and hd52961. bothstars were selected from a larger sample of evolved disc sources observed withspitzer and show unique solid-state and gas features in their infrared spectra.moreover, they show a very small infrared excess in comparison with the othersample stars. methods: the different dust and gas species are identified on thebasis of high-resolution spitzer-irs spectra. we fit the full spectrum toconstrain grain sizes and temperature distributions in the discs. this,combined with our broad-band spectral energy distribution and interferometricmeasurements, allows us to study the physical structure of the disc, using aself-consistent 2d radiative-transfer disc model. results: we find that bothstars have strong emission features due to co_2 gas, dominated by^{12}c^{16}o_2, but with clear ^{13}c^{16}o_2 and even ^{16}o^{12}c^{18}oisotopic signatures. crystalline silicates are apparent in both sources butproved very hard to model. ep lyr also shows evidence of mixed chemistry, withemission features of the rare class-c pahs. whether these pahs reside in theoxygen-rich disc or in a carbon-rich outflow is still unclear. with thestrongly processed silicates, the mixed chemistry and the low ^{12}c/^{13}cratio, ep lyr resembles some silicate j-type stars, although the depletedphotosphere makes nucleosynthetic signatures difficult to probe. we find thatthe disc environment of both sources is, to a first approximation, wellmodelled with a passive disc, but additional physics such as grain settling,radial dust distributions, and an outflow component must be included to explainthe details of the observed spectral energy distributions in both stars.

0907.2102	on the interplay between flaring and shadowing in disks around herbig  ae/be stars	based on the sed, herbig stars have been categorized into two observationalgroups, reflecting their overall disk structure: group i members have diskswith a higher degree of flaring than their group ii counterparts. weinvestigate the 5-35 um spitzer irs spectra of a sample of 13 group i sourcesand 20 group ii sources. we focus on the continuum emission to study theunderlying disk geometry. we have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]continuum flux ratios. the 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellarphotosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-ir emissionproduced by the inner disk. we have compared our data to self-consistentpassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. weconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission betweengroup i and ii sources can largely be explained by a different amount of smalldust grains. however, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and[13.5/7] flux ratios for meeus group ii sources. moreover, the [30/13.5] fluxratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample. toexplain these correlations with the models, we need to introduce an artificialscaling factor for the inner disk height. in roughly 50% of the herbig ae/bestars in our sample, the inner disk must be inflated by a factor 2 to 3 beyondwhat hydrostatic calculations predict. the total disk mass in small dust grainsdetermines the degree of flaring. we conclude, however, that for any given diskmass in small dust grains, the shadowing of the outer (tens of au) disk isdetermined by the scale height of the inner disk (1 au). the inner diskpartially obscures the outer disk, reducing the disk surface temperature. here,for the first time, we prove these effects observationally.

0907.3350	laboratory-based grain-shape models for simulating dust infrared spectra	analysis of thermal dust emission spectra for dust mineralogy and physicalgrain properties depends on laboratory-measured or calculated comparisonspectra. often, the agreement between these two kinds of spectra is notsatisfactory because of the strong influence of the grain morphology on thespectra. we investigate the ability of the statistical light-scattering modelwith a distribution of form factors (dff model) to reproduce experimentallymeasured infrared extinction spectra for particles that are small compared tothe wavelength. we take advantage of new experimental spectra measured for freeparticles dispersed in air with accompanying information on the grainmorphology. for the calculations, we used dffs that were derived for aggregatesof spherical grains, as well as for compact grain shapes corresponding togaussian random spheres. irregular particle shapes require a dff similar tothat of a gaussian random sphere with sigma=0.3, whereas roundish grain shapesare best fitted with that of a fractal aggregate of a fractal dimension2.4-1.8. in addition we used a fitting algorithm to obtain the best-fit dffsfor the various laboratory samples. in this way we can independently deriveinformation on the shape of the grains from their infrared spectra. foranisotropic materials, different dffs are needed for the differentcrystallographic axes. this is due to a theoretical problem, which is inherentto all models that are simply averaging the contributions of thecrystallographic directions.

1001.0516	the lunar phases of dust grains orbiting fomalhaut	optical images of the nearby star fomalhaut show a ring of dust orbiting thecentral star. this dust is in many respects expected to be similar to thezodiacal dust in the solar system. the ring displays a clear brightnessasymmetry, attributed to asymmetric scattering of the central starlight by thecircumstellar dust grains. recent measurements show that the bright side of thefomalhaut ring is oriented away from us. this implies that the grains in thissystem scatter most of the light in the backward direction, in sharp contrastto the forward-scattering nature of the grains in the solar system. in thisletter, we show that grains considerably larger than those dominating the solarsystem zodiacal dust cloud provide a natural explanation for the apparentbackward scattering behavior. in fact, we see the phases of the dust grains inthe same way as we can observe the phases of the moon and other large solarsystem bodies. we outline how the theory of the scattering behavior ofplanetesimals can be used to explain the fomalhaut dust properties. thisindicates that the fomalhaut dust ring is dominated by very large grains. thematerial orbiting fomalhaut, which is at the transition between dust andplanetesimals, can, with respect to their optical behavior, best be describedas micro-asteroids.

1008.0083	dust evolution in protoplanetary disks around herbig ae/be stars - the  spitzer view	in this paper we present mid-infrared spectra of a comprehensive set ofherbig ae/be stars observed with the spitzer space telescope. thesignal-to-noise ratio of these spectra is very high, ranging between about ahundred and several hundreds. during the analysis of these data we tested thevalidity of standard protoplanetary dust models and studied grain growth andcrystal formation. on the basis of the analyzed spectra, the major constituentsof protoplanetary dust around herbig ae/be stars are amorphous silicates witholivine and pyroxene stoichiometry, crystalline forsterite and enstatite andsilica. no other solid state features, indicating other abundant dust species,are present in the spitzer spectra. deviations of the synthetic spectra fromthe observations are most likely related to grain shape effects anduncertainties in the iron content of the dust grains. our analysis revealedthat larger grains are more abundant in the disk atmosphere of flatter disksthan in that of flared disks, indicating that grain growth and sedimentationdecrease the disk flaring. we did not find, however, correlations between thevalue of crystallinity and any of the investigated system parameters. ouranalysis shows that enstatite is more concentrated toward the warm inner diskthan forsterite, in contrast to predictions of equilibrium condensation models.none of the three crystal formation mechanisms proposed so far can aloneexplain all our findings. it is very likely that all three play at least somerole in the formation of crystalline silicates.

1106.3265	coagulation and fragmentation in molecular clouds. ii. the opacity of  the dust aggregate size distribution	the dust size distribution in molecular clouds can be strongly affected byice-mantle formation and (subsequent) grain coagulation. following previouswork where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-theart collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation andfragmentation (paper i), the corresponding opacities are presented in thisstudy. the opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theoryassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\mu}m silicate and graphitegrains and vacuum. in particular, we explore how the coagulation affects thenear-ir opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\mu}m silicate feature. we findthat as dust aggregates grow to {\mu}m-sizes both the near-ir color excess andthe opacity in the 9.7 {\mu}m feature increases. despite their coagulation,porous aggregates help to prolong the presence of the 9.7{\mu}m feature. wefind that the ratio between the opacity in the silicate feature and the near-ircolor excess becomes lower with respect to the ism, in accordance with manyobservations of dark clouds. however, this trend is primarily a result of icemantle formation and the mixed material composition of the aggregates, ratherthan being driven by coagulation. with stronger growth, when most of the dustmass resides in particles of size 10{\mu}m or larger, both the near-ir colorexcess and the 9.7{\mu}m silicate feature significantly diminish. observationsat additional wavelengths, in particular in the sub-mm range, are essential toprovide quantitative constraints on the dust size distribution within densecores. our results indicate that the sub-mm index {\beta} will increaseappreciably, if aggregates grow to ~100{\mu}m in size.

1205.3159	high-contrast nir polarization imaging of mwc480	one of the key predictions of modeling from the ir excess of herbig ae starsis that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settlinghas occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partiallyor largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimationradius. when the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expectedto be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scaleheight of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.high-contrast imaging combined with the ir spectral energy distribution allowus to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine theproperties of the outer disk. we present polarimetric differential imaging in$h$ band obtained with subaru/hiciao of one such system, mwc 480. the hiciaodata were obtained at a historic minimum of the nir excess. the disk isdetected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137au). together withthe marginal detection of the disk from 1998 february 24 by hst/nicmos, ourdata constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. when compared with similar measures in co forthe gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of thegas disk scale height (h/r$\sim$0.03). such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giantplanets have formed.

1207.1606	observational evidence for composite grains in an agb outflow: mgs in  the extreme carbon star ll peg	the broad 30 \mu m feature in carbon stars is commonly attributed to mgs dustparticles. however, reproducing the 30 \mu m feature with homogeneous mgsgrains would require much more sulfur relative to the solar abundance. directgas-phase condensation of mgs occurs at a low efficiency. precipitation of mgson sic precursor grains provides a more efficient formation mechanism, suchthat the assumption of homogeneous mgs grains may not be correct. using a montecarlo-based radiative transfer code, we aim to model the 30 \mu m feature ofthe extreme carbon star ll peg with mgs dust particles. we find that for ll pegthis modeling is insensitive to the unknown mgs optical properties at \lambda &lt;10 \mu m. when mgs is allowed to be in thermal contact with amorphous carbonand sic, the amount of mgs required to reproduce the strength of 30 \mu mfeature agrees with the solar abundance of sulfur, thereby resolving thereported mgs mass problem. we conclude that mgs is a valid candidate to be thecarrier of the 30 \mu m feature when it is part of a composite grain populationthat has optical properties representative of an ensemble of particle shapes.

1211.6300	the extreme polarimeter: design, performance, first results &amp; upgrades	well over 700 exoplanets have been detected to date. only a handful of thesehave been observed directly. direct observation is extremely challenging due tothe small separation and very large contrast involved. imaging polarimetryoffers a way to decrease the contrast between the unpolarized starlight and thelight that has become linearly polarized after scattering by circumstellarmaterial. this material can be the dust and debris found in circumstellardisks, but also the atmosphere or surface of an exoplanet. we present thedesign, calibration approach, polarimetric performance and sample observationresults of the extreme polarimeter, an imaging polarimeter for the study ofcircumstellar environments in scattered light at visible wavelengths. thepolarimeter uses the beam-exchange technique, in which the two orthogonalpolarization states are imaged simultaneously and a polarization modulatorswaps the polarization states of the two beams before the next image is taken.the instrument currently operates without the aid of adaptive optics. to reducethe effects of atmospheric seeing on the polarimetry, the images are taken at aframe rate of 35 fps, and large numbers of frames are combined to obtain thepolarization images. four successful observing runs have been performed usingthis instrument at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on la palma, targetingyoung stars with protoplanetary disks as well as evolved stars surrounded bydusty envelopes. in terms of fractional polarization, the instrumentsensitivity is better than 10^-4. the contrast achieved between the centralstar and the circumstellar source is of the order 10^-6. we show that ourcalibration approach yields absolute polarization errors below 1%.

1309.1039	imaging diagnostics for transitional discs	transitional discs are a special type of protoplanetary discs where planetformation is thought to be taking place. these objects feature characteristicinner cavities and/or gaps of a few tens of aus in the sub-millimitre images ofthe disc. this signature suggests a localised depletion of matter in the discthat could be caused by planet formation processes. however, recentobservations have revealed differences in the structures imaged at differentwavelengths in some of these discs. in this paper, we aim to explain theseobservational differences using self-consistent physical 2-d hydrodynamical anddust evolution models of such objects, assuming their morphology is indeedgenerated by the presence of a planet. we use these models to derive thedistribution of gas and dust in a theoretical planet-hosting disc, for variousplanet masses and orbital separations. we then simulate observations of theemitted and scattered light from these models with vlt/sphere zimpol,subaru/hiciao, vlt/visir and alma. we do this by first computing the fullresolution images of the models at different wavelengths, and then simulatingthe observations accounting for the characteristics of each particularinstrument. the presence of the planet generates pressure bumps in the gasdistribution of the disc whose characteristics strongly depend on the planetmass and position. these bumps cause large grains to accumulate while smallgrains are allowed into inner regions. this spatial differentiation of thegrain sizes explains the differences in the observations since differentwavelengths and observing techniques trace different parts of the dust sizedistribution. based on this effect, we conclude that the combination ofvisible/near-infrared polarimetric and sub-mm images is the best strategy toconstrain the properties of the unseen planet responsible for the discstructure.

1311.4832	imaging the circumstellar environment of the young t tauri star su  aurigae	the circumstellar environments of classical t tauri stars are challenging todirectly image because of their high star-to-disk contrast ratio. one method toovercome this is by using imaging polarimetry where scattered and consequentlypolarised starlight from the star's circumstellar disk can be separated fromthe unpolarised light of the central star. we present images of thecircumstellar environment of su aur, a classical t tauri star at the transitionof t tauri to herbig stars. the images directly show that the disk extends outto ~500 au with an inclination angle of $\sim$ 50$^\circ$. using interpretivemodels, we derived very small grains in the surface layers of its disk, with avery steep size- and surface-density distribution. additionally, we resolved alarge and extended nebulosity in our images that is most likely a remnant ofthe prenatal molecular cloud. the position angle of the disk, determineddirectly from our images, rules out a polar outflow or jet as the cause of thislarge-scale nebulosity.

1402.0902	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ionization as a tracer of gas flows  through protoplanetary disk gaps	planet-forming disks of gas and dust around young stars contain polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). we aim to characterize how the charge state ofpahs can be used as a probe of flows of gas through protoplanetary gaps. inthis context, our goal is to understand the pah spectra of four transitionaldisks. in addition, we want to explain the observed correlation between pahionization (traced by the 6.2/11.3 feature ratio) and the disk mass (traced bythe 1.3 mm luminosity). we implement a model to calculate the charge state ofpahs in the radiative transfer code mcmax. the emission spectra and ionizationbalance are calculated. a benchmark modeling grid is presented that shows howpah ionization and luminosity behave as a function of star and disk properties.the pah ionization is most sensitive to ultraviolet (uv) radiation and theelectron density. in optically thick disks, where the uv field is low and theelectron density is high, pahs are predominantly neutral. ionized pahs tracelow-density optically thin disk regions where the uv field is high and theelectron density is low. such regions are characteristic of gas flows throughthe gaps of transitional disks. we demonstrate that fitting the pah spectra offour transitional disks requires a contribution of ionized pahs in gas flowsthrough the gap. the pah spectra of transitional disks can be understood assuperpositions of neutral and ionized pahs. for hd97048, neutral pahs in theoptically thick disk dominate the spectrum. in the cases of hd169142, hd135344band oph irs 48, small amounts of ionized pahs located in the gas flows throughthe gap are strong contributors to the total pah luminosity. the observed trendbetween the disk mass and pah ionization may imply that lower-mass disks havelarger gaps. ionized pahs in gas flows through these gaps contribute stronglyto their spectra.

1402.6597	on the structure of the transition disk around tw hya	for over a decade, the structure of the inner cavity in the transition diskof tw hydrae has been a subject of debate. modeling the disk with data obtainedat different wavelengths has led to a variety of proposed disk structures.rather than being inconsistent, the individual models might point to thedifferent faces of physical processes going on in disks, such as dust growthand planet formation. our aim is to investigate the structure of the transitiondisk again and to find to what extent we can reconcile apparent modeldifferences. a large set of high-angular-resolution data was collected fromnear-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. we investigated the existing diskmodels and established a new self-consistent radiative-transfer model. agenetic fitting algorithm was used to automatize the parameter fitting. simpledisk models with a vertical inner rim and a radially homogeneous dustcomposition from small to large grains cannot reproduce the combined data set.two modifications are applied to this simple disk model: (1) the inner rim issmoothed by exponentially decreasing the surface density in the inner ~3 au,and (2) the largest grains (&gt;100 um) are concentrated towards the inner diskregion. both properties can be linked to fundamental processes that determinethe evolution of protoplanetary disks: the shaping by a possible companion andthe different regimes of dust-grain growth, respectively. the fullinterferometric data set from near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths requiresa revision of existing models for the tw hya disk. we present a new model thatincorporates the characteristic structures of previous models but deviates intwo key aspects: it does not have a sharp edge at 4 au, and the surface densityof large grains differs from that of smaller grains. this is the firstsuccessful radiative-transfer-based model for a full set of interferometricdata.

1404.3271	near-infrared emission from sublimating dust in collisionally active  debris disks	hot exozodiacal dust is thought to be responsible for excess near-infrared(nir) emission emanating from the innermost parts of some debris disks. theorigin of this dust, however, is still a matter of debate. we test whether hotexozodiacal dust can be supplied from an exterior parent belt bypoynting-robertson (p-r) drag, paying special attention to the pile-up of dustthat occurs due to the interplay of p-r drag and dust sublimation.specifically, we investigate whether pile-ups still occur when collisions aretaken into account, and if they can explain the observed nir excess. we computethe steady-state distribution of dust in the inner disk by solving thecontinuity equation. first, we derive an analytical solution under a number ofsimplifying assumptions. second, we develop a numerical debris disk model thatfor the first time treats the complex interaction of collisions, p-r drag, andsublimation in a self-consistent way. from the resulting dust distributions wegenerate thermal emission spectra and compare these to observed excess nirfluxes. we confirm that p-r drag always supplies a small amount of dust to thesublimation zone, but find that a fully consistent treatment yields a maximumamount of dust that is about 7 times lower than that given by analyticalestimates. the nir excess due this material is much smaller (&lt;10^-3 for a-typestars with parent belts at &gt;1 au) than the values derived from interferometricobservations (~10^-2). pile-up of dust still occurs when collisions areconsidered, but its effect on the nir flux is insignificant. finally, thecross-section in the innermost regions is clearly dominated by barely boundgrains.

1410.5963	gas and dust structures in protoplanetary disks hosting multiple planets	transition disks have dust-depleted inner regions and may represent anintermediate step of an on-going disk dispersal process, where planet formationis probably in progress. recent millimetre observations of transition disksreveal radially and azimuthally asymmetric structures, where micron- andmillimetre-sized dust particles may not spatially coexist. these properties canbe the result of particle trapping and grain growth in pressure bumpsoriginating from the disk interaction with a planetary companion. the multiplefeatures observed in some transition disks, such as sr 21, suggest the presenceof more than one planet. we study the gas and dust distributions of a diskhosting two massive planets as function of different disk and dust parameters.observational signatures, such as the spectral energy distribution,sub-millimetre, and polarised images are simulated for the various parameters.we confirm that planets can lead to particle trapping, although for a disk withhigh viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$), the planet should be moremassive than $5 m_{\rm{jup}}$ and dust fragmentation should occur with lowefficiency ($v_{f}\sim30\rm{m s}^{-1}$). this will lead to a ring-like featureas observed in transition disks in the millimetre. when trapping occurs, wefind that a smooth distribution of micron sized grains throughout the disk,sometimes observed in scattered light, can only happen if the combination ofplanet mass and turbulence is such that small grains are not fully filteredout. a high disk viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$) ensures areplenishment of the cavity in micron-sized dust, while for lower viscosity($\alpha_{\rm{turb}}=10^{-3}$), the planet mass is constrained to be less than$5 m_{\rm{jup}}$. in these cases, the gas distribution is likely to showlow-amplitude azimuthal asymmetries caused by disk eccentricity rather than bylong-lived vortices.

1412.5063	surprising detection of an equatorial dust lane on the agb star  irc+10216	understanding the formation of planetary nebulae remains elusive because inthe preceding asymtotic giant branch (agb) phase these stars are heavilyenshrouded in an optically thick dusty envelope. to further understand themorphology of the circumstellar environments of agb stars we observe theclosest carbon-rich agb star irc+10216 in scattered light. when imaged inscattered light at optical wavelengths, irc+10216 surprisingly shows a narrowequatorial density enhancement, in contrast to the large-scale spherical ringsthat have been imaged much further out. we use radiative transfer models tointerpret this structure in terms of two models: firstly, an equatorial densityenhancement, commonly observed in the more evolved post-agb stars, andsecondly, in terms of a dust rings model, where a local enhancement ofmass-loss creates a spiral ring as the star rotates. we conclude that bothmodels can be used to reproduce the dark lane in the scattered light images,which is caused by an equatorially density enhancement formed by dense dustrather than a bipolar outflow as previously thought. we are unable to placeconstraints on the formation of the equatorial density enhancement by a binarysystem.

1503.04765	dusty wind of w hya. multi-wavelength modelling of the present-day and  recent mass-loss	low- and intermediate-mass stars go through a period of intense mass-loss atthe end of their lives in a phase known as the asymptotic giant branch (agb).during the agb a significant fraction of their initial mass is expelled in astellar wind. this process controls the final stages of their evolution andcontributes to the chemical evolution of galaxies. however, the wind-drivingmechanism of agb stars is not yet well understood, especially so foroxygen-rich sources. characterizing both the present-day mass-loss and windstructure and the evolution of the mass-loss rate of such stars is paramount toadvancing our understanding of this processes. we modelled the dust envelope ofw hya using an advanced radiative transfer code. the dust model was analysed inthe light of a previously calculated gas-phase wind model and compared tomeasurements available in the literature, such as infrared spectra, infraredimages, and optical scattered light fractions. we find that the dust spectrumof w hya can partly be explained by a gravitationally bound dust shell thatprobably is responsible for most of the amorphous al$_2$o$_3$ emission. thecomposition of the large ($\sim$\,0.3\,$\mu$m) grains needed to explain thescattered light cannot be constrained, but probably is dominated by silicates.silicate emission in the thermal infrared was found to originate from beyond 40au from the star and we find that they need to have substantial near-infraredopacities to be visible at such large distances. the increase in near-infraredopacity of the dust at these distances roughly coincides with a sudden increasein expansion velocity as deduced from the gas-phase co lines. finally, therecent mass loss of w hya is confirmed to be highly variable and we identify astrong peak in the mass-loss rate that occurred about 3500 years ago and lastedfor a few hundred years.

1510.05426	multiwavelength optical properties of compact dust aggregates in  protoplanetary disks	in protoplanetary disks micron-size dust grains coagulate to form largerstructures with complex shapes and compositions. the coagulation processchanges the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the disk insignificant ways. to properly interpret observations of protoplanetary disksand to place these observations in the context of the first steps of planetformation, it is crucial to understand the optical properties of these complexstructures. we derive the optical properties of dust aggregates using detailedcomputations of aggregate structures and compare these computa- tionallydemanding results with approximate methods that are cheaper to compute inpractice. in this way we wish to understand the merits and problems ofapproximate methods and define the context in which they can or cannot be usedto analyze observations of objects where significant grain growth is takingplace. for the detailed computations we used the discrete dipole approximation(dda), a method able to compute the interaction of light with a complexlyshaped, inhomogeneous particle. we compared the results to those obtained usingspherical and irregular, homogeneous and inhomogeneous particles. while noapproximate method properly reproduces all characteristics of large dustaggregates, the thermal properties of dust can be analyzed using irregularlyshaped, porous, inhomogeneous grains. the asymmetry of the scattering phasefunction is a good indicator of aggregate size, while the degree ofpolarization is probably determined by the size of the constituent particles.optical properties derived from aggregates significantly differ from the mostfrequently used standard ("astronomical silicate" in spherical grains). weoutline a computationally fast and relatively accurate method that can be usedfor a multiwavelength analysis of aggregate dust in protoplanetary disks.

0806.4038	the infrared emission spectra of compositionally inhomogeneous  aggregates composed of irregularly shaped constituents	in order to deduce properties of dust in astrophysical environments wheredust growth through aggregation is important, knowledge of the way aggregatedparticles interact with radiation, and what information is encoded in thethermal radiation they emit, is needed. the emission characteristics aredetermined by the size and structure of the aggregate and the composition andshape of the constituents. we thus aim at performing computations ofcompositionally inhomogeneous aggregates composed of irregularly shapedconstituents. in addition we aim at developing an empirical recipe to computethe optical properties of such aggregates in a fast and accurate manner. weperformed cda computations for aggregates of irregularly shaped particles withvarious compositions. the constituents of the aggregate are assumed to be inthe rayleigh regime, and in addition we assume that the dominant interaction ofthe aggregate constituents is through dipole-dipole interactions. we computedthe spectral structure of the emission efficiency in the 10 micron region foraggregates with 30% amorphous carbon and 70% silicates by volume with variousfractions of crystalline and amorphous components. we find that the spectralappearance of the various components of the aggregate are very different anddepend on their abundances. most notably, materials that have a very lowabundance appear spectroscopically as if they were in very small grains, whilemore abundant materials appear, spectroscopically to reside in larger grains.we construct a fast empirical approximate method, based on the idea of aneffective medium approximation, to construct the spectra for these aggregateswhich almost perfectly reproduces the more exact computations. this new methodis fast enough to be easily implemented in fitting procedures.

astro-ph;0301569	water ice growth around evolved stars	we present a model of the growth of water ice on silicate grains in thecircumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants. we consider the growth of ice by gas grain collisions, the thermalevaporation of ice from a grain, and sputtering. our model contains severalimprovements compared to earlier models, including a detailed treatment of theeffects of sputtering, a detailed calculation of the radiation pressure on thegrain, and the treatment of subsonic drift velocities. in terms of driftvelocity between the grains and gas in the envelope, we find that the iceformation process can be divided into three regimes: (i) a sputtering dominatedregime where ice growth is heavily suppressed, (ii) an intermediate regime withmoderately efficient condensation and (iii) a thermally dominated regime whereice formation is highly efficient. sputtering is the critical factor whichdetermines if ice formation can occur at all. we find that in red supergiants,ice formation is suppressed, while the winds of oh/ir stars allow for efficientcondensation and can convert significant fractions of the available water vapor(tens of percent) into ice mantles on grains. population ii agb stars hardlyform ice due to their low dust to gas ratios. we also modify an analyticalequation describing condensation and depletion (jura and morris, 1985) in orderto give reasonable results for high and low drift velocities. initially, icewill condense in crystalline form, but continuing condensation at lowtemperatures, and damage caused by interstellar uv photons favor the productionof amorphous ice as well. we predict that a significant fraction of the iceformed will be amorphous.

astro-ph;0703258	the circumbinary disc around the j-type c-star iras 18006-3213	in the generally accepted, but poorly documented model, silicate j-typec-stars are binary objects for which the silicate emission originates from acircumbinary or a circumcompanion disc. we aim at testing this hypothesis by athorough spectral and spatial observational study of one object:iras18006-3213.  we obtained, analysed and modeled high spatial resolution interferometricvlti/midi observations on multiple baselines ranging from 45 m to 100 m. allobservations resolved the object and show the very compact nature of the n-bandemission (~30 mas). in addition, the highest spatial resolution data show asignificant differential phase jump around 8.3 micron. this demonstrates theasymmetric nature of the n-band emission. moreover, the single telescope n-bandspectrum shows the signature of highly processed silicate grains. these dataare used to confirm the model on silicate j-type c-stars for iras18006-3213. weshow that the most favourable model of the dust geometry is a stablecircumbinary disc around the system, seen under an intermediate inclination.  the data presented on the silicate j-type c-star iras18006-3213 provideevidence that the oxygen rich dust is trapped in a circumbinary disc. theformation of this disc is probably linked to the binary nature of the centralstar.

0809.2505	spitzer survey of dust grain processing in stable discs around binary  post-agb stars	aims: we investigate the mineralogy and dust processing in the circumbinarydiscs of binary post-agb stars using high-resolution timmi2 and spitzerinfrared spectra. methods: we perform a full spectral fitting to the infraredspectra using the most recent opacities of amorphous and crystalline dustspecies. this allows for the identification of the carriers of the differentemission bands. our fits also constrain the physical properties of differentdust species and grain sizes responsible for the observed emission features.results: in all stars the dust is oxygen-rich: amorphous and crystallinesilicate dust species prevail and no features of a carbon-rich component can befound, the exception being eplyr, where a mixed chemistry of both oxygen- andcarbon-rich species is found. our full spectral fitting indicates a high degreeof dust grain processing. the mineralogy of our sample stars shows that thedust is constituted of irregularly shaped and relatively large grains, withtypical grain sizes larger than 2 micron. the spectra of nearly all stars showa high degree of crystallinity, where magnesium-rich end members of olivine andpyroxene silicates dominate. other dust features of e.g. silica or alumina arenot present at detectable levels. temperature estimates from our fittingroutine show that a significant fraction of grains must be cool, significantlycooler than the glass temperature. this shows that radial mixing is veryefficient is these discs and/or indicates different thermal conditions at grainformation. our results show that strong grain processing is not limited toyoung stellar objects and that the physical processes occurring in the discsare very similar to those in protoplanetary discs.
