0903.0946	stellar populations in the galactic bulge	aims:the aim of this paper is to study the characteristics of the stellarpopulations and the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge. we studythe entire stellar population, but also retrieve information using only the redclump stars. methods: to study the characteristics of the stellar populationsand the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge, we compared the outputof the galaxy model trilegal, which implements the binney et al. (1997) bulgemodel, with observations from 2mass and ogle-ii. a minimisation procedure hasbeen set up to retrieve the best fitting model with different stellarpopulations and metallicity distributions. results: using the trilegal code wefind that the best model resembling the characteristics of the galactic bulgeis a model with the distance to the galactic centre $r_0 =8.7\pm^{0.57}_{0.43}$ kpc, the major axis ratios of the bar $1:\eta:\zeta = 1 :0.68\pm_{0.19}^{0.05} : 0.31\pm_{0.04}^{0.06}$, and the angle between thesun-centre line and the bar $\phi = 15\deg\pm_{12.7}^{13.3}$. using theseparameters the best model is found for a burst of 8 gyr, although it is almostindistinguishable from models with ages of 9 and 10 gyr. the metallicitydistribution found is consistent with metallicity distributions in theliterature based on spectroscopic results.

0903.1045	metal-rich carbon stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present spectroscopic observations from the {\it spitzer space telescope}of six carbon-rich agb stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgrdsph) and two foreground galactic carbon stars. the band strengths of theobserved c$_2$h$_2$ and sic features are very similar to those observed ingalactic agb stars. the metallicities are estimated from an empirical relationbetween the acetylene optical depth and the strength of the sic feature. themetallicities are higher than those of the lmc, and close to galactic values.while the high metallicity could imply an age of around 1 gyr, for the dustyagb stars, the pulsation periods suggest ages in excess of 2 or 3 gyr. we fitthe spectra of the observed stars using the dusty radiative transfer model anddetermine their dust mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0--3.3$\times 10^{-8}$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. the two galactic foreground carbon-rich agb stars arelocated at the far side of the solar circle, beyond the galactic centre. one ofthese two stars show the strongest sic feature in our present local groupsample.

0903.1123	the global gas and dust budget of the large magellanic cloud: agb stars  and supernovae, and the impact on the ism evolution	we report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the the interstellarmedium (ism) of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). recent observations from thespitzer space telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the lmc. this is the first time we canquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from agb stars over a completegalaxy, fully based on observations. the integrated mass-loss rate over allintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich agb candidates in the lmc is8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. this numbercould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich starsare included. this is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass starswhere formed, and the initial mass functions. agb stars are one of the mostimportant gas sources in the lmc, with supernovae (sne), which produces about2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. at the moment, the star formation rate exceedsthe gas feedback from agb stars and sne in the lmc, and the current starformation depends on gas already present in the ism. this suggests that as thegas in the ism is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline inthe lmc, unless gas is supplied externally. our estimates suggest `a missingdust-mass problem' in the lmc, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: theaccumulated dust mass from agb stars and possibly sne over the dust life time(400--800 myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ism. another dustsource is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

0907.4024	near-infrared spectroscopy of agb star candidates in fornax, sculptor  and ngc 6822	context: the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase is characterised bysubstantial mass loss that is accompanied by the formation of dust. in extremecases this will make the star no longer visible in the optical. for a betterunderstanding of agb evolution it is important to identify and characterisethese very red agb stars.  aims: the first aim of this article is to improve the census of red agb starsin three local group galaxies, based on near-ir spectroscopic observations ofnew candidates with red 2mass (j-k) colours. the opportunity is taken tocompare the near-ir spectra with those of milky way stars.  methods: we used isaac on the eso vlt to take j and h-band spectra of 36targets in fornax, sculptor and ngc 6822.  results: twelve new c-stars are found in fornax, and one is confirmed insculptor. all c-stars have (j-k) &gt; 1.6, and are brighter than -3.55 inbolometric magnitude. ten new oxygen-rich late-type giant stars are identifiedin fornax, but none is extremely red or very luminous. five luminous o-rich agbstars are identified in ngc 6822, of which 3 show water absorption, indicativeof spectral type m. again, none is as red as milky way oh/ir stars, but in thisgalaxy the list of candidate agb stars is biased against very red objects. insome c-stars with (j-k)&gt;2 an extremely strong 1.53 $\mu$m absorption band isfound. these stars are probably all mira variables and the feature is relatedto the low temperature, high density chemistry that is a first step towardsdust formation and mass loss.

1001.2098	870 um observations of evolved stars with laboca	during their evolution, asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars experience a highmass-loss which leads to the formation of a circumstellar envelope (cse) ofdust and gas. the mass-loss process is the most important phenomenon duringthis evolutionary stage. in order to understand it, it is important to studythe physical parameters of the cse. the emission of the cse in the(sub)millimetre range is dominated by the dust continuum. this means that(sub)millimetre observations are a key tool in tracing the dust and improvingour knowledge of the mass-loss process.  in this paper we analyse new sub-millimetre observations of 9 evolved starsin order to constrain the cse physical parameters. the data were taken by thenew apex bolometer laboca.  the fluxes at 870 um are derived and the extended emission is investigated.  we compute the spectral energy distribution (seds) using a 1d radiativetransfer code, dusty which we compared to literature data. grain properties arecalculated using both spherical grains distribution and a continuousdistribution of ellipsoids (cde) and a comparison between the two is drawn.synthetic surface brightness maps have been derived from the modelling and werecompared to the laboca brightness maps.  we detected the presence of extended emission around four stars. physicalparameters of the circumstellar envelope are derived from sed modelling, suchas the dust chemical composition, the dust condensation temperature and thetotal mass of the envelope. it proves difficult however to fit the sed and theintensity profile simultaneously.

1005.1433	herschel pacs and spire imaging of cw leo	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained over a 30'x30' area aroundthe well-known carbon star cw leo (irc +10 216). an extended structure is foundin an incomplete arc of ~22' diameter, which is cospatial with the terminationshock due to interaction with the interstellar medium (ism) as defined by sahai&amp; chronopoulos from ultraviolet galex images. fluxes are derived in the 70,160, 250, 350, and 550 um bands in the region where the interaction with theism takes place, and this can be fitted with a modified black body with atemperature of 25+-3 k. using the published proper motion and radial velocityfor the star, we derive a heliocentric space motion of 25.1 km/s. using thepacs and spire data and the analytical formula of the bow shock structure, weinfer a de-projected standoff distance of the bow shock of r0 =(8.0+-0.3)x10^17 cm. we also derive a relative velocity of the star withrespect to the ism of (106.6+-8.7)/sqrt(n_ism) km/s, where n_ism is the numberdensity of the local ism.

1005.1502	herschel images of ngc 6720: h2 formation on dust grains	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained of ngc 6720 (the ringnebula). this is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that iscurrently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula arerecombining. from the pacs and spire images we conclude that there is astriking resemblance between the dust distribution and the h2 emission, whichappears to be observational evidence that h2 forms on grain surfaces. we havedeveloped a photoionization model of the nebula with the cloudy code which weused to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possibleformation scenarios for the h2. we conclude that the most plausible scenario isthat the h2 resides in high density knots which were formed after therecombination of the gas started when the central star entered the coolingtrack. hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of therecombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. h2 formationin the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent astrong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still beongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and theproperties of the grains in the knots.

1005.4675	silicon in the dust formation zone of irc +10216 as observed with pacs  and spire on board herschel	the interstellar medium is enriched primarily by matter ejected from evolvedlow and intermediate mass stars. the outflows from these stars create acircumstellar envelope in which a rich gas-phase and dust-nucleation chemistrytakes place. we observed the nearest carbon-rich evolved star, irc+10216, usingthe pacs (55-210 {\mu}m) and spire (194-672 {\mu}m) spectrometers on boardherschel. we find several tens of lines from sis and sio, including lines fromthe v=1 vibrational level. for sis these transitions range up to j=124-123,corresponding to energies around 6700k, while the highest detectable transitionis j=90-89 for sio, which corresponds to an energy around 8400k. both speciestrace the dust formation zone of irc+10216, and the broad energy rangesinvolved in their detected transitions permit us to derive the physicalproperties of the gas and the particular zone in which each species has beenformed. this allows us to check the accuracy of chemical thermodynamicalequilibrium models and the suggested depletion of sis and sio due to accretiononto dust grains.

1012.5193	the vmc survey - i. strategy and first data	the new visual and infrared telescope for astronomy (vista) has startedoperations. over its first five years it will be collecting data for six publicsurveys, one of these is the near-infrared yjksvista survey of the magellanicclouds system (vmc). this survey comprises the lmc, the smc, the bridgeconnecting the two galaxies and two fields in the stream. this paper providesan overview of the vmc survey strategy and presents first science results. themain goals of the vmc survey are the determination of the spatially resolvedsfh and 3d structure of the magellanic system. therefore, the vmc survey isdesigned to reach stars as faint as the oldest main sequence turn-off point andto constrain the mean magnitude of pulsating variable stars such as rr lyraestars and cepheids. this paper focuses on observations of vmc fields in the lmcobtained between november 2009 and march 2010. these observations correspond toa 7% completeness of the lmc fields. the vmc observations consist ofmulti-epoch measurements organised following a specific structure. the datawere reduced using the vista data flow system pipeline whose source catalogueswere produced and made available via the vista science archive. the analysis ofthe data shows that the sensitivity in each wave band agrees with expectations.uncertainties and completeness of the data are also derived. the first scienceresults, aimed at assessing the science quality of the vmc data, include anoverview of the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude and colour-colourdiagrams, the detection of planetary nebulae and of stellar clusters, and theks band light-curve of variable stars. the vmc survey represents a tremendousimprovement, in spatial resolution and sensitivity, on previous panoramicobservations of the magellanic system in the near-infrared and complementsnicely the deep observations at other wavelengths.

0709.3199	spitzer space telescope spectral observations of agb stars in the fornax  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we have observed five carbon-rich agb stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal(dsph) galaxy, using the infrared spectrometer on board the spitzer spacetelescope. the stars were selected from a near-infrared survey of fornax andinclude the three reddest stars, with presumably the highest mass-loss rates,in that galaxy. such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-agepopulation (2-8 gyr old and metallicity of [fe/h] -1) of fornax. the primaryaim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosityand metallicity, by comparing agb stars in several galaxies with differentmetallicities. the spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfermodel. we find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 msunyr-1. the other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 msun yr-1. wefind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggestthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in therange 240 to 800. the c2h2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because ofthe higher c/o ratio. in contrast, the sic fraction is reduced at lowmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. the total mass-loss rate from allknown carbon-rich agb stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is ofthe order of 2x10^-5 msun yr-1. this is much lower than that of the dwarfirregular galaxy wlm, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.the difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of wlm. thesuppressed gas-return rate to the ism accentuates the difference between therelatively gas-rich dwarf irregular and the gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies.our study will be useful to constrain gas and dust recycling processes in lowmetallicity galaxies.

1104.2316	warm water vapour in the sooty outflow from a luminous carbon star	in 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbonstar irc+10216 was announced. this detection challenged the currentunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to beabsent in carbon-rich stars. several explanations for the occurrence of watervapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets ordwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, andphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. however, the only waterline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, byitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. here we report on thedetection by the herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in thefar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of irc+10216, including somehigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 k. the emission ofthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour ispresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. a plausible explanation forthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet(uv) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. this mechanism triggersalso the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observedabundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

1106.3645	x her and tx psc: two cases of ism interaction with stellar winds  observed by herschel	the asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars x her and tx psc have been imaged at70 and 160 microns with the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite, aspart of the large mess (mass loss of evolved stars) guaranteed time keyprogram. the images reveal an axisymmetric extended structure with its axisoriented along the space motion of the stars. this extended structure is verylikely to be shaped by the interaction of the wind ejected by the agb star withthe surrounding interstellar medium (ism). as predicted by numericalsimulations, the detailed structure of the wind-ism interface depends upon therelative velocity between star+wind and the ism, which is large for these twostars (108 and 55 km/s for x her and tx psc, respectively). in both cases,there is a compact blob upstream whose origin is not fully elucidated, but thatcould be the signature of some instability in the wind-ism shock. deconvolvedimages of x her and tx psc reveal several discrete structures along theoutermost filaments, which could be kelvin-helmholtz vortices. finally, tx pscis surrounded by an almost circular ring (the signature of the terminationshock?) that contrasts with the outer, more structured filaments. a similarinner circular structure seems to be present in x her as well, albeit lessclearly.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1203.4137	infrared excess around nearby rgb stars and reimers law	(abridged) the spectral energy distributions of a well-defined sample of 54rgb stars are constructed, and fitted with the dust radiative transfer modeldusty. the central stars are modeled by marcs model atmospheres. in a firststep, the best-fit marcs model is derived, determining the effectivetemperature. in a second step, models with a finite dust optical depth arefitted and it is determined whether the reduction in chi2 in such models withone additional free parameter is statistically significant.  23 stars are found to have a significant infrared excess, which isinterpreted as mass loss. the dust optical depths are translated into mass-lossrates assuming a typical expansion velocity of 10 km/s and a dust-to-gas ratioof 0.005.  the mass-loss rates are compared to those derived for luminous stars inglobular clusters, by fitting both the infrared excess, as in the presentpaper, and the chromospheric lines. there is excellent agreement between thesevalues and the mass-loss rates derived from the chromospheric activity. thereis a systematic difference with the literature mass-loss rates derived frommodeling the infrared excess, and this has been traced to technical details onhow the dusty radiative transfer model is run.  if the present results are combined with those from modeling thechromospheric emission lines, we obtain the fits log mdot = (1.0 +- 0.3) log l+ (-12.0 +- 0.9) and log mdot = (0.6 +- 0.2) log (lr/m) + (-11.9 +- 0.9).  the predictions of these mass-loss rate formula are tested against the rgbmass loss determination in ngc 6791. using a scaling factor of (8 +- 5), bothrelations can fit this value. that the scaling factor is larger than unitysuggests that the expansion velocity and/or dust-to-gas ratio, or even the dustopacities, are different from the values adopted.

1204.2273	the vmc survey. v. first results for classical cepheids	the vista magellanic cloud (vmc, pi m.r. cioni) survey is collecting deepks-band time-series photometry of the pulsating variable stars hosted by thesystem formed by the two magellanic clouds (mcs) and the "bridge" connectingthem. in this paper we present the first results for classical cepheids, fromthe vmc observations of two fields in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the vmcks-band light curves of the cepheids are well sampled (12-epochs) and ofexcellent precision. we were able to measure for the first time the ksmagnitude of the faintest classical cepheids in the lmc (ks\sim17.5 mag), whichare mostly pulsating in the first overtone (fo) mode, and to obtain foperiod-luminosity (pl), period-wesenheit (pw), and period-luminosity-color(plc) relations, spanning the full period range from 0.25 to 6 day. since thelongest period cepheid in our dataset has a variability period of 23 day, wehave complemented our sample with literature data for brighter f cepheids. onthis basis we have built a pl relation in the ks band that, for the first time,includes short period pulsators, and spans the whole range from 1.6 to 100 daysin period. we also provide the first ever empirical pw and plc relations usingthe (v-ks) color and time-series ks photometry. the very small dispersion(\sim0.07 mag) of these relations makes them very well suited to study thethree-dimensional (3d) geometry of the magellanic system. the use of "direct"(parallax- and baade-wesselink- based) distance measurements to both galacticand lmc cepheids, allowed us to calibrate the zero points of the pl, pw, andplc relations obtained in this paper, and in turn to estimate an absolutedistance modulus of (m-m)0=18.46\pm0.03 for the lmc. this result is inagreement with most of the latest literature determinations based on classicalcepheids.

1206.5982	an independent distance estimate to cw leo	cw leo has been observed six times between october 2009 and june 2012 withthe spire instrument on board the herschel satellite. variability has beendetected in the flux emitted by the central star with a period of 639 \pm 4days, in good agreement with determinations in the literature. variability isalso detected in the bow shock around cw leo that had previously been detectedin the ultraviolet and herschel pacs/spire data. although difficult to provedirectly, our working hypothesis is that this variability is directly relatedto that of the central star. in this case, fitting a sine curve with the periodfixed to 639 days results in a time-lag in the variability between bow shockand the central star of 402 \pm 37 days. the orientation of the bow shockrelative to the plane of the sky is unknown (but see below). for an inclinationangle of zero degrees, the observed time-lag translates into a distance to cwleo of 130 \pm 13 pc, and for non-zero inclination angles the distance issmaller. fitting the shape of the bow shock with an analytical model (wilkin1996), the effect of the inclination angle on the distance may be estimated.making the additional assumption that the relative peculiar velocity betweenthe interstellar medium (ism) and cw leo is determined entirely by the starspace velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (i.e. a stationaryism), the inclination angle is found to be (-33.3 \pm 0.8) degrees based on theobserved proper motion and radial velocity. using the wilkin model, our currentbest estimate of the distance to cw leo is 123 \pm 14 pc. for a distance of 123pc, we derive a mean luminosity of 7790 \pm 150 lsol (internal error).

1207.2492	the vmc survey - vi. quasars behind the magellanic system	the number and spatial distribution of confirmed quasi-stellar objects (qsos)behind the magellanic system is limited. this undermines their use asastrometric reference objects for different types of studies. we have searchedfor criteria to identify candidate qsos using observations from the vistasurvey of the magellanic clouds system (vmc) that provides photometry in theyjks bands and 12 epochs in the ks band. the (y-j) versus (j-ks) diagram hasbeen used to distinguish qso candidates from milky way stars and stars of themagellanic clouds. then, the slope of variation in the ks band has been used toidentify a sample of high confidence candidates. these criteria were developedbased on the properties of 117 known qsos presently observed by the vmc survey.vmc yjks magnitudes and ks light-curves of known qsos behind the magellanicsystem are presented. about 75% of them show a slope of variation in ks&gt;10^-4mag/day and the shape of the light-curve is in general irregular and withoutany clear periodicity. the number of qso candidates found in tiles includingthe south ecliptic pole and the 30 doradus regions is 22 and 26, respectively,with a ~20% contamination by young stellar objects, planetary nebulae, starsand normal galaxies. by extrapolating the number of qso candidates to theentire vmc survey area we expect to find about 1200 qsos behind the lmc, 400behind the smc, 200 behind the bridge and 30 behind the stream areas, but notall will be suitable for astrometry. further, the ks band light-curves can helpsupport investigations of the mechanism responsible for the variations.

1209.1023	oxygen-rich dust production in ic 10	we report the detection of oxygen-rich circumstellar envelopes in stars ofthe nearby (700 kpc) starburst galaxy ic 10. the star formation history and thechemical environment of this galaxy makes it an ideal target to observe dustproduction by high-mass stars in a low-metallicity environment. the goal ofthis study is to identify oxygen-rich stars in ic 10 and to constrain theirnature between asymptotic giant branch stars (agbs), red supergiants (rsgs),and other infrared bright sources. we examine the mass-loss rate of the starsand compare to results obtained for the magellanic clouds. our objectives areto (1) assess whether rsgs can be significant dust producers in ic 10, and (2),solve the discrepancy between the star formation history of ic 10 and therelatively low number of rsgs detected in the optical. we search for silicatedust in emission by using the spectral map observed with the infraredspectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope. the optical (ubvri) andinfrared (jhk, spitzer/irac and spitzer/mips) photometry is used to assert themembership of the stars to ic 10 and disentangle between agbs and rsgs.radiative models are used to infer mass-loss rates and stellar luminosities.the luminosity and colors of at least 9 silicate emission sources areconsistent with stars within ic 10. furthermore, the photometry of 2 of thesesources is consistent with rsgs. we derive dust mass-loss rates similar to thevalues found in the magellanic clouds. accounting for the sample completeness,rsgs are not important contributors to the dust mass budget in ic 10.

1210.3030	unexpectedly large mass loss during the thermal pulse cycle of the red  giant r sculptoris!	the asymptotic giant branch star r sculptoris is surrounded by a detachedshell of dust and gas. the shell originates from a thermal pulse during whichthe star undergoes a brief period of increased mass loss. it has hitherto beenimpossible to constrain observationally the timescales and mass-loss propertiesduring and after a thermal pulse - parameters that determine the lifetime onthe asymptotic giant branch and the amount of elements returned by the star.here we report observations of co emission from the circumstellar envelope andshell around r sculptoris with an angular resolution of 1.3 arcsec. what washitherto thought to be only a thin, spherical shell with a clumpy structure, isrevealed to contain a spiral structure. spiral structures associated withcircumstellar envelopes have been seen previously, from which it was concludedthat the systems must be binaries. using the data, combined with hydrodynamicsimulations, we conclude that r sculptoris is a binary system that underwent athermal pulse approximately 1800 years ago, lasting approximately 200 years.about 0.003 msun of mass was ejected at a velocity of 14.3 km s-1 and at a rateapproximately 30 times higher than the prepulse mass-loss rate. this shows thatapproximately 3 times more mass is returned to the interstellar medium duringand immediately after a pulse than previously thought.

1210.3483	discovery of multiple dust shells beyond 1 arcmin in the circumstellar  envelope of irc+10216 using herschel/pacs	we present new herschel/pacs images at 70, 100, and 160 micron of thewell-known, nearby, carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch star irc+10216revealing multiple dust shells in its circumstellar envelope. for the firsttime, dust shells (or arcs) are detected until 320 arcsec. the almost sphericalshells are non-concentric and have an angular extent between 40 deg and 200deg. the shells have a typical width of 5 arcsec - 8 arcsec, and the shellseparation varies in the range of 10 arcsec - 35 arcsec, corresponding to500-1700 yr. local density variations within one arc are visible. theshell/intershell density contrast is typically 4, and the arcs contain some 50%more dust mass than the smooth envelope. the observed (nested) arcs record themass-loss history over the past 16 000 yr, but rayleigh-taylor andkelvin-helmholtz instabilities in the turbulent astropause and astrosheath willerase any signature of the mass-loss history for at least the first 200 000 yrof mass loss. accounting for the bowshock structure, the envelope mass aroundirc+10216 contains &gt;2msun of gas and dust mass. it is argued that the origin ofthe shells is related to non-isotropic mass-loss events and clumpy dustformation.

1212.5478	baade-wesselink distances to galactic and magellanic cloud cepheids and  the effect of metallicity	(abridged) the aim of this paper is to investigate the metallicity dependenceof the pl relation in v and k, based on a sample of 128 galactic, 36 lmc, and 6smc cepheids with individual baade-wesselink (bw) distances and individuallydetermined metallicities from high-resolution spectroscopy. the p-relationfinally adopted is 1.50 -0.24log p. the slope of this relation is based on thecondition that the distance to the lmc does not depend on period or (v-k)colour and that the slope of the pl relation based on the bw distances agreeswith that based on apparent magnitude. the zero point of the relation is tightto the cepheids with hst and revised hipparcos parallaxes as well as tocepheids in clusters. the slope of the galactic and lmc k-band relationformally agrees within the errors, and combining all cepheids (including thesmc) results in a negligible metallicity dependence. a similar conclusion isfound for the reddening-free wesenheit relation. in the v-band the situation ismore complex. the slope of the lmc and the galactic pl relation differ at the3sigma level. combining the sample nevertheless results in a metallicity termsignificant at the 2sigma level. the details of the comparison of bw-baseddistances and cepheids with hst and revised hipparcos parallaxes also play arole. the method used by storm et al. would lead to larger dm of 18.37 and18.81 for the lmc and smc, respectively. the lmc dm is shorter than thecurrently accepted value, which is in the range 18.42 to 18.55 (walker 2012),and it is speculated that the p-factor may depend on metallicity.

1304.1153	the vmc survey vii. reddening map of the 30 doradus field and the  structure of the cold interstellar medium	context: the details of how galaxies have evolved are imprinted in their starformation history, chemical enrichment and morpho-kinematic structure.parameters behind these can be measured by combining photometric techniqueswith modelling. however, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colourand magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening.  aims: in this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30doradus region of the large magellanic cloud; for community use and to test themethods used. the reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracerof the interstellar medium (ism).  methods: near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measurereddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitudevariance. the star formation history is used to convert colour to reddeningvalues which are subsequently converted to visual extinction.  results: presented is a dust map for the 30 doradus field. this map samples aregion of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddeningup to av=6 mag. we compare our map with maps from the literature, includingoptical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomichydrogen and dust emission. through estimation of column density we locatemolecular clouds.  conclusions: this new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps inthe literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. we make ourreddening map available for community use. in terms of ism the red clump starsappear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emissionbecause there is stronger correlation between increasing emission andextinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that wouldheat the dust. the transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occursbetween densities of nh=4x10^21 to 6x10^21 cm^-2.

0801.2652	the distance to the galactic centre based on population-ii cepheids and  rr lyrae stars	context: the distance to the galactic centre (gc) is of importance for thedistance scale in the universe. the value derived by eisenhauer et al. (2005)of 7.62 +- 0.32 kpc based on the orbit of one star around the central blackhole is shorter than most other distance estimates based on a variety ofdifferent methods. aim: to establish an independent distance to the gc withhigh accuracy. to this end population-ii cepheids are used that have beendiscovered in the ogle-ii and iii surveys. method: thirty-nine pop-ii cepheidshave been monitored on 4 nights spanning 14 days. light curves have been fittedusing the known periods from the ogle data to determine the mean k-bandmagnitude. it so happens that 37 rr lyrae stars are in the field-of-views andmean k-band magnitudes are derived for this sample as well. results: theperiod-luminosity relation of pop-ii cepheids in the k-band is determined, andthe derived slope of -2.24 +- 0.14 is consistent with the value derived bymatsunaga et al. (2006). fixing the slope to their more accurate value resultsin a zero point, and implies a distance modulus to the gc of 14.51 +- 0.12,with an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.07 mag. similarly, from the rrlyrae k-band pl-relation we derive a value of 14.48 +- 0.17 (random) +- 0.07(syst.). the two independent determinations are averaged to find 14.50 +- 0.10(random) +- 0.07 (syst.), or 7.94 +- 0.37 +- 0.26 kpc.

1401.2399	first detection of rotational co line emission in an rgb star	context: for stars with initial masses below about 1 solar mass, the massloss during the first red giant branch (rgb) phase dominates mass loss in thelater asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase. nevertheless, mass loss on the rgbis still often parameterised by a simple reimers law in stellar evolutionmodels. aims: to try to detect co thermal emission in a small sample of nearbyrgb stars with reliable hipparcos parallaxes that were shown to have infraredexcess in an earlier paper. methods: a sample of five stars was observed in theco j=2-1 and j=3-2 lines with the iram and apex telescopes. results: one star,the one with the largest mass-loss rate based on the previous analysis of thespectral energy distribution, was detected. the expansion velocity isunexpectedly large at 12 km/s. the line profile and intensity are compared tothe predictions from a molecular line emission code. the standard modelpredicts a double-peaked profile, while the observations indicate a flatterprofile. a model that does fit the data has a much smaller co envelope (by afactor of 3), and a co abundance that is two times larger and/or a largermass-loss rate than the standard model. this could indicate that the phase oflarge mass loss has only recently started. conclusions: the detection of co inan rgb star with a luminosity of only about 1300 solar luminosities and amass-loss rate as low as a few 10(-9) solarmasses/yr is important and theresults also raise new questions. however, alma observations are required inorder to study the mass-loss process of rgb stars in more detail, both forreasons of sensitivity (6 hours of integration in superior weather at iram wereneeded to get a 4sigma detection in the object with the largest detectionprobability), and spatial resolution (to determine the size of the coenvelope).

1403.2892	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel - i. the co envelope	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars lose their envelopes by means of astellar wind whose driving mechanism is not understood well. characterizing thecomposition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow providesconstraints that are essential for understanding agb evolution, including therate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.  we modeled the co emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rateoxygen-rich agb star w hya using data obtained by the hifi, pacs, and spireinstruments onboard the herschel space observatory and ground-based telescopes.$^{12}$co and $^{13}$co lines are used to constrain the intrinsic$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio from resolved hifi lines.  the acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can berepresented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. beyond this point,acceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. using the j=10-9,9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio of$18\pm10$ for w hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the$^{12}$co abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\mu$m. to match thelow-excitation co lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about500 stellar radii. the radial dust emission intensity profile measured by pacsimages at 70 $\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our modelpredicts beyond 20 arcsec.  the initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving inthe lower part of the envelope. the final injection of momentum in the windmight be the result of an increase in the opacity thanks to the latecondensation of dust species. the derived intrinsic isotopologue ratio for whya is consistent with values set by the first dredge-up and suggestive of aninitial mass of 2 m$_\odot$ or more. however, the uncertainty in themain-sequence mass derived based on this isotopologic ratio is large.

1403.6335	herschel/pacs observations of the 69 $\mu m$ band of crystalline olivine  around evolved stars	we present 48 herschel/pacs spectra of evolved stars in the wavelength rangeof 67-72 $\mu$m. this wavelength range covers the 69 $\mu$m band of crystallineolivine ($\text{mg}_{2-2x}\text{fe}_{(2x)}\text{sio}_{4}$). the width andwavelength position of this band are sensitive to the temperature andcomposition of the crystalline olivine. our sample covers a wide range ofobjects: from high mass-loss rate agb stars (oh/ir stars, $\dot m \ge 10^{-5}$m$_\odot$/yr), through post-agb stars with and without circumbinary disks, toplanetary nebulae and even a few massive evolved stars. the goal of this studyis to exploit the spectral properties of the 69 $\mu$m band to determine thecomposition and temperature of the crystalline olivine. since the objects covera range of evolutionary phases, we study the physical and chemical propertiesin this range of physical environments. we fit the 69 $\mu$m band and use itswidth and position to probe the composition and temperature of the crystallineolivine. for 27 sources in the sample, we detected the 69 $\mu$m band ofcrystalline olivine ($\text{mg}_{(2-2x)}\text{fe}_{(2x)}\text{sio}_{4}$). the69 $\mu$m band shows that all the sources produce pure forsterite grainscontaining no iron in their lattice structure. the temperature of thecrystalline olivine as indicated by the 69 $\mu$m band, shows that on averagethe temperature of the crystalline olivine is highest in the group of oh/irstars and the post-agb stars with confirmed keplerian disks. the temperature islower for the other post-agb stars and lowest for the planetary nebulae. acouple of the detected 69 $\mu$m bands are broader than those of puremagnesium-rich crystalline olivine, which we show can be due to a temperaturegradient in the circumstellar environment of these stars. continued...

1404.2177	herschel spectral-mapping of the helix nebula (ngc 7293): extended co  photodissociation and oh+ emission	the helix nebula (ngc 7293) is the closest planetary nebulae. therefore, itis an ideal template for photochemical studies at small spatial scales inplanetary nebulae. we aim to study the spatial distribution of the atomic andthe molecular gas, and the structure of the photodissociation region along thewestern rims of the helix nebula as seen in the submillimeter range withherschel. we use 5 spire fts pointing observations to make atomic and molecularspectral maps. we analyze the molecular gas by modeling the co rotational linesusing a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-lte) radiative transfer model.for the first time, we have detected extended oh+ emission in a planetarynebula. the spectra towards the helix nebula also show co emission lines (fromj= 4 to 8), [nii] at 1461 ghz from ionized gas, and [ci] (2-1), which togetherwith the oh+ lines, trace extended co photodissociation regions along the rims.the estimated oh+ column density is (1-10)x1e12 cm-2. the ch+ (1-0) line wasnot detected at the sensitivity of our observations. non-lte models of the coexcitation were used to constrain the average gas density (n(h2)=(1-5)x1e5cm-3) and the gas temperature (tk= 20-40 k). the spire spectral-maps suggestthat co arises from dense and shielded clumps in the western rims of the helixnebula whereas oh+ and [ci] lines trace the diffuse gas and the uv and x-rayilluminated clumps surface where molecules reform after co photodissociation.[nii] traces a more diffuse ionized gas component in the interclump medium.

1409.0396	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel. ii. the molecular envelope of w  hya	the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass ina stellar wind. understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellarwinds of agb stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products ofnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining agb evolution and predicting thechemical evolution of galaxies. in a previous paper we have constrained thestructure of the outflowing envelope of w hya using spectral lines of the$^{12}$co molecule. here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set ofh$_{2}$o and $^{28}$sio lines observed by the three instruments on boardherschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfercode. the oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$sio abundance profile can beconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formationat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. the modelling of h$_{2}$o and$^{28}$sio confirms the properties of the envelope model of w hya derived from$^{12}$co lines. we find an h$_2$o ortho-to-para ratio of2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an agb wind. theo$^{16}$/o$^{17}$ ratio indicates that w hya has an initial mass of about 1.5m$_\odot$. although the ortho- and para-h$_{2}$o lines observed by hifi appearto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocityof $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the hifi lines of both spin isomers and thoseof $^{28}$sio well. the ortho- and para-h$_2^{16}$o and $^{28}$sio abundancesrelative to h$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. assuming a solarsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$sio line emission model is consistent withabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

1410.5460	new nir light-curve templates for classical cepheids	we present new near-infrared (nir) light-curve templates for fundamental (fu,jhk) and first overtone (fo, j) cepheids. the new templates together with pland pw relations provide cepheid distances from single-epoch observations witha precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method adopted. thetemplates rely on a very large set of galactic and magellanic clouds (mcs)cepheids (fu,~600; fo,~200) with well sampled nir (irsf data) and optical (v,i;ogle data) light curves. to properly trace the change in the shape of the lightcurve as a function of period, we split the sample of calibrating cepheids into10 different period bins. the templates for the first time cover fo cepheidsand the fu short-period cepheids (p&lt;5 days). moreover, the zero-point phase isanchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. the newapproach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump cepheidswhen compared with the phase of maximum light. we also provide new estimates ofthe nir-to-optical amplitude ratios for fu and fo cepheids. we perform detailedanalytical fits using both 7th-order fourier series and multi-gaussian periodicfunctions. the latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters(9 vs 15). mean nir magnitudes based on the new templates are up to 80% moreaccurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50% more accurate than meanmagnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertaintiesranging from 0.015 mag (j) to 0.019 mag (k). moreover, the errors on individualdistances of small mc cepheids derived from nir pw relations, are essentiallyreduced to the intrinsic scatter of the adopted relations. thus, the newtemplates are the ultimate tool to estimate precise cepheid distances from nirsingle-epoch observations, which can be adopted to derive the 3d structure ofthe mcs.

1411.4053	an infrared census of dust in nearby galaxies with spitzer (dustings),  i. overview	nearby resolved dwarf galaxies provide excellent opportunities for studyingthe dust-producing late stages of stellar evolution over a wide range ofmetallicity (-2.7 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -1.0). here, we describe dustings (dust in nearbygalaxies with spitzer): a 3.6 and 4.5 micron post-cryogen spitzer spacetelescope imaging survey of 50 dwarf galaxies within 1.5 mpc that is designedto identify dust-producing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massivestars. the survey includes 37 dwarf spheroidal, 8 dwarf irregular, and 5transition-type galaxies. this near-complete sample allows for the building ofstatistics on these rare phases of stellar evolution over the full metallicityrange. the photometry is &gt;75% complete at the tip of the red giant branch forall targeted galaxies, with the exception of the crowded inner regions of ic10, ngc 185, and ngc 147. this photometric depth ensures that the majority ofthe dust-producing stars, including the thermally-pulsing agb stars, aredetected in each galaxy. the images map each galaxy to at least twice thehalf-light radius to ensure that the entire evolved star population is includedand to facilitate the statistical subtraction of background and foregroundcontamination, which is severe at these wavelengths. in this overview, wedescribe the survey, the data products, and preliminary results. we showevidence for the presence of dust-producing agb stars in 8 of the targetedgalaxies, with metallicities as low as [fe/h] = -1.9, suggesting that dustproduction occurs even at low metallicity.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

0807.1196	the influence of chemical composition on the properties of cepheid  stars. ii-the iron content	the cepheid period-luminosity (pl) relation is unquestionably one of the mostpowerful tools at our disposal for determining the extragalactic distancescale. while significant progress has been made in the past few years towardsits understanding and characterization both on the observational andtheoretical sides, the debate on the influence that chemical composition mayhave on the pl relation is still unsettled. with the aim to assess theinfluence of the stellar iron content on the pl relation in the v and k bands,we have related the v-band and the k-band residuals from the standard plrelations of freedman et al. (2001) and persson et al. (2004), respectively, to[fe/h]. we used direct measurements of the iron abundances of 68 galactic andmagellanic cepheids from feros and uves high-resolution and highsignal-to-noise spectra. we find a mean iron abundance ([fe/h]) about solar(sigma = 0.10) for our galactic sample (32 stars), -0.33 dex (sigma = 0.13) forthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) sample (22 stars) and -0.75 dex (sigma = 0.08)for the small magellanic cloud (smc) sample (14 stars). our abundancemeasurements of the magellanic cepheids double the number of stars studied upto now at high resolution. the metallicity affects the v-band cepheid plrelation and metal-rich cepheids appear to be systematically fainter thanmetal-poor ones. these findings depend neither on the adopted distance scalefor galactic cepheids nor on the adopted lmc distance modulus. current data donot allow us to reach a firm conclusion concerning the metallicity dependenceof the k-band pl relation. the new galactic distances indicate a small effect,whereas the old ones support a marginal effect.

0807.1269	baade-wesselink distances and the effect of metallicity in classical  cepheids	the aim of this paper is to investigate the metallicity dependence of the$pl$-relation in $v$ and $k$ based on a sample of 68 galactic cepheids withindividual baade-wesselink distances (some of the stars also have an hst-basedparallax) and individually determined metallicities from high-resolutionspectroscopy. literature values of the $v$-band, $k$-band and radial velocitydata have been collected for a sample of 68 classical cepheids that have theirmetallicity determined in the literature from high-resolution spectroscopy.based on a $(v-k)$ surface-brightness relation and a projection factor derivedin a previous paper, distances have been derived from a baade-wesselinkanalysis. $pl$- and $plz$-relations in $v$ and $k$ are derived. the effect ofthe adopted dependence of the projection factor on period is investigated. thechange from a constant $p$-factor to one recently suggested in the literaturewith a mild dependence on $\log p$ results in a less steep slope by 0.1 unit,which is about the 1-sigma error bar in the slope itself. the observed slope inthe $pl$-relation in $v$ in the lmc agrees with both hypotheses. in $k$ thedifference between the galactic and lmc slope is larger and would favour a mildperiod dependence of the $p$-factor. the dependence on metallicity in $v$ and$k$ is found to be marginal, and independent of the choice of $p$-factor onperiod. this result is severely limited by the small range in metallicitycovered by the galactic cepheids.

0807.2764	the red clump absolute magnitude based on revised hipparcos parallaxes	over the past decade the use of the red clump (rc) as distance indicator hasincreased in importance as this evolutionary phase is well populated and a goodlocal calibration exists.  the absolute calibration of the rc in the $i$ and $k$ band is investigatedagain based on the recently published revised hipparcos parallaxes.  a numerical model is developed that takes the various selection criteria andthe properties of the hipparcos catalogue into account. the biases involved inapplying certain selections are estimated with this model.  the absolute magnitudes that are found are $m_{\rm i} = -0.22 \pm 0.03$ and$m_{\rm k} = -1.54 \pm 0.04$ (on the 2mass system). the $i$-band value is ingood agreement with previous determinations, the $k$-band value is fainter thanpreviously quoted, and this seems to be related to a selection bias wherebyaccurate $k$-magnitudes are only available for relatively few bright stars.applying population corrections to the absolute $k$ magnitude of rc stars inclusters supports the fainter magnitude scale.

astro-ph;0001386	atomic diffusion in metal poor stars. the influence on the main sequence  fitting distance scale, subdwarfs ages and the value of delta y/deltaz	the effect of atomic diffusion on the main sequence (ms) of metal-poor lowmass stars is investigated. since diffusion alters the stellar surface chemicalabundances with respect to their initial values, one must ensure - bycalibrating the initial chemical composition of the theoretical models - thatthe surface abundances of the models match the observed ones of the stellarpopulation under scrutiny. since the observed surface abundances of subdwarfsare different from the initial ones due to the effect of diffusion, while theglobular clusters stellar abundances are measured in red giants, which havepractically recovered their initial abundances after the dredge-up, theisochrones to be employed for studying globular clusters and halo subdwarfswith the same observational value of [fe/h] are different and do not coincide.we find, however,that the current ms-fitting distances derived from hipparcossubdwarfs using colour corrections from standard isochrones are basicallyunaltered when diffusion is taken properly into account; on the other hand, theabsolute ages, the age dispersion, the age-metallicity relation for halosubdwarfs, as well as the value of the helium enrichment ratio delta y/delta zobtained from the width of the empirical halo subdwarfs ms, are allsignificantly modified when the properly calibrated isochrones with diffusionare used.

astro-ph;0002325	multi-colour pl-relations of cepheids in the hipparcos catalogue and the  distance to the lmc	we analyse a sample of 236 cepheids from the hipparcos catalog, using themethod of ``reduced parallaxes'' in v, i, k and the reddening-free``wesenheit-index''. we compare our sample to those considered by feast &amp;catchpole (1997) and lanoix et al. (1999).  we stress the importance of two systematic effects which influence thedistance to the lmc: the slopes of the galactic pl-relations and metallicitycorrections. in order to assess the influence of these various effects, wepresent 27 distance moduli (dm) to the lmc, based on three different colours(v,i,k), three different slopes, and three different metallicity corrections.  the dm to the lmc based on the parallax data can be summarised as follows.based on the pl-relation in v and i, and the wesenheit-index, the dm is 18.60\pm 0.11 (\pm 0.08 slope)(^{+0.08}_{-0.15} metallicity), which is our currentbest estimate.  based on the pl-relation in k the dm is 18.52 \pm 0.18$ (\pm 0.03 slope) (\pm0.06 metallicity)(^{+0.10}_{-0} sampling bias}).  the random error is mostly due to the given accuracy of the hipparcosparallaxes and the number of cepheids in the respective samples. the termsbetween parentheses indicate the possible systematic uncertainties due to theslope of the galactic pl-relations, the metallicity corrections, and in thek-band, due to the limited number of stars. recent work by sandage et al.(1999) indicates that the effect of metallicity towards shorter distances maybe smaller in v and i than indicated here.

astro-ph;0109168	evolution of planetary nebulae i. an improved synthetic model	we present a new synthetic model to follow the evolution of a planetarynebula (pn) and its central star, starting from the onset of agb phase up tothe white dwarf cooling sequence. the model suitably combines variousanalytical prescriptions to account for different (but inter-related) aspectsof planetary nebulae, such as: the dynamical evolution of the primary shell andsurrounding ejecta, the photoionisation of h and he by the central star, thenebular emission of a few relevant optical lines (e.g. hbeta; heii4686;[oiii]5007). predictions of the synthetic model are tested by comparison withboth findings of hydrodynamical calculations, and observations of galactic pne.the sensitiveness of the results to the models parameters (e.g. transitiontime, mass of the central star, h-/he-burning tracks, etc.) is also discussed.we briefly illustrate the systematic differences that are expected in theluminosities and lifetimes of pne with either h- or he-burning central stars,which result in different ``detection probabilities'' across the h-r diagram,in both hbeta and [oiii]5007 lines. adopting reasonable values of the modelparameters, we are able to reproduce, in a satisfactory way, many generalproperties of pne, like the ionised mass--nebular radius relationship, thetrends of a few main nebular line ratios, and the observed ranges of nebularshell thicknesses, electron densities, and expansion velocities. the modelsnaturally predict also the possible transitions from optically-thick tooptically-thin configurations (and vice versa). in this context, the origin ofthe zanstra discrepancy is also analysed.

astro-ph;0111082	an empirical method to estimate the lmc distance using b-stars in  eclipsing binary systems	we present a new method to determine the distance to b-stars in eclipsingbinary systems. the method is completely empirical, and it is based on theexistence of a very tight linear relationship between the v-band ``zeromagnitude angular diameter'' and the stroemgren colour index c1 for b-stars; wehave empirically calibrated this relationship using local single b-stars withaccurate angular diameters, and b-stars in eclipsing binaries with preciseradii and parallax determinations. by studying the differential behaviour ofthis relationship as predicted by theoretical stellar evolution models, we findthat it is independent of the stellar metallicities for a range of [fe/h]values between the solar one and that of young stars in the magellanic clouds.the method, which also provides the value of the reddening to the system, isdiscussed in detail, together with a thorough estimate of the associatederrors. we conclude that accurate stroemgren photometry obtainable with 1.5m-class telescopes of the lmc eclipsing binaries hv 2274 and hv 982 will allowto obtain an empirical lmc distance with an accuracy of the order of 0.13 mag.

astro-ph;0201028	eso imaging survey. exploring the optical/infrared imaging data of  cdf-s: point sources	this paper describes the methodology currently being implemented in the eispipeline for analysing optical/infrared multi-colour data. the aim is toidentify different classes of objects as well as possible undesirable featuresassociated with the construction of colour catalogues. the classificationmethod used is based on the xi^2-fitting of template spectra to the observedseds, as measured through broad-band filters. its main advantage is thesimultaneous use of all colours, properly weighted by the photometric errors.in addition, it provides basic information on the properties of the classifiedobjects (eg redshift, effective temperature). these characteristics make thexi^2-technique ideal for handling large multi-band datasets. the results arecompared to the more traditional colour-colour selection and, wheneverpossible, to model predictions. in order to identify objects with odd colours,either associated with rare populations or to possible problems in thecatalogue, outliers are searched for in the multi-dimensional colour spaceusing a nearest-neighbour criterion. outliers with large xi^2-values areindividually inspected to further investigate their nature. the tools developedare used for a preliminary analysis of the multi-colour point source catalogueconstructed from the optical/infrared imaging data obtained for the chandradeep field south (cdf-s). these data are publicly available, representing thefirst installment of the ongoing eis deep public survey.

(3) from thespectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections forjohnson-cousins-glass, hst/wfpc2, hst/nicmos, washington, and eso imagingsurvey systems (this latter consisting on the wfi, emmi, and sofi filter sets).(4) these tables are used to convert several sets of padova isochrones into thecorresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful databasefor several astrophysical applications. all data files are made available inelectronic form.

astro-ph;0208449	carbon stars in the local group	the current status of carbon stars in the local group and beyond, isdiscussed. although many carbon stars and late m-stars have been identified inlocal group galaxies, a coherent understanding in terms of the chemicalevolution- and star formation history of a galaxy is still largely lacking.although a few major new surveys have been carried out over the last threeyears, the observational data is still incomplete in many respects: 1) for someof the larger galaxies only a small fraction in area has been surveyed so far,2) surveys have been conducted using different techniques, and some of theolder surveys are incomplete in bolometric magnitude, 3) only for some galaxiesis there information about the late m-star population, or it is sometimesunpublished even when the data is available, 4) not all galaxies in the localgroup have been surveyed, 5) especially for some of the older work insufficientdata is available to determine bolometric magnitudes. i have correlated carbonstar positions with the 2mass 2nd incremental data release to obtain $jhk$, andbolometric magnitudes, to remedy this situation in some cases.  from the existing observations one can derive the following: the formation ofcarbon stars is both a function of metallicity and star-formation history. ingalaxies with a similar star formation history, there will be relatively morecarbon stars formed in the system with the lower metallicity. on the otherhand, the scarcity of agb type carbon stars in some galaxies with the lowestmetallicity indicates that these systems have had a low, if any, star-formationover the last few gyrs.

astro-ph;0308529	the distance to the lmc cluster ngc 1866; clues from the cluster cepheid  population	(abridged) recent investigations aimed at estimating the distance to theyoung lmc cluster ngc1866 have made use of red clump stars in the surroundinglmc field, together with empirical and theoretical main-sequence fittingmethods, and have found significantly different distances for the field and thecluster, the latter being closer by in distance modulus by \delta (dm) \sim0.20 mag. in this paper we (re-)consider the cepheid star population ofngc1866, to try to shed some light on this discrepancy. by combining variousextensive photometric datasets in bvi and single-epoch 2mass jhk photometry, plrelationships for the cluster cepheids are obtained. a comparison between thefield lmc and cluster pl relationships for the reddening free wesenheit indexgives a firm determination of the distance between the cluster and the lmc mainbody (0.04 mag in distance modulus, the cluster being more distant) which,coupled to a model for the geometry of the lmc disk, provides \delta (dm)ranging between 0.0 and -0.11 mag. the simultaneous comparison of the plrelationships in bvi for the cluster and lmc field gives an estimate of thecluster reddening, which results to be e(b-v) = 0.12 \pm 0.02. thisdetermination is higher than the canonical value of 0.06 mag used in allprevious studies, but we show that it is not in contradiction with are-analysis of independent estimates. the cluster main sequence fittingdistance obtained with this new reddening is dm = 18.58 \pm 0.08, fullycompatible with the red clump value of dm = 18.53 \pm0.07(random)^{+0.02}_{-0.05} (systematic) and the cepheid constraint on \delta(dm).

(ii) in thesegalaxies, the pnlf cut-off is produced by pne with progenitor masses of about2.5 msun, while less massive stars give origin to fainter pne. as a consequencem* is expected to depend strongly on the age of the last burst of starformation, dimming by as much as 5 mag as we go from young to 10-gyr oldpopulations. (iii) rather than on the initial metallicity of a stellarpopulation, m* depends on the actual [o/h] of the observed pne, a quantity thatmay differ significantly from the initial value (due to dredge-up episodes),especially in young and intermediate-age pn populations. (iv) also thetransition time from the end of agb to the pn phase, and the nuclear-burningproperties (i.e. h- or he-burning) of the central stars introducenon-negligible effects on m*. the strongest indication derived from the presentcalculations is a serious difficulty to explain the age-invariance of thecut-off brightness over an extended interval, say from 1 to 13 gyr, thatobservations of pnlfs in galaxies of late-to-early type seem to suggest.

astro-ph;0409362	the distance to the pleiades: main sequence fitting in the near infrared	hipparcos parallax measurements of stars in the pleiades notoriously resultin a cluster distance of 118 pc; ~10% shorter than the `classical' results ofms-fitting. in an earlier paper we developed a purely empirical ms-fittingmethod to address this problem, which produced conflicting results between the(b-v) and (v-i) colour indices, indicating that the cluster's photometricmetallicity is substantially lower than its (~solar) spectroscopic metallicity.we were able to reconcile the discrepancy by assuming [fe/h]=-0.4 (as indicatedfrom (b-v)/(v-i) colour-colour plots), and the distance moduli obtained fromthe 2 indices were in agreement with the hipparcos result, within the 1sigerrors. with the release of the 2mass all sky catalogue, we now apply ourms-fitting method to the pleiades using the infrared colours, in order to testthe plausibility of our earlier result. fitting in the v/(v-k) and k/(j-k)colour planes, we find that assuming a subsolar metallicity does not producedistances in agreement with the (b-v) and (v-i) results. however the infraredplus (v-i) distances are in mutual agreement when adopting the spectroscopicmetallicity. by considering only stars with mv&lt;=6, the infrared and opticalcolour indices all yield consistent distances using the spectroscopic [fe/h].the concordant distances thus obtained from the (b-v), (v-i), (v-k) and (j-k)indices yield a mean of 133.8+/-3 pc, in excellent agreement with thepre-hipparcos ms-fitting results, and the most recent determinations from othermethods. we conclude that there are two distinct issues affecting the pleiades:the hipparcos parallax is in error by ~10%, as previously claimed; the (b-v)colours of the lower ms are anomalous, and we caution against their use forms-fitting to the pleiades and similarly young open clusters.

astro-ph;0504047	star counts in the galaxy. simulating from very deep to very shallow  photometric surveys with the trilegal code	we describe trilegal, a new populations synthesis code for simulating thestellar photometry of any galaxy field. the code attempts to improve uponseveral technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with very completeinput libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar spectral library tosimulate the photometry in any broad-band system; being very versatile allowingeasy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of itsingredients -- like the sfr, amr, imf, and geometry of galaxy components. in aprevious paper (groenewegen et al. 2002), the code was first applied todescribe the very deep star counts of the cdfs stellar catalogue. here, webriefly describe its initial calibration using eis-deep and dms star counts,which are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components oflargest scale heights (oldest ages). we then present the changes in thecalibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the modelinput data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: the relativelyshallower 2mass catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages,and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by hipparcos, which contains asomewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. remarkably, thesame model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all theabove-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of cdfs(16&lt;r&lt;23) to the very shallow ones of hipparcos (v&lt;8). significant deviationsare found just for fields close to the galactic center and plane, and for asingle set of south galactic pole data. the trilegal code is ready to use forthe variety of wide-angle surveys in the optical/infrared that will becomeavailable in the coming years.

astro-ph;0504354	oxygen-rich disk in the v778 cyg system resolved	various scenarios have been proposed to explain the presence of silicatefeatures associated with carbon stars, such as v778 cyg. we have attempted toconstrain these theories by means of mapping water maser mission from v778 cyg.the 22 ghz water maser emission from this star has been mapped using merlinwith an astrometric accuracy of 25 mas. the spatially- andkinematically-resolved maser complex is displaced by about 190 mas from theposition of the c-star as measured 10 years earlier using tycho. oursimulations and analysis of available data show that this position differenceis unlikely to be due to proper motion if v778 cyg is at the assumed distanceof 1.4 kpc. the maser components seem to form a distorted s-shaped structureextended over 18 mas with a clear velocity gradient. we propose a model whichexplains the observed water maser structure as an o-rich warped disk around acompanion of the c-star in v 778 binary system, which is seen almost edge-on.analysis of observational data, especially those obtained with merlin, suggeststhat v778 cyg (and, by implication, other silicate carbon stars) are binarysystems composed of a c-rich star and a companion which stores circumstellaro-rich material.

astro-ph;0506338	mira variables in the ogle bulge fields	(abridged) the 222000 i-band light curves of variable stars detected by theogle-ii survey in the direction of the galactic bulge have been fitted and havealso been correlated with the denis and 2mass databases. results are presentedfor 2691 objects with i-band semi-amplitude larger than 0.45 magnitude,corresponding to classical mira variables. the mira period distribution of 6fields at similar longitude but spanning latitudes from -1.2 to -5.8 degreesare statistically indistinguisable indicating similar populations with initialmasses of 1.5-2 \msol (corresponding to ages of 1-3 gyr). a field at similarlongitude at b = -0.05 from glass et al. (2001) does show a significantlydifferent period distribution, indicating the presence of a younger populationof 2.5-3 \msol and ages below 1 gyr. the k-band period-luminosity relation ispresented for the whole sample, and for sub-fields. the zero point depends ongalactic longitude. simulations are carried out to show that the observeddependence of the zero point with $l$, and the number of stars per field arenaturally explained using the model of disk and bulge stars of binney et al.(1997), for a viewing angle of 43 +/- 17 degrees. a comparison is made withsimilar objects in the magellanic clouds, studied in a previous paper. theslope of the pl-relation in the bulge and the mcs agree within the errorbars. adistance to the galactic centre between 8.6 and 9.0 kpc is derived (for anassumed dm of 18.50 to the lmc).

astro-ph;0602531	a spitzer mid-infrared spectral survey of mass-losing carbon stars in  the large magellanic cloud	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic survey of mass-losingcarbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the large magellanic cloud. thespectra cover the wavelength range 5--38 micron. they show varying combinationsof dust continuum, dust emission features (sic, mgs) and molecular absorptionbands (c2h2, hcn). a set of four narrow bands, dubbed the manchester system, isused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. the relationsbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecularfeatures are studied, and are compared to galactic stars of similar colours.the circumstellar 7-micron c2h2 band is found to be stronger at lowermetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.this is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher c/o ratios at lowmetallicity (less o). a possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in ourspectra may be due to c3. this band has also been identified with interstellarsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. the line-to-continuum ratio of thesic and mgsbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. the mgs band isonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 k. we discuss the selection of carbonversus oxygen-rich agb stars using the j-k vs. k-a colours, and show that thesecolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. metal-poor carbon starsform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. the formation efficiencyof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. we suggest that inlower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the interstellar medium byagb stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,as compare to the galaxy.

astro-ph;0603504	near-infrared photometry of carbon stars	near-infrared, jhkl, photometry of 239 galactic carbon-rich variable stars ispresented and discussed. from these and published data the stars wereclassified as mira or non-mira variables and amplitudes and pulsation periods,ranging from 222 to 948 days for the miras, were determined for most of them. acomparison of the colour and period relations with those of similar stars inthe large magellanic cloud indicates minor differences, which may be theconsequence of sample selection effects. apparent bolometric magnitudes weredetermined by combining the mean jhkl fluxes with mid-infrared photometry fromiras and msx. then, using the mira period luminosity relation to set theabsolute magnitudes, distances were determined -- to greater accuracy than hashitherto been possible for this type of star. bolometric corrections to the kmagnitude were calculated and prescriptions derived for calculating these fromvarious colours. mass-loss rates were also calculated and compared to values inthe literature.  approximately one third of the c-rich miras and an unknown fraction of thenon-miras exhibit apparently random obscuration events that are reminiscent ofthe phenomena exhibited by the hydrogen deficient rcb stars. the underlyingcause of this is unclear, but it may be that mass loss, and consequently dustformation, is very easily triggered from these very extended atmospheres.

astro-ph;0606296	spitzer observations of acetylene bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the  large magellanic cloud	we investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on board thespitzer space telescope (sst) over the 5--38 micron range. all 26low-resolution spectra show acetylene (c2h2) bands at 7 and 14 micron. thehydrogen cyanide (hcn) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. thisis consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the lmc. the observed 14 micronc2h2 band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 k. thereis no clear dilution of the 14 micron band by circumstellar dust emission. this14 micron band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope inthese high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings forgalactic stars. the c2h2,column density, derived from the 13.7 micron band,shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3x10^-6 to 5x10^{-5} msun yr-1. this iscomparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from thespectral energy distribution. additionally, we compare the line strengths ofthe 13.7 micron c2h2 band of our lmc sample with those of a galactic sample.despite the low metallicity of the lmc, there is no clear difference in thec2h2 abundance among lmc and galactic stars. this reflects the effect of the3rd dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to high c/oratios at low metallicity.

astro-ph;0611071	spitzer spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we present spitzer space telescope spectroscopic observations of 14carbon-rich agb stars in the small magellanic cloud. sic dust is seen in mostof the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to lmc stars. the sic featureis strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what isobserved for galactic stars. we argue that in the smc, sic forms at lowertemperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in thegalaxy where sic condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. dust inputinto the interstellar medium by agb stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,with little sic or silicate dust. only the two coolest stars show a 30-micronband due to mgs dust. we suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the smc,mass-losing agb stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth andtherefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allowtemperatures below the 650 k necessary for mgs to exist as a solid. gas phasec$_2$h$_2$ bands are stronger in the smc than in the lmc or galaxy. this isattributed to an increasing c/o ratio at low metallicity. we present acolour-colour diagram based on spitzer irac and mips colours to discriminatebetween o- and c-rich stars. we show that agb stars in the smc become carbonstars early in the thermal-pulsing agb evolution, and remain optically visiblefor $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. for the lmc, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$yr. the superwind phase traced with spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. spitzerspectra of a k supergiant and a compact hii region are also given.

astro-ph;0702628	continuum emission around agb stars at 1.2 mm	it is generally acknowledged that the mass loss of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars undergoes variations on different time scales. we constructedmodels for the dust envelopes for a sample of agb stars to assess whethermass-loss variations influence the spectral energy distribution (sed). toconstrain the variability, extra observations at millimetre wavelengths (1.2mm) were acquired. from the analysis of the dust models, two indications forthe presence of mass-loss variations can be found, being (1) a dust temperatureat the inner boundary of the dust envelope that is far below the dustcondensation temperature and (2) an altered density distribution with respectto rho(r) \propto r^{-2} resulting from a constant mass-loss rate. for 5 out ofthe 18 studied sources a two-component model of the envelope is required,consisting of an inner region with a constant mass-loss rate and an outerregion with a less steep density distribution. for one source an outer regionwith a steeper density distribution was found. moreover, in a search for timevariability in our data set at 1.2 mm, we found that wx psc shows a largerelative time variation of 34% which might partially be caused by variablemolecular line emission.

astro-ph;9709119	obscured asymptotic giant branch stars in the magellanic clouds iv.  carbon stars and oh/ir stars	we present n-band photometry for a sample of 21 dust- enshrouded agb stars inthe large magellanic cloud, and three additional sources in the smallmagellanic cloud. together with near-ir photometry, this is used to give atentative classification into carbon and oxygen-rich atmospheres. bolometricluminosities are also estimated for these stars. in addition, we present theresults of a survey for oh masers in the lmc, which resulted in the discoveryof oh maser emission from iras04407-7000. spectra between 600 and 1000 nm havebeen obtained for two heavily obscured agb stars in the lmc, confirming them tobe highly reddened very late m-type giants. because the dust-enshrouded starsare clearly undergoing heavy mass loss they are assumed to be very near thetermination of their respective asymptotic giant branch phases. the fraction ofmass-losing carbon stars decreases with increasing luminosity, as expected fromhot bottom burning. the best candidate carbon star, with m_bol = -6.8 mag, isthe most luminous mass-losing carbon star in the magellanic clouds, and amongstthe most luminous agb stars. at lower luminosities (m_bol = -5 mag) both oxygenand carbon stars are found. this may be explained by a range in metallicity ofthe individual mass-losing agb stars.

astro-ph;9805127	fine structure of the red giant clump from hipparcos data, and distance  determinations based on its mean magnitude	the i-band brightness of clump stars has been used recently to determine thedistance to the bulge, the lmc and smc, and to m31. it was assumed to be astandard candle based on the observational fact that it is independent of(v-i)-colour in all observed populations. the calibration was done using nearbyclump stars with hipparcos-parallaxes. the most surprising result of thisprocedure was the claim that the distance to the lmc was only 18.04 mag. in thepresent paper we show that with a population synthesis approach we canreproduce the constancy of m_i with colour for the local hipparcos clumpsample. nevertheless, m_i is not a constant among different populations, butdepends on metallicity. as a result, the determined distance modulus to the lmcof 18.28+-0.18 mag is in better agreement with standard values. this resolves,at least partially, the controversial result obtained by the assumption of auniversal value for m_i. we also find and discuss substructures in the clump:we predict that stars slightly heavier than the maximum mass for developingdegenerate he cores should define a secondary, clumpy structure, about 0.3 magbelow the bluest extremity of the red clump. this secondary clump can beclearly identified in the hipparcos database of stars. we argue that thereremain severe uncertainties in the use of clump stars as a distance indicator.

astro-ph;9809010	new peculiar co data of the shell around irc +10 216	a co(1-0) on-source spectrum of the well-known carbon star irc+10216 takenwith the iram 30m telescope in june 1996 shows excess emission between -18.3and -14.3 km/s at the red wing of the underlying profile. the excess emissionis confirmed in january 1997 but is absent in april 1997 and june 1998 iramspectra. such a transient feature has not been seen before in this star or anyother agb star. in april 1997 we mapped the circumstellar shell out to 110".both the j = 1-0 and j = 2-1 spectra show ``spikes'' or components which varyin strength with position in the envelope. one of these components correspondsto the velocity interval mentioned above. an immediate conclusion is that thecircumstellar shell is not spherically symmetric, contrary to what was believedbased on lower spectral resolution data. we are probably seeing emission from acomplex geometrical structure. neither a disk structure nor a double-windstructure seem to be able to explain the observations. the on-source transientbehaviour of the red excess emission can reasonably well be explained by asingle large (about 5 x 10^{13} cm) blob, that expands due to internal motion.

astro-ph;9811133	carbon stars in populations of different metallicity	our current knowledge of carbon stars in the local group and beyond, isdiscussed. although many carbon stars and late m-stars have been identified inexternal galaxies a coherent understanding in terms of the chemical evolution-and star formation rate-history of a galaxy is still largely lacking. issuesthat need to be addressed are: 1) for some of the larger galaxies only a smallfraction in area has been surveyed so far, 2) surveys have been conducted usingdifferent techniques, and may be incomplete in bolometric magnitude, 3) onlyfor some galaxies is there information about the late m-star population, 4) notall galaxies in the local group have been surveyed, 5) only for a sub-set ofstars are bolometric magnitudes available.  from the existing observations one can derive the following: the formation ofcarbon stars is both a function of metallicity and star-formation. in galaxieswith a similar star-formation rate history, there will be relatively morecarbon stars formed in the system with the lower metallicity. on the otherhand, the scarcity of agb type carbon stars in some systems with the lowestmetallicity indicates that these galaxies have had a low, if any,star-formation rate history over the last few gyrs.

astro-ph;9902284	luminous carbon stars in the magellanic clouds	we present ground-based 3 micron spectra of obscured asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars in the magellanic clouds (mcs). we identify the carbon stars on thebasis of the 3.1 micron absorption by hcn and c2h2 molecules.  we show evidence for the existence of carbon stars up to the highest agbluminosities (mbol=-7 mag, for a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.7 mag). thisproves that hot bottom burning (hbb) cannot, in itself, prevent massive agbstars from becoming carbon star before leaving the agb. it also sets an upperlimit to the distance modulus of the large magellanic cloud of 18.8 mag.  the equivalent width of the absorption band decreases with redder (k-l)colour when the dust continuum emission becomes stronger than the photosphericemission. carbon stars with similar (k-l) appear to have equally strong 3micron absorption in the mcs and the milky way. we discuss the implications forthe carbon and nitrogen enrichment of the stellar photosphere of carbon stars.

astro-ph;9906489	isogal-denis detection of red giants with weak mass loss in the galactic  bulge	the isogal project is a survey of the stellar populations, structure, andrecent star formation history of the inner disk and bulge of the galaxy. isogalcombines 15 and 7micron isocam observations with denis ijks data to determinethe nature of a source and the interstellar extinction. in this paper we reportan isogal study of a small field in the inner galactic bulge (l=0deg, b=1.0deg,area=0.035 sq. deg) as a prototype of the larger area isogal survey of theinner galaxy. the five wavelengths of isogal+denis, together with therelatively low and constant extinction in front of this specific field, allowreliable determination of the nature of the sources. the primary scientificresult of this paper is evidence that the most numerous class of isogal15micron sources are red giants in the galactic bulge and central disk, withluminosities just above or close to the rgb tip and weak mass-loss rates. theyform loose sequences in the magnitude-colour diagrams [15]/ks-[15] and[15]/[7]-[15]. their large excesses at 15micron with respect to 2micron and7micron is due to circumstellar dust produced by mass-loss at low rates. theseisogal results are the first systematic evidence and study of dust emission atthis early stage (''intermediate'' agb), before the onset of the largemass-loss phase. it is thus well established that efficient dust formation isalready associated with such low mass-loss rates during this early phase.

astro-ph;9907207	the absolute magnitudes of rr lyrae stars from hipparcos parallaxes	using the method of ``reduced parallaxes'' for the halo rr lyrae stars in thehipparcos catalogue we derive a zero point of 0.77 $\pm$ 0.26 mag for anassumed slope of 0.18 in the $m_{\rm v}$-[fe/h] relation. this is 0.28magnitude brighter than the value fernley et al. (1998a) derived by employingthe method of statistical parallax for the {\it identical} sample and using thesame slope.  we point out that a similar difference exists between the ``reducedparallaxes'' method and the statistical parallax method for the cepheids in thehipparcos catalogue.  we also determine the zero point for the $m_{\rm k}$-$\log p_{0}$ relation,and obtain a value of -1.16 $\pm$ 0.27 mag (for a slope of -2.33). the distancemoduli to the hipparcos rr lyrae stars derived from the two relations agreewell.  the derived distance scale is in good agreement with the results from themain sequence fitting distances of galactic globular clusters and with theresults of theoretical horizontal branch models, and implies a distance modulusto the lmc of 18.61 $\pm$ 0.28 mag.

astro-ph;9909416	mass-loss rates and luminosity functions of dust-enshrouded agb stars  and red supergiants in the lmc	a radiative transfer code is used to model the spectral energy distributionsof 57 mass-losing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants(rsgs) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) for which iso spectroscopic andphotometric data are available. as a result we derive mass-loss rates andbolometric luminosities.  a gap in the luminosity distribution around m_bol = -7.5 mag separates agbstars from rsgs. the luminosity distributions of optically bright carbon stars,dust-enshrouded carbon stars and dust-enshrouded m-type stars have only littleoverlap, suggesting that the dust-enshrouded agb stars are at the very tip ofthe agb and will not evolve significantly in luminosity before mass loss endstheir agb evolution.  derived mass-loss rates span a range from mdot about 10^-7 to 10^-3 m_sun/yr.more luminous and cooler stars are found to reach higher mass-loss rates. thehighest mass-loss rates exceed the classical limit set by the momentum of thestellar radiation field, l/c, by a factor of a few due to multiple scatteringof photons in the circumstellar dust envelope. mass-loss rates are lower thanthe mass consumption rate by nuclear burning, mdot_nuc, for most of the rsgs.two rsgs have mdot &gt;&gt; mdot_nuc, however, suggesting that rsgs shed most oftheir stellar mantles in short phases of intense mass loss. stars on thethermal pulsing agb may also experience episodes of intensified mass loss, buttheir quiescent mass-loss rates are usually already higher than mdot_nuc.
