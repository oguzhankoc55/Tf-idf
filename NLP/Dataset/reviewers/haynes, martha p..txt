0706.2299	diffuse hi disks in isolated galaxies	in order to investigate the contribution of diffuse components to their totalhi emission, we have obtained high precision hi line flux densities with the100m green bank telescope for a sample of 100 isolated spiral and irregulargalaxies which we have previously observed with the 43m telescope. a comparisonof the observed hi line fluxes obtained with the two different telescopes,characterized by half-power beam widths of 9 arcmin and 21 arcmin respectively,exploits a ``beam matching'' technique to yield a statistical determination ofthe occurrence of diffuse hi components in their disks. a simple model of thehi distribution within a galaxy well describes ~75 % of the sample and accountsfor all of the hi line flux density. the remaining galaxies are approximatelyevenly divided into two categories: ones which appear to possess asignificantly more extensive hi distribution than the model predicts, and onesfor which the hi distribution is more centrally concentrated than predicted.examples of both extremes can be found in the literature but little attentionhas been paid to the centrally concentrated hi systems. our sample hasdemonstrated that galaxies do not commonly possess extended regions of lowsurface brightness hi gas which is not accounted for by our currentunderstanding of the structure of hi disks. eight hi-rich companions to thetarget objects are identified, and a set of extragalactic hi line flux densitycalibrators is presented.

0707.0109	optically unseen hi detections towards the virgo cluster detected in the  arecibo legacy fast alfa survey	we report the discovery by the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey ofeight hi features not coincident with stellar counterparts in the virgo clusterregion. all of the hi clouds have cz &lt; 3000 km/s and, if at the virgo distance,hi masses between 1.9 x 10**7 and 1.1 x 10**9 solar masses. four of the eightobjects were reported or hinted at by previous studies and "rediscovered" byalfalfa. while some clouds appear to be associated with optical galaxies intheir vicinity, others show no clear association with a stellar counterpart.two of them are embedded in relatively dense regions of the cluster and areassociated with m49 and m86; they were previously known. the others are mostlylocated in peripheral regions of the cluster. especially notable are aconcentration of objects towards the so-called m cloud, 3 to 5 degrees to thenw of m87, and a complex of several clouds projected roughly halfway betweenm87 and m49. the object referred to as virgohi21 and proposed to be a "darkgalaxy" is also detected and shown to be a tidal feature associated with ngc4254.

0707.0113	ngc 4254: an act of harassment uncovered by the arecibo legacy fast alfa  survey	we present an hi map constructed from the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa)survey of the surroundings of the strongly asymmetric virgo cluster sc galaxyngc 4254. noted previously for its lopsided appearance, rich interstellarmedium, and extradisk hi emission, ngc 4254 is believed to be entering thevirgo environment for the first time and at high speed. the alfalfa map clearlyshows a long hi tail extending ~250 kpc northward from the galaxy. embedded asone condensation within this hi structure is the object previously identifiedas a "dark galaxy": virgo hi21 (davies et al. 2004). a body of evidenceincluding its location within and velocity with respect to the cluster and theappearance and kinematics of its strong spiral pattern, extra-disk hi andlengthy hi tail is consistent with a picture of "galaxy harassment" as proposedby moore et al. (1996a,b; 1998). the smoothly varying radial velocity fieldalong the tail as it emerges from ngc 4254 can be used as a timing tool, ifinterpreted as resulting from the coupling of the rotation of the disk and thecollective gravitational forces associated with the harassment mechanism.

0911.4195	are newly discovered hi high velocity clouds minihalos in the local  group?	a set of hi sources extracted from the north galactic polar region by theongoing alfalfa survey has properties that are consistent with theinterpretation that they are associated with isolated minihalos in theoutskirts of the local group (lg). unlike objects detected by previous surveys,such as the compact high velocity clouds of braun &amp; burton (1999), the hiclouds found by alfalfa do not violate any structural requirements or haloscaling laws of the lambdacdm structure paradigm, nor would they have beendetected by extant hi surveys of nearby galaxy groups other than the lg. at adistance of d mpc, their hi masses range between $5 x 10^4 d^2 and 10^6 d^2solar and their hi radii between &lt;0.4d and 1.6 d kpc. if they are parts ofgravitationally bound halos, the total masses would be on order of 10^8--10^9solar, their baryonic content would be signifcantly smaller than the cosmicfraction of 0.16 and present in a ionized gas phase of mass well exceeding thatof the neutral phase. this study does not however prove that the minihalointerpretation is unique. among possible alternatives would be that the cloudsare shreds of the leading arm of the magellanic stream.

0912.1610	the galex arecibo sdss survey. i. gas fraction scaling relations of  massive galaxies and first data release	we introduce the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass), an on-going large programthat is gathering high quality hi-line spectra using the arecibo radiotelescope for an unbiased sample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greaterthan 10^10 msun and redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05, selected from the sdssspectroscopic and galex imaging surveys. the galaxies are observed untildetected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5-5%) is reached. this paperpresents the first data release, consisting of ~20% of the final gass sample.we use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of hi gas fractionwith galaxy structure and nuv-r colour. a large fraction (~60%) of the galaxiesin our sample are detected in hi. we find that the atomic gas fractiondecreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and nuv-rcolour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (asmeasured by the concentration index of the r-band light). we also find that thefraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) hi decreasessharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10^8.5 msunkpc^-2. the fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly withstellar mass. one of the key goals of gass is to identify and quantify theincidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-formingcloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. likely transitioncandidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relationsbetween gas fraction and other galaxy properties.

0707.3273	the alfalfa search for (almost) dark galaxies across the hi mass  function	the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey is a second generation blindextragalactic hi survey currently in progess which is exploiting arecibo'ssuperior sensitivity, angular resolution and digital technology to derive acensus of the local hi universe over a cosmologically significant volume. as ofthe time of this meeting, some 4500 good quality extragalactic hi line sourceshave been identified in about 15% of the final survey area. alfalfa isdetecting hi masses as low as 10**6 solar masses and as large as 10**10.8 solarmasses with positional accuracies typically better than 20", allowing immediateidentification of the most probable optical counterparts. only 3% of allextragalactic hi sources and less than 1% of detections with hi mass 10**9.5solar masses cannot be identified with a stellar component. because alfalfa isfar from complete, the discussion here focuses on limitations of past surveysthat alfalfa will overcome because of its greater volume, sensitivity andreduced susceptibility to source confusion and on a sampling of illustrativepreliminary results. first alfalfa results already suggest, in agreement withprevious studies, that there does not appear to be a cosmologically significantpopulation of optically dark but hi rich galaxies. alfalfa promises a wealthydataset for the exploration of many issues in near-field cosmology and galaxyevolution studies, setting the stage for their extension to higher redshifts inthe future with the square kilometer array (ska).

1006.5447	the galex arecibo sdss survey ii: the star formation efficiency of  massive galaxies	we use measurements of the hi content, stellar mass and star formation ratesin ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun, obtainedfrom the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) described in paper i (catinella etal. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with thebin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the hi mass, which we callthe hi-based star formation efficiency (sfe). unlike the mean specific starformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surfacedensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across thesample with a value close to sfe = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gasconsumption timescale of ~3 gyr). specifically, we find little variation in sfewith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, nuv-r color and concentration.we interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedbackmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating starformation in massive galaxies. an investigation into the detailed distributionof sfes reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencieswith sfe &gt; 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to adeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. conversely,we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich fortheir given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both ahigher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formationrate. both of these populations are plausible candidates for "transition"galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in theirspecific star formation rate in the near future. we also find that 36+/-5% ofthe total hi mass density and 47+/-5% of the total sfr density is found ingalaxies with stellar mass greater than 10^10 msun.

0708.2547	hi cosmology in the local universe with alfalfa	the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey is an on-going secondgeneration blind extragalactic hi survey exploiting arecibo's superiorsensitivity, angular resolution and digital technology to conduct a census ofthe local hi universe over a cosmologically significant volume. as of mid-2007,~4500 good quality extragalactic hi line sources have been extracted in ~15% ofthe final survey area. alfalfa is detecting hi masses as low as 10**6 msun andas high as 10**10.8 msun with positional accuracies typically better than 20arcsec, allowing immediate identification of the most probable opticalcounterparts. only 3% of all extragalactic hi sources and fewer than 1% ofdetections with m(hi) &gt; 10**9.5 msun cannot be identified with a stellarcomponent. first alfalfa results already suggest, in agreement with previousstudies, that there does not appear to be a cosmologically significantpopulation of optically dark but hi rich galaxies. alfalfa promises a wealthydataset for the exploration of many issues in near-field cosmology and galaxyevolution studies, setting the stage for their extension to higher redshiftswith the square kilometer array (ska).

1008.5107	the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey: x. the hi mass function and  omega_hi from the 40% alfalfa survey	the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey has completed source extractionfor 40% of its total sky area, resulting in the largest sample of hi-selectedgalaxies to date. we measure the hi mass function from a sample of 10,119galaxies with 6.2 &lt; log (m_hi/m_sun) &lt; 11.0 and with well-described mass errorsthat accurately reflect our knowledge of low-mass systems. we characterize thesurvey sensitivity and its dependence on profile velocity width, the effect oflarge-scale structure, and the impact of radio frequency interference in orderto calculate the himf with both the 1/vmax and 2dswml methods. we also assess aflux-limited sample to test the robustness of the methods applied to the fullsample. these measurements are in excellent agreement with one another; thederived schechter function parameters are phi* = 4.8 (+/- 0.3) * 10^-3, log(m*/m_sun) + 2 log(h_70) = 9.96 (+/- 0.2), and alpha = -1.33 (+/- 0.02). wefind omega_hi = 4.3 (+/- 0.3) * 10^-4, 16% larger than the 2005 hipass result,and our schechter function fit extrapolated to log (m_hi/m_sun) = 11.0 predictsan order of magnitude more galaxies than hipass. the larger values of omega_hiand of m* imply an upward adjustment for estimates of the detection rate offuture large-scale hi line surveys with, e.g., the square kilometer array. acomparison with simulated galaxies from the millennium run and a treatment ofphotoheating as a method of baryon removal from hi-selected halos indicatesthat the disagreement between dark matter mass functions and baryonic massfunctions may soon be resolved.

1009.4309	alfalfa hi data stacking i. does the bulge quench ongoing star formation  in early-type galaxies?	we have carried out an hi stacking analysis of a volume-limited sample of~5000 galaxies with imaging and spectroscopic data from galex and the sloandigital sky survey, which lie within the current footprint of the arecibolegacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. our galaxies are selected to have stellarmasses greater than 10^10 msun and redshifts in the range 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. weextract a sub-sample of 1833 "early-type" galaxies with inclinations less than70deg, with concentration indices c&gt;2.6 and with light profiles that are wellfit by a de vaucouleurs model. we then stack hi line spectra extracted from thealfalfa data cubes at the 3-d positions of the galaxies from these two samplesin bins of stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, central velocitydispersion, and nuv-r colour. we use the stacked spectra to estimate theaverage hi gas fractions m_hi/m_* of the galaxies in each bin.  our main result is that the hi content of a galaxy is not influenced by itsbulge. the average hi gas fractions of galaxies in both our samples correlatemost strongly with nuv-r colour and with stellar surface density. the relationbetween average hi fraction and these two parameters is independent ofconcentration index c. we have tested whether the average hi gas content ofbulge-dominated galaxies on the red sequence, differs from that of late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find no evidence that galaxies with asignificant bulge component are less efficient at turning their available gasreservoirs into stars. this result is in contradiction with the "morphologicalquenching" scenario proposed by martig et al. (2009).

0704.2209	rotational widths for use in the tully-fisher relation. ii. the impact  of surface brightness	using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/orlong-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison betweenvarious estimates of rotational widths. different optical width estimators areconsidered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associatedwith rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surfacebrightness. the best match with hi rotational velocities is obtained withpolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixedfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotationcurve. in contrast with polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measuredat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from hi widths by an amount thatcorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. this bias occursbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases withincreasing disk surface brightness. statistical corrections, parameterized bythe radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce polyexand hi width measurements into a homogeneous system. this yields a singlerobust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of diskscaling relations.

1011.0829	the galex arecibo sdss survey: iii. evidence for the inside-out  formation of galactic disks	we analyze a sample of galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}m_{\odot}$ and with redshifts in the range $0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05$ for which hi massmeasurements are available from the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) or fromthe arecibo legacy fast alfa survey (alfalfa). at a given value of $m_*$, oursample consists primarily of galaxies that are more hi-rich than average. weconstructed a series of three control samples for comparison with these hi-richgalaxies. as expected, hi-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of samestellar mass that are selected without regard to hi content. the majority ofthese differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas arebluer and more actively star-forming. in order to identify those galaxyproperties that are causally connected with hi content, we compare resultsderived for the hi sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellarmass, size and nuv-$r$ colour. the only photometric property that is clearlyattributable to increasing hi content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy.galaxies with larger hi fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outerdisks compared to the inner part of the galaxy. hi-rich galaxies also havelarger $g$-band radii compared to $i$-band radii. our results are consistentwith the "inside-out" picture of disk galaxy formation, which has commonlyserved as a basis for semi-analytic models of the formation of disks in thecontext of cold dark matter cosmologies. the lack of any intrinsic connectionbetween hi fraction and galaxy asymmetry suggests that gas is accreted smoothlyonto the outer disk.

1103.1642	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  i. relations between h2, hi, stellar content and structural properties	we are conducting cold gass, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearbygalaxies. using the iram 30m telescope, we measure the co(1-0) line in a sampleof ~350 nearby (d=100-200 mpc), massive galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10.0). thesample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides anunbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. by combining the iram datawith sdss photometry and spectroscopy, galex imaging and high-quality arecibohi data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars,atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10l* galaxies. in this paper, we present columinosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. theoverall co detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence ofsharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surfacedensity and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurablecold gas component but above which the detection rate of the co line dropssuddenly. the mean molecular gas fraction mh2/m* of the co detections is0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is astrong function of nuv-r colour. through stacking, we set a firm upper limit ofmh2/m*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with nuv-r&gt;5.0. the averagemolecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, withsignificant scatter from one galaxy to the next. the existence of strongdetection thresholds in both the hi and co lines suggests that "quenching"processes have occurred in these systems. intriguingly, atomic gas stronglydominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie abovethese thresholds. this suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still bepossible following the quenching event.

1104.0019	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  ii. the non-universality of the molecular gas depletion timescale	we study the relation between molecular gas and star formation in avolume-limited sample of 222 galaxies from the cold gass survey, withmeasurements of the co(1-0) line from the iram 30m telescope. the galaxies areat redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05 and have stellar masses in the range10.0&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;11.5. the iram measurements are complemented by deep arecibohi observations and homogeneous sdss and galex photometry. a reference samplethat includes both uv and far-ir data is used to calibrate our estimates ofstar formation rates from the seven optical/uv bands. the mean molecular gasdepletion timescale, tdep(h2), for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 gyr,however tdep(h2) increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ~0.5 gyr forgalaxies with stellar masses of 10^10 msun to ~3 gyr for galaxies with massesof a few times 10^11 msun. in contrast, the atomic gas depletion timescaleremains contant at a value of around 3 gyr. this implies that in high massgalaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales are comparable, but inlow mass galaxies, molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly thanatomic gas. the strongest dependences of tdep(h2) are on the stellar mass ofthe galaxy (parameterized as log tdep(h2)= (0.36+/-0.07)(log m* -10.70)+(9.03+/-0.99)), and on the specific star formation rate. a singletdep(h2) versus ssfr relation is able to fit both "normal" star-forminggalaxies in our cold gass sample, as well as more extreme starburst galaxies(lirgs and ulirgs), which have tdep(h2) &lt; 10^8 yr. normal galaxies at z=1-2 aredisplaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the tdep(h2) versusssfr plane and have molecular gas depletion times that are a factor of 3-5times longer at a given value of ssfr due to their significantly larger gasfractions.

1106.0710	the velocity width function of galaxies from the 40% alfalfa survey:  shedding light on the cold dark matter overabundance problem	the ongoing arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey is a wide-area,extragalactic hi-line survey conducted at the arecibo observatory. sources haveso far been extracted over ~3,000 sq.deg of sky (40% of its final area),resulting in the largest hi-selected sample to date. we measure the spacedensity of hi-bearing galaxies as a function of their observed velocity width(uncorrected for inclination) down to w = 20 km/s, a factor of 2 lower than theprevious generation hi parkes all-sky survey. we confirm previous results thatindicate a substantial discrepancy between the observational distribution andthe theoretical one expected in a cold dark matter (cdm) universe, at lowwidths. in particular, a comparison with synthetic galaxy samples populatingstate-of-the-art cdm simulations imply a factor of ~8 difference in theabundance of galaxies with w = 50 km/s (increasing to a factor of ~100 whenextrapolated to the alfalfa limit of w = 20 km/s). we furthermore identifypossible solutions, including a kev warm dark matter scenario and the fact thathi disks in low mass galaxies are usually not extended enough to probe the fullamplitude of the galactic rotation curve. in this latter case, we canstatistically infer the relationship between the measured hi rotationalvelocity of a galaxy and the mass of its host cdm halo. observationalverification of the presented relationship at low velocities would provide animportant test of the validity of the established dark matter model.

1108.4011	the alfalfa hi absorption pilot survey: a wide-area blind damped lyman  alpha system survey of the local universe	we present the results of a pilot survey for neutral hydrogen (hi) 21 cmabsorption in the arecibo legacy fast arecibo l-band feed array (alfalfa)survey. this project is a wide-area "blind" search for hi absorption in thelocal universe, spanning -650 km/s &lt; cz &lt; 17,500 km/s and covering 517.0 squaredegrees (7% of the full alfalfa survey). the survey is sensitive to hiabsorption lines stronger than 7.7 mjy (8983 radio sources) and is 90% completefor lines stronger than 11.0 mjy (7296 sources). the total redshift intervalsensitive to all damped lyman alpha (dla) systems (n_hi &gt;= 2x10^20 cm^-2) isdelta z = 7.0 (129 objects, assuming t_s = 100 k and covering fraction unity);for super-dlas (n_hi &gt;= 2x10^21 cm^-2) it is delta z= 128.2 (2353 objects). were-detect the intrinsic hi absorption line in ugc 6081 but detect nointervening absorption line systems. we compute a 95% confidence upper limit onthe column density frequency distribution function f(n_hi,x) spanning fourorders of magnitude in column density, 10^19 (t_s/100 k)(1/f) cm^-2 &lt; n_hi &lt;10^23 (t_s/100 k)(1/f) cm^-2, that is consistent with previous redshiftedoptical damped ly alpha surveys and the aggregate hi 21 cm emission in thelocal universe. the detection rate is in agreement with extant observations.this pilot survey suggests that an absorption line search of the completealfalfa survey --- or any higher redshift, larger bandwidth, or more sensitivesurvey, such as those planned for square kilometer array pathfinders or a lowfrequency lunar array --- will either make numerous detections or will set astrong statistical lower limit on the typical spin temperature of neutralhydrogen gas.

1110.4226	the galex arecibo sdss survey. iv. baryonic mass-velocity-size relations  of massive galaxies	we present dynamical scaling relations for a homogeneous and representativesample of ~500 massive galaxies, selected only by stellar mass (&gt;10^10 msun)and redshift (0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05) as part of the ongoing galex arecibo sdss survey.we compare baryonic tully-fisher (btf) and faber-jackson (bfj) relations forthis sample, and investigate how galaxies scatter around the best fits obtainedfor pruned subsets of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated systems. the bfjrelation is significantly less scattered than the btf when the relations areapplied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclinationproblems that plague the btf. disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematicallydeviate from the bfj relation defined by the spheroids. we demonstrate that byapplying a simple correction to the stellar velocity dispersions that dependsonly on the concentration index of the galaxy, we are able to bring disks andspheroids onto the same dynamical relation -- in other words, we obtain ageneralized bfj relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample,regardless of morphology, inclination or gas content, and has a scatter smallerthan 0.1 dex. we find that disks and spheroids are offset in the stellardispersion-size relation, and that the offset is removed when correcteddispersions are used instead. the generalized bfj relation represents afundamental correlation between the global dark matter and baryonic content ofgalaxies, which is obeyed by all (massive) systems regardless of morphology.[abridged]

1202.6005	the clustering characteristics of hi-selected galaxies from the 40%  alfalfa survey	the 40% arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey catalog (\alpha.40) ofapproximately 10,150 hi-selected galaxies is used to analyze the clusteringproperties of gas-rich galaxies. by employing the landy-szalay estimator and afull covariance analysis for the two-point galaxy-galaxy correlation function,we obtain the real-space correlation function and model it as a power law,\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^(-\gamma), on scales less than 10 h^{-1} mpc. as the largestsample of blindly hi-selected galaxies to date, \alpha.40 provides detailedunderstanding of the clustering of this population. we find \gamma = 1.51 +/-0.09 and r_0 = 3.3 +0.3, -0.2 h^{-1} mpc, reinforcing the understanding thatgas-rich galaxies represent the most weakly clustered galaxy population known;we also observe a departure from a pure power law shape at intermediate scales,as predicted in \lambda cdm halo occupation distribution models. furthermore,we measure the bias parameter for the \alpha.40 galaxy sample and find that higalaxies are severely antibiased on small scales, but only weakly antibiased onlarge scales. the robust measurement of the correlation function for gas-richgalaxies obtained via the \alpha.40 sample constrains models of thedistribution of hi in simulated galaxies, and will be employed to betterunderstand the role of gas in environmentally-dependent galaxy evolution.

0711.0545	the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey: v. hi source catalog of the  anti-virgo region at dec=27 degrees	we present a second catalog of hi sources detected in the arecibo legacy fastalfa survey. we report 488 detections over 135 square degrees, within theregion of the sky having 22h&lt;ra&lt;03h and +26deg&lt;dec&lt;+28deg. we present here thedetections that have either (a) s/n&gt;6.5, where the reliability of the catalogis better than 95% or (b) 5.0&lt;s/n&lt;6.5 and a previously measured redshift thatcorroborates our detection. of the 488 objects presented here, 49 are highvelocity clouds or clumps thereof with negative heliocentric recessionvelocities. these clouds are mostly very compact and isolated, while some ofthem are associated with large features such as wright's cloud or the northernextension of the magellanic stream. the remaining 439 candidate detections areidentified as extragalactic objects and have all been matched with opticalcounterparts. five of the six galaxies detected with m(hi)&lt;10^7.5 solar massesare satellites of either the ngc672/ic1727 nearby galaxy pair or theirneighboring dwarf irregular galaxy ngc784. the data of this catalog releaseinclude a slice through the pisces-perseus foreground void, a large nearbyunderdensity of galaxies. we report no detections within the void, where ourcatalog is complete for systems with hi masses of 10^8 solar masses. gas-rich,optically-dark galaxies do not seem to constitute an important void population,and therefore do not suffice at producing a viable solution to the voidphenomenon.

1205.5271	galaxy zoo and alfalfa: atomic gas and the regulation of star formation  in barred disc galaxies	we study the observed correlation between atomic gas content and thelikelihood of hosting a large scale bar in a sample of 2090 disc galaxies. sucha test has never been done before on this scale. we use data on morphologiesfrom the galaxy zoo project and information on the galaxies' hi content fromthe alfalfa blind hi survey. our main result is that the bar fraction issignificantly lower among gas rich disc galaxies than gas poor ones. this isnot explained by known trends for more massive (stellar) and redder discgalaxies to host more bars and have lower gas fractions: we still see at fixedstellar mass a residual correlation between gas content and bar fraction. wediscuss three possible causal explanations: (1) bars in disc galaxies causeatomic gas to be used up more quickly, (2) increasing the atomic gas content ina disc galaxy inhibits bar formation, and (3) bar fraction and gas content areboth driven by correlation with environmental effects (e.g. tidal triggering ofbars, combined with strangulation removing gas). all three explanations areconsistent with the observed correlations. in addition our observations suggestbars may reduce or halt star formation in the outer parts of discs by holdingback the infall of external gas beyond bar co-rotation, reddening the globalcolours of barred disc galaxies. this suggests that secular evolution driven bythe exchange of angular momentum between stars in the bar, and gas in the disc,acts as a feedback mechanism to regulate star formation in intermediate massdisc galaxies.

1206.0061	halpha3: halpha imaging survey of hi selected galaxies from alfalfa	we present halpha3 (acronym for halpha-alpha-alpha), an halpha narrow-bandimaging survey of ~400 galaxies selected from the hi arecibo legacy fast alfasurvey (alfalfa) in the local supercluster, including the virgo cluster. byusing hydrogen recombination lines as a tracer of recent star formation, we aimto investigate the relationships between atomic neutral gas and newly formedstars in different environments (cluster and field), morphological types(spirals and dwarfs), and over a wide range of stellar masses (~10^7.5-10^11.5msun). we image in halpha+[nii] all the galaxies that contain more than 10^7msun of neutral atomic hydrogen in the sky region 11^h &lt; r.a. &lt;16^h 4^o &lt; dec.&lt;16^o; 350&lt; cz &lt;2000 km/s using the san pedro martir 2m telescope. this surveyprovides a complete census of the star formation in hi rich galaxies of thelocal universe. we present the properties of the galaxy sample, together withhalpha fluxes and equivalent widths. we find an excellent agreement between thefluxes determined from our images in apertures of 3 arcsec diameter and thefluxes derived from the sdss spectral database. from the halpha fluxescorrected for galactic and internal extinction and for [nii] contamination wederive the global star formation rates (sfrs).

1207.0523	the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey: the galaxy population detected by  alfalfa	making use of hi 21 cm line measurements from the alfalfa survey (alpha.40)and photometry from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and galex, weinvestigate the global scaling relations and fundamental planes linking starsand gas for a sample of 9417 common galaxies: the alpha.40-sdss-galex sample.in addition to their hi properties derived from the alfalfa dataset, stellarmasses (m_*) and star formation rates (sfrs) are derived from fitting theuv-optical spectral energy distributions. 96% of the alpha.40-sdss-galexgalaxies belong to the blue cloud, with the average gas fraction f_hi =m_hi/m_* ~ 1.5. a transition in sf properties is found whereby below m_* ~10^9.5 m_sun, the slope of the star forming sequence changes, the dispersion inthe specific star formation rate (ssfr) distribution increases and the starformation efficiency (sfe) mildly increases with m_*. the evolutionary track inthe ssfr-m_* diagram, as well as that in the color magnitude diagram are linkedto the hi content; below this transition mass, the star formation is regulatedstrongly by the hi. comparison of hi- and optically-selected samples over thesame restricted volume shows that the hi-selected population is less evolvedand has overall higher sfr and ssfr at a given stellar mass, but lower sfe andextinction, suggesting either that a bottleneck exists in the hi to h_2conversion, or that the process of sf in the very hi-dominated galaxies obeysan unusual, low efficiency star formation law. a trend is found that, for agiven stellar mass, high gas fraction galaxies reside preferentially in darkmatter halos with high spin parameters. because it represents a full census ofhi-bearing galaxies at z~0, the scaling relations and fundamental planesderived for the alfalfa population can be used to assess the hi detection rateby future blind hi surveys and intensity mapping experiments at higherredshift.

1208.5229	a direct measurement of the baryonic mass function of galaxies &amp;  implications for the galactic baryon fraction	we use both an hi-selected and an optically-selected galaxy sample todirectly measure the abundance of galaxies as a function of their "baryonic"mass (stars + atomic gas). stellar masses are calculated based on optical datafrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and atomic gas masses are calculatedusing atomic hydrogen (hi) emission line data from the arecibo legacy fast alfa(alfalfa) survey. by using the technique of abundance matching, we combine themeasured baryonic function (bmf) of galaxies with the dark matter halo massfunction in a lcdm universe, in order to determine the galactic baryon fractionas a function of host halo mass. we find that the baryon fraction of low-masshalos is much smaller than the cosmic value, even when atomic gas is taken intoaccount. we find that the galactic baryon deficit increases monotonically withdecreasing halo mass, in contrast with previous studies which suggested anapproximately constant baryon fraction at the low-mass end. we argue that theobserved baryon fractions of low mass halos cannot be explained by reionizationheating alone, and that additional feedback mechanisms (e.g. supernova blowout)must be invoked. however, the outflow rates needed to reproduce our result arenot easily accommodated in the standard picture of galaxy formation in a lcdmuniverse.

1209.2003	alfalfa hi data stacking iii. comparison of environmental trends in hi  gas mass fraction and specific star formation rate	it is well known that both the star formation rate and the cold gas contentof a galaxy depend on the local density out to distances of a few megaparsecs.in this paper, we compare the environmental density dependence of the atomicgas mass fractions of nearby galaxies with the density dependence of theircentral and global specific star formation rates. we stack hi line spectraextracted from the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey centered on galaxies with uvimaging from galex and optical imaging/spectroscopy from sdss. we use thesestacked spectra to evaluate the mean atomic gas mass fraction of galaxies inbins of stellar mass and local density. for galaxies with stellar masses lessthan 10^10.5 m_sun, the decline in mean atomic gas mass fraction with densityis stronger than the decline in mean global and central specific star formationrate. the same conclusion does not hold for more massive galaxies. we interpretour results as evidence for ram-pressure stripping of atomic gas from the outerdisks of low mass satellite galaxies. we compare our results with thesemi-analytic recipes of guo et al. (2011) implemented on the millennium iisimulation. these models assume that only the diffuse gas surrounding satellitegalaxies is stripped, a process that is often termed "strangulation". we showthat these models predict relative trends in atomic gas and star formation thatare in disagreement with observations. we use mock catalogues generated fromthe simulation to predict the halo masses of the hi-deficient galaxies in oursample. we conclude that ram-pressure stripping is likely to become effectivein dark matter halos with masses greater than 10^13 m_sun.

1209.3519	pre-existing dwarfs, tidal knots and a tidal dwarf galaxy: an unbiased  hi study of the gas-rich interacting galaxy group ngc 3166/9	we present arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) and follow-up giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) hi observations of the gas-rich interacting group ngc3166/9. the sensitive alfalfa data provide a complete census of hi-bearingsystems in the group while the high-resolution gmrt data elucidate theirorigin, enabling one of the first unbiased physical studies of gas-rich dwarfcompanions and the subsequent identification of second generation, tidal dwarfgalaxies in a nearby group. the alfalfa maps reveal an extended hi envelopearound the ngc 3166/9 group core, which we mosaic at higher resolution usingsix gmrt pointings spanning ~1 square degree. a thorough search of the gmrtdatacube reveals eight low-mass objects with gas masses ranging from 4x10^7 to3x10^8 m_sol and total dynamical masses up to 1.4x10^9 m_sol. a comparison ofthe hi fluxes measured from the gmrt data to those measured in the alfalfa datasuggests that a significant fraction (~60%) of the hi is smoothly distributedon scales greater than an arcminute (~7 kpc at the ngc 3166/9 distance). wecompute stellar masses and star formation rates for the eight low-mass gmrtdetections, using ancillary sdss and galex data, and use these values toconstrain their origin. most of the detections are likely to be eitherpre-existing dwarf irregular galaxies or short-lived, tidally formed knots;however, one candidate, agc 208457, is clearly associated with a tidal tailextending below ngc 3166, exhibits a dynamical to gas mass ratio close to unityand has a stellar content and star formation rate that are broadly consistentwith both simulated as well as candidate tidal dwarf galaxies from theliterature. our observations therefore strongly suggest that agc 208457 is atidal dwarf galaxy.

1303.0840	halpha3: an halpha imaging survey of hi selected galaxies from alfalfa.  iv. structure of galaxies in the local and coma superclusters	we present the analysis of the galaxy structural parameters from halpha3, anhalpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey of ~800 galaxies selected from thehi alfalfa survey in the local and coma superclusters. taking advantage ofhalpha3 which provides the complete census of the recent star-forming, hi-richgalaxies in the local universe, we aim to investigate the structural parametersof both the young (&lt;10 myr) and the old (&gt;1 gyr) stellar populations. bycomparing the sizes of these stellar components we investigated the spatialscale on which galaxies are growing at the present cosmological epoch and therole of the environment in quenching the star-formation activity. we computedthe concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness structural parameters. to quantifythe sizes we computed half-light radii and a new parameter dubbed ew/r. theconcentration index computed in the r band depends on the stellar mass and onthe hubble type, these variables being related since most massive galaxies arebulge dominated thus most concentrated. going toward later spirals andirregulars both the concentration index and the stellar mass decrease. bluecompact dwarfs represent an exception since they have similar stellar mass butthey are more concentrated than dwarf irregulars. the asymmetry and theclumpiness increase along the spiral sequence then they decrease going into thedwarf regime, where the light distribution is smooth and more symmetric. whenmeasured on halpha images, the cas parameters do not exhibit obviouscorrelations with hubble type. we found that the concentration index is themain parameter that describes the current growth of isolated galaxies but, fora fixed concentration, the stellar mass plays a second order role. at thepresent epoch, massive galaxies are growing inside-out, conversely the dwarfsare growing on the scale of their already assembled mass.

1303.2374	halpha3: an halpha imaging survey of hi selected galaxies from alfalfa.  iii. nurture shapes up the hubble sequence in the great wall	we present the analysis of halpha3, an halpha imaging survey of galaxiesselected from the hi alfalfa survey in the coma supercluster. by using thehalpha line as a tracer of the "instantaneous" star formation, complementedwith optical colors from sdss we explore the hypothesis that a morphologicalsequence of galaxies of progressively earlier type, lower gas-content exists inthe neighborhood of the coma cluster, with specific star formation activitydecreasing with increasing local galaxy density and velocity dispersion. in thedwarf regime (8.5&lt;\log(m*)&lt; 9.5) we identify a 4-step sequence of galaxies withprogressively redder colors, i.e. of decreasing specific star formation, from(1) hi-rich late-type galaxies belonging to the blue-cloud exhibiting extendedplus nuclear star formation, (2) hi-poor ltgs with nuclear star formation only,(3) hi-poor galaxies with no star formation either extended or nuclear, butwith nuclear post-star-burst signature,(4) early-type galaxies in thered-sequence, with no gas or star formation on all scales. along this sequencethe quenching of the star formation proceeds radially outside-in. theprogression toward redder colors found along this "morphological" (gas content)sequence is comparable to the one obtained increasing the local galaxy density,from the cosmic filaments (1,2), to the rich clusters (2,3,4). in the dwarfregime we find evidence for evolution of hi-rich ltgs into etgs, passingthrough hi-poor and psb galaxies, driven by the environment. we identifyram-pressure as the mechanism most likely responsible for this transformation.we conclude that infall of low-mass galaxies has proceeded for the last 7.5 gyrbuilding up the coma cluster at a rate of approximately 100 galaxies per gyr.

1303.2846	halpha3: an halpha imaging survey of hi selected galaxies from alfalfa.  ii. the star formation properties of galaxies in the virgo cluster and  surroundings	we present the analysis of halpha3, an halpha imaging survey of 409 galaxiesselected from the hi arecibo alfalfa survey in the local supercluster,including the virgo cluster. we explore the relations between the stellar mass,the hi mass and the current, massive sfr of nearby galaxies in the virgocluster and we compare them with those of isolated galaxies in the localsupercluster, disentangling the role of the environment in shaping the starformation properties of galaxies at the present cosmological epoch. weinvestigate the relationships between atomic neutral gas and newly formed starsin different environments, across many morphological types, and over a widerange of stellar masses adopting an updated calibration of the hi deficiencyparameter. studying the mean properties of late-type galaxies in the localsupercluster, we find that galaxies in increasing local galaxy densityconditions (or decreasing projected angular separation from m87) show asignificant decrease in the hi content and in the mean specific star formationrate, along with a progressive reddening of their stellar populations. thegradual quenching of the star formation occurs outside-in, consistently withthe predictions of the ram pressure model. once considered as a whole, thevirgo cluster is effective in removing neutral hydrogen from galaxies, and thisperturbation is strong enough to appreciably reduce the sfr of its entiregalaxy population. an estimate of the present infall rate of 300-400 galaxiesper gyr in the virgo cluster is obtained from the number of existing hi-richlate-type systems, assuming 200-300 myr as the time scale for hi ablation. ifthe infall process has been acting at constant rate this would imply that thevirgo cluster has formed approximately 2 gyr ago, consistently with the ideathat virgo is in a young state of dynamical evolution.

1303.6967	a catalog of ultra-compact high velocity clouds from the alfalfa survey:  local group galaxy candidates?	we present a catalog of 59 ultra-compact high velocity clouds (uchvcs)extracted from the 40% complete alfalfa hi-line survey. the alfalfa uchvcs havemedian flux densities of 1.34 jy km/s, median angular diameters of 10', andmedian velocity widths of 23 km/s. we show that the full uchvc populationcannot easily be associated with known populations of high velocity clouds. ofthe 59 clouds presented here, only 11 are also present in the compact cloudcatalog extracted from the commensal galfa-hi survey, demonstrating the utilityof this separate dataset and analysis. based on their sky distribution andobserved properties, we infer that the alfalfa uchvcs are consistent with thehypothesis that they may be very low mass galaxies within the local volume. inthat case, most of their baryons would be in the form of gas, and because oftheir low stellar content, they remain unidentified by extant optical surveys.at distances of ~1 mpc, the uchvcs have neutral hydrogen (hi) masses of ~10^5-10^6 m_sun, hi diameters of ~2-3 kpc, and indicative dynamical masses withinthe hi extent of ~10^7 - 10^8 m_sun, similar to the local group ultra-faintdwarf leo t. the recent alfalfa discovery of the star-forming, metal-poor, lowmass galaxy leo p demonstrates that this hypothesis is true in at least onecase. in the case of the individual uchvcs presented here, confirmation oftheir extragalactic nature will require further work, such as theidentification of an optical counterpart to constrain their distance.

1305.0272	alfalfa discovery of the nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy leo p. i. hi  observations	the discovery of a previously unknown 21cm hi line source identified as anultra-compact high velocity cloud in the alfalfa survey is reported. the hidetection is barely resolved by the arecibo 305m telescope ~4' beam and has anarrow hi linewidth (hpfw of 24 km/s). further hi observations at arecibo andwith the vla corroborate the alfalfa hi detection, provide an estimate of thehi radius, ~1' at the 5 x 10^19 cm^-2 isophote, and show the cloud to exhibitrotation with an amplitude of ~9.0 +/- 1.5 km/s. in other papers, rhode et al.(2013) show the hi source to have a resolved stellar counterpart and ongoingstar forming activity, while skillman et al. (2013) reveal it as havingextremely low metallicity: 12 + log(o/h) = 7.16 +/- 0.04. the hi mass tostellar mass ratio of the object is found to be 2.6. we use the tully-fishertemplate relation in its baryonic form (mcgaugh 2012) to obtain a distanceestimate d = 1.3 (+0.9,-0.5) mpc. additional constraints on the distance arealso provided by the optical data of rhode et al. (2013) and mcquinn et al.(private communication), both indicating a distance in the range of 1.5 to 2.0mpc. the three estimates are compatible within their errors. the object appearsto be located beyond the dynamical boundaries of, but still in close proximityto the local group. its pristine properties are consistent with the sedateenvironment of its location. at a nominal distance of 1.75 mpc, it would havean hi mass of ~1.0 x 10^6 msun, a stellar mass of ~3.6 x 10^5 msun, and adynamical mass within the hi radius of ~1.5 x 10^7 msun. this discoverysupports the idea that optically faint - or altogether dark - low mass halosmay be detectable through their non-stellar baryons.

1308.2661	the clustering of alfalfa galaxies: dependence on hi mass, relationship  to optical samples &amp; clues on host halo properties	we use a sample of ~6000 galaxies detected by the arecibo legacy fast alfa(alfalfa) 21cm survey, to measure the clustering properties of hi-selectedgalaxies. we find no convincing evidence for a dependence of clustering on thegalactic atomic hydrogen (hi) mass, over the range m_hi ~ 10^{8.5} - 10^{10.5}m_sun. we show that previously reported results of weaker clustering for low-himass galaxies are probably due to finite-volume effects. in addition, wecompare the clustering of alfalfa galaxies with optically selected samplesdrawn from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that hi-selectedgalaxies cluster more weakly than even relatively optically faint galaxies,when no color selection is applied. conversely, when sdss galaxies are splitbased on their color, we find that the correlation function of blue opticalgalaxies is practically indistinguishable from that of hi-selected galaxies. atthe same time, sdss galaxies with red colors are found to cluster significantlymore than hi-selected galaxies, a fact that is evident in both the projected aswell as the full two-dimensional correlation function. a cross-correlationanalysis further reveals that gas-rich galaxies "avoid" being located within ~3mpc of optical galaxies with red colors. next, we consider the clusteringproperties of halo samples selected from the bolshoi lambdacdm simulation. acomparison with the clustering of alfalfa galaxies suggests that galactic himass is not tightly related to host halo mass, and that a sizable fraction ofsubhalos do not host hi galaxies. lastly, we find that we can recover fairlywell the correlation function of hi galaxies by just excluding halos with lowspin parameter. this finding lends support to the hypothesis that halo spinplays a key role in determining the gas content of galaxies.

1404.5298	alfalfa discovery of the nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy leo p. v. neutral  gas dynamics and kinematics	we present new hi spectral line imaging of the extremely metal-poor,star-forming dwarf irregular galaxy leo p. our hi images probe the globalneutral gas properties and the local conditions of the interstellar medium(ism). the hi morphology is slightly elongated along the optical major-axis. wedo not find obvious signatures of interaction or infalling gas at large spatialscales. the neutral gas disk shows obvious rotation, although the velocitydispersion is comparable to the rotation velocity. the rotation amplitude isestimated to be v_c = 15 +/- 5 km/s. within the hi radius probed by theseobservations, the mass ratio of gas to stars is roughly 2:1, while the ratio ofthe total mass to the baryonic mass is ~15:1. we use this information to placeleo p on the baryonic tully-fisher relation, testing the baryonic content ofcosmic structures in a sparsely populated portion of parameter space that hashitherto been occupied primarily by dwarf spheroidal galaxies. we detect thesignature of two temperature components in the neutral ism of leo p; the coldand warm components have characteristic velocity widths of 4.2 +/- 0.9 km/s and10.1 +/- 1.2 km/s, corresponding to kinetic temperatures of ~1100 k and ~6200k, respectively. the cold hi component is unresolved at a physical resolutionof 200 pc. the highest hi surface densities are observed in close physicalproximity to the single hii region. a comparison of the neutral gas propertiesof leo p with other extremely metal-deficient (xmd) galaxies reveals that leo phas the lowest neutral gas mass of any known xmd, and that the dynamical massof leo p is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than any known xmd withcomparable metallicity.

1407.4665	is there a "too big to fail" problem in the field?	we use the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) 21cm survey to measure thenumber density of galaxies as a function of their rotational velocity,$v_\mathrm{rot,hi}$ (as inferred from the width of their 21cm emission line).based on the measured velocity function we statistically connect galaxies withtheir host halo, via abundance matching. in a lambda cold dark matter($\lambda$cdm) cosmology, dwarf galaxies are expected to be hosted by halosthat are significantly more massive than indicated by the measured galacticvelocity; if smaller halos were allowed to host galaxies, then alfalfa wouldmeasure a much higher galactic number density. we then seek observationalverification of this predicted trend by analyzing the kinematics of aliterature sample of gas-rich dwarf galaxies. we find that galaxies with$v_\mathrm{rot,hi} \lesssim 25$ $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ arekinematically incompatible with their predicted $\lambda$cdm host halos, in thesense that hosts are too massive to be accommodated within the measuredgalactic rotation curves. this issue is analogous to the "too big to fail"problem faced by the bright satellites of the milky way, but here it concernsextreme dwarf galaxies in the field. consequently, solutions based onsatellite-specific processes are not applicable in this context. our resultconfirms the findings of previous studies based on optical survey data andaddresses a number of observational systematics present in these works.furthermore, we point out the assumptions and uncertainties that could stronglyaffect our conclusions. we show that the two most important among them -namelybaryonic effects on the abundances of halos and on the rotation curves ofhalos- do not seem capable of resolving the reported discrepancy.

1407.7538	highmass -- high hi mass, hi-rich galaxies at z~0: sample definition,  optical and halpha imaging, and star formation properties	we present first results of the study of a set of exceptional hi sourcesidentified in the 40% alfalfa extragalactic hi survey catalog alpha.40 as beingboth hi massive (m_hi &gt; 10^10 msun) and having high gas fractions for theirstellar masses: the highmass galaxy sample. we analyze uv- andoptical-broadband and halpha images to understand the nature of theirrelatively underluminous disks in optical and to test whether their high gasfractions can be tracked to higher dark matter halo spin parameters or late gasaccretion. estimates of their star formation rates (sfrs) based on sed-fittingagree within uncertainties with the halpha luminosity inferred sfrs. the hiiregion luminosity functions have standard slopes at the luminous end. theglobal sfrs demonstrate that the highmass galaxies exhibit active ongoing starformation (sf) with moderate sf efficiency, but relative to normal spirals, alower integrated sfr in the past. because the sf activity in these systems isspread throughout their extended disks, they have overall lower sfr surfacedensities and lower surface brightness in the optical bands. relative to normaldisk galaxies, the majority of highmass galaxies have higher halpha equivalentwidths and are bluer in their outer disks, implying an inside-out disk growthscenario. downbending double exponential disks are more frequent than upbendingdisks among the gas-rich galaxies, suggesting that sf thresholds exist in thedownbending disks, probably as a result of concentrated gas distribution.

1408.3392	the hi mass function and velocity width function of void galaxies in the  arecibo legacy fast alfa survey	we measure the hi mass function (himf) and velocity width function (wf)across environments over a range of masses $7.2&lt;\log(m_{hi}/m_{\odot})&lt;10.8$,and profile widths $1.3\log(km/s)&lt;\log(w)&lt;2.9\log(km/s)$, using a catalog of~7,300 hi-selected galaxies from the alfalfa survey, located in the region ofsky where alfalfa and sdss (data release 7) north overlap. we divide our galaxysample into those that reside in large-scale voids (void galaxies) and thosethat live in denser regions (wall galaxies). we find the void himf to be wellfit by a schechter function with normalization$\phi^*=(1.37\pm0.1)\times10^{-2} h^3mpc^{-3}$, characteristic mass$\log(m^*/m_{\odot})+2\log h_{70}=9.86\pm0.02$, and low-mass-end slope$\alpha=-1.29\pm0.02$. similarly, for wall galaxies, we find best-fittingparameters $\phi^*=(1.82\pm0.03)\times10^{-2} h^3mpc^{-3}$,$\log(m^*/m_{\odot})+2\log h_{70}=10.00\pm0.01$, and $\alpha=-1.35\pm0.01$. weconclude that void galaxies typically have slightly lower hi masses than theirnon-void counterparts, which is in agreement with the dark matter halo massfunction shift in voids assuming a simple relationship between dm mass and himass. we also find that the low-mass slope of the void himf is similar to thatof the wall himf suggesting that there is either no excess of low-mass galaxiesin voids or there is an abundance of intermediate hi mass galaxies. we fit amodified schechter function to the alfalfa void wf and determine itsbest-fitting parameters to be $\phi^*=0.21\pm0.1 h^3mpc^{-3}$,$\log(w^*)=2.13\pm0.3$, $\alpha=0.52\pm0.5$ and high-width slope$\beta=1.3\pm0.4$. for wall galaxies, the wf parameters are:$\phi^*=0.022\pm0.009 h^3mpc^{-3}$, $\log(w^*)=2.62\pm0.5$,$\alpha=-0.64\pm0.2$ and $\beta=3.58\pm1.5$. because of large uncertainties onthe void and wall width functions, we cannot conclude whether the wf isdependent on the environment.

1501.07313	characterizing the star formation of the low-mass shield galaxies from  hubble space telescope imaging	the survey of hi in extremely low-mass dwarfs (shield) is an on-goingmulti-wavelength program to characterize the gas, star formation, and evolutionin gas-rich, very low-mass galaxies that populate the faint end of the galaxyluminosity function. the galaxies were selected from the first ~10% of the hialfalfa survey based on their low hi mass and low baryonic mass. here, wemeasure the star-formation properties from optically resolved stellarpopulations for 12 galaxies using a color-magnitude diagram fitting technique.we derive lifetime average star-formation rates (sfrs), recent sfrs, stellarmasses, and gas fractions. overall, the recent sfrs are comparable to thelifetime sfrs with mean birthrate parameter of 1.4, with a surprisingly narrowstandard deviation of 0.7. two galaxies are classified as dwarf transitiongalaxies (dtrans). these dtrans systems have star-formation and gas propertiesconsistent with the rest of the sample, in agreement with previous results thatsome dtrans galaxies may simply be low-luminosity dirrs. we do not find acorrelation between the recent star-formation activity and the distance to thenearest neighboring galaxy, suggesting that the star-formation process is notdriven by gravitational interactions, but regulated internally. further, wefind a broadening in the star-formation and gas properties (i.e., specificsfrs, stellar masses, and gas fractions) compared to the generally tightcorrelation found in more massive galaxies. overall, the star-formation and gasproperties indicate these very low-mass galaxies host a fluctuating,non-deterministic, and inefficient star-formation process.

1502.07359	spectroscopic confusion: its impact on current and future extragalactic  hi surveys	we present a comprehensive model to predict the rate of spectroscopicconfusion in hi surveys, and demonstrate good agreement with the observableconfusion in existing surveys. generically the action of confusion on the himass function was found to be a suppression of the number count of sourcesbelow the `knee', and an enhancement above it. this results in a bias, wherebythe `knee' mass is increased and the faint end slope is steepened. for alfalfaand hipass we find that the maximum impact this bias can have on the schechterfit parameters is similar in magnitude to the published random errors. on theother hand, the impact of confusion on the hi mass functions of upcoming mediumdepth interferometric surveys, will be below the level of the random errors. inaddition, we find that previous estimates of the number of detections forupcoming surveys with ska-precursor telescopes may have been too optimistic, asthe framework implemented here results in number counts between 60% and 75% ofthose previously predicted, while accurately reproducing the counts of existingsurveys. finally, we argue that any future single dish, wide area surveys of higalaxies would be best suited to focus on deep observations of the localuniverse (z &lt; 0.05), as confusion may prevent them from being competitive withinterferometric surveys at higher redshift, while their lower angularresolution allows their completeness to be more easily calibrated for nearbyextended sources.

(1996) to showcounterrotating stellar components. the multiwavelength evidence is interpretedin terms of the kinematic "memory" of past minor mergers in objects thatotherwise exhibit no morphological signs of interaction.

astro-ph;0005200	gravitational lensing by nearby clusters of galaxies	we present an estimation of the expected number of arcs and arclets in asample of nearby (z&lt;0.1) clusters of galaxies, that takes into account themagnitude limit of the objects as well as seeing effects. we show that stronglensing effects are not common, but also they are not as rare as usuallystated. indeed, for a given cluster, they present a strong dependence with themagnitude limit adopted in the analysis and the seeing of the observations. wealso describe the procedures and results of a search for lensing effects in asample of 33 clusters spanning the redshift range of 0.014 to 0.076,representative of the local cluster distribution. this search produced two arccandidates. the first one is in a3408 (z=0.042), the same arc previouslydiscovered by campusano &amp; hardy (1996), with z=0.073 and associated to thebrightest cluster galaxy. the second candidate is in the cluster a3266(z=0.059) and is near a bright elliptical outside the cluster center, requiringthe presence of a very massive sub-structure around this galaxy to be producedby gravitational lensing.

astro-ph;0007402	the hi content of spirals. ii. gas deficiency in cluster galaxies	we derive the atomic hydrogen content for a total of 1900 spirals in thefields of eighteen nearby clusters. by comparing the hi deficiencydistributions of the galaxies inside of and outside of one abell radius of eachcluster, we find that two thirds of the clusters in our sample show a dearth ofneutral gas in their interiors. possible connections between the gaseousdeficiency and the characteristics of both the underlying galaxies and theirenvironment are investigated in order to gain insight into the mechanismsresponsible for hi depletion. while we do not find a statistically significantvariation of the fraction of hi-deficient spirals in a cluster with its globalproperties, a number of correlations emerge that argue in favor of theinterplay between spiral disks and their environment. in the clusters in whichneutral gas deficiency is pronounced, we see clear indications that the degreeof hi depletion is related to the morphology of the galaxies and not to theiroptical size: early-type and, probably, dwarf spirals are more easily emptiedof gas than the intermediate sbc--sc types. the wealth of 21-cm data collectedfor the virgo region has made it possible to study the 2d pattern of hideficiency in that cluster. we also find evidence that gas-poor spirals inhi-deficient clusters move on orbits more radial than those of the gas-richobjects. the implications of all these results on models of how galaxiesinteract with their environment are reviewed. hydrodynamic effects appear asthe most plausible cause of hi removal.

0808.1180	a pilot survey of hi in field galaxies at redshift z~0.2	we present the first results of a targeted survey carried out with the 305 marecibo telescope to detect hi-line emission from galaxies at redshift z&gt;0.16.the targets, selected from the sloan digital sky survey database, arenon-interacting disk galaxies in relatively isolated fields. we present herethe hi spectra and derived hi parameters for ten objects detected in this pilotprogram. all are massive disk galaxies in the redshift interval 0.17-0.25 (i.e.2-3 gyr look-back time), with hi masses m_hi=3-8 x 10^10 msun and high gas massfractions (hi - to - stellar mass ratios ~10-30%). our results demonstrate theefficacy of exploiting arecibo's large collecting area to measure the hi massand rotational velocity of galaxies above redshift z=0.2. in particular, thissample includes the highest redshift detections of hi emission from individualgalaxies made to date. extension of this pilot program will allow us to studythe hi properties of field galaxies at cosmological distances, thuscomplementing ongoing radio synthesis observations of cluster samples at z~0.2.

astro-ph;0012388	signatures of galaxy-cluster interactions: spiral galaxy rotation curve  asymmetry, shape, and extent	the environmental dependencies of the characteristics of spiral galaxyrotation curves are studied in this work. we use our large, homogeneouslycollected sample of 510 cluster spiral galaxy rotation curves to test the claimthat the shape of a galaxy's rotation curve strongly depends on its locationwithin the cluster, and thus presumably on the strength of the localintracluster medium and on the frequency and strength of tidal interactionswith the cluster and cluster galaxies. our data do not corroborate such ascenario, consistent with the fact that tully-fisher residuals are independentof galaxy location within the cluster; while the average late-type spiralgalaxy shows more rise in the outer parts of its rotation curve than does thetypical early-type spiral galaxy, there is no apparent trend for either subsetwith cluster environment. we also investigate as a function of clusterenvironment rotation curve asymmetry and the radial distribution of h ii regiontracers within galactic disks. mild trends with projected cluster-centricdistance are observed: (i) the (normalized) radial extent of optical lineemission averaged over all spiral galaxy types shows a 4%+/-2% increase per mpcof galaxy-cluster core separation, and (ii) rotation curve asymmetry falls by afactor of two between the inner and outer cluster for early-type spirals (anegligible decrease is found for late-type spirals). such trends are consistentwith spiral disk perturbations or even the stripping of the diffuse, outermostgaseous regions within the disks as galaxies pass through the dense clustercores.

astro-ph;0304398	internal extinction in spiral galaxies in the near infrared	in order to study the effects of internal extinction in spiral galaxies wesearch for correlations of near infrared (nir) photometric parameters withinclination. we use data from the 2 micron all-sky survey (2mass) extendedsource catalog (xsc) on 15,224 spiral galaxies for which we also haveredshifts. for 3035 of the galaxies, i-band photometry is available which isincluded in the analysis. from the simple dependence of reddening oninclination we derive a lower limit to the difference in magnitude between theface-on and edge-on aspect of 0.9, 0.3 and 0.1 magnitudes in i (0.81 um), j(1.25 um) and h (1.65 um) bands. we find that the faintest isophotal radiusreported in the xsc (at the 21st mag/arc sq level) is closer to the centers ofthe galaxies than other common isophotal measures (e.g. the 23.5 mag/arc sqradius in i-band), and argue that it should not be assumed to represent anouter isophote at which galaxies are transparent at all viewing angles. asimple linear extinction law (i.e. delta m = gamma log(a/b)) is not adequatefor the full range of disk inclinations and we adopt both a bi-linear and aquadratic law. a simple photometric model is used to explain the observedbehavior. internal extinction depends on galaxy luminosity. we show that forgalaxies with a k total magnitude dimmer than -20, -20.7 and -20.9 the dataindicates zero extinction in j, h and k respectively, while disk opacityincreases monotonically with increasing disk luminosity.

astro-ph;0402650	m/l, h-alpha rotation curves, and hi measurements for 329 nearby cluster  and field spirals: ii. evidence for galaxy infall	we have conducted a study of optical and hi properties of spiral galaxies(size, luminosity, h-alpha flux distribution, circular velocity, hi gas mass)to explore the role of gas stripping as a driver of morphological evolution inclusters. we find a strong correlation between the spiral and s0 fractionswithin clusters, and the spiral fraction scales tightly with cluster x-ray gasluminosity. we explore young star formation and identify spirals that are (1)asymmetric, with truncated h-alpha emission and hi gas reservoirs on theleading edge of the disk, on a first pass through the dense intracluster mediumin the cores of rich clusters; (2) strongly hi deficient and stripped, withstar formation confined to the inner 5 kpc/h and 3 disk scale lengths; (3)reddened, extremely hi deficient and quenched, where star formation has beenhalted across the entire disk. we propose that these spirals are in successivestages of morphological transformation, between infalling field spirals andcluster s0s, and that the process which acts to remove the hi gas reservoirsuppresses new star formation on a similarly fast timescale. these data suggestthat gas stripping plays a significant role in morphological transformation andrapid truncation of star formation across the disk.

astro-ph;0402651	m/l, h-alpha rotation curves, and hi measurements for 329 nearby cluster  and field spirals: iii. evolutionin fundamental galaxy parameters	we have conducted a study of optical and hi properties of spiral galaxies(size, luminosity, h-alpha flux distribution, circular velocity, hi gas mass)to investigate causes (e.g., nature versus nurture) for variation within thecluster environment. we find hi deficient cluster galaxies to be offset infundamental plane space, with disk scale lengths decreased by a factor of 25%.this may be a relic of early galaxy formation, caused by the disk coalescingout of a smaller, denser halo (e.g., higher concentration index) or bytruncation of the hot gas envelope due to the enhanced local density ofneighbors, though we cannot completely rule out the effect of the gas strippingprocess. the spatial extent of h-alpha flux and the b-band radius alsodecreases, but only in early type spirals, suggesting that gas removal is lessefficient within steeper potential wells (or that stripped late type spiralsare quickly rendered unrecognizable). we find no significant trend in stellarmass-to-light ratios or circular velocities with hi gas content, morphologicaltype, or clustercentric radius, for star forming spiral galaxies throughout theclusters. these data support the findings of a companion paper that gasstripping promotes a rapid truncation of star formation across the disk, andcould be interpreted as weak support for dark matter domination over baryons inthe inner regions of spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0404455	the impact of distance uncertainties on local luminosity and mass  functions	in order to investigate discrepancies between recent published estimates ofthe the hi mass function (himf), we explore the impact of distanceuncertainties on the derivation of the faint end slope of mass and luminosityfunctions of galaxies in the local volume by deriving himfs from mock hisurveys. we consider various survey geometries and depths and compare the himfsmeasured when using ``real'' distances, distances derived by assuming purehubble flow and distances assigned from parametric models of the local velocityfield. the effect is variable and dependent on the exact survey geometry, butcan easily lead to incorrect estimates of the himf, particularly at the lowmass end. we show that at least part of the discrepancies among recentderivations of the himf can be accounted for by the use of different methods toassign distances. we conclude that a better understanding of the local velocityfield will be necessary for accurate determinations of the local galaxyluminosity and mass functions.

astro-ph;0408531	detection of 21 centimeter hi absorption at z = 0.78 in a survey of  radio continuum sources	we report the detection of a deep broad hi 21 cm absorption system at z =0.78 toward the radio source [hb89] 2351+456 (4c+45.51) at z = 1.992. the hiabsorption was identified in a blind spectral line survey conducted at thegreen bank telescope spanning 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 1.10 toward a large sample of radiocontinuum sources. the hi column density is n(hi) = 2.35 x 10^19 (t_s/f) cm^-2,where t_s is the spin temperature and f is the continuum covering factor of theabsorbing gas. for t_s/f &gt; 8.5 k, this system is by definition a damped lyalpha absorption system (n(hi) &gt;= 2 x 10^20 cm^-2). the line is unusuallybroad, with a fwhm of 53 km/s and a full span of 163 km/s, suggesting aphysically extended hi gas structure. radio surveys identify damped ly alphasystems in a manner that bypasses many of the selection effects present inoptical/uv surveys, including dust extinction and the atmospheric cutoff for z&lt; 1.65. the smooth broad profile of this hi 21 cm absorption system is similarto the z = 0.89 hi absorption toward pks 1830-211, which suggests that theabsorber toward [hb89] 2351+456 is also a gravitational lens and a molecularabsorption system. however, very long baseline interferometry and hubble spacetelescope observations show little evidence for gravitational lensing, and bimamillimeter observations show no hco+ (1-2) or hcn (1-2) absorption down to tau= 0.15 (3 sigma) in 5 km/s channels. although this radio damped ly alphaselection technique would include dusty, molecule-rich systems, [hb89] 2351+456appears to be a ``vanilla'' hi 21 cm absorber.

astro-ph;0411349	morphology, environment, and the hi mass function	we exploit a large, complete optical diameter and hi flux limited sample ofspiral galaxies with types later than s0a to derive a robust measurement of thehi mass function (himf) for masses log(m_hi/m_sun) &gt; 7.4 which takes intoaccount the effects of local large scale structure. the global himf derived forthis optically-selected sample is well fit by a schechter function with alpha =-1.24, log(m* / m_sun)=9.99, phi* = 3.2 (10^{-3}) mpc^{-3}. these values matchthose derived from blind hi surveys to within the estimated uncertainties, yetour estimated himf is clearly lower than most other estimates at the lowestmasses. we also investigate the variation in the derived himf among spiralsubclasses, finding a clear distinction between the schechter parameters foundfor types sa-sc and those scd and later, in the sense that the himf of thelatest types is rising at the low mass end, whereas that of the main spiralclasses is flat or even declining. we also explore the possible environmentaldependence of the himf by computing it separately in regimes of differingcosmic density. the himfs of higher density regions are found to have flatterlow-mass ends and lower values of m* than those of lower density regions,although the statistical significance of the difference is low. we find thatthe environmental dependence cannot be accounted for by morphologicalsegregation, and must be a consequence of differences among galaxies of thesame morphological type but found in different environments. if this dependenceis caused by the well known deficiency of galaxies in clusters, then it wouldsuggest that galaxies of small linear optical diameter are characterized byhigher hi deficiency, an expectation consistent with gas removal mechanismssuch as ram pressure stripping.

astro-ph;0502166	the cusp/core problem in galactic halos: long-slit spectra for a large  dwarf galaxy sample	we derive inner dark matter halo density profiles for a sample of 165low-mass galaxies using rotation curves obtained from high-quality, long-slitoptical spectra assuming minimal disks and spherical symmetry. for $\rho(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$ near the galaxy center we measure median inner slopes rangingfrom $\alpha_m = 0.22 \pm 0.08$ to $0.28 \pm 0.06$ for various subsamples ofthe data. this is similar to values found by other authors, and in starkcontrast to the intrinsic cusps ($\alpha_{int}\sim1$) predicted by simulationsof halo assembly in cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies. to elucidate therelationship between $\alpha_m$ and $\alpha_{int}$ in our data, we simulatelong-slit observations of model galaxies with halo shapes broadly consistentwith the cdm paradigm. simulations with $\alpha_{int}=1/2$ and 1 recover boththe observed distribution of $\alpha_m$ and correlations between $\alpha_m$ andprimary observational parameters such as distance and disk inclination, whereasthose with $\alpha_{int}=5/4$ are marginally consistent with the data.conversely, the hypothesis that low-mass galaxies have $\alpha_{int}=3/2$ isrejected. while the simulations do not imply that the data favor intrinsiccusps over cores, they demonstrate that the discrepancy between $\alpha_m$ and$\alpha_{int}\sim1$ for our sample does not necessarily imply a genuineconflict between our results and cdm predictions: rather, the apparentcusp/core problem may be reconciled by considering the impact of observing anddata processing techniques on rotation curves derived from long-slit spectra.

astro-ph;0510363	multi-wavelength study of galaxy rotation curves and its application to  cosmology	rotation information for spiral galaxies can be obtained through theobservation of different spectral lines. while the halpha(6563 a) line is oftenused for galaxies with low to moderate redshifts, it is redshifted into thenear-infrared at z&gt;0.4. this is why most high redshift surveys rely on the[oii](3727 a) line. using a sample of 32 spiral galaxies at 0.155 &lt; z &lt; 0.25observed simultaneously in both halpha and [oii] with the hale 200 inchtelescope, the relation between velocity widths extracted from these twospectral lines is investigated, and we conclude that halpha derived velocitiescan be reliably compared to high z [oii] measurements. the sample of galaxiesis then used along with vimos-vlt deep survey observations to perform theangular diameter - redshift test to find constraints on cosmologicalparameters. the test makes it possible to discriminate between variouscosmological models, given the upper limit of disc size evolution at themaximum redshift of the data set, no matter what the evolutionary scenario is.

astro-ph;9604114	the rotation curves of galaxies at intermediate redshift	we have undertaken a pilot project to measure the rotation velocities ofspiral galaxies in the redshift range 0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.4 using high dispersion longslit spectroscopy obtained with the palomar 5m telescope. one field galaxy andthree cluster objects known to have strong emission lines were observed overwavelength ranges covering the redshifted lines of [oii], caii k, h beta, and[oiii]. two of the objects show extended line emission that allows the tracingof the rotation curve in one or more lines. a line width similar to thatobtained with single dish telescopes for the 21-cm hi line observed in lowerredshift galaxies can be derived from the observed h beta, [oii], and [oiii]emission by measuring a characteristic width from the velocity histogram. thesemoderately distant galaxies have much stronger emission lines than typicallow-redshift spirals but they appear to be kinematically similar. applicationof the tully-fisher relation suggests that the two galaxies with rotationcurves are intrinsically brighter at r-band than nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;9610082	the relative distance between the clusters of galaxies a2634 and coma	the tully-fisher and fundamental plane relations are used to obtain twoindependent estimates of the relative distance between the clusters a2634 andcoma. previously published studies of a2634 showed a large discrepancy betweenthe distance estimates obtained with the tf and the dn-sigma relations,questioning the reliability of redshift-independent distances obtained usingthese relations. because of the importance of this issue, we have obtained newdistance estimates for a2634, based on much larger samples than previouslyused, and selected according to rigorous membership criteria. new i band ccdphotometry for 175 galaxies, new 21 cm observations of 11 galaxies, and newvelocity dispersion measurements for 62 galaxies are used together withpreviously published data in building these samples. after the appropriatecorrections for sample incompleteness have been taken into account, we find thetf and fp distance estimates to be in good agreement, both indicating thata2634 has a negligibly small peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmicmicrowave background reference frame. because of the high accuracy with whichthe two distance estimates have been obtained, their agreement stronglysupports the universality of the tf and fp relations, and therefore theirreliability for the estimate of redshift-independent distances.

astro-ph;9610130	a test of the lauer--postman bulk flow	we use tully--fisher distances for a sample of field late spiral galaxies totest the lauer and postman (1994; hereinafter lp) result suggestive of a bulkflow with respect to the cosmic microwave background reference frame, ofamplitude of +689 km/s in the direction l=343, b=+52. a total of 432 galaxiesare used, subdivided between two cones, of 30deg semiaperture each and pointedrespectively toward the apex and antapex of the lp motion. the peculiarvelocities in the two data sets are inconsistent with a bulk flow of theamplitude claimed by lp. when combined in opposition, the peculiar velocitymedians in shells of constant redshift width are never larger than half theamplitude of the lp bulk flow. out to 5000 km/s the median bulk velocity in thelp apex--antapex cones is about 200 km/s or less, dropping to a valueindistinguishable from zero beyond that distance. it can be excluded that fieldspiral galaxies within 8000 km/s partake of a bulk flow of the amplitude anddirection reported by lp.

astro-ph;9706150	redshift-space distortions and the real-space clustering of different  galaxy types	we study the distortions induced by peculiar velocities on the redshift-spacecorrelation function of galaxies of different morphological types in thepisces-perseus redshift survey. redshift-space distortions affect early- andlate-type galaxies in different ways. in particular, at small separations, thedominant effect comes from virialized cluster cores, where ellipticals are thedominant population. the net result is that a meaningful comparison of theclustering strength of different morphological types can be performed only inreal space, i.e., after projecting out the redshift distortions on thetwo-point correlation function xi(r_p,pi). a power-law fit to the projectedfunction w_p(r_p) on scales smaller than 10/h mpc gives r_o =8.35_{-0.76}^{+0.75} /h mpc, \gamma = 2.05_{-0.08}^{+0.10} for the early-typepopulation, and r_o = 5.55_{-0.45}^{+0.40} /h mpc, \gamma =1.73_{-0.08}^{+0.07} for spirals and irregulars. these values are derived for asample luminosity brighter than m_{zw} = -19.5. we detect a 25% increase of r_owith luminosity for all types combined, from m_{zw} = -19 to -20. in theframework of a simple stable-clustering model for the mean streaming of pairs,we estimate sigma_12(1), the one-dimensional pairwise velocity dispersionbetween 0 and 1 /h mpc, to be 865^{+250}_{-165} km/s for early-type galaxiesand 345^{+95}_{-65} km/s for late types. this latter value should be a fairestimate of the pairwise dispersion for ``field'' galaxies; it is stable withrespect to the presence or absence of clusters in the sample, and is consistentwith the values found for non-cluster galaxies and iras galaxies at similarseparations.

astro-ph;9707299	comparison of the sfi peculiar velocities with the iras 1.2 jy gravity  field	we present a comparison between the peculiar velocity fields measured fromthe sfi all-sky sbc-sc tully-fisher catalog and that derived from the \iras 1.2jy redshift survey galaxy distribution. the analysis is based on the expansionof these data in redshift space using smooth orthonormal functions and isperformed using low and high resolution expansions, with an effective smoothingscale which increases almost linearly with redshift. the effective smoothingscales at 3000 \kms are 1500\kms and 1000\kms for the low and high resolutionfilters. the agreement between the high and low resolution sfi velocity maps isexcellent. the general features in the filtered sfi and \iras velocity fieldsagree remarkably well within 6000\kms. this good agreement between the fieldsallows us to determine the parameter $\beta=\omega^{0.6}/b$, where $\omega $ isthe cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the linear biasing factor. from alikelihood analysis on the sfi and \iras modes we find that $\beta=0.6\pm 0.1$independently of the resolution of the modal expansion. for this value of$\beta$, the residual fields for the two filters show no systematic variationswithin 6000 \kms. most remarkable is the lack of any coherent, redshiftdependent dipole flow in the residual field.

astro-ph;9808331	the luminous starburst ring in ngc 7771: sequential star formation?	only two of the twenty highly luminous starburst galaxies analyzed by smithet al. exhibit circumnuclear rings of star formation. these galaxies provide alink between 10^11 l_sun systems and classical, less-luminous ringed systems.we report the discovery of a near-infrared counterpart to the nuclear ring ofradio emission in ngc 7771. a displacement between the ~10 radio bright clumpsand the ~10 near-infrared bright clumps indicates the presence of multiplegenerations of star formation. the estimated thermal emission from each radiosource is equivalent to that of ~35000 o6 stars. each near-infrared bright knotcontains ~5000 red supergiants, on average. the stellar mass of each knot isestimated to be ~10^7 m_sun. the implied time-averaged star formation rate is\~40 m_sun per yr. several similarities are found between the properties ofthis system and other ringed and non-ringed starbursts. morphologicaldifferences between ngc 7771 and the starburst + seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 7469suggest that ngc 7771 may not be old enough to fuel an agn, or may not becapable of fueling an agn. alternatively, the differences may be unrelated tothe presence or absence of an agn and may simply reflect the possibility thatstar formation in rings is episodic.

astro-ph;9810467	seeking the local convergence depth. the abell cluster dipole flow to  200 mpc/h	we have obtained new tully-fisher (tf) peculiar velocity measurements for 52abell galaxy clusters distributed throughout the sky between ~ 50 and 200mpc/h.the measurements are based on i band photometry and optical rotationcurves for a sample of 522 spiral galaxies, from which an accurate tf templaterelation has been constructed. individual cluster tf relations are referred tothe template to compute cluster peculiar motions.  the reflex motion of the local group of galaxies is measured with respect tothe reference frame defined by our cluster sample and the distant portion ofthe giovanelli et al. (1998) cluster set. we find the local group motion inthis frame to be 565+/-113 km/s in the direction (l,b)=(267,26)+/-10 whenpeculiar velocities are weighted according to their errors. after optimizingthe dipole calculation to sample equal volumes equally, the vector is 509+/-195km/s towards (255,33)+/-22. both solutions agree, to within 1-sigma or better,with the local group motion as inferred from the cosmic microwave background(cmb) dipole. thus, the cluster sample as a whole moves slowly in the cmbreference frame, its bulk flow being at most 200 km/s.

astro-ph;9904118	large-scale power spectrum and cosmological parameters from sfi peculiar  velocities	we estimate the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations from peculiarvelocities of galaxies by applying an improved maximum-likelihood technique tothe new all-sky sfi catalog. parametric models are used for the power spectrumand the errors, and the free parameters are determined by assuming gaussianvelocity fields and errors and maximizing the probability of the data given themodel. it has been applied to generalized cdm models with and without cobenormalization. the method has been carefully tested using artificial sficatalogs. the most likely distance errors are found to be similar to theoriginal error estimates in the sfi data. the general result that is not verysensitive to the prior model used is a relatively high amplitude of the powerspectrum. for example, at k=0.1 h/mpc we find p(k)\omega^{1.2}=(4.4+/-1.7)x10^3(mpc/h)^3. an integral over the power spectrum yields\sigma_8\omega^{0.6}=0.82+/-0.12. model-dependent constraints on thecosmological parameters are obtained for families of cdm models. for example,for cobe-normalized \lambda cdm models (scalar fluctuations only), themaximum-likelihood result can be approximated by \omega n^{2} h_{60}^{1.3}=0.58+/-0.11. the formal random errors quoted correspond to the 90% confidencelevel. the total uncertainty, including systematic errors associated withnonlinear effects, may be larger by a factor of ~2. these results are inagreement with an application of a similar method to other data (mark iii).

0810.3571	the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey vii: a neutral hydrogen cloud  complex in the virgo cluster	we present observations of an hi cloud complex most likely located in thevirgo galaxy cluster, first reported by kent et al. (2007). the complexconsists of five clouds, detected in the data set of the alfalfa extragalactichi survey at arecibo. the clouds have radial velocities between cz~480 and 610km/s. at the virgo cluster distance, they are spread over a projected span of170 kpc and have hi masses ranging from 0.48 to 1.7 x 10^8 msun. the overall himass of the complex is 5.1 x 10^8 msun. the clouds' velocity widths varybetween 50 and 250 km/s. new results of follow-up aperture synthesisobservations conducted with the very large array are also presented, whichyield a higher resolution view of two of the clouds in the complex. these tworesolved clouds show no evidence of symmetry in the gas distribution or of anyordered motions. the possibility that the complex is a group of primordialobjects, embedded in their own dark matter halo is thought to be unlikely.scenarios in which the clouds have been removed from the disk of a galaxytraveling at high speed through the intracluster medium are considered. themost likely among those is thought to be one where the clouds were separatedfrom ngc 4445 at a time &gt;0.5 gyr ago. the orbital velocity of the clouds andthe putative parent galaxy would now be seen at a relatively large angle withrespect to the line of sight.
