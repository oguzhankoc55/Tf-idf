0904.0002	the propagation of uncertainties in stellar population synthesis  modeling ii: the challenge of comparing galaxy evolution models to  observations	models for the formation and evolution of galaxies readily predict physicalproperties such as the star formation rates, metal enrichment histories, and,increasingly, gas and dust content of synthetic galaxies. such predictions arefrequently compared to the spectral energy distributions of observed galaxiesvia the stellar population synthesis (sps) technique. substantial uncertaintiesin sps exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolutionmodels to observations has received little attention. in the present work webegin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties instellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (imf), and dust andinterstellar medium (ism) properties on the translation from models toobservations. we demonstrate that these uncertainties translate intosubstantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colorsof synthetic galaxies. aspects that carry significant uncertainties include thelogarithmic slope of the imf above 1 msun, dust attenuation law, molecularcloud disruption timescale, clumpiness of the ism, fraction of unobscuredstarlight, and treatment of advanced stages of stellar evolution including bluestragglers, the horizontal branch, and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giantbranch. the interpretation of the resulting uncertainties in the derived colorsis highly non-trivial because many of the uncertainties are likely systematic,and possibly correlated with the physical properties of galaxies. we thereforeurge caution when comparing models to observations.

0905.4073	dust attenuation in the restframe ultraviolet: constraints from  star-forming galaxies at z~1	a novel technique is employed for estimating attenuation curves in galaxieswhere only photometry and spectroscopic redshifts are available. this techniqueprovides a powerful measure of particular extinction features such as the uvbump at 2175\a, which has been observed in environments ranging from the milkyway to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. knowledge of the typical strengthof the uv bump as a function of environment and redshift is crucial forconverting restframe uv flux into star formation rates. the uv bump will imparta unique signature as it moves through various filters due to redshifting; itspresence can therefore be disentangled from other stellar population effects.the utility of this technique is demonstrated with a large sample of galaxiesdrawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. the observed b-r color ofstar-forming galaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 disfavors the presence of a uv bump asstrong as observed in the milky way, and instead favors restframe uv(1800a&lt;lambda&lt;3000a) attenuation curves similar to the milky way without a uvbump or a power-law with index delta=-0.7. stronger constraints on the strengthof the uv bump in galaxies can be achieved if independent constraints on thev-band optical depth are available.

0911.3151	the propagation of uncertainties in stellar population synthesis  modeling iii: model calibration, comparison, and evaluation	stellar population synthesis (sps) provides the link between the stellar anddust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. inthe present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible sps(fsps) model against a suite of data. several public sps models areintercompared, including the models of bruzual &amp; charlot (bc03), maraston (m05)and fsps. the relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated,with the following conclusions: 1) the fsps and bc03 models compare favorablywith mc data at all ages, whereas m05 colors are too red and the age-dependenceis incorrect; 2) all models yield similar optical and near-ir colors for oldmetal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated j-kand v-k colors of both mw and m31 star clusters; 4) all models predict ugrcolors too red, d4000 strengths too strong and hdelta strengths too weakcompared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that suchgalaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) fsps and, to a lesserextent, bc03 can reproduce the optical and near-ir colors of post-starburstgalaxies, while m05 cannot. reasons for these discrepancies are explored. thefailure at predicting the ugr colors, d4000, and hdelta strengths can beexplained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars,young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not byappealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres orcanonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). we emphasizethat due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of themetallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue tosuffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

1001.0015	a comprehensive analysis of uncertainties affecting the stellar mass -  halo mass relation for 0&lt;z&lt;4	we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between centralgalaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellarmass-halo mass (sm-hm) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties.our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, whichassumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass thresholdhosts one galaxy. we discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties inobserved galaxy stellar mass functions (gsmfs) (including stellar massestimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmologyand uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique usedto link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). our analysisresults in a robust estimate of the sm-hm relation and its evolution from z=0to z=4. the shape and evolution are well constrained for z &lt; 1. the largestuncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however,failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead toerrors of similar magnitude in the sm-hm relation for central galaxies inmassive halos. we also investigate the sm-hm relation to z=4, although theshape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained whenuncertainties are taken into account. these results will provide a powerfultool to inform galaxy evolution models.

0707.3445	void statistics in large galaxy redshift surveys: does halo occupation  of field galaxies depend on environment?	we use measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function w_p andgalaxy void statistics to test whether the galaxy content of halos of fixedmass is systematically different in low density environments. we present newmeasurements of the void probability function (vpf) and underdensityprobability function (upf) from data release four of the sloan digital skysurvey, as well as new measurements of the vpf from the full data release ofthe two-degree field galaxy redshift survey. we compare these measurements topredictions calculated from models of the halo occupation distribution (hod)that are constrained to match both w_p and the space density of galaxies. thestandard implementation of the hod assumes that galaxy occupation depends onhalo mass only, and is independent of local environment. for luminosity-definedsamples, we find that the standard hod prediction is a good match to theobservations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiencyis reduced in low-density environments. more remarkably, we find that the voidstatistics of red and blue galaxies (at l ~ 0.4l_*) are perfectly predicted bystandard hod models matched to the correlation function of these samples,ruling out "assembly bias" models in which galaxy color is correlated withlarge-scale environment at fixed halo mass. we conclude that the luminosity andcolor of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo inwhich they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in whichthe host halo formed. in broader terms, our results show that the sizes andemptiness of voids found in the distribution of l &gt; 0.2l_* galaxies are inexcellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model witha simple connection between galaxies and dark matter halos.

1003.2202	dust attenuation in disk-dominated galaxies: evidence for the 2175a dust  feature	the attenuation of starlight by interstellar dust is investigated in a sampleof low redshift, disk-dominated star-forming galaxies using photometry fromgalex and sdss. by considering broadband colors as a function of galaxyinclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasingdust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellarpopulations do not correlate with inclination. all commonly employed dustattenuation curves (such as the calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-lawcurve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highlyinclined galaxies. this conclusion rests on the fact that the average fuv-nuvcolor varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors suchas nuv-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. after considering a number ofmodel variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dustextinction feature at 2175a seen in the milky way (mw) extinction curve isresponsible for the observed trends. independent of our interpretation, theseresults imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet issignificantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. these results alsoimply a very weak dependence of the fuv-nuv color on total fuv attenuation, andwe conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observeduv spectral slope to infer the total uv dust attenuation, as is commonly done.we propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grainpopulation responsible for the 2175a feature.

1004.4626	the kinematic connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes	using estimates of dark halo masses from satellite kinematics, weakgravitational lensing, and halo abundance matching, combined with thetully-fisher and faber-jackson relations, we derive the mean relation betweenthe optical, v_opt, and virial, v_200, circular velocities of early- andlate-type galaxies at redshift z~0. for late-type galaxies v_opt ~ v_200 overthe velocity range v_opt=90-260 km/s, and is consistent with v_opt = v_maxh(the maximum circular velocity of nfw dark matter haloes in the concordancelcdm cosmology). however, for early-type galaxies v_opt \ne v_200, with theexception of early-type galaxies with v_opt simeq 350 km/s. this isinconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal.for low mass (v_opt &lt; 250 km/s) early-types v_opt &gt; v_maxh, indicating thatbaryons have modified the potential well, while high mass (v_opt &gt; 400 km/s)early-types have v_opt &lt; v_maxh. folding in measurements of the black hole mass- velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive blackhole - halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from ~1.4 athalo masses of ~10^{12} msun/h to ~0.65 at halo masses of 10^{13.5} msun/h. thevalues of v_opt/v_200 we infer for the milky way and m31 are lower than thevalues currently favored by direct observations and dynamical models. thisoffset is due to the fact that the milky way and m31 have higher v_opt andlower v_200 compared to typical late-type galaxies of the same stellar masses.we show that current high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulationsare unable to form galaxies which simultaneously reproduce both the v_opt/v_200ratio and the v_opt-m_star (tully-fisher/faber-jackson) relation.

1005.4934	on the formation of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters	nearly all globular clusters (gcs) studied to date show evidence for multiplestellar populations, in stark contrast to the conventional view that gcs are amono-metallic, coeval population of stars. building on earlier work, we proposea simple physical model for the early evolution (several 10^8 yr) of gcs. weconsider the effects of stellar mass-loss, type ii and prompt type iasupernovae, ram pressure, and accretion from the ambient ism on the developmentof a young gc's own gas reservoir. in our model, type ii sne from a firstgeneration of star formation clears the gc of its initial gas reservoir. overthe next several 10^8 yr, mass lost from agb stars and matter accreted from theambient ism collect at the center of the gc. this material must remain quitecool (t~10^2k), but does not catastrophically cool on a crossing time becauseof the high lyman-werner flux density in young gcs. the collection of gaswithin the gc must compete with ram pressure from the ambient ism. afterseveral 10^8 yr, the lyman-werner photon flux density drops by more than threeorders of magnitude, allowing molecular hydrogen and then stars to form. afterthis second generation of star formation, type ii sne from the secondgeneration and then prompt type ia sne associated with the first generationmaintain a gas-free gc, thereby ending the cycle of star formation events. ourmodel makes clear predictions for the presence or absence of multiple stellarpopulations within gcs as a function of gc mass and formation environment.analyzing intermediate-age lmc clusters, we find evidence for a mass thresholdof ~10^4 msun below which lmc clusters appear to be truly coeval. thisthreshold mass is consistent with our predictions for the mass at which rampressure is capable of clearing gas from clusters in the lmc at the presentepoch.

1008.4357	the spectral energy distribution of post-starburst galaxies in the  newfirm medium-band survey: a low contribution from tp-agb stars	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are a key ingredient of many galaxyevolution studies. unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated forcertain stellar evolution stages. of particular concern is the treatment of thethermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase, as differentimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as tp-agb stars arethought to be most prominently visible during this phase. here, we usepost-starburst galaxies in the newfirm medium-band survey to assess differentsps models. the available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous andwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0, from which weconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (sed) over therange 1200-40 000 angstrom. the sed is well-fit by the bruzual &amp; charlot spsmodels, while the maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical andnear-infrared parts of the sed simultaneously. when the fitting is restrictedto lambda &lt; 6000 angstrom, the maraston models overpredict the near-infraredluminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to tp-agb stars.using the flexible sps models by conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,we find that the contribution of tp-agb stars to the integrated sed is a factorof ~3 lower than predicted by the latest padova tp-agb models. whether this isdue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dustobscuration of tp-agb stars remains to be addressed. altogether, our datademand a low contribution from tp-agb stars to the sed of post-starburstgalaxies.

1009.5992	a substantial population of low mass stars in luminous elliptical  galaxies	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the mass distribution ofstars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for manyareas of astrophysics. the imf is reasonably well constrained in the disk ofthe milky way but we have very little direct information on the form of the imfin other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. here we investigate the stellarmass function in elliptical galaxies by measuring the strength of the na idoublet and the wing-ford molecular feh band in their spectra. these lines arestrong in stars with masses &lt;0.3 msun and weak or absent in all other types ofstars. we unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previousstudies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. the directdetection of the light of low mass stars implies that they are very abundant inelliptical galaxies, making up &gt;80% of the total number of stars andcontributing &gt;60% of the total stellar mass. we infer that the imf in massivestar-forming galaxies in the early universe produced many more low mass starsthan the imf in the milky way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than thesalpeter form in the mass range 0.1 - 1 msun.

1010.5783	evidence against dark matter halos surrounding the globular clusters  mgc1 and ngc 2419	the conjecture that the ancient globular clusters (gcs) formed at the centerof their own dark matter halos was first proposed by peebles (1984), and hasrecently been revived to explain the puzzling abundance patterns observedwithin many gcs. in this paper we demonstrate that the outer stellar densityprofile of isolated gcs is very sensitive to the presence of an extended darkhalo. the gcs ngc 2419, located at 90 kpc from the center of our galaxy, andmgc1, located at ~200 kpc from the center of m31, are ideal laboratories fortesting the scenario that gcs formed at the centers of massive dark halos.comparing analytic models to observations of these gcs, we conclude that thesegcs cannot be embedded within dark halos with a virial mass greater than 10^6msun, or, equivalently, the dark matter halo mass-to-stellar mass ratio must bemdm/m_*&lt;1. if these gcs have indeed orbited within weak tidal fields throughouttheir lifetimes, then these limits imply that these gcs did not form withintheir own dark halos. recent observations of an extended stellar halo in the gcngc 1851 are also interpreted in the context of our analytic models.implications of these results for the formation of gcs are briefly discussed.

1012.5859	dark halo response and the stellar initial mass function in early-type  and late-type galaxies	we investigate the origin of the relations between stellar mass and opticalcircular velocity for early-type (etg) and late-type (ltg) galaxies --- thefaber-jackson (fj) and tully-fisher (tf) relations. we combine measurements ofdark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and thedistribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scalingrelations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmologicalsimulations. the principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formationand the stellar initial mass function (imf). the slopes of the tf and fjrelations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and imfs.however, models with a universal imf and universal halo response cannotsimultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the tf and fj relations. for amodel with a universal chabrier imf, ltgs require halo expansion, while etgsrequire halo contraction. a salpeter imf is permitted for high mass (sigma &gt;180 km/s) etgs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unlessv_circ(r_e)/sigma_e &gt; 1.6. if the imf is universal and close to chabrier, wespeculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for thecontraction in etgs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads toexpansion in ltgs. alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the imfdisfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. finally we show that ourmodels naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profileswithin the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

1101.2208	on the birth masses of the ancient globular clusters	all globular clusters (gcs) studied to date show evidence for internalvariation in their light element abundances. these variations have beeninterpreted as evidence for multiple star formation episodes within gcs, withsecondary episodes fueled, at least in part, by the ejecta of agb stars from afirst generation of stars. a major puzzle emerging from this otherwiseplausible scenario is that the fraction of stars associated with the secondepisode of star formation is observed to be much larger than expected for astandard imf. the present work investigates this tension by modeling theobserved anti-correlation between [na/fe] and [o/fe] for 20 galactic gcs. ifthe abundance pattern of the retained agb ejecta does not depend on gc mass atfixed [fe/h], then a strong correlation is found between the fraction ofcurrent gc stellar mass comprised of pure agb ejecta, f_p, and gc mass. thisfraction varies from 0.20 at low masses (10^4.5 msun) to 0.45 at high masses(10^6.5 msun). the fraction of mass associated with pure agb ejecta is directlyrelated to the total mass of the cluster at birth; the ratio between theinitial and present mass in stars can therefore be derived. assuming a starformation efficiency of 50%, the observed na-o anti-correlations imply that gcswere at least 10-20 times more massive at birth. these factors are lower limitsbecause any mass-loss mechanism that removes first and second generation starsequally will leave f_p unchanged. the mass-dependence of f_p probably arisesbecause lower mass gcs are unable to retain all of the agb ejecta from thefirst stellar generation. recent observations of elemental abundances inintermediate-age lmc clusters are re-interpreted and shown to be consistentwith this basic scenario. a convincing explanation of these trends is currentlylacking.

1102.3431	confirmation of enhanced dwarf-sensitive absorption features in the  spectra of massive elliptical galaxies: further evidence for a non-universal  initial mass function	we recently found that massive cluster elliptical galaxies have strong na i8183,8195 and feh 9916 wing-ford band absorption, indicating the presence of avery large population of stars with masses &lt;~ 0.3 m_sun. here we test thisresult by comparing the elliptical galaxy spectra to those of luminous globularclusters associated with m31. these globular clusters have similarmetallicities, abundance ratios and ages as massive elliptical galaxies buttheir low dynamical mass-to-light ratios rule out steep stellar initial massfunctions (imfs). from high quality keck spectra we find that thedwarf-sensitive absorption lines in globular clusters are significantly weakerthan in elliptical galaxies, and consistent with normal imfs. the differencesin the na i and wing-ford indices are 0.027 +- 0.007 mag and 0.017 +- 0.006 magrespectively. we directly compare the two classes of objects by subtracting theaveraged globular cluster spectrum from the averaged elliptical galaxyspectrum. the difference spectrum is well fit by the difference between astellar population synthesis model with a bottom-heavy imf and one with abottom-light imf. we speculate that the slope of the imf may vary with velocitydispersion, although it is not yet clear what physical mechanism would beresponsible for such a relation.

1107.5046	are halo and galaxy formation histories correlated?	the properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate withlarger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias.however, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxyproperties remains unclear. we apply a group-finding algorithm to dr7 of thesdss to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies intothose that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit assatellites within larger halos. using the 4000-a break as a measure of starformation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction ofgalaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. at all galaxy magnitudes,there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. we use thegroup catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from centraland satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. because satellites are morelikely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlationis primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment,which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. for low-masscentral galaxies (mgal &lt;~ 10^10.0 msol/h^2), there is no correlation betweenf_q and rho. these results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias ofdark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at allcorrelates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolutionn-body simulation. we also find that the mean stellar age of quenched centralgalaxies is independent of rho at fixed mgal, while the formation times of lowmass halos vary significantly. we conclude that the processes that halt thestar formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formationhistories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially inold halos.

1107.5311	galaxy evolution in groups and clusters: star formation rates, red  sequence fractions, and the persistent bimodality	using galaxy group/cluster catalogs created from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (ssfr)distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, hosthalo mass, and halo-centric radius. all galaxies, regardless ofcentral-satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal ssfr distribution,with a strong break at ssfr ~ 10^-11 yr^-1 and the same high ssfr peak; in noregime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. satellitegalaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side ofthe ssfr distribution. furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excessabove the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. anenhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo massesdown to 3 x 10^11 msol and increases strongly with halo mass and toward halocenter. we find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond ~2r_viraround massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centralsand satellites. these trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significantenvironmental effects until they cross within ~r_vir of a more massive hosthalo, (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolvein the same manner as active central galaxies for several gyrs, and (3) oncebegun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. these results placestrong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we willdiscuss further in companion papers.

1109.0007	counting low-mass stars in integrated light	low-mass stars (m&lt;0.4msun) are thought to comprise the bulk of the stellarmass of galaxies but they constitute only of order a percent of the bolometricluminosity of an old stellar population. directly estimating the number oflow-mass stars from integrated flux measurements of old stellar systems istherefore possible but very challenging given the numerous variables that canaffect the light at the percent level. here we present a new populationsynthesis model created specifically for the purpose of measuring the low-massinitial mass function (imf) down to ~0.1msun for metal-rich stellar populationswith ages in the range 3-13.5 gyr. our fiducial model is based on the synthesisof three separate isochrones and a combination of optical and near-ir empiricalstellar libraries in order to produce integrated light spectra over thewavelength interval 0.35mu&lt;lambda&lt;2.4mu at a resolving power of r~2000. newsynthetic stellar atmospheres and spectra have been computed in order to modelthe spectral variations due to changes in individual elemental abundancesincluding c, n, na, mg, si, ca, ti, fe, and generic alpha elements. wedemonstrate the power of combining blue spectral features with surfacegravity-sensitive near-ir features in order to simultaneously constrain thelow-mass imf, stellar population age, metallicity, and abundance pattern fromintegrated light measurements. finally, we show that the shape of the low-massimf can also be directly constrained by employing a suite of surfacegravity-sensitive spectral features, each of which is most sensitive to aparticular mass interval.

1109.0010	the integrated stellar content of dark matter halos	measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a functionof host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes thatregulate star formation. we derive the total stellar mass fraction f_star as afunction of halo mass m500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods.first, we derive f_star using a statistical halo occupation distribution modeljointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar massfunction. this method enables us to probe f_star over a much wider halo massrange than with group or cluster catalogs. second, we derive f_star at groupscales using a cosmos x-ray group catalog and we show that the two methodsagree to within 30%. we quantify the systematic uncertainty on f_star usingabundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty onf_star (~10%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellarmass measurements (~45% excluding imf uncertainties). assuming a chabrier imf,we find 0.012&lt;f_star&lt;0.025 at m500c=10^13 msun and 0.0057&lt;f_star&lt;0.015 atm500c=10^14 msun. these values are significantly lower than previouslypublished estimates. we investigate the cause of this difference and find thatprevious work has overestimated f_star due to a combination of inaccuratestellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies ingroups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. contrary toprevious claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f_star is alwayssignificantly lower than f_gas for halos above 10^13 msun. combining ourresults with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall inf_star+f_gas at r500c compared to the cosmic mean. this shortfall varies withhalo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.

1202.6241	the progenitors of present-day massive red galaxies up to z ~ 0.7 -  finding passive galaxies using sdss-i/ii and sdss-iii	we present a comprehensive study of 250,000 galaxies targeted by the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal ofidentifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolvedwithout significant merging. we compute a likelihood that each boss galaxy is aprogenitor of the luminous red galaxies (lrgs) sample, targeted by sdss-i/ii upz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of lrgs and their inferred star-formationhistories, metallicity histories and dust content. we determine merger rates,luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering betweenthe two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellarpopulation synthesis models in our conclusions. we demonstrate that our sampleis slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per gyr by merging). ourconclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, withmi0.55 &lt; -22, and m* &gt; 1e11.2 msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% ofthe lrgs and boss galaxy populations, respectively. our analysis further showsthat any possible excess of flux in boss galaxies, when compared to lrgs, frompotentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in ther0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame ofgalaxies at z=0.55). when weighting the boss galaxies based on the predictedproperties of the lrgs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest bossgalaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistentwith dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. we concludethat our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close topassive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) aspossible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

0711.0001	the varied fates of z~2 star-forming galaxies	star-forming galaxies constitute the majority of galaxies with stellar masses&gt;10^10 m_sun/h^2 at z~2 and dominate the star-formation rate density of theuniverse at this early epoch. it is thus critical to understand their origins,evolution, and connection to the underlying dark matter distribution. to thisend, we identify the dark matter halos (including subhalos) that are likely tocontain star-forming galaxies at z~2 (z2sfgs) within a large dissipationlesscosmological simulation and then use halo merger histories to follow theevolution of z2sfg descendants to z~1 and z~0. the evolved halos at theseepochs are then confronted with an array of observational data in order touncover the likely descendants of z2sfgs. though the evolved halos haveclustering strengths comparable to red galaxies at z~1 and z~0, we find thatthe bulk of z2sfgs do not evolve into red galaxies, at either epoch. thisconclusion is based primarily on the fact that the space density of z2sfgs ismuch higher than that of lower redshift red galaxies, even when accounting forthe merging of z2sfg descendants, which decreases the number density of z2sfgdescendants by at most a factor of two by z~0. of the ~50% of z2sfgs thatsurvive to z~0, ~70% reside at the center of z~0 dark matter halos with m&gt;10^12m_sun/h. halo occupation modeling of z~0 galaxies suggests that such halos areoccupied by galaxies with m_r&lt;-20.5, implying that these z2sfgs evolve into``typical'' ~ l* galaxies today, including our own galaxy. the remaining ~30%become satellite galaxies by z~0, and comparison to halo occupation modelingsuggests that they are rather faint, with m_r&lt;-19.5.

1203.3192	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: design, observations, data reduction,  and redshifts	we describe the design and data sample from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey,the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z ~ 1completed to date. the survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massivegalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down toabsolute magnitude m_b = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on thedeimos spectrograph at keck observatory. deep2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude ofr_ab=24.1. objects with z &lt; 0.7 are rejected based on bri photometry in threeof the four deep2 fields, allowing galaxies with z &gt; 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. approximatelysixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. most of thetargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z~ 1.45. the deimos 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers highspectral resolution (r~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and uniqueinternal kinematic information. extensive ancillary data are available in thedeep2 fields, particularly in the extended groth strip, which has evolved intoone of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. deep2 surpasses otherdeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshiftaccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. we alsoprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the deep2 survey thus far.this paper is intended as a handbook for users of the deep2 data release 4,which includes all deep2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for thepublicly-available deep2 deimos data reduction pipelines.

1205.3495	runaway stars and the escape of ionizing radiation from high-redshift  galaxies	approximately 30% of all massive stars in the galaxy are runaways withvelocities exceeding 30 km/s. their high speeds allow them to travel ~0.1-1 kpcaway from their birth place before they explode at the end of their several myrlifetimes. at high redshift, when galaxies were much smaller than in the localuniverse, runaways could venture far from the dense inner regions of their hostgalaxies. from these large radii, and therefore low column densities, much oftheir ionizing radiation is able to escape into the intergalactic medium.runaways may therefore significantly enhance the overall escape fraction ofionizing radiation, fesc, from small galaxies at high redshift. we presentsimple models of the high-redshift runaway population and its impact on fesc asa function of halo mass, size, and redshift. we find that the inclusion ofrunaways enhances fesc by factors of ~1.1-8, depending on halo mass, galaxygeometry, and the mechanism of runaway production, implying that runaways maycontribute 50-90% of the total ionizing radiation escaping from high-redshiftgalaxies. runaways may therefore play an important role in reionizing theuniverse.

1205.6471	the stellar initial mass function in early-type galaxies from absorption  line spectroscopy. i. data and empirical trends	the strength of gravity-sensitive absorption lines in the integrated light ofold stellar populations is one of the few direct probes of the stellar initialmass function (imf) outside of the milky way. owing to the advent of fullydepleted ccds with little or no fringing it has recently become possible toobtain accurate measurements of these features. here we present spectracovering the wavelength ranges 0.35 - 0.55 micron and 0.72 - 1.03 micron forthe bulge of m31 and 34 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample, obtainedwith the low resolution imaging spectrometer on keck. the signal-to-noise ratiois &gt;200 per angstrom out to 1 micron, which is sufficient to measuregravity-sensitive features for individual galaxies and to determine how theydepend on other properties of the galaxies. combining the new data withpreviously obtained spectra for globular clusters in m31 and the most massiveelliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster we find that the dwarf-sensitive na idoublet and the feh wing-ford band increase systematically with velocitydispersion, while the giant-sensitive ca ii triplet decreases with dispersion.these trends are consistent with a varying imf, such that galaxies with deeperpotential wells have more dwarf-enriched mass functions. in a companion paper(conroy &amp; van dokkum 2012) we use a comprehensive stellar population synthesismodel to demonstrate that imf effects can be separated from age and abundancevariations and quantify the imf variation among early-type galaxies.

1205.6473	the stellar initial mass function in early-type galaxies from absorption  line spectroscopy. ii. results	the spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth ofinformation regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history,and stellar initial mass function (imf) of the underlying stellar population.using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect ofvariable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high qualityabsorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of m31.these data extend to 1um and they therefore include the imf-sensitive spectralfeatures nai, caii, and feh at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. themodels fit the data well, with typical rms residuals ~1%. strong constraints onthe imf and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (m/l)_stars, are derivedfor individual galaxies. we find that the imf becomes increasingly bottom-heavywith increasing velocity dispersion and [mg/fe]. at the lowest dispersions and[mg/fe] values the derived imf is consistent with the milky way imf, while atthe highest dispersions and [mg/fe] values the derived imf contains morelow-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a salpeter imf. our best-fit(m/l)_stars values do not exceed dynamically-based m/l values. we also applyour models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in m31 andfind an (m/l)_stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a milky way imf,again agreeing with dynamical constraints. we discuss other possibleexplanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the imf isthe simplest and most plausible.

1206.3571	galaxy evolution in groups and clusters: satellite star formation  histories and quenching timescales in a hierarchical universe	satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low starformation rates (sfr) and lie on the red-sequence than central (field)galaxies. using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from sdss dr7, together with acosmological n-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the starformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of m_star &gt; 5 x 10^9m_sun at z=0. we first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessingand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properlyaccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 gyrago. to obtain accurate initial conditions for the sfrs of satellites at theirtime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for theevolution of central galaxy sfrs and quiescent fractions. with this, weconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function ofsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominantprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at m_star &lt; 10^10 m_sun. we thenconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'quenching scenario: satellite sfrs evolve unaffected for 2-4 gyr after infall,after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of &lt; 0.8gyr. these quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but donot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescentfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in alower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsiblefor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. because of the longtime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellarmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. this factprovides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.

1207.6105	the average star formation histories of galaxies in dark matter halos  from z=0-8	we present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates,star formation histories, and the intracluster light as a function of halomass. our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions,specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates from z=0 to z=8.we consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results,including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halomass function at the heart of our analysis. as they are relevant to our method,we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halomass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. we alsoprovide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; morerecent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellarmass density at all redshifts. implications of our work include: halos near10^12 msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryonconversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistentwith theories of cold-mode accretion), the icl for massive galaxies is expectedto be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at lowredshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previousexpectations and form later than in most theoretical models. finally, weprovide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are moreaccurate than the standard declining tau model. our approach places a widevariety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies intoa self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structureformation in lcdm. constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship andstar formation rates are available for download athttp://www.peterbehroozi.com/data.html .

1208.0832	nimbus: the near-infrared multi-band ultraprecise spectroimager for  sofia	we present a new and innovative near-infrared multi-band ultraprecisespectroimager (nimbus) for sofia. this design is capable of characterizing alarge sample of extrasolar planet atmospheres by measuring elemental andmolecular abundances during primary transit and occultation. this wide-fieldspectroimager would also provide new insights into trans-neptunian objects(tno), solar system occultations, brown dwarf atmospheres, carbon chemistry inglobular clusters, chemical gradients in nearby galaxies, and galaxyphotometric redshifts. nimbus would be the premier ultraprecise spectroimagerby taking advantage of the sofia observatory and state of the art infraredtechnologies.  this optical design splits the beam into eight separate spectral bandpasses,centered around key molecular bands from 1 to 4 microns. each spectral channelhas a wide field of view for simultaneous observations of a reference star thatcan decorrelate time-variable atmospheric and optical assembly effects,allowing the instrument to achieve ultraprecise calibration for imaging andphotometry for a wide variety of astrophysical sources. nimbus produces thesame data products as a low-resolution integral field spectrograph over a largespectral bandpass, but this design obviates many of the problems that precludehigh-precision measurements with traditional slit and integral fieldspectrographs. this instrument concept is currently not funded for development.

1208.3198	a simple model for quasar demographics	we present a simple model for the relationship between quasars, galaxies, anddark matter halos from 0.5&lt;z&lt;6. in the model, black hole (bh) mass is linearlyrelated to galaxy mass, and galaxies are connected to dark matter halos viaempirically constrained relations. a simple "scattered" light bulb model forquasars is adopted, wherein bhs shine at a fixed fraction of the eddingtonluminosity during accretion episodes, and eddington ratios are drawn from alognormal distribution that is redshift-independent. this model has two free,physically meaningful parameters at each redshift: the normalization of thembh-mgal relation and the quasar duty cycle; these parameters are fit to theobserved quasar luminosity function (lf) over the interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;6. this simplemodel provides an excellent fit to the lf at all epochs, and also successfullypredicts the observed projected two-point correlation of quasars from0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. it is significant that a single quasar duty cycle at each redshiftis capable of reproducing the extant observations. the data are thereforeconsistent with a scenario wherein quasars are equally likely to exist ingalaxies, and therefore dark matter halos, over a wide range in masses. theknee in the quasar lf is a reflection of the knee in the stellar mass-halo massrelation. future constraints on the quasar lf and quasar clustering at highredshift will provide strong constraints on the model. in the model, theautocorrelation function of quasars becomes a strong function of luminosityonly at the very highest luminosities, and will be difficult to observe becausesuch quasars are so rare. cross-correlation techniques may provide usefulconstraints on the bias of such rare objects.

1209.3013	on the lack of evolution in galaxy star formation efficiency	using reconstructed galaxy star formation histories, we calculate theinstantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formationrate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from $z=8$ to the present day. thisefficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 10^11.7msun, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the massscale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. above thecharacteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minusfour-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off atan average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. by comparison, the shapeand normalization of the efficiency change very little since z=4. we show thata time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of thecosmic star formation rate since z=4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates.the rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z=2 is especiallysensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. the mass dependence of the efficiencystrongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result thattwo-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor ofthree of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the milkyway.

1209.5390	the sluggs survey: ngc 3115, a critical test case for metallicity  bimodality in globular cluster systems	due to its proximity (9 mpc) and the strongly bimodal color distribution ofits spectroscopically well-sampled globular cluster (gc) system, the early-typegalaxy ngc 3115 provides one of the best available tests of whether the colorbimodality widely observed in gc systems generally reflects a true metallicitybimodality. color bimodality has alternatively been attributed to a stronglynonlinear color--metallicity relation reflecting the influence of hothorizontal branch stars. here we couple subaru suprime-cam gi photometry withkeck/deimos spectroscopy to accurately measure gc colors and a cat index thatmeasures the caii triplet. we find the ngc 3115 gc system to be unambiguouslybimodal in both color and the cat index. using simple stellar populationmodels, we show that the cat index is essentially unaffected by variations inhorizontal branch morphology over the range of metallicities relevant to gcsystems (and is thus a robust indicator of metallicity) and confirm bimodalityin the metallicity distribution. we assess the existing evidence for andagainst multiple metallicity subpopulations in early and late-type galaxies andconclude that metallicity bi/multimodality is common. we briefly discuss howthis fundamental characteristic links directly to the star formation andassembly histories of galaxies.

0712.0824	thermal balance in the intracluster medium: is agn feedback necessary?	a variety of physical heating mechanisms are combined with radiative coolingto explore, via one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, the expected thermalproperties of the intracluster medium (icm) in the context of the cooling flowproblem. energy injection from type ia supernovae, thermal conduction, anddynamical friction (df) from orbiting satellite galaxies are considered. thenovel feature of this work is the exploration of a wide range of efficienciesof each heating process. while the latter two can provide a substantial amountof energy, neither mechanism operating alone can produce nor maintain an icm inthermal balance over cosmological timescales, in stark contrast withobservations. for simulated clusters with initially isothermal temperatureprofiles, both mechanisms acting in combination result in long-term thermalbalance for a range of icm temperatures and for central electron densities lessthan n_e~0.02 cm^-3; at greater densities catastrophic cooling invariablyoccurs. furthermore, these heating mechanisms can neither produce nor maintainclusters with a declining temperature profile in the central regions, implyingthat the observed "cooling-core'' clusters, which have such decliningtemperature profiles, cannot be maintained with these mechanisms alone. thus,while there appears to be an abundant supply of energy capable of heating theicm in clusters, it is extremely difficult for the energy deposition to occurin such a way that the icm remains in thermal balance over cosmologicaltime-scales. these results strongly suggest that a more dynamic heating processsuch as feedback from a central black hole is required to generate theproperties of observed intracluster media.

1301.0321	strontium and barium in early-type galaxies	the detailed abundance patterns of the stars within galaxies provide a uniquewindow into the history of star formation (sf) at early times. two widely used`chronometers' include the alpha and iron-peak elements, which are created onshort and long timescales, respectively. these two clocks have been widely usedto estimate sf timescales from moderate-resolution spectra of early-typegalaxies. elements formed via s-process neutron captures (e.g., sr and ba)comprise a third type of chronometer, as the site of the main s-process isbelieved to be intermediate and low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. the[alpha/ba] ratio in particular should provide a powerful new constraint on thesf histories of galaxies, in part because it is insensitive to the uncertaindistribution of type ia sne detonation times and the overall ia rate. here wepresent new measurements of the abundance of sr and ba in nearby early-typegalaxies by applying stellar population synthesis tools to high s/n opticalspectra. we find a strong anti-correlation between [mg/fe] and [ba/fe], and astrong positive correlation between [mg/ba] and galaxy velocity dispersion.these trends are consistent with the idea that more massive galaxies formedtheir stars on shorter timescales compared to less massive galaxies, and ruleout several other proposed explanations for the observed super-solar [mg/fe]values in massive galaxies. in contrast, [sr/fe]~0, with no strong variationacross the sample. it is difficult to interpret the sr trends without detailedchemical evolution models owing to the multiplicity of proposed nucleosyntheticsites for sr.

1301.4497	the strikingly similar relation between satellite and central galaxies  and their dark matter halos since z=2	satellite galaxies in rich clusters are subject to numerous physicalprocesses that can significantly influence their evolution. however, thetypical l* satellite galaxy resides in much lower mass galaxy groups, where theprocesses capable of altering their evolution are generally weaker and have hadless time to operate. to investigate the extent to which satellite and centralgalaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (m*-mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.this relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar massfunction while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained againstrecent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2pcf). at z ~0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peaksubhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass. this isrequired in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2pcf andsatellite fractions. at low masses our model slightly under-predicts thecorrelation function at ~1 mpc scales. at z ~ 1 the satellite and centralgalaxy m*-mh relations are consistent within the errors, and the model providesan excellent fit to the clustering data. at present, the errors on theclustering data at z ~ 2 are too large to constrain the satellite model. asimple model in which satellite and central galaxies share the same m*-mhrelation is able to reproduce the extant z ~ 2 clustering data. we speculatethat the striking similarity between the satellite and central galaxy m*-mhrelations since z ~ 2 arises because the central galaxy relation evolves veryweakly with time and because the stellar mass of the typical satellite galaxyhas not changed significantly since it was accreted.

1303.7231	galaxy evolution near groups and clusters: ejected satellites and the  spatial extent of environmental quenching	galaxies that are several virial radii beyond groups/clusters showpreferentially quiescent star formation rates. using a galaxy group/clustercatalog from the sloan digital sky survey, together with a cosmological n-bodysimulation, we examine the origin of this environmental quenching beyond thevirial radius. accounting for the clustering of groups/clusters, we show thatcentral galaxies show enhanced sfr quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyondgroups/clusters, and we demonstrate that this extended environmentalenhancement can be explained simply by 'ejected' satellite galaxies that orbitbeyond their host halo's virial radius. we show that ejected satellitestypically orbit for several gyr beyond the virial radius before falling backin, and thus they compose up to 40% of all central galaxies neargroups/clusters. we show that a model in which ejected satellites experiencethe same sfr quenching as satellites within a host halo can explain essentiallyall environmental dependence of galaxy quenching. furthermore, ejectedsatellites (continue to) lose significant halo mass, an effect that ispotentially observable via gravitational lensing. the sfrs/colors andstellar-to-halo masses of ejected satellites highlight the importance ofenvironmental history and present challenges to models of galaxy occupationthat ignore such history.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

1305.2873	the stellar imf determined in early-type galaxies from a non-degenerate  set of optical line indices	we investigate the optical spectral region of spectra of 1000 stars searchingfor imf-sensitive features to constrain the low-mass end of the initial massfunction (imf) slope in elliptical galaxies. we use the miles stellar libraryin the wavelength range [3500-7500] {\aa} to select indices that are sensitiveto cool dwarf stars and that only weakly depend on age and metallicity. in thiswavelength range, the response of a change in the effective temperature of thecool red giant population is similar to the response of a change in the numberof dwarf stars in the galaxy. we investigate the degeneracy between imfvariation and teff,rgb and show that it is possible to break it with the newimf indicators defined here. in particular, we define a cah1 index around{\lambda}6380 {\aa} that arises purely from cool dwarfs, does not stronglydepend on age and is anti-correlated with [a/fe]. this index allows thedetermination of the the imf slope when combined with tio lines and age- andmetallicity-dependent features. the use of several indicators is crucial tobreak degeneracies between imf, age, abundance pattern and teff of the rgbpopulation. we measure line-index strengths of the optical imf indicators inthe ssp models and compare these with index strengths of the same features instacked ssdss early-type galaxy spectra with varying velocity dispersions.using 10 different indicators, we find a clear trend of a steepening imf withincreasing velocity dispersion described by the equationx=(2.3+-0.1)*log{\sigma}200+(2.13+-0.15), where x is the imf slope and{\sigma}200 is the central stellar velocity dispersion measured in units of200km/s. we compute the 'imf mismatch' parameter as the ratio of stellarmass-to-light ratio predicted from the x-{\sigma}200 relation to that inferredfrom ssp models assuming a salpeter imf and find good agreement withindependent published results.

1306.2316	dynamical versus stellar masses in compact early-type galaxies: further  evidence for systematic variation in the stellar initial mass function	several independent lines of evidence suggest that the stellar initial massfunction (imf) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly `bottom-heavy' withincreasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, sigma. here we considerevidence for imf variation in a sample of relatively compact early-typegalaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. these galaxies are ofsufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minorcontribution to the total dynamical mass, mdyn, within one effective radius. wefit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorptionline spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence fromimf-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy imf at high sigma. we alsoapply simple `mass-follows-light' dynamical models to the same data and findthat mdyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxieswere stellar dominated and had a universal milky way imf. adopting mdyn m_*therefore implies that the imf is `heavier' at high sigma. most importantly,the quantitative amount of inferred imf variation is very similar between thetwo techniques, agreeing to within 0.1 dex in mass. the agreement between twoindependent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compellingevidence for systematic variation in the imf as a function of early-type galaxyvelocity dispersion. any alternative explanations must reproduce both theresults from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques.

1306.3990	stellar mass-gap as a probe of halo assembly history and concentration:  youth hidden among old fossils	we investigate the use of the halo mass-gap statistic --- defined as thelogarithmic difference in mass between the host halo and its most massivesatellite subhalo --- as a probe of halo age and concentration. a cosmologicaln-body simulation is used to study n ~25, 000 group/cluster sized halos in themass range 10^12.5 &lt; m_halo/m_sol &lt; 10^14.5. in agreement with previous work,we find that halo mass-gap is related to halo formation time and concentration.on average, older and more highly concentrated halos have larger halomass-gaps, and this trend is stronger than the mass-concentration relation overa similar dynamic range. however, there is a large amount of scatter owing tothe transitory nature of the satellite subhalo population, which limits the useof the halo mass-gap statistic on an object-by-object basis. for example, wefind that 20% of very large halo mass-gap systems (akin to "fossil groups") areyoung, and have likely experienced a recent merger between a massive satellitesubhalo and the central subhalo. we relate halo mass-gap to the observablestellar mass-gap via abundance matching. using a galaxy group catalogconstructed from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7, we find that thestar formation and structural properties of galaxies at fixed mass show notrend with stellar mass-gap. this is despite a variation in halo-age of ~2.5gyr over ~1.2 dex in stellar mass-gap. thus, we find no evidence to suggestthat the halo formation history significantly affects galaxy properties.

1308.1099	the dust attenuation law in distant galaxies: evidence for variation  with spectral type	this letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (seds)constructed from newfirm medium-band survey photometry to constrain the dustattenuation curve in 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 galaxies. based on similarities between the fullsed shapes (0.3-8 micron), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectralclasses and stacked their photometry. as each class contains galaxies over arange in redshift, the resulting rest-frame seds are well-sampled in wavelengthand show various spectral features including halpha and the uv dust bump at2175 angstrom. we fit all composite seds with flexible stellar populationsynthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and uvbump strengths. the milky way and calzetti law provide poor fits at uvwavelengths for nearly all seds. consistent with previous studies, we find thatthe best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. there is a strongcorrelation between the best-fit dust slope and uv bump strength, with steeperlaws having stronger bumps. moreover, the attenuation curve correlates withspecific star formation rate (sfr), with more active galaxies having shallowerdust curves and weaker bumps. there is also a weak correlation withinclination. the observed trends can be explained by differences in thedust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination ofboth. our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies.first, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derivedgalaxy properties. second, the presence of a dust bump may result inunderestimated values for the uv slope, used to correct sfrs of distantgalaxies.

1308.4131	the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies: dark, bursty, gas-rich polluters	we present results from a fully cosmological, very high-resolution, lcdm"zoom-in" simulation of a group of seven field dwarf galaxies with present-dayvirial masses in the range m_vir=4.4e8-3.6e10 msun. the simulation includes ablastwave scheme for supernova feedback, a star formation recipe based on ahigh gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, a scheme for theturbulent diffusion of metals and thermal energy, and a uniform uv backgroundthat modifies the ionization and excitation state of the gas. the properties ofthe simulated dwarfs are strongly modulated by the depth of the gravitationalpotential well. all three halos with m_vir &lt; 1e9 msun are devoid of stars, asthey never reach the density threshold for star formation of 100 atoms/cc. theother four, m_vir &gt; 1e9 msun dwarfs have blue colors, low star formationefficiencies, high cold gas to stellar mass ratios, and low stellarmetallicities. their bursty star formation histories are characterized by peakspecific star formation rates in excess of 50-100 1/gyr, far outside the realmof normal, more massive galaxies, and in agreement with observations of extremeemission-line starbursting dwarfs by the cosmic assembly near-ir deepextragalactic legacy survey. metal-enriched galactic outflows produce sub-solareffective yields and pollute with heavy elements a mpc-size region of theintergalactic medium, but are not sufficient to completely quench starformation activity and are not ubiquitous in our dwarfs. within the limitedsize of the sample, our simulations appear to simultaneously reproduce theobserved stellar mass and cold gas content, resolved star formation histories,stellar kinematics, and metallicities of field dwarfs in the local volume.

1308.6590	star clusters in m31. v. evidence for self-enrichment in old m31  clusters from integrated spectroscopy	in the past decade, the notion that globular clusters (gcs) are composed ofcoeval stars with homogeneous initial chemical compositions has been challengedby growing evidence that they host an intricate stellar population mix, likelyindicative of a complex history of star formation and chemical enrichment.several models have been proposed to explain the existence of multiple stellarpopulations in gcs, but no single model provides a fully satisfactory match toexisting data. correlations between chemistry and global parameters such ascluster mass or luminosity are fundamental clues to the physics of gcformation. in this letter, we present an analysis of the mean abundances of fe,mg, c, n, and ca for 72 old gcs from the andromeda galaxy. we show for thefirst time that there is a correlation between the masses of gcs and the meanstellar abundances of nitrogen, spanning almost two decades in mass. thisresult sheds new light on the formation of gcs, providing important constraintson their internal chemical evolution and mass loss history.

1310.4177	direct measurements of dust attenuation in z~1.5 star-forming galaxies  from 3d-hst: implications for dust geometry and star formation rates	the nature of dust in distant galaxies is not well understood, and untilrecently few direct dust measurements have been possible. we investigate dustin distant star-forming galaxies using near-infrared grism spectra of the3d-hst survey combined with archival multi-wavelength photometry. these dataallow us to make a direct comparison between dust around star-forming regions($a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$) and the integrated dust content ($a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$).we select a sample of 163 galaxies between $1.36\le{}z\le1.5$ with h$\alpha$signal-to-noise ratio $\ge5$ and measure balmer decrements from stacked spectrato calculate $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$. first, we stack spectra in bins of$a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, and find that$a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}=1.86\,a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, with a significance of$\sigma=1.7$. our result is consistent with the two-component dust model, inwhich galaxies contain both diffuse and stellar birth cloud dust. next, westack spectra in bins of specific star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{ssfr}$),star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{sfr}$), and stellar mass ($\log{}m_*$). wefind that on average $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$ increases with sfr and mass, butdecreases with increasing ssfr. interestingly, the data hint that the amount ofextra attenuation decreases with increasing ssfr. this trend is expected fromthe two-component model, as the extra attenuation will increase once olderstars outside the star-forming regions become more dominant in the galaxyspectrum. finally, using balmer decrements we derive dust-corrected h$\alpha$sfrs, and find that stellar population modeling produces incorrect sfrs ifrapidly declining star formation histories are included in the exploredparameter space.

1310.7020	exploring the chemical link between local ellipticals and their  high-redshift progenitors	we present keck/mosfire k-band spectroscopy of the first mass-selected sampleof galaxies at $z\sim2.3$. targets are selected from the 3d-hst treasurysurvey. the six detected galaxies have a mean [nii]$\lambda$6584/h$\alpha$ratio of $0.27\pm0.01$, with a small standard deviation of 0.05. this meanvalue is similar to that of uv-selected galaxies of the same mass. the meangas-phase oxygen abundance inferred from the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratios depends onthe calibration method, and ranges from 12+log(o/h)$_{gas}=8.57$ for the{pettini} &amp; {pagel} (2004) calibration to 12+log(o/h)$_{gas}= 8.87$ for the{maiolino} {et~al.} (2008) calibration. measurements of the stellar oxygenabundance in nearby quiescent galaxies with the same number density indicate12+log(o/h)$_{stars}= 8.95$, similar to the gas-phase abundances of the$z\sim2.3$ galaxies if the {maiolino} {et~al.} (2008) calibration is used. thissuggests that these high-redshift star forming galaxies may be progenitors oftoday's massive early-type galaxies. the main uncertainties are the absolutecalibration of the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the incompleteness of the$z\sim2.3$ sample: the galaxies with detected h$\alpha$ tend to be larger andhave higher star formation rates than the galaxies without detected h$\alpha$,and we may still be missing the most dust-obscured progenitors.

1401.5472	simultaneous modeling of the stellar and dust emission in distant  galaxies: implications for star formation rate measurements	we have used near-ultraviolet (nuv) to mid-infrared (mir) composite spectralenergy distributions (seds) to simultaneously model the attenuated stellar anddust emission of 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 galaxies. these composite seds were previouslyconstructed from the photometric catalogs of the newfirm medium-band survey, bystacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-framenuv-to-nir seds. in this work, we include a stacked mips 24 micron measurementfor each sed type to extend the seds to rest-frame mir wavelengths. consistentwith previous studies, the observed mir emission for most sed types is higherthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. we fit the nuv-to-mircomposite seds by the flexible stellar population synthesis (sps) models, whichinclude both stellar and dust emission. we compare the best-fit star formationrates (sfrs) to the sfrs based on simple uv+ir estimators. interestingly, theuv and ir luminosities overestimate sfrs - compared to the model sfrs - by morethan ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forminggalaxies in our sample the two sfrs are broadly consistent. the difference inspecific sfrs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specificsfr, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific sfrs thanpreviously found. contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the uvand the mir seds most likely explain the discrepancy. based on this work, weconclude that sfrs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellarand dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple uv+ir-based sfrestimators.

1404.0402	parametrising star formation histories	we examine the star formation histories (sfhs) of galaxies in smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations, compare them to parametric modelsthat are commonly used in fitting observed galaxy spectral energydistributions, and examine the efficacy of these parametric models as practicaltools for recovering the physical parameters of galaxies. the commonly usedtau-model, with sfr ~ exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the sfh of our sphgalaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads tosystematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. aone-parameter lin-exp model, with sfr ~ t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successfulon average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, mostactively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. weintroduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear rampafter a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. wetest the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1)the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellarpopulation ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full sph starformation histories using the fsps code of conroy et al. (2009). fits withtau-models systematically overestimate m/l by ~ 0.2 dex, overestimatepopulation ages by ~ 1-2 gyr, and underestimate ssfr by ~ 0.05 dex. fits withlin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the bestresults for the full range of galaxies. marginalizing over the free parametersof the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is ourrecommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

1406.0838	reversal of fortune: increased star formation efficiencies in the early  histories of dwarf galaxies?	on dwarf galaxy scales, the different shapes of the galaxy stellar massfunction and the dark halo mass function require a star-formation efficiency(sfe) in these systems that is currently more than 1 dex lower than that ofmilky way-size halos. here, we argue that this trend may actually be reversedat high redshift. specifically, by combining the resolved star-formationhistories of nearby isolated dwarfs with the simulated mass-growth rates ofdark matter halos, we show that the assembly of these systems occurs in twophases: (1) an early, fast halo accretion phase with a rapidly deepeningpotential well, characterized by a high sfe; and (2) a late slow halo accretionphase where, perhaps as a consequence of reionization, the sfe is low. nearbydwarfs have more old stars than predicted by assuming a constant or decreasingsfe with redshift, a behavior that appears to deviate qualitatively from thetrends seen amongst more massive systems. taken at face value, the data suggestthat, at sufficiently early epochs, dwarf galaxy halos above the atomic coolingmass limit can be among the most efficient sites of star formation in theuniverse.

1406.3026	preventing star formation in early-type galaxies with late-time stellar  heating	we revisit previous suggestions that the heating provided by the winds ofdying low-mass stars plays an important role in preventing star formation inquiescent galaxies. at the end of their asymptotic giant branch phase,intermediate and low-mass stars eject their envelopes rapidly in a super-windphase, usually giving rise to planetary nebulae. in spheroidal galaxies withhigh stellar velocity dispersions, the interaction of these ejected envelopeswith the ambient diffuse gas can lead to significant, isotropic andsteady-state heating that scales as $\dot{m}_\ast\sigma_\ast^2$. we show thatcooling of the central regions of the hot diffuse halo gas can be delayed for ahubble time for halos more massive than $\sim10^{12.5}m_{\odot}$ at $0&lt;z&lt;2$,although stellar heating alone is unlikely to forestall cooling in the mostmassive clusters at $z=0$. this mechanism provides a natural explanation forthe strong trend of galaxy quiescence with stellar surface density and velocitydispersion. in addition, since the ejected material will thermalize to$kt\sim\sigma_\ast^2$, this mechanism provides an explanation for the observedsimilarity between the central temperature of the hot diffuse gas and$\sigma_\ast^2$, a result which is not trivial in light of the short inferredcooling times of the hot gas. the main uncertainty in this analysis is theultimate fate of the stellar ejecta. preventing accumulation of the ejecta inthe central regions may require energy input from another source, such as typeia supernovae. detailed simulations of the interaction of the stellar wind withthe ambient gas are required to better quantify the net effect of agb heating.

1409.2832	comparing simple quasar demographics models	this paper explores several simple model variations for the connections amongquasars, galaxies, and dark matter halos for redshifts 1 &lt; z &lt; 6. a keycomponent of these models is that we enforce a self-consistent black hole (bh)history by tracking both bh mass and bh growth rate at all redshifts. weconnect objects across redshift with a simple constant-number-densityprocedure, and choose a fiducial model with a relationship between bh andgalaxy growth rates that is linear and evolves in a simple way with redshift.within this fiducial model, we find the quasar luminosity function (qlf) bycalculating an "intrinsic" luminosity based on either the bh mass or bh growthrate, and then choosing a model of quasar variability with either a lognormalor truncated power-law distribution of instantaneous luminosities. this givesfour model variations, which we fit to the observed qlf at each redshift. withthe best-fit models in hand, we undertake a detailed comparison of the fourfiducial models, and explore changes to our fiducial model of the bh-galaxyrelationship. each model variation can successfully fit the observed qlf, theshape of which is generally set by the "intrinsic" luminosity at the faint endand by the scatter due to variability at the bright end. we focus on accountingfor the reasons that physically different models can make such similarpredictions, and on identifying what observational data or physical argumentsare most essential in breaking the degeneracies among models.

1409.4772	the very faint end of the uv luminosity function over cosmic time:  constraints from the local group fossil record	we present a new technique to estimate the evolution of the very faint end ofthe uv luminosity function (lf) out to $z\sim5$. measured star formationhistories (sfhs) from the fossil record of local group galaxies are used toreconstruct the lf down to m$_{uv}\sim-5$ at $z\sim5$ and m$_{uv}\sim-1.5$ at$z&lt;1$. such faint limits are well beyond the current observational limits andare likely to remain beyond the limits of next generation facilities. thereconstructed lfs, when combined with direct measurements of the lfs at higherluminosity, are well-fit by a standard schechter function with no evidence of abreak to the faintest limits probed by this technique. the derived faint endslope, $\alpha$, steepens from $\approx-1.2$ at $z&lt;1$ to $\approx-1.6$ at$4&lt;z&lt;5$. we test the effects of burstiness in the sfhs and find the recoveredlfs to be only modestly affected. incompleteness corrections for the faintestlocal group galaxies and the (unlikely) possibility of significantluminosity-dependent destruction of dwarf galaxies between high redshift andthe present epoch are important uncertainties. these and other uncertaintiescan be mitigated with more detailed modeling and future observations. thereconstructed faint end lf from the fossil record can therefore be a powerfuland complementary probe of the high redshift faint galaxies believed to play akey role in the reionization of the universe.

1409.8676	the sluggs survey: globular cluster stellar population trends from weak  absorption lines in stacked spectra	as part of the sluggs survey, we stack 1137 keck deimos spectra of globularclusters from 10 galaxies to study their stellar populations in detail. thestacked spectra have median signal to noise ratios of $\sim 90$ \aa$^{-1}$.besides the calcium triplet, we study weaker sodium, magnesium, titanium andiron lines as well as the h$\alpha$ and higher order paschen hydrogen lines. ingeneral, the stacked spectra are consistent with old ages and a milky way-likeinitial mass function. however, we see different metal line index strengths atfixed colour and magnitude, and differences in the calcium triplet--colourrelation from galaxy to galaxy. we interpret this as strong evidence forvariations in the globular cluster colour--metallicity relation betweengalaxies. two possible explanations for the colour--metallicity relationvariations are that the average ages of globular clusters vary from galaxy togalaxy or that the average abundances of light elements (i.e. he, c, n and o)differ between galaxies. stacking spectra by magnitude, we see that the coloursbecome redder and metal line indices stronger with brighter magnitudes. thesetrends are consistent with the previously reported `blue tilts' beingmass--metallicity relations.

1410.0007	fluctuation spectroscopy: a new probe of old stellar populations	we introduce a new method to determine the relative contributions ofdifferent types of stars to the integrated light of nearby early-type galaxies.as is well known, the surface brightness of these galaxies shows pixel-to-pixelfluctuations due to poisson variations in the number of giant stars.differential spectroscopy of pixels as a function of fluctuation strength("fluctuation spectroscopy") effectively measures the spectral variation ofstars as a function of their luminosity, information that is otherwisedifficult to obtain for individual stars outside of the local group. we applythis technique to the elliptical galaxy ngc 4472, using hst/acs imaging in sixnarrow-band ramp filters tuned to spectral features in the range 0.8-1.0micron. pixels with +- 5% broad-band variations show differential colorvariations of 0.1% - 1.0% in the narrow-band filters. these variations areprimarily due to the systematic increase in tio absorption strength withincreasing luminosity on the upper giant branch. the data are very wellreproduced by the same conroy &amp; van dokkum (2012) stellar population synthesismodel that is the best fit to the integrated light, with residuals in the range0.03% - 0.09%. models with ages or metallicities that are significantlydifferent from the integrated-light values do not yield good fits. we can alsorule out several modifications to the underlying model, including the presenceof a significant (&gt;3% of the light) population of late m giants. the currentobservations constitute a powerful test of the expected luminosities andtemperatures of metal-rich giants in massive early-type galaxies. studies ofpixels with much larger (negative) fluctuations will provide unique informationon main sequence stars and the stellar initial mass function.

1410.4570	stellar models of multiple populations in globular clusters. i. the main  sequence of ngc 6752	we present stellar atmosphere and evolution models of main sequence stars intwo stellar populations of the galactic globular cluster ngc 6752. thesepopulations represent the two extremes of light-element abundance variations inthe cluster. ngc 6752 is a benchmark cluster in the study of multiple stellarpopulations because of the rich array of spectroscopic abundances andpanchromatic hubble space telescope photometry. the spectroscopic abundancesare used to compute stellar atmosphere and evolution models. the syntheticspectra for the two populations show significant differences in the ultravioletand, for the coolest temperatures, in the near-infrared. the stellar evolutionmodels exhibit insignificant differences in the h-r diagram except on the lowermain sequence. the appearance of multiple sequences in the colour-magnitudediagrams (cmds) of ngc 6752 is almost exclusively due to spectral effectscaused by the abundance variations. the models reproduce the observed splittingand/or broadening of sequences in a range of cmds. the ultraviolet cmds aresensitive to variations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen but the models are notreliable enough to directly estimate abundance variations from photometry. onthe other hand, the widening of the lower main sequence in the near-infraredcmd, driven by oxygen-variation via the water molecule, is well-described bythe models and can be used to estimate the range of oxygen present in a clusterfrom photometry. we confirm that it is possible to use multiband photometry toestimate helium variations among the different populations, with the caveatthat the estimated amount of helium-enhancement is model-dependent.

0804.2475	the void phenomenon explained	we use high-resolution n-body simulations, combined with a halo occupationmodel of galaxy bias, to investigate voids in the galaxy distribution. our goalis to address the 'void phenomenon' of peebles (2001), which presents theobserved dearth of faint galaxies in voids as a challenge to the currentcosmology. in our model, galaxy luminosity is determined only as a function ofdark matter halo mass. with this simple assumption, we demonstrate that large,empty voids of ~15 mpc/h in diameter are expected even for galaxies sevenmagnitudes fainter than l*. the predictions of our model are in excellentagreement with several statistical measures; (i) the luminosity function ofgalaxies in underdense regions, (ii) nearest neighbor statistics of dwarfgalaxies, (iii) the void probability function of faint galaxies. in thetransition between filaments and voids in the dark matter, the halo massfunction changes abruptly, causing the maximum galaxy luminosity to decrease by~5 magnitudes over a range of ~1 mpc/h. thus the boundary between filaments andvoids in the galaxy distribution is nearly as sharp for dwarfs as for ~l*objects. these results support a picture in which galaxy formation is drivenpredominantly by the mass of the host dark matter halo, and is nearlyindependent of the larger-scale halo environment. further, they demonstratethat lcdm, combined with a straightforward bias model, naturally explains theexistence of the void phenomenon.

1503.02661	the sinfoni nearby elliptical lens locator survey: discovery of two new  low-redshift strong lenses and implications for the initial mass function in  giant early-type galaxies	we present results from a blind survey to identify strong gravitationallenses among the population of low-redshift early-type galaxies. the sinfoninearby elliptical lens locator survey (snells) uses integral-field infraredspectroscopy to search for lensed emission line sources behind massive lenscandidates at $z$&lt;0.055. from 27 galaxies observed, we have recovered onepreviously-known lens (eso325-g004) at $z$=0.034, and discovered two newsystems, at $z$=0.031 and $z$=0.052. all three lens galaxies have high velocitydispersions (\sigma&gt;300 km/s) and \alpha-element abundances ([mg/fe]&gt;0.3). fromthe lensing configurations we derive total j-band mass-to-light ratios of1.8$\pm$0.1, 2.1$\pm$0.1 and 1.9$\pm$0.2 within the $\sim$2 kpc einsteinradius. correcting for estimated dark-matter contributions, and comparing tostellar population models with a milky way (kroupa) initial mass function(imf), we determine the "mass excess factor", \alpha. assuming the lensgalaxies have "old" stellar populations (10$\pm$1 gyr), the average imf massfactor is $\langle\alpha\rangle$=1.10$\pm$0.08$\pm$0.10, where the first erroris random and the second is systematic. if we instead fit the stellarpopulations from 6df optical survey spectra, all three galaxies are consistentwith being old, but the age errors are 3-4 gyr, due to limited signal-to-noise.the imf constraints are therefore looser in this case, with$\langle\alpha\rangle$ = $1.23^{+0.16}_{-0.13}\pm{0.10}$. our results are thusconsistent with a kroupa imf (\alpha=1.00) on average, and strongly reject veryheavy imfs with \alpha&gt;2. a salpeter imf (\alpha=1.55) is inconsistent at the3.5$\sigma$ level if the galaxies are old, but cannot be excluded using ageconstraints derived from the currently-available optical spectra.

1504.00900	circumstellar dust around agb stars and implications for infrared  emission from galaxies	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are used to infer many galacticproperties including star formation histories, metallicities, and stellar anddust masses. however, most sps models neglect the effect of circumstellar dustshells around evolved stars and it is unclear to what extent they impact theanalysis of seds. to overcome this shortcoming we have created a new set ofcircumstellar dust models, using the radiative transfer code dusty ivezic etal. 1999, for asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and incorporated them intothe flexible stellar population synthesis code. the circumstellar dust modelsprovide a good fit to individual agb stars as well as the ir color-magnitudediagrams of the large and small magellanic clouds. ir luminosity functions fromthe large and small magellanic clouds are not well-fit by the 2008 padovaisochrones when coupled to our circumstellar dust models, and so we adjustedthe lifetimes of agb stars in the models to provide a match to the data. weshow, in agreement with previous work, that circumstellar dust from agb starscan make a significant contribution to the ir ($\gtrsim4\mu m$) emission fromgalaxies that contain relatively little diffuse dust, including low-metallicityand/or non-star forming galaxies. our models provide a good fit to the mid-irspectra of early-type galaxies. circumstellar dust around agb stars appears tohave a small effect on the ir seds of metal-rich star-forming galaxies (i.e.,when a$_{\rm v}$ $\gtrsim$~0.1). stellar population models that includecircumstellar dust will be needed to accurately interpret data from the jameswebb space telescope (jwst) and other ir facilities.

1504.03320	spectroscopic confirmation of the existence of large, diffuse galaxies  in the coma cluster	we recently identified a population of low surface brightness objects in thefield of the z=0.023 coma cluster, using the dragonfly telephoto array. here wepresent keck spectroscopy of one of the largest of these "ultra-diffusegalaxies" (udgs), confirming that it is a member of the cluster. the galaxy hasprominent absorption features, including the ca ii h+k lines and the g-band,and no detected emission lines. its radial velocity of cz=6280 +- 120 km/s iswithin the 1 sigma velocity dispersion of the coma cluster. the galaxy has aneffective radius of 4.3 +- 0.3 kpc and a sersic index of 0.89 +- 0.06, asmeasured from keck imaging. we find no indications of tidal tails or otherdistortions, at least out to a radius of ~2 r_e. we show that udgs are locatedin a previously sparsely populated region of the size - magnitude plane ofquiescent stellar systems, as they are ~6 magnitudes fainter than normalearly-type galaxies of the same size. it appears that the luminositydistribution of large quiescent galaxies is not continuous, although this couldlargely be due to selection effects. dynamical measurements are needed todetermine whether the dark matter halos of udgs are similar to those ofgalaxies with the same luminosity or to those of galaxies with the same size.

1504.03327	prospects for chemically tagging stars in the galaxy	it is now well-established that the elemental abundance patterns of starsholds key clues not only to their formation but also to the assembly historiesof galaxies. one of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellarabundance patterns as "chemical tags" to identify stars that were born in thesame molecular cloud. in this paper we assess the prospects of chemical taggingas a function of several key underlying parameters. we show that in thefiducial case of $10^4$ distinct cells in chemical space and $10^5-10^6$ starsin the survey, one can expect to detect $\sim 10^2-10^3$ groups that are $\ge5\sigma$ overdensities in the chemical space. however, we find that even verylarge overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity isdue to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. in fact, for ourfiducial model parameters, the typical $5\sigma$ overdensity is comprised ofstars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributingonly 25% of the stars. the most important factors limiting the identificationof disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells inthe chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellarpopulation. both of these factors can be improved through strategicobservational plans. while recovering individual clusters through chemicaltagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, thatdifferent cmfs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. thesedifferences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope andhigh mass cutoff of cmf and its evolution through cosmic time.

1504.04015	beacons in the dark: using novae and supernovae to detect dwarf galaxies  in the local universe	we propose that luminous transients, including novae and supernovae, can beused to detect the faintest galaxies in the universe. beyond a few mpc, dwarfgalaxies with stellar masses $&lt;10^6 m_{\odot}$ will likely be too faint and/ortoo low in surface brightness to be directly detected in upcoming large areaground-based photometric surveys. however, single epoch lsst photometry will beable to detect novae to distances of $\sim30$ mpc and sne to gpc-scaledistances. depending on the form of the stellar mass-halo mass relation and theunderlying star formation histories of low mass dwarfs, the expected nova rateswill be a few to $\sim100$ yr$^{-1}$ and the expected sn rates (including bothtype ia and core-collapse) will be $\sim10^2-10^4$ within the observable($4\pi$ sr) volume. the transient rate associated with intrahalo stars will becomparably large, but these transients will be located close to brightgalaxies, in contrast to the dwarfs, which should trace the underlying largescale structure of the cosmic web. aggressive follow-up of hostless transientshas the potential to uncover the predicted enormous population of low massfield dwarf galaxies.

1504.06621	the local group as a time machine: studying the high-redshift universe  with nearby galaxies	we infer the uv luminosities of local group galaxies at early cosmic times($z \sim 2$ and $z \sim 7$) by combining stellar population synthesis modelingwith star formation histories derived from deep color-magnitude diagramsconstructed from hubble space telescope (hst) observations. our analysisprovides a basis for understanding high-$z$ galaxies - including those that maybe unobservable even with the james webb space telescope (jwst) - in thecontext of familiar, well-studied objects in the very low-$z$ universe. we findthat, at the epoch of reionization, all local group dwarfs were less luminousthan the faintest galaxies detectable in deep hst observations of blank fields.we predict that jwst will observe $z \sim 7$ progenitors of galaxies similar tothe large magellanic cloud today; however, the hst frontier fields initiativemay already be observing such galaxies, highlighting the power of gravitationallensing. consensus reionization models require an extrapolation of the observedblank-field luminosity function at $z \approx 7$ by at least two orders ofmagnitude in order to maintain reionization. this scenario requires theprogenitors of the fornax and sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies to becontributors to the ionizing background at $z \sim 7$. combined with numericalsimulations, our results argue for a break in the uv luminosity function from afaint-end slope of $\alpha \sim -2$ at $m_{\rm uv} &lt; -13$ to $\alpha \sim -1.2$at lower luminosities. applied to photometric samples at lower redshifts, ouranalysis suggests that hst observations in lensing fields at $z \sim 2$ arecapable of probing galaxies with luminosities comparable to the expectedprogenitor of fornax.

0805.3346	connecting galaxies, halos, and star formation rates across cosmic time	a simple, observationally-motivated model is presented for understanding howhalo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, andhow these relations evolve with time. the relation between halo mass and galaxystellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance ofgalaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs -- i.e.more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. halosat different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimatedfrom n-body simulations. the halo--galaxy connection at fixed epochs inconjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connectionbetween observed galaxies across time. with approximations for the impact ofmerging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly inferthe star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halomass. this model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellarmass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate --stellar mass relation to z~1. the data demands, for example, that the starformation rate density is dominated by galaxies with mstar~10^{10.0-10.5} msunfrom 0&lt;z&lt;1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos withm~10^{11.5-12.5} msun. the star formation rate -- halo mass relation isapproximately gaussian over the range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a mildly evolving mean andnormalization. this model is then used to shed light on a number of issues,including 1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', 2) the lack of a sharpcharacteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and 3) thedominance of star formation over merging to the stellar build-up of galaxieswith mstar&lt;10^11 msun at z&lt;1.

1507.07563	apogee chemical tagging constraint on the maximum star cluster mass in  the $\alpha$-enhanced galactic disk	stars born from the same molecular cloud should be nearly homogeneous intheir element abundances. the concept of chemical tagging is to identifymembers of disrupted clusters by their clustering in element abundance space.chemical tagging requires large samples of stars with precise abundances formany individual elements. with uncertainties of $\sigma_{[x/{\rm fe}]}$ and$\sigma_{\rm [fe/h]} \simeq 0.05$ for 10 elements measured for $&gt;10^4$ stars,the apogee dr12 spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this ideainto practice. we find that even apogee data offer only $\sim 500$ independentvolume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space, when we focus on the$\alpha$-enhanced galactic disk. we develop and apply a new algorithm to searchfor chemically homogeneous sets of stars against a dominant background. byinjecting star clusters into the apogee data set we show that chemicallyhomogeneous clusters with masses $\gtrsim 3 \times 10^7 \, {\rm m}_\odot$ wouldbe easily detectable and yet no such signal is seen in the data. bygeneralizing this approach, we put a first abundance-based constraint on thecluster mass function for the old disk stars in the milky way.

1509.01253	the imf-sensitive 1.14-micron na i doublet in early-type galaxies	we present j-band spectroscopy of passive galaxies focusing on the na idoublet at 1.14 {\mu}m. like the na i 0.82 {\mu}m doublet, this feature isstrong in low-mass stars and hence may provide a useful probe of the initialmass function (imf). from high signal-to-noise composite spectra, we find thatna i 1.14 {\mu}m increases steeply with increasing velocity dispersion,{\sigma}, and for the most massive galaxies (\sigma &gt; 300 km/s) is muchstronger than predicted from synthetic spectra with milky-way-like imfs andsolar abundances. reproducing na i 1.14 {\mu}m at high {\sigma} likely requireseither a very high [na/h], or a bottom-heavy imf, or a combination of both.using the na d line to break the degeneracy between imf and abundance, we infer[na/h] $\approx$ +0.5 and a steep imf (single-slope-equivalent x $\approx$ 3.2,where x = 2.35 for salpeter), for the high-\sigma galaxies. at lower mass({\sigma} = 50-100 km/s), the line strengths are compatible with mw-like imfsand near-solar [na/h]. we highlight two galaxies in our sample where stronggravitational lensing masses favour mw-like imfs. like the high-{\sigma} sampleon average, these galaxies have strong na i 1.14 \mu m; taken in isolationtheir sodium indices imply bottom-heavy imfs which are hard to reconcile withthe lensing masses. an alternative full-spectrum-fitting approach, applied tothe high-\sigma sample, recovers an imf less heavy than salpeter, butunder-predicts the na i 1.14 \mu m line at the 5{\sigma} level. we concludethat current models struggle to reproduce this feature in the most massivegalaxies without breaking other constraints, and caution against over-relianceon the sodium lines in spectroscopic imf studies.

1511.04086	ubiquitous time variability of integrated stellar populations	long period variable stars arise in the final stages of the asymptotic giantbranch phase of stellar evolution. they have periods of up to ~1000d andamplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the i-band flux. these starspulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of massand radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of theunderlying stellar population. the overall number of long period variables in apopulation is directly related to their lifetime, which is difficult to predictfrom first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellarmass-loss and convective mixing. the time variability of these stars has notbeen previously taken into account when modeling the spectral energydistributions of galaxies. here we construct time-dependent stellar populationmodels that include the effects of long period variable stars, and report theubiquitous detection of this expected `pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-richgalaxy m87. the pixel light curves display a variety of behaviors, includinglinearly rising and falling curves, semi-periodic curves, and sudden increasesor decreases in the flux level. the observed variation of 0.1-1% is very wellmatched to the predictions of our models. the data provide a strong and novelconstraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellarpopulation, and we infer that the lifetime of long period variables in m87 isshorter by approximately 30% compared to predictions from the latest stellarevolution models.

1512.03834	are the formation and abundances of metal-poor stars the result of dust  dynamics?	large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relativeto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. small, high-redshift galaxies (beforereionization) represent ideal environments for this process. we show via simplearguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected inlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. this can haveimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremelymetal-poor stars. low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almostimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity istoo low for fragmentation to occur. the abundances of these 'promoted' starsmay contain interesting signatures, as the cno abundances (concentrated inlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and mg and si (in large silicate grains)can be enhanced or fluctuate independently. remarkably, otherwise puzzlingabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standardcore-collapse sne yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. wealso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements inthese species agrees with our simulations. moreover, we confirm mg and si arecorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in localsilicate grains. meanwhile [mg/ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from puresne yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,preferentially in the [c/fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. this suggests that (1)dust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratiofluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) lightelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dustwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis.

astro-ph;0508250	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of void statistics from  z~1 to z~0	we present measurements of the void probability function (vpf) at z~1 usingdata from the deep2 redshift survey and its evolution to z~0 using data fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we measure the vpf as a function of galaxycolor and luminosity in both surveys and find that it mimics trends displayedin the two-point correlation function, $\xi$; namely that samples of brighter,red galaxies have larger voids (i.e. are more strongly clustered) than fainter,blue galaxies. we also clearly detect evolution in the vpf with cosmic time,with voids being larger in comoving units at z~0. we find that the reduced vpfmatches the predictions of a `negative binomial' model for galaxies of allcolors, luminosities, and redshifts studied. this model lacks a physicalmotivation, but produces a simple analytic prediction for sources of any numberdensity and integrated two-point correlation function, \bar{\xi}. this impliesthat differences in the vpf across different galaxy populations are consistentwith being due entirely to differences in the population number density and\bar{\xi}. the robust result that all galaxy populations follow the negativebinomial model appears to be due to primarily to the clustering of dark matterhalos. the reduced vpf is insensitive to changes in the parameters of the halooccupation distribution, in the sense that halo models with the same \bar{\xi}will produce the same vpf. for the wide range of galaxies studied, the vpftherefore does not appear to provide useful constraints on galaxy evolutionmodels that cannot be gleaned from studies of \bar{\xi} alone.

astro-ph;0512234	modeling luminosity-dependent galaxy clustering through cosmic time	we employ high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance lcdmcosmology to model the observed luminosity dependence and evolution of galaxyclustering through most of the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. we use asimple, non-parametric model which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities tothe maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (v_max) by preserving theobserved galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulationswith observed galaxies. the novel feature of the model is the use of themaximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, v_max,acc, for subhalos,the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. we argue that forsubhalos in dissipationless simulations, v_max,acc reflects the luminosity andstellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity atthe epoch of observation, v_max,now. the simulations and our model l-v_maxrelation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of thetwo-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxyclustering in the sdss data at z~0 and in the deep2 samples at z~1 over theentire probed range of projected separations, 0.1&lt;r_p/(mpc/h)&lt;10.0. inparticular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from thepower-law form in the sdss and deep2 luminosity-selected samples is reproducedvery well. at z~3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape andamplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn.

astro-ph;0607204	evolution in the halo masses of isolated galaxies between z~1 and z~0:  from deep2 to sdss	we measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (m_{200}/l_b) andvirial-to-stellar mass ratio (m_{200}/m_\ast) for isolated ~ l* galaxiesbetween z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey andthe sloan digital sky survey. utilizing the motions of satellite galaxiesaround isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions andderive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. at both epochsthe velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,\sigma\propto m_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocitydispersion and host galaxy b-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from\sigma\propto l_b^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto l_b^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.the evolution in m_200/m_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar ashost galaxies with stellar mass below m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h maintain aconstant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)while host galaxies above m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. this result can be easilyunderstood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form starswhile star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the darkmatter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordancewith lcdm cosmological simulations. host galaxies that are red in u-b colorhave larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massivehalos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. the redshift and host galaxystellar mass dependence of m_200/m_\ast agrees qualitatively with themillennium run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

0809.4261	the propagation of uncertainties in stellar population synthesis  modeling i: the relevance of uncertain aspects of stellar evolution and the  imf to the derived physical properties of galaxies	the stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories ofgalaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (sps)techniques. sps relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequenceto stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, andstellar initial mass functions (imfs). the present work is the first in aseries that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellarevolution and the imf on the derived physical properties of galaxies and theexpected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. amonte-carlo markov-chain approach is taken to fit near-uv through near-irphotometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies withthis new sps model. significant results include the following: 1) includinguncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z~0 carry errors of ~0.3dex at 95% cl with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z~2, themasses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level; 2) eithercurrent stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, orboth, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of thethermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates onthe uncertainty of the slope of the imf in the solar neighborhood imply thatluminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level inthe k-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting theevolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) the more plausible assumptionof a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as isusually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colorsblueward of the v-band.

0706.0520	constraints on the merging timescale of luminous red galaxies, or, where  do all the halos go?	in the lcdm cosmology dark matter halos grow primarily through the accretionof smaller halos. much of the mass in a halo of 10^14msun comes in throughaccretion of ~10^13msun halos. if each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy(lrg) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed numberof lrgs in clusters unless these accreted lrgs merge or disrupt on relativelyshort timescales (~2gyr). these timescales are consistent with classicaldynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 lrgs have merged or disruptedwithin each halo more massive than 10^14msun by z=0. the total amount ofstellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent withobservations once the intracluster light (icl) is included. if disrupted lrgsbuild up the icl, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that asubstantial amount of icl should also surround satellite lrgs, as suggested byrecent observations of the virgo cluster. finally, we point out that theseresults are entirely consistent with a non-evolving clustering strength andhalo occupation distribution, and note that observations of the latter in factsupport the hypothesis that merging/disruption of massive galaxies does indeedtake place at late times.
