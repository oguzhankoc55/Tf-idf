0901.0419	modeling and reproducibility of suzaku hxd pin/gso background	suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) achieved the lowest background level thanany other previously or currently operational missions sensitive in the energyrange of 10--600 kev, by utilizing pin photodiodes and gso scintillatorsmounted in the bgo active shields to reject particle background andcompton-scattered events as much as possible. because it does not have imagingcapability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity islimited by the reproducibility of the non x-ray background (nxb) model. wemodeled the hxd nxb, which varies with time as well as other satellites with alow-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitorcounts and satellite orbital/attitude information. the model background issupplied as an event file in which the background events are generated byrandom numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. thereproducibility of the nxb model depends on the event selection criteria (suchas cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigmasystematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (pin 15--40 kev) and 1% (gso50--100 kev) for more than 10 ksec exposure.

0901.4626	a galaxy merger scenario for the ngc 1550 galaxy from metal  distributions in the x-ray emitting plasma	the elliptical galaxy ngc 1550 at a redshift of $z=0.01239$, identified withan extended x-ray source rx j0419+0225, was observed with {\it xmm-newton} for31 ks. from the x-ray data and archival near infra-red data of two micron allsky survay, we derive the profiles of components constituting the ngc 1550system; the gas mass, total mass, metal mass, and galaxy luminosity. the metals(oxygen, silicon, and iron) are extended to $\sim 200$ kpc from the center,wherein $\sim$ 70% of the $k$-band luminosity is carried by ngc 1550 itself. asfirst revealed with {\it asca}, the data reconfirms the presence of a darkhalo, of which the mass ($1.6 \times 10^{13} m_{\odot}$) is typical of a galaxygroup rather than of a single galaxy. within 210 kpc, the $k$-bandmass-to-light ratio reaches $75 m_{\odot}/l_{\odot}$, which is comparable tothose of clusters of galaxies. the iron-mass-to-light ratio profile (silicon-and oxygen mass-to-light ratio profiles as well) exhibits about two orders ofmagnitude decrease toward the center. further studies comparing mass densitiesof metals with those of the other cluster components reveal that the iron (aswell as silicon) in the icm traces very well the total gravitating mass,whereas the stellar component is significantly more concentrated to withinseveral tens kpc of the ngc 1550 nucleus. thus, in the central region, theamount of metals is significantly depleted for the luminous galaxy light. amonga few possible explanations of this effect, the most likely scenario is thatgalaxies in this system were initially much more extended than today, andgradually fell to the center and merged into ngc 1550.

0907.2283	suzaku observation of the metallicity distribution in the elliptical  galaxy ngc 4636	ngc 4636, an x-ray bright elliptical galaxy, was observed for 70 ks withsuzaku. the low background and good energy resolution of the xis enable us toestimate the foreground galactic emission accurately and hence measure, for thefirst time, the o, mg, si and fe abundances out to a radius of ~28 arcmin($\simeq$ 140 kpc). these metal abundances are as high as $&gt;$1 solar within thecentral 4' and decrease by ~50% towards the outer regions. further, the o to feabundance ratio is about 0.60--1.0 solar in all regions analyzed, indicatingthat the products of both sne ii and sne ia have mixed and diffused to theouter regions of the galaxy. the o and fe metal mass-to-light-ratios (mlr) ofngc 4636 are 2--3 times larger than those of ngc 1399 implying that metaldistributions in ngc 4636 are less extended than those in ngc 1399, possiblydue to environmental factors, such as frequency of galaxy interaction. we alsofound that the mlrs of ngc 4636 at 0.1 $r_{180}$ are $\sim$5 times smaller thanthose of clusters of galaxies, possibly consistent with the correlation betweentemperature and mlr of other spherically symmetric groups of galaxies. we alsoconfirmed a resonant scattering signature in the fe$_{xv ii}}$ line in thecentral region, as previously reported using the xmm-newton rgs.

0911.5205	suzaku constraints on the soft and hard excess emissions from abell 2199	the nearby ($z=0.03015$) cluster of galaxies abell~2199 was observed bysuzaku in x-rays, with five pointings for $\sim 20$ ks each. from the xis data,the temperature and metal abundance profiles were derived out to $\sim 700$ kpc(0.4 times virial radius). both these quantities decrease gradually from thecenter to peripheries by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the oxygen abundance tendsto be flat. the temperature within 12' ($\sim 430$ kpc) is $\sim 4$ kev, andthe 0.5--10 kev x-ray luminosity integrated up to 30' is $(2.9 \pm 0.1) \times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous xmm-newton measurements.above this thermal emission, no significant excess was found either in the xisrange below $\sim 1$ kev, or in the hxd-pin range above $\sim 15$ kev. the90%-confidence upper limit on the emission measure of an assumed 0.2 kev warmgas is (3.7--7.5) $\times 10^{62}$ cm$^{-3}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, which is 3.7--7.6times tighter than the detection reported with xmm-newton. the 90%-confidenceupper limit on the 20--80 kev luminosity of any power law component is $1.8\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, assuming a photon index of 2.0. although thisupper limit does not reject the possible 2.1$\sigma$ detection by the bepposaxpds, it is a factor of 2.1 tighter than that of the pds if both are consideredupper limits. the non-detection of the hard excess can be reconciled with theupper limit on diffuse radio emission, without invoking the very low magneticfields ($&lt; 0.073 \mu$g) which were suggested previously.

0707.3867	low/hard state spectra of gro j1655-40 observed with suzaku	the galactic black-hole binary gro j1655$-$40 was observed with suzaku on2005 september 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) and 20 ks with the hard x-ray detector (hxd). the source wasdetected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 kev, with anintensity of $\sim$50 mcrab at 20 kev. at a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300kev luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of theeddington luminosity for a 6 $m_{\odot}$ black hole). the source was in atypical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photonindex of $\sim 1.6$. during the observation, the source intensity graduallydecreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ kev, and by 35% below 2 kev. this,together with the soft x-ray spectra taken with the xis, suggests the presenceof an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from acool ($\sim 0.2$ kev) disk. the hard x-ray spectra obtained with the hxd reveala high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ kev.since the spectral photon index above 10 kev is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than thatobserved in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher thanthose of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 kev spectrum cannot bereproduced by a single thermal comptonization model, even consideringreflection effects. instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can besuccessfully explained by invoking two thermal-comptonization components withdifferent $y$-parameters. in contrast to the high/soft state spectra of thisobject in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalentwidths of 60--100 ev, the present xis spectra bear no such features beyond anupper-limit equivalent width of 25 ev.

1002.4811	suzaku observation of abell 1689: anisotropic temperature and entropy  distributions associated with the large-scale structure	(abridged) we present results of suzaku observations of the intraclustermedium (icm) in abell 1689, combined with complementary analysis of the sdssdata and weak and strong lensing analysis of subaru/suprime-cam and hst/acsobservations. faint x-ray emission from the icm around the virial radius isdetected at 4.0 sigma significance. we find anisotropic gas temperature andentropy distributions in cluster outskirts correlated with large-scalestructure of galaxies. the high temperature and entropy region in thenortheastern (ne) outskirts is connected to an overdense filamentary structure.the outskirt regions in contact with low density void environments have low gastemperatures and entropies, deviating from hydrostatic equilibrium. theseresults suggest that thermalization of the icm occurs faster along thefilamentary structures than the void regions. a joint x-ray and lensinganalysis shows that the hydrostatic mass is $\sim60-90%$ of spherical lensingone but comparable to a triaxial halo mass within errors in $0.6r_{2500} \simltr \simlt 0.8r_{500}$, and that it is significantly biased as low as $\simlt60%$within $0.4r_{2500}$, irrespective of mass models. the thermal gas pressurewithin $r_{500}$ is, at most, $\sim50$--60% of the total pressure to balancefully the gravity of the spherical lensing mass, and $\sim30$--40% around thevirial radius. although these constitute lower limits when one considers thepossible halo triaxiality, these small relative contributions of thermalpressure would require additional sources of pressure, such as bulk and/orturbulent motions.

1003.2031	multiband photopolarimetric monitoring of the outburst of the blazar  3c~454.3 in 2007	we report on optical-near-infrared photopolarimetric observations of a blazar3c 454.3 over 200 d. the object experienced an optical outburst in july 2007.this outburst was followed by a short state fainter than $v=15.2$ mag lasting$\sim 25$ d. the object, then, entered an active state during which we observedshort flares having a timescale of 3-10 d. the object showed two types offeatures in the color-magnitude relationship. one is a "bluer-when-brighter"trend in the outburst state, and the other is a "redder-when-brighter" trend inthe faint state. these two types of features suggest a contribution of athermal emission to the observed flux, as suspected in previous studies. ourpolarimetric observation detected two episodes of the rotation of thepolarization vector. the first one was a counterclockwise rotation in the $qu$plane during the outburst state. after this rotation event of the polarizationvector, the object entered a rapidly fading stage. the second one was seen in aseries of flares during the active state. each flare had a specific positionangle of polarization, and it apparently rotated clockwise from the first tothe last flares. thus, the object exhibited rotations of the polarizationvector in opposite directions. we estimated a decay timescale of the shortflares during the active state, and then calculated an upper limit of thestrength of the magnetic field, $b$=0.2 g, assuming a typical beaming factor ofblazars, $\delta=20$. this upper limit of $b$ is smaller than those previouslyestimated from spectral analysis.

1008.0432	optical and near-infrared photometry of nova v2362 cyg : rebrightening  event and dust formation	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry of a classical nova,v2362 cyg (= nova cygni 2006). v2362 cyg experienced a peculiar rebrighteningwith a long duration from 100 to 240 d after the maximum of the nova. ourmulticolor observation indicates an emergence of a pseudophotosphere with aneffective temperature of 9000 k at the rebrightening maximum. after therebrightening maximum, the object showed a slow fading homogeneously in all ofthe used bands for one week. this implies that the fading just after therebrightening maximum ( less or equal 1 week ) was caused by a slowly shrinkingpseudophotosphere. then, the nir flux drastically increased, while the opticalflux steeply declined. the optical and nir flux was consistent with blackbodyradiation with a temperature of 1500 k during this nir rising phase. thesefacts are likely to be explained by dust formation in the nova ejecta. assumingan optically thin case, we estimate the dust mass of 10^(-8) -- 10^(-10)m_solar, which is less than those in typical dust-forming novae. these resultssupport the senario that a second, long-lasting outflow, which caused therebrightening, interacted with a fraction of the initial outflow and formeddust grains.

1010.4997	soft gamma-ray detector for the astro-h mission	astro-h is the next generation jaxa x-ray satellite, intended to carryinstruments with broad energy coverage and exquisite energy resolution. thesoft gamma-ray detector (sgd) is one of astro-h instruments and will featurewide energy band (40-600 kev) at a background level 10 times better than thecurrent instruments on orbit. sgd is complimentary to astro-h's hard x-rayimager covering the energy range of 5-80 kev. the sgd achieves low backgroundby combining a compton camera scheme with a narrow field-of-view active shieldwhere compton kinematics is utilized to reject backgrounds. the compton camerain the sgd is realized as a hybrid semiconductor detector system which consistsof silicon and cdte (cadmium telluride) sensors. good energy resolution isafforded by semiconductor sensors, and it results in good background rejectioncapability due to better constraints on compton kinematics. utilization ofcompton kinematics also makes the sgd sensitive to the gamma-ray polarization,opening up a new window to study properties of gamma-ray emission processes.the astro-h mission is approved by isas/jaxa to proceed to a detailed designphase with an expected launch in 2014. in this paper, we present sciencedrivers and concept of the sgd instrument followed by detailed description ofthe instrument and expected performance.

1011.1750	fe-k line probing of material around the agn central engine with suzaku	we systematically analyzed the high-quality suzaku data of 88 seyfertgalaxies. we obtained a clear relation between the absorption column densityand the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$,suggesting a wide-ranging column density of $10^{23-24.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ with asimilar solid and a fe abundance of 0.7--1.3 solar for seyfert 2 galaxies. theew of the 6.4 kev line for seyfert 1 galaxies are typically 40--120 ev,suggesting the existence of compton-thick matter like the torus with a columndensity of $&gt;10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a solid angle of $(0.15-0.4)*4pi$, and nodifference of neutral matter is visible between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. anabsorber with a lower column density of $10^{21-23}$ cm$^{-2}$ for compton-thinseyfert 2 galaxies is suggested to be not a torus but an interstellar medium.these constraints can be understood by the fact that the 6.4 kev line intensityratio against the 10--50 kev flux is almost identical within a range of 2--3 inmany seyfert galaxies. interestingly, objects exist with a low ew, 10--30 ev,of the 6.4 kev line, suggesting that those torus subtends only a small solidangle of $&lt;0.2*4pi$. ionized fe-k$\alpha$ emission or absorption lines aredetected from several percents of agns. considering the ionization state andequivalent width, emitters and absorbers of ionized fe-k lines can be explainedby the same origin, and highly ionized matter is located at the broad lineregion. the rapid increase in ew of the ionized fe-k emission lines at$n_{h}&gt;10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ is found, like that of the cold material. it is foundthat these features seem to change for brighter objects with more than several$10^{44}$ erg/s such that the fe-k line features become weak. we discuss thisfeature, together with the torus structure.

0709.1278	pogolite - a high sensitivity balloon-borne soft gamma-ray polarimeter	we describe a new balloon-borne instrument (pogolite) capable of detecting10% polarisation from 200mcrab point-like sources between 25 and 80kev in one 6hour flight. polarisation measurements in the soft gamma-ray band are expectedto provide a powerful probe into high-energy emission mechanisms as well as thedistribution of magnetic fields, radiation fields and interstellar matter. atpresent, only exploratory polarisation measurements have been carried out inthe soft gamma-ray band. reduction of the large background produced bycosmic-ray particles has been the biggest challenge. pogolite uses comptonscattering and photo-absorption in an array of 217 well-type phoswich detectorcells made of plastic and bgo scintillators surrounded by a bgo anticoincidenceshield and a thick polyethylene neutron shield. the narrow fov (1.25msr)obtained with well-type phoswich detector technology and the use of thickbackground shields enhance the detected s/n ratio. event selections based onrecorded phototube waveforms and compton kinematics reduce the background tothat expected for a 40-100mcrab source between 25 and 50kev. a 6 hourobservation on the crab will differentiate between the polar cap/slot gap,outer gap, and caustic models with greater than 5 sigma; and also cleanlyidentify the compton reflection component in the cygnus x-1 hard state. thefirst flight is planned for 2010 and long-duration flights from sweden tonorthern canada are foreseen thereafter.

1102.1856	prominent polarized flares of the blazars ao 0235+164 and pks 1510-089	we report on multi-band photometric and polarimetric observations of theblazars ao 0235+164 and pks 1510-089. these two blazars were active in 2008 and2009, respectively. in these active states, prominent short flares wereobserved in both objects, having amplitudes of &gt;1 mag within 10 d. the $v-j$color became bluer when the objects were brighter in these flares. on the otherhand, the color of pks 1510-089 exhibited a trend that it became redder when itwas brighter, except for its prominent flare. this redder-when-brighter trendcan be explained by the strong contribution of thermal emission from anaccretion disk. the polarization degree increased at the flares, and reached&gt;25 % at the maxima. we compare these flares in ao 0235+164 and pks 1510-089with other short flares which were detected by our monitoring of 41 blazars.those two flares had one of the largest variation amplitudes in both flux andpolarization degree. furthermore, we found a significant positive correlationbetween the amplitudes of the flux and polarization degree in the short flares.it indicates that the short flares originate from the region where the magneticfield is aligned.

1105.0255	photopolarimetric monitoring of blazars in the optical and near-infrared  bands with the kanata telescope. i. correlations between flux, color, and  polarization	we report on the correlation between the flux, color and polarizationvariations on time scales of days--months in blazars, and discuss theiruniversal aspects. we performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical andnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using trispec attached to the "kanata"1.5-m telescope. we found that 28 blazars exhibited "bluer-when-brighter"trends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. this corresponds to88% of objects that were observed for &gt;10 days. thus, our observationunambiguously confirmed that the "bluer-when-brighter" trend is common in theemission from blazar jets. this trend was apparently generated by a variationcomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying redcomponent. prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended toexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decayphases around the flare maxima. in contrast to the strong flux--colorcorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relativelyweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. rotations ofpolarization were detected only in three objects: pks 1510-089, 3c 454.3, andpks 1749+096, and possibly in s5 0716+714. we also investigated the dependenceof the degree of variability on the luminosity and the synchrotron peakfrequency, \nu_peak. as a result, we found that lower luminosity and higher\nu_peak objects had smaller variations in their amplitudes both in the flux,color, and polarization degree. our observation suggests the presence ofseveral distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,colors, and polarizations. we propose that the energy injection by, forexample, internal shocks in relativistic shells is a major factor for blazarvariations on time scales of both days and months.

1107.4857	improvements in calibration of gso scintillators in the suzaku hard  x-ray detector	improvements of in-orbit calibration of gso scintillators in the hard x-raydetector on board suzaku are reported. to resolve an apparent change of theenergy scale of gso which appeared across the launch for unknown reasons,consistent and thorough re-analyses of both pre-launch and in-orbit data havebeen performed. with laboratory experiments using spare hardware, the pulseheight offset, corresponding to zero energy input, was found to change by ~0.5of the full analog voltage scale, depending on the power supply. furthermore,by carefully calculating all the light outputs of secondaries from activationlines used in the in-orbit gain determination, their energy deposits in gsowere found to be effectively lower, by several percent, than their nominalenergies. taking both these effects into account, the in-orbit data agrees withthe on-ground measurements within ~5%, without employing the artificialcorrection introduced in the previous work (kokubun et al. 2007). with thisknowledge, we updated the data processing, the response, and the auxiliaryfiles of gso, and reproduced the hxd-pin and hxd-gso spectra of the crab nebulaover 12-300 kev by a broken powerlaw with a break energy of ~110 kev.

1302.0095	suzaku observations of abell 1835 outskirts: deviation from hydrostatic  equilibrium	we present results of four-pointing suzaku x-ray observations (total ~200 ks)of the intracluster medium (icm) in the abell 1835 galaxy cluster (kt ~ 8 kev,z = 0.253) out to the virial radius (r_vir ~ 2.9 mpc) and beyond. faint x-rayemission from the icm out to r_vir is detected. the temperature graduallydecreases with radius from ~8 kev in the inner region to ~2 kev at r_vir. theentropy profile is shown to flatten beyond r_500, in disagreement with ther_1.1 dependence predicted from the accretion shock heating model. the thermalpressure profile in the range 0.3r_500 &lt; r &lt; r_vir agrees well with thatobtained from the stacked sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations with theplanck satellite. the hydrostatic mass profile in the cluster outskirts (r_500&lt; r &lt; r_vir) falls well short of the weak lensing one derived fromsubaru/suprime-cam observations, showing an unphysical decrease with radius.the gas mass fraction at r_vir defined with the lensing total mass agrees withthe cosmic baryon fraction from the wmap 7-year data. all these resultsindicate, rather than the gas-clumping effect, that the bulk of the icm in thecluster outskirts is far from hydrostatic equilibrium and infalling matterretained some of its kinetic energy. finally, combining with our recent suzakuand lensing analysis of abell 1689, a cluster of similar mass, temperature, andredshift, we show that the cluster temperature distribution in the outskirts issignificantly correlated with the galaxy density field in the surroundinglarge-scale environment at (1-2)r_vir.

1303.7109	spectral variation of the hard x-ray emission from the crab nebula with  the suzaku hard x-ray detector	the crab nebula is one of the brightest and most stable sources in the x-raysky. year-scale flux variation from the object was recently revealed in thehard x-ray band by four satellites. this marked the first detection ofyear-scale variability from pulsar wind nebulae in the hard x-ray band. thecrab nebula has been observed at least once a year for calibration purposeswith the suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) since its launch in 2005. in order toinvestigate possible spectral changes as well as flux variation, the archivaldata of the hxd were analyzed. the flux variation reported by other instrumentswas confirmed in the 25 -- 100 kev band by the hxd in a few percent level, butflux above 100 kev did not follow the trend in variation below 100 kev. thehardness ratios produced utilizing the pin and gso sensors installed in the hxdexhibit significant scattering, thereby indicating spectral variations in thehard x-ray. the spectral changes are quantified by spectral fitting with abroken power-law model. the difference between the two photon indexes of thebroken power-law model in harder and softer energy bands is in the range of &lt;2.54. taking into account flux variation of 6.3% and spectral variationtime-scale of a few days, multi components of the broken power-law-shapedsynchrotron emission with different cooling times are suggested.

0801.2432	spectral properties of prompt emission of four short gamma-ray bursts  observed by the suzaku-wam and the konus-wind	we have performed a joint analysis of prompt emission from four bright shortgamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the suzaku-wam and the konus-wind experiments.this joint analysis allows us to investigate the spectral properties ofshort-duration bursts over a wider energy band with a higher accuracy. we findthat these bursts have a high e$_{\rm peak}$, around 1 mev and have a harderpower-law component than that of long grbs. however, we can not determinewhether these spectra follow the cut-off power-law model or the band model. wealso investigated the spectral lag, hardness ratio, inferred isotropicradiation energy and existence of a soft emission hump, in order to classifythem into short or long grbs using several criteria, in addition to the burstduration. we find that all criteria, except for the existence of the soft hump,support the fact that our four grb samples are correctly classified asbelonging to the short class. in addition, our broad-band analysis revealedthat there is no evidence of grbs with a very large hardness ratio, as seen inthe batse short grb sample, and that the spectral lag of our four short grbs isconsistent with zero, even in the mev energy band, unlike long grbs. althoughour short grb samples are still limited, these results suggest that thespectral hardness of short grbs might not differ significantly from that oflong grbs, and also that the spectral lag at high energies could be a strongcriterion for burst classification.

1311.5531	a balloon-borne measurement of high latitude atmospheric neutrons using  a licaf neutron detector	pogolino is a scintillator-based neutron detector. its main purpose is toprovide data on the neutron flux in the upper stratosphere at high latitudes atthermal and nonthermal energies for the pogolite instrument. pogolite is aballoon borne hard x-ray polarimeter for which the main source of backgroundstems from high energy neutrons. no measurements of the neutron environment forthe planned flight latitude and altitude exist. furthermore this neutronenvironment changes with altitude, latitude and solar activity, three variablesthat will vary throughout the pogolite flight. pogolino was developed to studythe neutron environment and the influences from these three variables upon it.pogolino consists of two europium doped lithium calcium aluminium fluoride(eu:licaf) scintillators, each of which is sandwiched between 2 bismuthgermanium oxide (bgo) scintillating crystals, which serve to veto signalsproduced by gamma-rays and charged particles. this allows the neutron flux tobe measured even in high radiation environments. measurements of neutrons intwo separate energy bands are achieved by placing one licaf detector inside amoderating polyethylene shield while the second detector remains unshielded.the pogolino instrument was launched on march 20th 2013 from the esrange spacecenter in northern sweden to an altitude of 30.9 km. a description of thedetector design and read-out system is presented. a detailed set of simulationsof the atmospheric neutron environment performed using both planetocosmics andgeant4 will also be described. the comparison of the neutron flux measuredduring flight to predictions based on these simulations will be presented andthe consequences for the pogolite background will be discussed.

1402.6192	extremely high polarization in 2010 outburst of blazar 3c 454.3	the gamma-ray-detected blazar 3c 454.3 exhibits dramatic flux andpolarization variations in the optical and near-infrared bands. in december2010, the object emitted a very bright outburst. we monitored it forapproximately four years (including the 2010 outburst) by optical andnear-infrared photopolarimetry. during the 2010 outburst, the object emittedtwo rapid, redder brightenings, at which the polarization degrees (pds) in bothbands increased significantly and the bands exhibited a frequency-dependentpolarization. the observed frequency-dependent polarization leads us to proposethat the polarization vector is composed of two vectors. therefore, we separatethe observed polarization vectors into short and long-term components that weattribute to the emissions of the rapid brightenings and the outburst thatvaried the timescale of days and months, respectively. the estimated pd of theshort-term component is greater than the maximum observed pd and is close tothe theoretical maximum pd. we constrain the bulk lorentz factors andinclination angles between the jet axis and the line of sight from theestimated pds. in this case, the inclination angle of the emitting region ofshort-term component from the first rapid brightening should be equal to90$^{\circ}$, because the estimated pd of the short-term component wasapproximately equal to the theoretical maximum pd. thus, the doppler factor atthe emitting region of the first rapid brightening should be equal to the bulklorentz factor.

1403.2455	long-lasting x-ray emission from type iib supernova 2011dh and mass-loss  history of the yellow supergiant progenitor	type iib supernova (sn) 2011dh, with conclusive detection of an unprecedentedyellow supergiant (ysg) progenitor, provides an excellent opportunity to deepenour understanding on the massive star evolution in the final centuries towardthe sn explosion. in this paper, we report on detection and analyses of thermalx-ray emission from sn iib 2011dh at ~500 days after the explosion on chandraarchival data, providing a solidly derived mass loss rate of an ysg progenitorfor the first time. we find that the circumstellar media (csm) should be dense,more than that expected from a wolf-rayet (wr) star by one order of magnitude.the emission is powered by a reverse shock penetrating into an outer envelope,fully consistent with the ysg progenitor but not with a wr progenitor. thedensity distribution at the outermost ejecta is much steeper than that expectedfrom a compact wr star, and this finding must be taken into account in modelingthe early uv/optical emission from sne iib. the derived mass loss rate is 3 x10^{-6} msun/year for the mass loss velocity of ~20 km/s in the final ~1,300years before the explosion. the derived mass loss properties are largelyconsistent with the standard wind mass loss expected for a giant star. this isnot sufficient to be a main driver to expel nearly all the hydrogen envelope.therefore, the binary interaction, with a huge mass transfer having taken placeat &gt;1,300 years before the explosion, is a likely scenario to produce the ysgprogenitor.

1410.2733	suzaku observations of gamma-ray bright radio galaxies: origin of the  x-ray emission and broad-band modelin	we performed a systematic x-ray study of eight nearby gamma-ray bright radiogalaxies with suzaku for understanding the origin of their x-ray emissions. thesuzaku spectra for five of those have been presented previously, while theremaining three (m87, pks0625-354, and 3c78) are presented here for the firsttime. based on the fe-k line strength, x-ray variability, and x-ray power-lawphoton indices, and using additional information on the [o iii] line emission,we argue for a jet origin of the observed x-ray emission in these threesources. we also analyzed five years of fermi large area telescope (lat) gevgamma-ray data on pks0625-354 and 3c78 to understand these sources within theblazar picture. we found significant gamma-ray variability in the formerobject. overall, we note that the suzaku spectra for both pks0625-354 and 3c78are rather soft, while the lat spectra are unusually hard when compared withother gamma-ray detected low-power (fr i) radio galaxies. we demonstrate thatthe constructed broad-band spectral energy distributions of pks0625-354 and3c78 are well described by a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-comptonmodel. the results of the modeling indicate lower bulk lorentz factors comparedto those typically found in other bl lac objects, but consistent with thevalues inferred from modeling other lat-detected fr\,i radio galaxies.interestingly, the modeling also implies very high peak ($\sim 10^{16}$ hz)synchrotron frequencies in the two analyzed sources, contrary topreviously-suggested scenarios for fr i/bl lac unification. we discuss theimplications of our findings in the context of the fr i/bl lac unificationschemes.

1502.02802	study for relation between direction of relativistic jet and optical  polarization angle with multi-wavelength observation	blazars are thought to possess a relativistic jet that is pointing toward thedirection of the earth and the elect of relativistic beaming enhances itsapparent brightness. they radiate in all wavebands from the radio to thegamma-ray bands via the synchrotron and the inverse compton scattering process.numerous observations are performed but the mechanism of variability, creationand composition of jets are still controversial.  we performed multi-wavelength monitoring with optical polarization for 3c66a, mrk 421, cta 102 and pmn j0948+0022 to investigate the mechanisms ofvariability and research the emission region in the relativistic jets.consequently, an emergence of new emission component in flaring state issuggested in each object. the most significant aspect of these results is itswide range of sizes of emission regions from $10^{14}-10^{16}$ cm, whichimplies the model with a number of independent emission regions with varietysizes and randomly orientation. the "shock-in-jet" scenario can explain high pdand direction of pa in each objects. it might reflect the common mechanism offlares in the relativistic jets.

astro-ph;0104079	x-ray probing of the central regions of clusters of galaxies	results of asca x-ray study of central regions of medium-richness clusters ofgalaxies are summarized, emphasizing differences between cd and non-cdclusters. the intra-cluster medium (icm) is likely to consist of two (hot andcool) phases within $\sim 100$ kpc of a cd galaxy, where the icm metallicity isalso enhanced. in contrast, the icm in non-cd clusters appears to be isothermalwith little metallicity gradient right to the center. the gravitationalpotential exhibits a hierarchical nesting around cd galaxies, while a totalmass-density profile with a central cusp is indicated for a non-cd clusterabell~1060. the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the icm decreases toward the centerin both types of clusters, although it is radially constant in peripheralregions. the silicon-to-iron abundance ratio in the icm increases with thecluster richness, but remains close to the solar ratio around cd galaxies.these overall results are interpreted without appealing to the popularcooling-flow hypothesis. instead, an emphasis is put on the halo-in-halostructure formed around cd galaxies.

astro-ph;0105510	excess hard x-ray emission from the obscured low luminosity agn in the  nearby galaxy m 51 (ngc 5194)	we observed the nearby galaxy m~51 (ngc 5194) with bepposax. the x-rayproperties of the nucleus below 10 kev are almost the same as the asca resultsregarding the hard component and the neutral fe k$\alpha$ line, but theintensity is about half of the asca 1993 data. beyond this, in the bepposax pdsdata, we detected a bright hard x-ray emission component which dominates above10 kev. the 10 -- 100 kev flux and luminosity of this component arerespectively $2\times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $2\times10^{41}$ ergs$^{-1}$. these are about 10 times higher than the extrapolation from the softx-ray band, and similar to the flux observed with ginga, which found a brightpower law component in 2 -- 20 kev band. considering other wavelengthproperties and the x-ray luminosity, together with strong neutral fe k line,the hard x-ray emission most likely arises from a low luminosity activenucleus, which is obscured with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$.this suggests that hidden low luminosity agns may well be present in othernearby galaxies. we interpret the discrepancy between ginga and other x-raysatellites to be due to a large variability of absorption column density towardthe line of sight over several years, suggesting that the compton thickabsorption material may be present on a spatial scale of a parsec. apart fromthe nucleus, several ultra-luminous off-nuclear x-ray sources detected in m~51exhibit long-term time variability, suggesting the state transition similar tothat observed in galactic black hole candidates.

astro-ph;0205197	search for hot gas in the local group with asca	an x-ray study was made to examine whether some part of the soft x-raybackground is coming from hot gas in the local group. for this purpose, fourconsecutive pointings were made with asca toward a sky region between m 31 andm 33, which is close to the direction of the center of the local group. bycomparing the x-ray surface brightness in this sky direction with that inanother blank sky region near the north equatorial pole, an upper limit on anysoft excess x-ray background was determined to be 2.8$\times10^{-9}$ ergcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ with a 90% confidence level statistical error.assuming an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung energy spectrum(raymond-smith model) for a temperature of 1 kev and a $\beta$-model electrondensity distribution for a core radius of 100 kpc for the x-ray halo, the upperlimit of the central plasma density was obtained to be 1.3$\times10^{-4}$cm$^{-3}$. the plasma column density is too low to contribute significantly tothe observed quadrupole anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;0207011	extended thermal x-ray emission from the spiral-dominant group of  galaxies hcg 57	we observed a group of galaxies, hcg 57, with asca. regardless that theirmember galaxies are dominated by spiral galaxies, we detected extended thermalx-ray emission that is attributed to hot gas with a temperature of$1.04\pm0.10$ kev. this is the second clear detection of thermal x-ray emissionfrom a spiral-dominant group of galaxies after hcg 92. the luminosity of thethermal emission is about $5\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5--10 kevband, which is higher than that of hcg 92, but relatively less luminous amonggroups of galaxies. the x-ray emission is extended over several membergalaxies, and is thus associated with the group rather than an individualgalaxy. the metal abundance cannot be well constrained with a lower limit of0.08 solar. the gas-to-stellar mass ratio is $\sim0.3$. although this isrelatively low among groups, the hot gas is also a significant component evenin the spiral-dominant group. we suggest that the x-ray faintness ofspiral-dominant groups is due to the low surface brightness and somewhat lowgas mass, at least in the case of hcg 57.

astro-ph;0405172	reflection component in the hard x-ray emission from the seyfert 2  galaxy mrk 1210	the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 1210 was found to exhibit a flat hard x-raycomponent by asca, although asca could not distinguish whether it is anabsorbed direct component or a reflected one. we then observed mrk 1210 withbepposax, and found that the x-ray spectral properties are quite different fromthose of asca, as have been confirmed with xmm-newton; the flux issignificantly higher than that in the asca observation, and a clear absorptioncut-off appears below 5 kev. a bright hard x-ray emission is detected up to 100kev. the reflection component is necessary to describe the bepposax pdsspectrum, and represents the asca hard component very well. therefore, the hardcomponent in the asca spectrum is a reflected one, whose intensity is almostconstant over 6 years. this indicates that a dramatic spectral variability isattributed to a large change of the absorption column density by a factor of&gt;5, rather than the variability of the nuclear emission. the change in theabsorption-column density means that the torus is not homogeneous, but has ablobby structure with a typical blob size of &lt; 0.001

astro-ph;0410126	a prototype si/cdte compton camera and the polarization measurement	a compton camera is the most promising approach for gamma-ray detection inthe energy region from several hundred kev to mev, especially for applicationin high energy astrophysics. in order to obtain good angular resolution,semiconductor detectors such as silicon, germanium and cadmium telluride(cdte)have several advantages over scintillation detectors, which have been used sofar. based on the recent advances of high resolution cdte and silicon imagingdetectors, we are working on a si/cdte compton camera. we have developed64-pixel cdte detectors with a pixel size of 2mmx2mm and double-sided si stripdetectors(dssds) with a position resolution of 800 micron. as a prototypesi/cdte compton camera, we use a dssd as a scatterer and two cdte pixeldetectors as an absorber. in order to verify its performance, we irradiate thecamera with 100% linearly polarised 170kev gamma-rays and demonstrate thesystem works properly as a compton camera. the resolution of the reconstructedscattering angle is 22 degrees(fwhm). measurement of polarization is alsoreported. the polarimetric modulation factor is obtained to be 43%, which isconsistent with the prediction of monte carlo simulations.

astro-ph;0411745	asca compilation of x-ray properties of hot gas in elliptical galaxies  and galaxy clusters: two breaks in the temperature dependences	utilizing asca archival data of about 300 objects of elliptical galaxies,groups, and clusters of galaxies, we performed systematic measurements of thex-ray properties of hot gas in their systems, and compiled them in this paper.the steepness of the luminosity--temperature (lt) relation, $l_{\rmx}\propto(kt)^{\alpha}$, in the range of $kt=$1.5--15 kev is$\alpha=3.17\pm0.15$, consistent with previous measurements. in the relation,we find two breaks at around icm temperatures of 1 kev and 4 kev:$\alpha=2.34\pm0.29$ above 4 kev, $3.74\pm0.32$ in 1.5--5 kev, and$4.03\pm1.07$ below 1.5 kev. such two breaks are also evident in thetemperature and size relation. the steepness in the lt relation at $kt&gt;4$ kevis consistent with the scale-relation derived from the cdm model, indicatingthat the gravitational effect is dominant in richer clusters, while poorerclusters suffer non-gravity effects. the steep lt relation below 1 kev isalmost attributed to x-ray faint systems of elliptical galaxies and galaxygroups. we found that the icm mass within the scaling radius $r_{1500}$ followsthe relation of $m_{\rm gas}\propto t^{2.33\pm0.07}$ from x-ray faint galaxiesto rich clusters. therefore, we speculate that even such x-ray faint systemscontain a large-scale hot gas, which is too faint to detect.

astro-ph;0509520	three spectral states of the disk x-ray emission of the black-hole  candidate 4u 1630-47	we studied a time history of x-ray spectral states of a black-hole candidate,4u 1630-47, utilizing data from a number of monitoring observations with therossi x-ray timing explorer over 1996--2004. these observations covered fiveoutbursts of 4u 1630-47, and most of the data recorded typical features of thehigh/soft states. we found that the spectra in the high/soft states can befurther classified into three states. the first spectral state is explained bya concept of the standard accretion disk picture. the second state appears inthe so-called very high state, where a dominant hard component is seen and thedisk radius apparently becomes too small. these phenomena are explained by theeffect of inverse compton scattering of disk photons, as shown by kubota,makishima, &amp; ebisawa (2001, apj, 560, l147) for gro j1655-40. the third stateis characterized in such a way that the disk luminosity varies in proportion to$t_{\rm in}^2$, rather than $t_{\rm in}^4$, where $t_{\rm in}$ is theinner-disk temperature. this state is suggested to be an optically-thick andadvection-dominated slim disk, as suggested by kubota &amp; makishima (2004, apj,601, 428) for xte j1550-564. the second and third states appear, with goodreproducibility, when $t_{\rm in}$ and the total x-ray luminosity are higherthan 1.2 kev and $\sim2.5\times10^{38}(d/10\quad{\rm kpc})^2\left[\cos{\theta}/(1/\sqrt{3})]^{-1}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively, where $d$ isthe distance to the object and $\theta$ is the inclination angle to the disk.the present results suggest that these three spectral states commonly appearamong black-hole binaries under high accretion rates.
