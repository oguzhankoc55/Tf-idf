0904.4251	angular momentum transport in extended galactic disks	we demonstrate a significant difference in the angular momentum transportproperties of galactic disks between regions in which the interstellar mediumis single phase or two phase. our study is motivated by observations of hi inextended galactic disks which indicate velocity dispersions of nonthermalorigin, suggesting that turbulence in the gas may be contributing significantlyto the observed dispersion. to address this, we have implemented a shearing-boxframework within the flash code. the new code was used to perform localsimulations of galactic disks that incorporate differential rotation,self-gravity, vertical stratification, hydrodynamics and cooling. thesesimulations explore plausible mechanisms for driving turbulent motions via thethermal and self-gravitational instabilities coupling to differential rotation.where a two-phase medium develops, gravitational angular momentum transportingstresses are much greater, creating a possible mechanism for transferringenergy from galactic rotation to turbulence. in simulations where the diskconditions do not trigger the formation of a two-phase medium, it is found thatperturbations to the flow damp without leading to a sustained mechanism fordriving turbulence. the differing angular momentum transport properties of thesingle- and two-phase regimes of the disk suggest that a significant,dynamically motivated division can be drawn between the two, even when thisdivision occurs far outside the star formation cutoff in a galactic disk.

1001.4991	estimating small angular scale cmb anisotropy with high resolution  n-body simulations: weak lensing	we estimate the impact of weak lensing by strongly nonlinear cosmologicalstructures on the cosmic microwave background. accurate calculation of large$\ell$ multipoles requires n-body simulations and ray-tracing schemes with bothhigh spatial and temporal resolution. to this end we have developed a new codethat combines a gravitational adaptive particle-particle, particle-mesh (ap3m)solver with a weak lensing evaluation routine. the lensing deviations areevaluated while structure evolves during the simulation so that all evolutionsteps--rather than just a few outputs--are used in the lensing computations.the new code also includes a ray-tracing procedure that avoids periodicityeffects in a universe that is modeled as a 3-d torus in the standard way.results from our new simulations are compared with previous ones based onparticle-mesh simulations. we also systematically investigate the impact of boxvolume, resolution, and ray-tracing directions on the variance of the computedpower spectra. we find that a box size of $512 h^{-1}$ mpc is sufficient toprovide a robust estimate of the weak lensing angular power spectrum in the$\ell$-interval (2,000--7,000). for a reaslistic cosmological model the power$[\ell(\ell+1)c_{\ell}/2\pi]^{1/2}$ takes on values of a few $\mu k$ in thisinterval, which suggests that a future detection is feasible and may explainthe excess power at high $\ell$ in the bima and cbi observations.

1103.3285	mechanisms of baryon loss for dark satellites in cosmological sph  simulations	we present a study of satellites in orbit around a high-resolution, smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) galaxy simulated in a cosmological context. thesimulated galaxy is approximately the same mass as the milky way. thecumulative number of luminous satellites at z = 0 is similar to the observedsystem of satellites orbiting the milky way although an analysis of thesatellite mass function reveals an order of magnitude more dark satellites thanluminous. some of the dark subhalos are more massive than some of the luminoussubhalos at z = 0. what separates luminous and dark subhalos is not their massat z = 0, but the maximum mass the subhalos ever achieve. we study the effectof four mass loss mechanisms on the subhalos: ultraviolet (uv) ionisingradiation, ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping, and stellar feedback, andcompare the impact of each of these four mechanisms on the satellites. in thelowest mass subhalos, uv is responsible for the majority of the baryonic massloss. ram pressure stripping removes whatever mass remains from the low masssatellites. more massive subhalos have deeper potential wells and retain moremass during reionisation. however, as satellites pass near the centre of themain halo, tidal forces cause significant mass loss from satellites of allmasses. satellites that are tidally stripped from the outside can account forthe luminous satellites that are lower mass than some of the dark satellites.stellar feedback has the greatest impact on medium mass satellites that hadformed stars, but lost all their gas by z = 0. our results demonstrate that themissing satellite problem is not an intractable issue with the cold dark mattercosmology, but is rather a manifestation of baryonic processes.

1111.5620	halo expansion in cosmological hydro simulations: towards a baryonic  solution of the cusp/core problem in massive spirals	a clear prediction of the cold dark matter model is the existence of cuspydark matter halo density profiles on all mass scales. this is not in agreementwith the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies, challenging on smallscales the otherwise successful cdm paradigm. in this work we employ highresolution cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations to study the effects ofdissipative processes on the inner distribution of dark matter in milky-waylike objects (m~1e12 msun). our simulations include supernova feedback, and theeffects of the radiation pressure of massive stars before they explode assupernovae. the increased stellar feedback results in the expansion of the darkmatter halo instead of contraction with respect to n-body simulations. baryonsare able to erase the dark matter cuspy distribution creating a flat, cored,dark matter density profile in the central several kpc of a massive milky-waylike halo. the profile is well fit by a burkert profile, with fittingparameters consistent with the observations. in addition, we obtain flatrotation curves as well as extended, exponential stellar disk profiles. whilethe stellar disk we obtain is still partially too thick to resemble the mw thindisk, this pilot study shows that there is enough energy available in thebaryonic component to alter the dark matter distribution even in massive discgalaxies, providing a possible solution to the long standing problem of cuspsvs. cores.

1112.0315	the aquila comparison project: the effects of feedback and numerical  methods on simulations of galaxy formation	we compare the results of thirteen cosmological gasdynamical codes used tosimulate the formation of a galaxy in the lcdm structure formation paradigm.the various runs differ in their hydrodynamical treatment (sph, moving-mesh andamr) but share the same initial conditions and adopt their latest publishedmodel of cooling, star formation and feedback. despite the common halo assemblyhistory, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size,morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=0, due mainly to the differentimplementations of feedback. compared with observation, most codes tend toproduce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas-rich than typicalspirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. a stellar disk isdiscernible in most simulations, though its prominence varies widely from codeto code. there is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and theseverity of the disagreement with observation. models that are more effectiveat limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observedgalaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disk component. ourconclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. some differences canalso be traced to the numerical techniques: more gas seems able to cool andbecome available for star formation in grid-based codes than in sph. however,this effect is small compared to the variations induced by different feedbackprescriptions. we conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yetuniquely predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, evenwhen the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. developingfeedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy withouthindering the formation of high-angular momentum stellar disks remains achallenge.

1201.6359	metallicity gradients in disks: do galaxies form inside-out?	we examine radial and vertical metallicity gradients using a suite of diskgalaxy simulations, supplemented with two classic chemical evolutionapproaches. we determine the rate of change of gradient and reconciledifferences between extant models and observations within the `inside-out' diskgrowth paradigm. a sample of 25 disks is used, consisting of 19 from our rades(ramses disk environment study) sample, realised with the adaptive meshrefinement code ramses. four disks are selected from the mugs (mcmasterunbiased galaxy simulations) sample, generated with the smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) code gasoline, alongside disks from rahimi et al. (gcd+)and kobayashi &amp; nakasato (grape-sph). two chemical evolution models ofinside-out disk growth were employed to contrast the temporal evolution oftheir radial gradients with those of the simulations. we find that systematicdifferences exist between the predicted evolution of radial abundance gradientsin the rades and chemical evolution models, compared with the mugs sample;specifically, the mugs simulations are systematically steeper at high-redshift,and present much more rapid evolution in their gradients. we find that themajority of the models predict radial gradients today which are consistent withthose observed in late-type disks, but they evolve to this self-similarity indifferent fashions, despite each adhering to classical `inside-out' growth. wefind that radial dependence of the efficiency with which stars form as afunction of time drives the differences seen in the gradients; systematicdifferences in the sub-grid physics between the various codes are responsiblefor setting these gradients. recent, albeit limited, data at redshift z=1.5 areconsistent with the steeper gradients seen in our sph sample, suggesting amodest revision of the classical chemical evolution models may be required.

1204.1051	the stellar metallicity distribution of disc galaxies and bulges in  cosmological simulations	by means of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of milkyway-like disc galaxies, we conduct an analysis of the associated stellarmetallicity distribution functions (mdfs). after undertaking a kinematicdecomposition of each simulation into spheroid and disc sub-components, wecompare the predicted mdfs to those observed in the solar neighbourhood and thegalactic bulge. the effects of the star formation density threshold are visiblein the star formation histories, which show a modulation in their behaviourdriven by the threshold. the derived mdfs show median metallicities lower by0.2-0.3 dex than the mdf observed locally in the disc and in the galacticbulge. possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy include the use of lowstellar yields and/or centrally-concentrated star formation. the dispersionsare larger than the one of the observed mdf; this could be due to simulateddiscs being kinematically hotter relative to the milky way. the fraction of lowmetallicity stars is largely overestimated, visible from the more negativelyskewed mdf with respect to the observational sample. for our fiducial milky wayanalog, we study the metallicity distribution of the stars born "in situ"relative to those formed via accretion (from disrupted satellites), anddemonstrate that this low-metallicity tail to the mdf is populated primarily byaccreted stars. enhanced supernova and stellar radiation energy feedback to thesurrounding interstellar media of these pre-disrupted satellites is suggestedas an important regulator of the mdf skewness.

1205.4796	the distribution of metals in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of  dwarf disk galaxies	we examine the chemical properties of 5 cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations of an m33-like disc galaxy which have been shown to be consistentwith the morphological characteristics and bulk scaling relations expected oflate-type spirals. these simulations are part of the making galaxies in acosmological context (magicc) project, in which stellar feedback is tuned tomatch the stellar mass -- halo mass relationship. each realisation employedidentical initial conditions and assembly histories, but differed from oneanother in their underlying baryonic physics prescriptions, including (a) theefficiency with which each supernova energy couples to the ism, (b) the impactof feedback associated with massive star radiation pressure, (c) the role ofthe minimum shut-off time for radiative cooling of type ii sne remnants, (d)the treatment of metal diffusion, and (e) varying the imf. our analysisfocusses on the resulting stellar metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) ineach simulated (analogous) `solar neighbourhood' and central `bulge' region. wecompare the simulated mdfs' skewness, kurtosis, and dispersion (inter-quartile,inter-decile, inter-centile, and inter-tenth-percentile regions) with that ofthe empirical solar neighbourhood mdf and local group dwarfs. we find that themdfs of the simulated discs are more negatively skewed, with higher kurtosis,than those observed locally. we can trace this difference to the simulations'tight and correlated age-metallicity relations (compared with that of the milkyway), suggesting that these relations within `dwarf' discs might be steeperthan in l* discs and/or the degree of stellar orbital re-distribution andmigration inferred locally has not been captured in their entirety, at theresolution of our simulations. the important role of metal diffusion inameliorating the over-production of extremely metal-poor stars is highlighted.

1207.2421	building the stellar halo through feedback in dwarf galaxies	we present a new model for the formation of stellar halos in dwarf galaxies.we demonstrate that the stars and star clusters that form naturally in theinner regions of dwarfs are expected to migrate from the gas rich, star formingcentre to join the stellar spheroid. for dwarf galaxies, this process could bethe dominant source of halo stars. the effect is caused by stellarfeedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potentialfluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionlesscomponents. this effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwisecuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxyhaloes. it can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lowermetallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model.globular cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ism and thenmigrate to the spheroid on 100\thinspace myr timescales. once outside the innerregions they are less susceptible to tidal disruption and are thus long lived;clusters on wider orbits may be easily unbound from the dwarf to join the haloof a larger galaxy during a merger. a simulated dwarf galaxy($\text{m}_{vir}\simeq10^{9}\text{m}_{\odot}$ at $z=5$) is used to examine thisgravitational coupling to dark matter and stars.

1208.0002	making galaxies in a cosmological context: the need for early stellar  feedback	we introduce the making galaxies in a cosmological context (magicc) programof smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations. we describe a parameterstudy of galaxy formation simulations of an l* galaxy that uses early stellarfeedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass--halo massrelationship. while supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enoughto match the stellar mass--halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too manystars before z=2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. ourearly stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like a uv ionizationsource as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation ofmassive, young stars. the early feedback heats gas to &gt;10^6 k before cooling to10^4 k. the pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disk andprevents more star formation prior to z=1 than supernovae feedback alone. theresulting disk galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surfacebrightness profile, and matches a wide range of disk scaling relationships. thedisk forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length asthe galaxy evolves. overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxiesthat match observational results at low and high redshifts.

1211.1975	the luminosity function of diverse satellite galaxy systems	the high-resolution, sph galaxies of the mcmaster unbiased galaxy survey(mugs) are used to examine the satellite systems of sixteen model hostgalaxies. each galaxy has a different mass, angular momentum and merger historythat yield a rich set of satellite luminosity functions. with new observationsof distant satellite systems, we can compare these luminosity functions tosatellite systems beyond the local group. we find that the luminosity functionsof our simulations compare well to observations when the luminosity functionsare scaled according to host mass. we use the recently-found relationshipbetween dwarf satellites and host mass in distant satellite systems (trentham &amp;tully 2009) to normalize a theoretical, complete luminosity function for themilky way (koposov et al. 2008). the luminosity function of satellites,expressed as a function of the host mass, is given by dn/dm_v= 3.5 xm_host^(0.91) x 10^(0.1 x m_v-10.2), where host mass is given in m_sun. themass of a host galaxy can be used to predict the number of dwarf satellites andeven when considering spiral and elliptical hosts separately this relationholds.

1301.4517	halo orbits in cosmological disk galaxies: tracers of formation history	we analyze the orbits of stars and dark matter particles in the halo of adisk galaxy formed in a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. the halo isoblate within the inner ~20 kpc and triaxial beyond this radius. about 43% oforbits are short axis tubes - the rest belong to orbit families thatcharacterize triaxial potentials (boxes, long-axis tubes and chaotic orbits),but their shapes are close to axisymmetric. we find no evidence that theself-consistent distribution function of the nearly oblate inner halo iscomprised primarily of axisymmetric short-axis tube orbits. orbits of allfamilies, and both types of particles are highly eccentric with meaneccentricity &gt;0.6. we find that randomly selected samples of halo stars show nosubstructure in "integrals of motion" space. however individual accretionevents can be clearly identified in plots of metallicity versus formation time.dynamically young tidal debris is found primarily on a single type of orbit.however, stars associated with older satellites become chaotically mixed duringthe formation process (possibly due to scattering by the central bulge anddisk, and baryonic processes), and appear on all four types of orbits. we findthat the tidal debris in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations experiencessignificantly more chaotic evolution than in collisionless simulations, makingit much harder to identify individual progenitors using phase space coordinatesalone. however by combining information on stellar ages and chemical abundanceswith the orbital properties of halo stars in the underlying self-consistentpotential, the identification of progenitors is likely to be possible.

1301.5318	magicc thick disk i: comparing a simulated disk formed with stellar  feedback to the milky way	we analyse the structure and chemical enrichment of a milky way-like galaxywith a stellar mass of 2 10^{10} m_sun, formed in a cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulation. it is disk-dominated with a flat rotation curve, and has a diskscale length similar to the milky way's, but a velocity dispersion that is ~50%higher. examining stars in narrow [fe/h] and [\alpha/fe] abundance ranges, wefind remarkable qualitative agreement between this simulation and observations:a) the old stars lie in a thickened distribution with a short scale length,while the young stars form a thinner disk, with scale lengths decreasing, as[fe/h] increases. b) consequently, there is a distinct outward metallicitygradient. c) mono-abundance populations exist with a continuous distribution ofscale heights (from thin to thick). however, the simulated galaxy has adistinct and substantive very thick disk (h_z~1.5 kpc), not seen in the milkyway. the broad agreement between simulations and observations allows us to testthe validity of observational proxies used in the literature: we find in thesimulation that mono-abundance populations are good proxies for single agepopulations (&lt;1 gyr) for most abundances.

1302.2618	the magicc volume: reproducing statistical properties of high redshift  galaxies	we present a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of a representativevolume of the universe, as part of the making galaxies in a cosmologicalcontext (magicc) project. magicc uses a thermal implementation for supernovaand early stellar feedback. this work tests the feedback model at lowerresolution across a range of galaxy masses, morphologies and merger histories.the simulated sample compares well with observations of high redshift galaxies($z \ge 2$) including the stellar mass - halo mass ($m_\star - m_h$ ) relation,the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at low masses ($m_\star \lt 5 \times10^{10} m_\odot$ ) and the number density evolution of low mass galaxies. thepoor match of $m_\star - m_h$ and the gsmf at high masses ($m_\star \ge 5\times 10^{10} m_\odot$ ) indicates supernova feedback is insufficient to limitstar formation in these haloes. at $z = 0$, our model produces too many starsin massive galaxies and slightly underpredicts the stellar mass around$l_\star$ mass galaxy. altogether our results suggest that early stellarfeedback, in conjunction with supernovae feedback, plays a major role inregulating the properties of low mass galaxies at high redshift.

1401.5489	systematic problems with using dark matter simulations to model stellar  halos	the limits of available computing power have forced models for the structureof stellar halos to adopt one or both of the following simplifying assumptions:(1) stellar mass can be "painted" onto dark matter particles in progenitorsatellites; (2) pure dark matter simulations that do not form a luminous galaxycan be used. we estimate the magnitude of the systematic errors introduced bythese assumptions using a controlled set of stellar halo models where weindependently vary whether we look at star particles or painted dark matterparticles, and whether we use a simulation in which a baryonic disk galaxyforms or a matching pure dark matter simulation that does not form a baryonicdisk. we find that the "painting" simplification reduces the halo concentrationand internal structure, predominantly because painted dark matter particleshave different kinematics than star particles even when both are buried deep inthe potential well of the satellite. the simplification of using pure darkmatter simulations reduces the concentration further, but increases theinternal structure, and results in a more prolate stellar halo. thesedifferences can be a factor of 1.5-7 in concentration (as measured by thehalf-mass radius) and 2-7 in internal density structure. given this level ofsystematic uncertainty, one should be wary of overinterpreting differencesbetween observations and the current generation of stellar halo models based ondark matter only simulations when such differences are less than an order ofmagnitude.

1401.7653	the celestial buffet: multiple populations and globular cluster  formation in dwarf galaxies	we present a framework that explains the commonly observed variation in lightelement abundances in globular clusters. if globular clusters form in thecentres of dwarf galaxies, they will be pumped onto larger orbits as starformation progresses. the potential well will only retain the moderate velocityagb ejecta, the expected source of enrichment, but not supernova ejecta. thereis no need to increase the initial cluster mass, a requirement ofself-enrichment scenarios, as all the stars within the dwarf can contribute. asthe clusters move through the dwarf centre they sweep up a mix of agb ejectaand in-falling pristine gas to form a second generation of stars. the specificmix will vary in time and is thus able to explain the spread in secondgeneration abundances observed in different clusters. the globular clusterswill survive to the present day or be stripped as part of the hierarchicalmerging process of larger galaxies. we illustrate how this process may operateusing a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy at high redshift.

1505.00825	the energetics of cusp destruction	we present a new analytic estimate for the energy required to create aconstant density core within a dark matter halo. our new estimate, based onmore realistic assumptions, leads to a required energy that is orders ofmagnitude lower than is claimed in earlier work. we define a core size based onthe logarithmic slope of the dark matter density profile so that it isinsensitive to the functional form used to fit observed data. the energyrequired to form a core depends sensitively on the radial scale over which darkmatter within the cusp is redistributed within the halo. simulations indicatethat within a region of comparable size to the active star forming regions ofthe central galaxy that inhabits the halo, dark matter particles have theirorbits radially increased by a factor of 2--3 during core formation. thus theinner properties of the dark matter halo, such as halo concentration, and finalcore size, set the energy requirements. as a result, the energy cost increasesslowly with halo mass as m$_{\rm{h}}^{0.3-0.7}$ for core sizes $\lesssim1$ kpc.we use the expected star formation history for a given dark matter halo mass topredict dwarf galaxy core sizes. we find that supernovae alone would createwell over 4 kpc cores in $10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxies \emph{if} 100% ofthe energy were transferred to dark matter particle orbits. we can directlyconstrain the efficiency factor by studying galaxies with known stellar contentand core size, such as fornax. we find that the efficiency of coupling betweenstellar feedback and dark matter orbital energy need only be at the 1% level orless to explain fornax's 1 kpc core.

1510.08187	the properties of bound and unbound molecular cloud populations formed  in galactic disc simulations	we explore the effect of galactic environment on properties of molecularclouds. using clouds formed in a large-scale galactic disc simulation, wemeasure the observable properties from synthetic column density maps. weconfirm that a significant fraction of unbound clouds forms naturally in agalactic disc environment and that a mixed population of bound and unboundclouds can match observed scaling relations and distributions for extragalacticmolecular clouds. by dividing the clouds into inner and outer disc populations,we compare their distributions of properties and test whether there arestatistically significant differences between them. we find that clouds in theouter disc have lower masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions as compared tothose in the inner disc for reasonable choices of the inner/outer boundary. weattribute the differences to the strong impact of galactic shear on the discstability at large galactocentric radii. in particular, our toomre analysis ofthe disc shows a narrowing envelope of unstable masses as a function of radius,resulting in the formation of smaller, lower mass fragments in the outer disc.we also show that the star formation rate is affected by the environment of theparent cloud, and is particularly influenced by the underlying surface densityprofile of the gas throughout the disc. our work highlights the strengths ofusing galaxy-scale simulations to understand the formation and evolution ofcloud properties - and the star formation within them - in the context of theirenvironment.

astro-ph;0001276	implementing feedback in simulations of galaxy formation: a survey of  methods	we present a detailed investigation of different approaches to modelingfeedback in simulations of galaxy formation. gas-dynamic forces are evaluatedusing smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) while star formation and supernovafeedback are included using a three parameter model which determines the starformation rate normalization, feedback energy and lifetime of feedback regions.the star formation rate is calculated using a lagrangian schmidt law for allgas particles which satisfy temperature, density and convergent flow criteria.feedback is incorporated as thermal heating of the ism. we compare the effectsof distributing this energy over the smoothing scale or depositing it on asingle particle. radiative losses are prevented from heated particles byadjusting the density used in radiative cooling. we test the models on theformation of galaxies from cosmological initial conditions and also on isolatedmilky way and dwarf galaxies. extremely violent feedback is necessary toproduce a gas disk with angular momentum remotely close to that of observeddisk galaxies. this is a result of the extreme central concentration of thedark halos in the scdm model, and the pervasiveness of the core-halo angularmomentum transport mechanism. we emphasize that the disks formed inhierarchical simulations are partially a numerical artifact produced by theminimum mass scale of the simulation acting as a highly efficient `support'mechanism. disk formation is strongly affected by the treatment of denseregions in sph, which along with the difficulty of representing thehierarchical formation process, means that realistic simulations of galaxyformation require far higher resolution than currently used.

astro-ph;0002437	weak gravitational lensing in different cosmologies, using an algorithm  for shear in three dimensions	we present the results of weak gravitational lensing statistics in fourdifferent cosmological $n$-body simulations. the data has been generated usingan algorithm for the three-dimensional shear, which makes use of a variablesoftening facility for the $n$-body particle masses, and enables a physicalinterpretation for the large-scale structure to be made. working inthree-dimensions also allows the correct use of the appropriate angulardiameter distances. our results are presented on the basis of the filled beamapproximation in view of the variable particle softening scheme in ouralgorithm. the importance of the smoothness of matter in the universe for theweak lensing results is discussed in some detail. the low density cosmologywith a cosmological constant appears to give the broadest distributions for allthe statistics computed for sources at high redshifts. in particular, the rangein magnification values for this cosmology has implications for thedetermination of the cosmological parameters from high-redshift type iasupernov\ae. the possibility of determining the density parameter from thenon-gaussianity in the probability distribution for the convergence isdiscussed.

astro-ph;0003079	simulation of primordial object formation	we have included the chemical rate network responsible for the formation ofmolecular hydrogen in the n-body hydrodynamic code, hydra, in order to studythe formation of the first cosmological at redshifts between 10 and 50. we havetested our implementation of the chemical and cooling processes by comparingn-body top hat simulations with theoretical predictions from a semi-analyticmodel and found them to be in good agreement. we find that post-virializationproperties are insensitive to the initial abundance of molecular hydrogen. ourmain objective was to determine the minimum mass ($m_{sg}(z)$) of perturbationsthat could become self gravitating (a prerequisite for star formation), and theredshift at which this occurred. we have developed a robust indicator fordetecting the presence of a self-gravitating cloud in our simulations and findthat we can do so with a baryonic particle mass-resolution of 40 solar masses.we have performed cosmological simulations of primordial objects and find thatthe object's mass and redshift at which they become self gravitating agree wellwith the $m_{sg}(z)$ results from the top hat simulations. once a criticalmolecular hydrogen fractional abundance of about 0.0005 has formed in anobject, the cooling time drops below the dynamical time at the centre of thecloud and the gas free falls in the dark matter potential wells, becoming selfgravitating a dynamical time later.

astro-ph;0005259	clustering of galaxy clusters in cdm universes	we use very large cosmological n--body simulations to obtain accuratepredictions for the two-point correlations and power spectra of mass-limitedsamples of galaxy clusters. we consider two currently popular cold dark matter(cdm) cosmogonies, a critical density model ($\tau$cdm) and a flat low densitymodel with a cosmological constant ($\lambda$cdm). our simulations each use$10^9$ particles to follow the mass distribution within cubes of side$2h^{-1}$gpc ($\tau$cdm) and $3h^{-1}$gpc ($\lambda$cdm) with a forceresolution better than $10^{-4}$ of the cube side. we investigate how thepredicted cluster correlations increase for samples of increasing mass anddecreasing abundance. very similar behaviour is found in the two cases. thecorrelation length increases from $r_0=12$ -- 13$h^{-1}$mpc for samples withmean separation $d_{\rm c}=30h^{-1}$mpc to $r_0=22$-- 27$h^{-1}$mpc for sampleswith $d_{\rm c}=100h^{-1}$mpc. the lower value here corresponds to $\tau$cdmand the upper to $\lambda$cdm. the power spectra of these cluster samples areaccurately parallel to those of the mass over more than a decade in scale. bothcorrelation lengths and power spectrum biases can be predicted to better than10% using the simple model of sheth, mo &amp; tormen (2000). this predictionrequires only the linear mass power spectrum and has no adjustable parameters.we compare our predictions with published results for the apm cluster sample.the observed variation of correlation length with richness agrees well with themodels, particularly for $\lambda$cdm. the observed power spectrum (for acluster sample of mean separation $d_{\rm c}=31h^{-1}$mpc) lies significantlyabove the predictions of both models.

astro-ph;0007348	a simluated tcdm cosmology cluster catalogue: the nfw profile and the  temperature-mass scaling relations	we have extracted over 400 clusters, covering more than 2 decades in mass,from three simulations of the tcdm cosmology. this represents the largest,uniform catalogue of simulated clusters ever produced. the clusters exhibit awide variety of density-profiles. only a minority are well-fit in their outerregions by the widely used density profile of navarro, frenk &amp; white (1977).others have steeper outer density profiles, show sharp breaks in their densityprofiles, or have significant substructure. if we force a fit to the nfwprofile, then the best-fit concentrations decline with increasing mass, butthis is driven primarily by an increase in substructure as one moves to highermasses. the measured temperature-mass relations for properties measured withina sphere enclosing a fixed overdensity all follow the self-similar form,t\propto m^{2/3}, however the normalisation is lower than in observed clusters.the temperature-mass relations for properties measured within a fixed physicalradius are significantly steeper then this. both can be accurately predictedusing the nfw model.

astro-ph;0010587	simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological volume	we present results of large n-body-hydrodynamic simulations of galaxyformation. our simulations follow the formation of galaxies in cubic volumes ofside 100mpc, in two versions of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogony: thestandard, omega=1 scdm model and the flat, omega=0.3 lcdm model. over 2000galaxies form in each of these simulations. we examine the rate at which gascools and condenses into dark matter halos. this roughly tracks the cosmic starformation rate inferred from observations at various redshifts. galaxies in thesimulations form gradually over time in the hierarchical fashion characteristicof the cdm cosmogony. in the lcdm model, substantial galaxies first appear atz=5 and the population builds up rapidly until z=1 after which the rate ofgalaxy formation declines as cold gas is consumed and the cooling time of hotgas increases. in both cosmologies, the present-day k-band luminosity functionof the simulated galaxies resembles observations. the galaxy autocorrelationfunctions differ significantly from those of the dark matter. at the presentepoch there is little bias in either model between galaxies and dark matter onlarge scales, but a significant anti-bias on scales of 1mpc/h and a positivebias on scales of 100kpc/h. the galaxy correlation function evolves little withredshift in the range z=0-3, and depends on the luminosity of the galaxysample. the projected pairwise velocity dispersion of the galaxies is muchlower than that of the dark matter on scales less than 2mpc/h. applying avirial mass estimator to the largest galaxy clusters recovers the clustervirial masses in an unbiased way.

(1990). simulationparticles are tagged as `galaxies' so as to reproduce observed present-daycorrelations. they are then identified along the past light-cones ofhypothetical observers to create mock catalogues with the geometry and thedistance distribution of the broadhurst et al. data. we produce 1936 (2625)quasi-independent catalogues from our $\tau$cdm ($\lambda$cdm) simulation. acouple of large clumps in a catalogue can produce a high peak at lowwavenumbers in the corresponding one-dimensional power spectrum, without anyapparent large-scale periodicity in the original redshift histogram. althoughthe simulated redshift histograms frequently display regularly spaced clumps,the spacing of these clumps varies between catalogues and there is no`preferred' period over our many realisations. we find only a 0.72 (0.49) percent chance that the highest peak in the power spectrum of a $\tau$cdm($\lambda$cdm) catalogue has a peak-to-noise ratio higher than that in thebroadhurst et al. data. none of the simulated catalogues with such high peaksshows coherently spaced clumps with a significance as high as that of the realdata. we conclude that in cdm universes, the kind of regularity observed bybroadhurst et al. has a priori probability well below $10^{-3}$.

astro-ph;0102048	the effect of radiative cooling on scaling laws of x-ray groups and  clusters	we have performed cosmological simulations in a $\lambda$cdm cosmology withand without radiative cooling, in order to study the effect of cooling on thecluster scaling relations. our simulations consist of 4.1 million particleseach of gas and dark matter within a box-size of 100 $h^{-1}$ mpc and the runwith cooling is the largest of its kind to have been evolved to $z=0$. ourcluster catalogues both consist of over 400 objects and are complete in massdown to $\sim 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm m_{\odot}}$. we contrast theemission-weighted temperature-mass ($t_{\rm ew}-m$) and bolometricluminosity-temperature ($l_{\rm bol}-t_{\rm ew}$) relations for the simulationsat $z=0$. we find that radiative cooling \emph{increases} the temperature ofintracluster gas and \emph{decreases} its total luminosity, in agreement withthe results of pearce et al. furthermore, the temperature dependence of theseeffects flattens the slope of the $t_{\rm ew}-m$ relation and steepens theslope of the $l_{\rm bol}-t_{\rm ew}$ relation. inclusion of radiative coolingin the simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed x-ray scalingrelations without requiring excessive non-gravitational energy injection.

astro-ph;0102117	how big were the first cosmological objects?	we calculate the cooling times at constant density for halos with virialtemperatures from 100 k to 10^5 k that originate from a 3-sigma fluctuation ofa cdm power spectrum in three different cosmologies. our intention is todetermine the first objects that can cool to low temperatures, but not tofollow their dynamical evolution. we identify two generations of halos: thosewith low virial temperatures, tvir &lt; 9000 k that remain largely neutral, andthose with larger virial temperatures that become ionized. thelower-temperature, lower-mass halos are the first to cool to 75 percent oftheir virial temperature. the precise temperature and mass of the first objectsare dependent upon the molecular hydrogen (h2) cooling function and thecosmological model. the higher-mass halos collapse later but, in this paradigm,cool much more efficiently once they have done so, first via electronictransitions and then via molecular cooling: in fact, a greater residualionization once the halos cool below 9000 k results in an enhanced h2production and hence a higher cooling rate at low temperatures than for thelower-mass halos, so that within our constant-density model it is the formerthat are the first to cool to really low temperatures. we discuss the possiblesignificance of this result in the context of cdm models in which the shallowslope of the initial fluctuation spectrum on small scales leads to a wide rangeof halo masses (of differing overdensities) collapsing over a small redshiftinterval. this ``crosstalk'' is sufficiently important that both high- andlow-mass halos collapse during the lifetimes of the massive stars which may beformed at these epochs. further investigation is thus required to determinewhich generation of halos plays the dominant role in early structure formation.

astro-ph;0502126	modeling star formation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: a case for  extended dark matter halos	we propose a simple model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, inwhich stars are assumed to have formed from isothermal gas in hydrostaticequilibrium inside extended dark matter halos. after expelling the leftovergas, the stellar system undergoes a dynamical relaxation inside the dark matterhalo. these models can adequately describe the observed properties of three(draco, sculptor, and carina) out of four galactic dwarf spheroidal satellitesstudied in this paper. we suggest that the fourth galaxy (fornax), which cannotbe fitted well with our model, is observed all the way to its tidal radius. ourbest fitting models have virial masses of ~10^9 m_sun, halo formation redshiftsconsistent with the age of oldest stars in these dwarfs, and shallow inner darkmatter density profiles (with slope gamma -0.5...0). the inferred temperatureof gas is ~10^4 k. in our model, the "extratidal" stars observed in thevicinity of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies are gravitationally bound to thegalaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos. the inferred virialmasses make galactic dwarf spheroidals massive enough to alleviate the "missingsatellites" problem of lcdm cosmologies.

astro-ph;0511361	formation of mini-galaxies in defunct cosmological hii regions	using a large set of high resolution numerical simulations incorporatingnon-equilibrium molecular hydrogen chemistry and a constant source of externalradiation, we study gas collapse in previously photo-ionized mini-galaxies withvirial temperatures less than 10^4 k in the early universe (redshifts z=10-20).we confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of ionizing radiation onstar formation in mini-galaxies proposed by ricotti, gnedin, &amp; shull (2002) canbe efficient despite a significant flux of metagalactic photo-dissociatingradiation. we derive critical fluxes for the lyman-werner background radiationsufficient to prevent the collapse of gas in mini-galaxies as a function of thevirial mass of the halo and redshift. in our model, the formation ofmini-galaxies in defunct hii regions is most efficient at large redshifts(z&gt;15) and/or for large local gas overdensity delta&gt;10. we show thatnon-equilibrium chemistry plays an important dynamical role not only during theinitial evolutionary phase leading to the gas becoming gravitationally unstableinside the mini-halo, but also at the advanced stages of the core collapse,resulting in efficient gas accretion in the core region. we speculate on apossible connection between our objects and metal-poor globular clusters anddwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0511567	constraining global properties of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy	by fitting a flexible stellar anisotropy model to the observed surfacebrightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of draco we derive asequence of cosmologically plausible two-component (stars + dark matter) modelsfor this galaxy. the models are consistent with all the available observationsand can have either cuspy navarro-frenk-white or flat-cored dark matter densityprofiles. the dark matter halos either formed relatively recently (at z~2...7)and are massive (up to ~5x10^9 m_sun), or formed before the end of thereionization of the universe (z~7...11) and are less massive (down to ~7x10^7m_sun). our results thus support either of the two popular solutions of the"missing satellites" problem of lambda cold dark matter cosmology - that dwarfspheroidals are either very massive, or very old. we carry out high-resolutionsimulations of the tidal evolution of our two-component draco models in thepotential of the milky way. the results of our simulations suggest that theobservable properties of draco have not been appreciably affected by thegalactic tides after 10 gyr of evolution. we rule out draco being a "tidaldwarf" - a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy. almost radial draco orbits (with thepericentric distance &lt;15 kpc) are also ruled out by our analysis. the case of aharmonic dark matter core can be consistent with observations only for a verylimited choice of draco orbits (with the apocentric-to-pericentric distancesratio of &lt;2.5).

astro-ph;0512040	a new fast parallel statistical measurement technique for computational  cosmology	higher order cumulants of point processes, such as skew and kurtosis, requiresignificant computational effort to calculate. the traditional counts-in-cellsmethod implicitly requires a large amount of computation since, for eachsampling sphere, a count of particles is necessary. although alternativemethods based on tree algorithms can reduce execution time considerably, suchmethods still suffer from shot noise when measuring moments on low amplitudesignals. we present a novel method for calculating higher order moments that isbased upon first top-hat filtering the point process data on to a grid. aftercorrecting for the smoothing process, we are able to sample this grid using aninterpolation technique to calculate the statistics of interest. the filteringtechnique also suppresses noise and allows us to calculate skew and kurtosiswhen the point process is highly homogeneous. the algorithm can be implementedefficiently in a shared memory parallel environment provided a data-localrandom sampling technique is used. the local sampling technique allows us toobtain close to optimal speed-up for the sampling process on the alphaservergs320 numa architecture.

astro-ph;0605672	cosmological puzzle resolved by stellar feedback in high redshift  galaxies	the standard cosmological model, now strongly constrained by directobservation at early epochs, is very successful in describing the structure ofthe evolved universe on large and intermediate scales. unfortunately, seriouscontradictions remain on smaller, galactic scales. among the major small-scaleproblems is a significant and persistent discrepancy between observations ofnearby galaxies, which imply that galactic dark matter (dm) haloes have adensity profile with a flat core, and the cosmological model, which predictsthat the haloes should have divergent density (a cusp) at the centre. here weuse numerical n-body simulations to show that random bulk motions of gas insmall primordial galaxies, of the magnitude expected in these systems, resultin a flattening of the central dm cusp on short timescales (of order 10^8years). gas bulk motions in early galaxies are driven by supernova explosionswhich result from ongoing star formation. our mechanism is general and wouldhave operated in all star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;~ 10. once removed,the cusp cannot be reintroduced during the subsequent mergers involved in thebuild-up of larger galaxies. as a consequence, in the present universe bothsmall and large galaxies would have flat dm core density profiles, in agreementwith observations.

astro-ph;0606214	quasars: what turns them off?	(abridged) we explore the idea that the anti-hierarchical turn-off observedin the quasar population arises from self-regulating feedback, via an outflowmechanism. using a detailed hydrodynamic simulation we calculate the luminosityfunction of quasars down to a redshift of z=1 in a large, cosmologicallyrepresentative volume. outflows are included explicitly by tracking halomergers and driving shocks into the surrounding intergalactic medium. ourresults are in excellent agreement with measurements of the spatialdistribution of quasars, and we detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasarpairs at very short separations. we also reproduce the anti-hierarchicalturnoff in the quasar luminosity function, however, the magnitude of theturn-off falls short of that observed as well as that predicted by analogoussemi-analytic models. the difference can be traced to the treatment of gasheating within galaxies. the simulated galaxy cluster l_x-t relationship isclose to that observed for z~1 clusters, but the simulated galaxy groups at z=1are significantly perturbed by quasar outflows, suggesting that measurements ofx-ray emission in high-redshift groups could well be a "smoking gun" for theagn heating hypothesis.

astro-ph;9709010	evolution of structure in cold dark matter universes	we present an analysis of the clustering evolution of dark matter in fourcold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies. we use a suite of high resolution,17-million particle, n-body simulations which sample volumes large enough togive clustering statistics with unprecedented accuracy. we investigate both aflat and an open model with omega_0=0.3, and two models with omega=1, one withthe standard cdm power spectrum and the other with the same power spectrum asthe omega_0=0.3 models. the amplitude of primordial fluctuations is set so thatthe models reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters by thepresent day. the mass 2-point correlation function and power spectrum of allthe simulations differ significantly from those of the observed galaxydistribution, in both shape and amplitude. thus, for any of these models toprovide an acceptable representation of reality, the distribution of galaxiesmust be biased relative to the mass in a non-trivial, scale-dependent, fashion.in the omega=1 models the required bias is always greater than unity, but inthe omega_0=0.3 models an "antibias" is required on scales smaller than \sim5\hmpc. the mass correlation functions in the simulations are well fit byrecently published analytic models. the velocity fields are remarkably similarin all the models, whether they be characterised as bulk flows, 1-particle orpairwise velocity dispersions. this similarity is a direct consequence of ouradopted normalisation. the small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion of the darkmatter is somewhat larger than recent determinations from galaxy redshiftsurveys, but the bulk-flows predicted by our models are broadly in agreementwith most available data.

astro-ph;9906160	the santa barbara cluster comparison project: a comparison of  cosmological hydrodynamics solutions	we have simulated the formation of an x-ray cluster in a cold dark matteruniverse using 12 different codes. the codes span the range of numericaltechniques and implementations currently in use, including sph and grid methodswith fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. the goal of this comparison is toassess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters inthe simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed tobe non-radiative. we compare images of the cluster at different epochs, globalproperties such as mass, temperature and x-ray luminosity, and radial profilesof various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. on the whole, theagreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number ofdiscrepancies exist. agreement is best for properties of the dark matter andworst for the total x-ray luminosity. even in this case, simulations thatadequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total x-rayluminosities that agree to within a factor of two. other quantities arereproduced to much higher accuracy. for example, the temperature and gas massfraction within the virial radius agree to about 10%, and the ratio of specifickinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5%. various factorscontribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, includingdifferences in the internal timing of the simulations. based on the overallconsistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of thecluster we have modelled.

astro-ph;9908062	the effect of radiative cooling on the x-ray properties of galaxy  clusters	in this paper, we investigate the effect of cooling on the x-ray propertiesof galaxy clusters. we have performed n-body, hydrodynamical simulations bothwith and without the effects of radiative cooling, but neglecting the effectsof star formation and feedback. we show that radiative cooling produces aninflow of high-entropy gas from the outer parts of the cluster, thus\emph{raising} the cluster temperature and \emph{decreasing} the x-rayluminosity. with radiative cooling clusters are on average three to five timesless luminous in x-rays than the same cluster simulated without cooling.however, we do not produce a large constant-density core in either the gas orthe dark matter distributions. our results contradict previous work in whichcooling raises the x-ray luminosity and deposits an unreasonably large amountof mass in the central cluster galaxy. we achieve this by selecting ournumerical resolution in such a way that a reasonable fraction of the baryonicmaterial cools and by decoupling the hot and cold gas in our simulations, afirst step towards modelling multiphase gas. we emphasise that globally coolinga sensible amount of material is vital and the presence or absence of massivecentral concentrations of cold baryonic material has a dramatic effect upon theresultant x-ray properties of the clusters.

astro-ph;9911365	hierarchical clustering, the universal density profile, and the  mass-temperature scaling law of galaxy clusters	the significance of hierarchical clustering on the density profile andmass-temperature scaling relation for galaxy clusters is examined usinghydrodynamic n-body simulations. clusters formed hierarchically are comparedwith clusters formed with the initial density fluctuations on sub-clusterscales removed via smoothing.  the universal profile, as described by navarro, frenk, and white, is not aby-product of hierarchical clustering. it is found to fit the mean profiles ofclusters formed both hierarchically and otherwise. the hernquist profile isalso found to fit the data well. the characteristic radius, r_s, moves outwardfrom 0.1 r_200 to 0.2 r_200 when the initial substructure is eliminated.interior to r_s, rho_dm is proportional to r^-1.8, regardless of initialsmoothing. exterior to this radius, the profile is marginally shallower in thenon-hierarchical case, with rho_dm proportional to r^-2.4 compared with rho_dmproportional to r^-2.7.  the mass-temperature scaling relation maintains the form t proportional tom^2/3, regardless of cluster formation method. the normalisation varies at the20% level, which is at the level of the intrinsic scatter, with thenon-hierarchical simulations producing the cooler clusters.

0811.2014	predictions of quasar clustering: redshift, luminosity and selection  dependence	we show that current clustering observations of quasars and luminous agn canbe explained by a merger model augmented by feedback from outflows. usingnumerical simulations large enough to study clustering out to 25 comovingh^{-1} mpc, we calculate correlation functions, biases, and correlation lengthsas a function of agn redshift and optical and x-ray luminosity. at opticalwavelengths, our results match a wide range of current observations andgenerate predictions for future data sets. we reproduce the weak luminositydependence of clustering over the currently well-measured range, and predict amuch stronger dependence at higher luminosities. the increase in the amplitudeof binary quasar clustering observed in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) isalso reproduced and is predicted to occur at higher redshift, an effect that isdue to the one halo term in the correlation function. on the other hand, ourresults do not match the rapid evolution of the correlation length observed inthe sdss at z\simeq 3, a discrepancy that is at least partially due todifferences in the scales probed by our simulation versus this survey. in fact,we show that changing the distances sampled from our simulations can producechanges as large as 40% in the fitted correlation lengths. finally, in thex-ray, our simulations produce correlation lengths similar to that observed inthe chandra deep field (cdf) north, but not the significantly largercorrelation length observed in the cdf south.
