0901.1882	xmm-newton and suzaku analysis of the fe k complex in the seyfert 1  galaxy mrk 509	we report on partially overlapping xmm-newton (~260 ks) and suzaku (~100 ks)observations of the iron k band in the nearby, bright seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 509.the source shows a resolved neutral fe k line, most probably produced in theouter part of the accretion disc. moreover, the source shows further emissionblue-ward of the 6.4 kev line due to ionized material. this emission is wellreproduced by a broad line produced in the accretion disc, while it cannot beeasily described by scattering or emission from photo-ionized gas at rest. thesummed spectrum of all xmm-newton observations shows the presence of a narrowabsorption line at 7.3 kev produced by highly ionized outflowing material. aspectral variability study of the xmm-newton data shows an indication for anexcess of variability at 6.6-6.7 kev. these variations may be produced in thered wing of the broad ionized line or by variation of a further absorptionstructure. the suzaku data indicate that the neutral fe kalpha line intensityis consistent with being constant on long timescales (of a few years) and theyalso confirm as most likely the interpretation of the excess blueshiftedemission in terms of a broad ionized fe line. the average suzaku spectrumdiffers from the xmm-newton one for the disappearance of the 7.3 kev absorptionline and around 6.7 kev, where the xmm-newton data alone suggested variability.

0901.4809	variable partial covering and a relativistic iron line in ngc 1365	we present a complete analysis of the hard x-ray (2-10 kev) properties of theseyfert galaxy ngc 1365, based on a 60 ks xmm-newton observation performed injanuary 2004. the two main results are: 1) we detect an obscuring cloud withn_h~3.5x10^23 cm^(-2) crossing the line of sight in ~25 ks. this implies adimension of the x-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance ofthe obscuring cloud of the order of 10^16 cm. adopting the black hole massm(bh) estimated from the m(bh)-velocity dispersion relation, the source size isd_s&lt;20 r_g and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds arer~3000-10000 r_g and n~10^(10) cm^(-3), i.e. typical values for broad lineregion clouds. 2) an iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detectedwith high statistical significance. a time integrated fit of the line+continuumreflection components suggests a high iron abundance (~3 times solar) and anorigin of these components in the inner part (~10 r_g) of the accretion disk,in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of theabsorption variability.

0902.2840	stellar-mass black hole spin constraints from disk reflection and  continuum modeling	accretion disk reflection spectra, including broad iron emission lines, bearthe imprints of the strong doppler shifts and gravitational red-shifts close toblack holes. the extremity of these shifts depends on the proximity of theinnermost stable circular orbit to the black hole, and that orbit is determinedby the black hole spin parameter. modeling relativistic spectral features,then, gives a means of estimating black hole spin. we report on the results offits made to archival x-ray spectra of stellar-mass black holes and black holecandidates, selected for strong disk reflection features. following recentwork, these spectra were fit with reflection models and disk continuum emissionmodels (where required) in which black hole spin is a free parameter. althoughour results must be regarded as preliminary, we find evidence for a broad rangeof black hole spin parameters in our sample. the black holes with the mostrelativistic radio jets are found to have high spin parameters, though jets areobserved in a black hole with a low spin parameter. for those sources withconstrained binary system parameters, we examine the distribution of spinparameters versus black hole mass, binary mass ratio, and orbital period. wediscuss the results within the context of black hole creation events,relativistic jet production, and efforts to probe the innermost relativisticregime around black holes.

0905.2891	an intermediate black hole spin in the nls1 galaxy swift j2127.4+5654:  chaotic accretion or spin energy extraction?	we have observed the hard x-ray selected narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy swiftj2127.4+5654 with suzaku. we report the detection of a broad relativistic ironemission line from the inner accretion disc. by assuming that the inner edge ofthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of theblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spina= 0.6\pm0.2. however, a non-rotating schwarzschild spacetime is excluded atjust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning kerr black hole isexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. the intermediate spin we measure may indicatethat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds throughshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the discand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. the measured steep emissivityindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating x-ray source to be very centrallyconcentrated. light bending may help focus the primary emission towards theinnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. on the otherhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the holerotational energy is at work. if this is the case, the interplay betweenaccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,under standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.rotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account forthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectralanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

0905.4383	the detection of broad iron k and l line emission in the narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 using xmm-newton	since the discovery of the first broad iron-k line in 1995 from the seyfertgalaxy mcg--6-30-15, broad iron-k lines have been found in several otherseyfert galaxies, from accreting stellar mass black holes and even fromaccreting neutron stars. the iron-k line is prominent in the reflectionspectrum created by the hard x-ray continuum irradiating dense accretingmatter. relativistic distortion of the line makes it sensitive to the stronggravity and spin of the black hole. the accompanying iron-l line emissionshould be detectable when the iron abundance is high. here we report the firstdiscovery of both iron-k and l emission, using xmm-newton observations of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495. the bright fe-l emission has enabledus, for the first time, to detect a reverberation lag of 30 s between thedirect x-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the hole.the observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing timeof the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. the combination ofspectral and timing data on 1h0707-495 provides strong evidence that we arewitnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction ofa light-minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly-spinning, massive blackhole.

0907.1527	probing variability patterns of the fe k line complex in bright nearby  agns	the unprecedented sensitivity of current x-ray telescopes allows for thefirst time to address the issue of the fe k line complex variability patternsin bright, nearby agns. we examine xmm-newton observations of the brightestsources of the fero sample of radio-quiet type 1 agns with the aim ofcharacterizing the temporal behaviour of fe k complex features. a systematicmapping of residual flux above and below the continuum in the 4-9 kev range isperformed in the time vs energy domain, with the purpose of identifyinginteresting spectral features in the three energy bands: 5.4-6.1 kev, 6.1-6.8kev and 6.8-7.2 kev, corresponding respectively to the redshifted, rest frameand blueshifted or highly ionized fe kalpha line bands. the variabilitysignificance is assessed by extracting light curves and comparing them withmontecarlo simulations. the time-averaged profile of the fe k complex revealedspectral complexity in several observations. red- and blue-shifted components(either in emission or absorption) were observed in 30 out of 72 observations,with an average &lt;ew&gt;~90 ev for emission and &lt;ew&gt;~ -30 ev for absorptionfeatures. we detected significant line variability (with confidence levelsranging between 90% and 99.7%) within at least one of the above energy bands in26 out of 72 observations on time scales of ~6-30 ks. reliability of thesefeatures has been carefully calculated using this sample and has been assessedat ~3sigma confidence level. this work increases the currently scanty number ofdetections of variable, energy shifted, fe lines and confirms the reliabilityof the claimed detections. we found that the distribution of detected featuresis peaked at high variability significances in the red- and blue-shifted energybands, suggesting an origin in a relativistically modified accretion flow.

0909.2960	does the x-ray emission of the luminous quasar rbs 1124 originate in a  mildly relativistic outflowing corona?	we have observed the luminous (l_x ~ 6x10^44 erg/s) radio-quiet quasar rbs1124 (z=0.208) with suzaku. we report the detection of a moderately broad iron(fe) line and of a weak soft x-ray excess. the x-ray data are very welldescribed by a simple model comprising a power law x-ray continuum plus itsreflection off the accretion disc. if the inner disc radius we measure (&lt;=3.8gravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit ofthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering rbs 1124 isrotating rapidly with spin a&gt;= 0.6. the soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2kev band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured seyfert1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction wemeasure (r_disc ~0.4). the low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disctruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we inferbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source(l_bol / l_edd ~1). a plausible explanation is that the x-ray corona is thebase of a failed jet (rbs 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing atmildly relativistic speeds. aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,thus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferredsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived eddington ratio from ~1to~0.5.

1108.5988	1h0707-495 in 2011: an x-ray source within a gravitational radius of the  event horizon	the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 went in to a low state from 2010december to 2011 february, discovered by a monitoring campaign using the x-raytelescope on the swift satellite. we triggered a 100 ks xmm-newton observationof the source in 2011 january, revealing the source to have dropped by a factorof ten in the soft band, below 1 kev, and a factor of 2 at 5 kev, compared witha long observation in 2008. the sharp spectral drop in the source usually seenaround 7 kev now extends to lower energies, below 6 kev in our frame. the 2011spectrum is well fit by a relativistically-blurred reflection spectrum similarto that which fits the 2008 data, except that the emission is now concentratedsolely to the central part of the accretion disc. the irradiating source mustlie within 1 gravitational radius of the event horizon of the black hole, whichspins rapidly. alternative models are briefly considered but none has anysimple physical interpretation.

1201.0196	discovery of a relation between black hole mass and soft x-ray time lags  in active galactic nuclei	we carried out a systematic analysis of time lags between x-ray energy bandsin a large sample (32 sources) of unabsorbed, radio quiet active galacticnuclei (agn), observed by xmm-newton. the analysis of x-ray lags (up to thehighest/shortest frequencies/time-scales), is performed in thefourier-frequency domain, between energy bands where the soft excess (softband) and the primary power law (hard band) dominate the emission. we report atotal of 15 out of 32 sources displaying a high frequency soft lag in theirlight curves. all 15 are at a significance level exceeding 97 per cent and 11are at a level exceeding 99 per cent. of these soft lags, 7 have not beenpreviously reported in the literature, thus this work significantly increasesthe number of known sources with a soft/negative lag. the characteristictime-scales of the soft/negative lag are relatively short (with typicalfrequencies and amplitudes of \nu\sim 0.07-4 \times 10^{-3} hz and \tau\sim10-600 s, respectively), and show a highly significant (\gsim 4\sigma)correlation with the black hole mass. the measured correlations indicate thatsoft lags are systematically shifted to lower frequencies and higher absoluteamplitudes as the mass of the source increases. to first approximation, all thesources in the sample are consistent with having similar mass-scaled lagproperties. these results strongly suggest the existence of a mass-scaling lawfor the soft/negative lag, that holds for agn spanning a large range of masses(about 2.5 orders of magnitude), thus supporting the idea that soft lagsoriginate in the innermost regions of agn and are powerful tools for testingtheir physics and geometry.

1208.4502	the nature of the bright ulx x-2 in ngc3921: a chandra position and hst  candidate counterpart	we report on chandra observations of the bright ultra-luminous x-ray (ulx)source in ngc3921. previous xmm observations reported in the literature showthe presence of a bright ulx at a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 2x10^40 erg/s. ourchandra observation finds the source at a lower luminosity of ~8x10^39 erg/s,furthermore, we provide a chandra position of the ulx accurate to 0.7" at 90%confidence. the x-ray variability makes it unlikely that the high luminosity iscaused by several separate x-ray sources. in 3 epochs of archival hubble spacetelescope (hst) observations we find a candidate counterpart to the ulx. thereis direct evidence for variability between the two epochs of wfpc2 f814wobservations with the observation obtained in 2000 showing a brighter source.furthermore, converting the 1994 f336w and 2000 f300w wfpc2 and the 2010 f336wwfc3 observations to the johnson u-band filter assuming a spectral type of o7iwe find evidence for a brightening of the u-band light in 2000. using thehigher resolution wfc3 observations the candidate counterpart is resolved intotwo sources of similar color. we discuss the nature of the ulx and the probableassociation with the optical counterpart(s). finally, we investigate apotential new explanation for some (bright) ulxs as the decaying stages offlares caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a recoiled supermassiveblack hole. however, we find that there should be at most only 1 of suchsystems within z=0.08.

1209.0706	the x-ray variability history of markarian 3	we aim at constraining the geometry of the reprocessing matter in the nearbyprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy markarian 3 by studying the time evolution ofspectral components associated to the primary agn emission and to itscompton-scattering. we have analyzed archival spectroscopic observations ofmarkarian 3 taken over the last 12 years with the xmm-newton, suzaku and swiftobservatories, as well as data taken during a monitoring campaign activated byus in 2012. the timescale of the compton-reflection component variability(originally discovered by asca in the mid-'90s) is ~64 days. this upper limitimproves by more than a factor of 15 previous estimates of thecompton-reflection variability timescale for this source. when the light curveof the compton-reflection continuum in the 4-5 kev band is correlated with the15-150 kev swift/bat curve a delay ~1200 days is found. the cross-correlationresults are dependent on the model used to fit the spectra, although thedetection of the compton-reflection component variability is independent of therange of models employed to fit the data. reanalysis of an archival chandraimage of markarian 3 indicates that the compton-reflection and the fe k-alphaemitting regions are extended to the north up to ~300 pc. the combination ofthese findings suggests that the optically-thick reprocessor in markarian 3 isclumpy. there is mounting experimental evidence for the structure of theoptically-thick gas and dust in the nuclear environment of nearby heavilyobscured agn to be extended and complex. we discuss possible modifications tothe standard unification scenarios encompassing this complexity. markarian 3,exhibiting x-ray absorption and reprocessing on widely different spatialscales, is an ideal laboratory to test these models (abridged).

1209.1278	suzaku reveals x-ray continuum piercing the nuclear absorber in  markarian 231	we report the results from a 2011 suzaku observation of the nearbylow-ionization bal quasar/ulirg markarian 231. these data reveal that the x-rayspectrum has undergone a large variation from the 2001 xmm-newton and bepposaxobservations. we interpret this finding according to a scenario whereby thex-ray continuum source is obscured by a two-component partial-covering absorberwith nh ~10^22 and ~10^24 cm^-2, respectively. the observed spectral change ismostly explained by a progressive appearance of the primary continuum at &lt;10kev due to the decrease of the covering fraction of the denser absorptioncomponent. the properties of the x-ray obscuration in mrk 231 match well withthose of the x-ray shielding gas predicted by the theoretical models for anefficient radiatively-driven acceleration of the bal wind. in particular, thex-ray absorber might be located at the extreme base of the outflow. we measurea 2-10 kev luminosity of l(2-10) = 3.3 x 10^43 erg s^-1 for the 2011 data set,i.e. an increase of 30% with respect to the 2001 value.

1209.1497	loft: the large observatory for x-ray timing	the loft mission concept is one of four candidates selected by esa for the m3launch opportunity as medium size missions of the cosmic vision programme. thelaunch window is currently planned for between 2022 and 2024. loft is designedto exploit the diagnostics of rapid x-ray flux and spectral variability thatdirectly probe the motion of matter down to distances very close to black holesand neutron stars, as well as the physical state of ultra-dense matter. theseprimary science goals will be addressed by a payload composed of a large areadetector (lad) and a wide field monitor (wfm). the lad is a collimated (&lt;1degree field of view) experiment operating in the energy range 2-50 kev, with a10 m^2 peak effective area and an energy resolution of 260 ev at 6 kev. the wfmwill operate in the same energy range as the lad, enabling simultaneousmonitoring of a few-steradian wide field of view, with an angular resolution of&lt;5 arcmin. the lad and wfm experiments will allow us to investigate variabilityfrom submillisecond qpo's to year-long transient outbursts. in this paper wereport the current status of the project.

1210.0855	a blurred reflection interpretation for the intermediate flux state in  mrk 335	as part of a long term monitoring campaign of mrk 335, deep xmm-newtonobservations catch the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) in a complex,intermediate flux interval as the active galaxy is transiting from low- tohigh-flux. other works on these same data examined the general behaviour of thenls1 (grupe et al.) and the conditions of its warm absorber (longinotti etal.). the analysis presented here demonstrates the x-ray continuum and timingproperties can be described in a self-consistent manner adopting a blurredreflection model with no need to invoke partial covering. the rapid spectralvariability appears to be driven by changes in the shape of the primary emitterthat is illuminating the inner accretion disc around a rapidly spinning blackhole (a &gt; 0.7). while light bending is certainly prominent, the rather constantemissivity profile and break radius obtained in our spectral fitting suggestthat the blurring parameters are not changing as would be expected if theprimary source is varying its distance from the disc. instead changes could beintrinsic to the power law component. one possibility is that material in anunresolved jet above the disc falls to combine with material at the base of thejet producing the changes in the primary emitter (spectral slope and flux)without changing its distance from the disc.

0712.1906	suzaku observations of markarian 335: evidence for a distributed  reflector	we report on a 151 ks net exposure suzaku observation of the narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxy mrk 335. the 0.5-40 kev spectrum contains a broad fe line, astrong soft excess below about 2 kev and a compton hump around 20-30 kev. wefind that a model consisting of a power law and two reflectors provides thebest fit to the time-averaged spectrum. in this model, an ionized, heavilyblurred, inner reflector produces most of the soft excess, while an almostneutral outer reflector (outside ~40 r_g) produces most of the fe lineemission. the spectral variability of the observation is characterised byspectral hardening at very low count rates. in terms of our power-law +two-reflector model it seems like this hardening is mainly caused by pivotingof the power law. the rms spectrum of the entire observation has the curvedshape commonly observed in agn, although the shape is significantly flatterwhen an interval which does not contain any deep dip in the lightcurve isconsidered. we also examine a previous 133 ks xmm-newton observation of mrk335. we find that the xmm-newton spectrum can be fitted with a similartwo-reflector model as the suzaku data and we confirm that the rms spectrum ofthe observation is flat. the flat rms spectra, as well as the high-energy datafrom the suzaku pin detector, disfavour an absorption origin for the softexcess in mrk 335.

1301.1924	revealing the x-ray source in iras 13224-3809 through flux-dependent  reverberation lags	iras 13224-3809 was observed in 2011 for 500 ks with the xmm-newtonobservatory. we detect highly significant x-ray lags between soft (0.3 - 1 kev)and hard (1.2 - 5 kev) energies. the hard band lags the soft at low frequencies(i.e. hard lag), while the opposite (i.e. soft lag) is observed at highfrequencies. in this paper, we study the lag during flaring and quiescentperiods. we find that the frequency and absolute amplitude of the soft lag isdifferent during high-flux and low-flux periods. during the low flux intervals,the soft lag is detected at higher frequencies and with smaller amplitude.assuming that the soft lag is associated with the light travel time betweenprimary and reprocessed emission, this behaviour suggests that the x-ray sourceis more compact during low-flux intervals, and irradiates smaller radii of theaccretion disc (likely because of light bending effects). we continue with aninvestigation of the lag dependence on energy, and find that isolating thelow-flux periods reveals a strong lag signature at the fe k line energy,similar to results found using 1.3 ms of data on another well known narrow-lineseyfert i galaxy, 1h0707-495.

1302.1761	discovery of fe k-alpha x-ray reverberation around the black holes in  mcg-5-23-16 and ngc 7314	several x-ray observations have recently revealed the presence ofreverberation time delays between spectral components in agn. most of theobserved lags are between the power-law comptonization component, seendirectly, and the soft excess produced by reflection in the vicinity of theblack hole. ngc 4151 was the first object to show these lags in the iron kband. here, we report the discovery of reverberation lags in the fe k band intwo other sources: mcg-5-23-16 and ngc 7314. in both objects, the 6-7 kev band,where the fe k line peaks, lags the bands at lower and higher energies with atime delay of ~ 1 kilo-seconds. these lags are unlikely to be due to the narrowfe k line. they are fully consistent with reverberation of therelativistically-broadened iron k line. the measured lags, their time-scale andspectral modeling, indicate that most of the radiation is emitted at ~ 5 and 24gravitational radii for mcg-5-23-16 and ngc 7314 respectively.

0712.3445	heavy absorption and soft x-ray emission lines in the xmm-newton  spectrum of the type 2 radio-loud quasar 3c 234	we report results on a 40 ks xmm-newton observation of the type 2 quasar 3c234. optical spectropolarimetric data have demonstrated the presence of ahidden broad-line region in this powerful (m_v &lt;~ -24.2 after reddening andstarlight correction) narrow-line frii radio galaxy. our analysis is aimed atinvestigating the x-ray spectral properties of this peculiar source which haveremained poorly known so far. we analyze the 0.5--10 kev spectroscopic datacollected by the epic cameras in 2006. the x-ray spectrum of this radio-loudquasar is typical of a local compton-thin seyfert 2 galaxy. it exhibits strongabsorption (nh~3.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}) and a narrow, neutral fe kalpha emissionline with an equivalent width of ~140+/-40 ev. our observation also revealsthat the soft portion of the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lineswith a very low level of scattered primary continuum. a possible explanation ofthese features in terms of thermal emission from a two-temperaturecollisionally ionized plasma emission seems to be unlikely due to the highluminosity estimated for this component (l(0.5-2) ~ 6 x 10^{42} erg/s). it islikely that most of the soft x-ray emission originates from a photoionizedplasma as commonly observed in obscured, radio-quiet seyfert-like agns. thisx-ray observation has definitively confirmed the presence of a hidden quasar in3c 234. the line-rich spectrum and the steepness of the hard x-ray continuum(gamma ~ 1.7) found in this source weaken the hypothesis that the bulk ofthex-ray emission in radio-loud agns with high excitation optical lines arisesfrom jet non-thermal emission.

1310.0042	time lags in the ultraluminous x-ray source ngc 5408 x-1: implications  for the black hole mass	we present the analysis of the x-ray variability and spectral timingproperties of the ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) ngc 5408 x-1, one of themost variable ulxs known so far. the variability properties are used as adiagnostic of the accretion state of the source and to derive estimates of theblack hole (bh) mass. the observed high level of fast x-ray variability(fractional root-mean-square variability - rms - amplitude of $\sim$ 30 percentin the hard energy band), the hardening of the fractional rms spectrum, and theproperties of the qpo, all resemble those of a source in a hard-intermediateaccretion state. we confirm the previous detection of a soft lag in the x-raylight curves of the source during 2006 and 2008 observations and find that thesoft lag is still present in the more recent 2010/2011 observations. using theentire available xmm-newton data set (public as of february 2012) we observethat the soft lag (of few seconds amplitude) is detected over a relativelylarge range of frequencies ($\nu \sim 5-90$ mhz), which always includes the qpofrequencies. the soft lag displays energy-dependence, with the (absolute)amplitude increasing as a function of energy separation. we find closeanalogies with soft lags associated to type-c qpos in bh binary systems(although an association to other types of qpos cannot be completely excluded),as well as with reverberation lags observed in agn. in both cases anintermediate mass bh (imbh) solution appears the most plausible.

1310.7701	the properties of the clumpy torus and blr in the polar-scattered  seyfert 1 galaxy eso 323-g77 through x-ray absorption variability	we report results from multi-epoch x-ray observations of the polar-scatteredseyfert 1 galaxy eso 323-g77. the source exhibits remarkable spectralvariability from months to years timescales. the observed spectral variabilityis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorbertowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. the column density is generallycompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. however, one observation reveals a compton-thick statewith column density of the order of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. theobserved variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of thex-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. we identify variable x-ray absorptionfrom two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individualclumps have a density of $\leq$ 1.7 $\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an averagecolumn density of $\sim$ 4 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broadline region (blr), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\times$10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. thederived properties of the clumpy torus can also be used to estimate the torushalf-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 $^\circ$. we also confirm thepreviously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflowvelocities of 1000-4000 km s$^{-1}$. the observed outflow velocities areconsistent with the keplerian/escape velocity at the blr. hence, the warmabsorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud mediumwhich ensures that the blr clouds are in pressure equilibrium with theirsurroundings. the blr line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumpsof this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggestedby the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during ourmonitoring.

0802.3882	initial measurements of black hole spin in gx 339-4 from suzaku  spectroscopy	we report on a deep suzaku observation of the stellar-mass black hole gx339-4 in outburst. a clear, strong, relativistically-shaped iron emission linefrom the inner accretion disk is observed. the broad-band disk reflectionspectrum revealed is one of the most sensitive yet obtained from an accretingblack hole. we fit the suzaku spectra with a physically-motivated diskreflection model, blurred by a new relativistic line function in which theblack hole spin parameter is a variable. this procedure yielded a black holespin parameter of a = 0.89 +/- 0.04. joint modeling of these suzaku spectra andprior xmm-newton spectra obtained in two different outburst phases yields aspin parameter of a = 0.93 +/- 0.01. the degree of consistency between theseresults suggests that disk reflection models allow for spin measurements thatare not strongly biased by scattering effects. we suggest that the best valueof the black hole spin parameter is a = 0.93 +/- 0.01 (statistical) +/- 0.04(systematic). although preliminary, these results represent the first directmeasurement of non-zero spin in a stellar-mass black hole using relativisticline modeling.

1408.5051	the changing x-ray time lag in mcg-6-30-15	mcg-6-30-15 is one of the most observed narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies in thex-ray band. in this paper we examine the x-ray time lags in this source using atotal of 600 ks in observations (440 ks exposure) taken with the xmm-newtontelescope (300 ks in 2001 and 300 ks in 2013). both the old and newobservations show the usual hard lag that increases with energy, however, thehard lag turns over to a soft lag at frequencies below ~1e-4 hz. the highestfrequencies (~1e-3 hz) in this source show a clear soft lag, as previouslypresented for the first 300 ks observation, but no clear iron k lag is detectedin either the old or new observation. the soft lag is more significant in theold observation than the new. the observations are consistent with areverberation interpretation, where the soft, reflected emission is delayedwith respect to the hard powerlaw component. these spectral timing resultssuggest that two distinct variability mechanisms are important in this source:intrinsic coronal variations (which lead to correlated variability in thereprocessed emission), and geometrical changes in the corona. variability dueto geometrical changes does not result in correlated variability in thereflection, and therefore inhibits the clear detection of an iron k lag.

1508.04565	a variable-density absorption event in ngc 3227 mapped with suzaku and  swift	the morphology of the circumnuclear gas accreting onto supermassive blackholes in seyfert galaxies remains a topic of much debate. as the innermostregions of active galactic nuclei (agn) are spatially unresolved, x-rayspectroscopy, and in particular line-of-sight absorption variability, is a keydiagnostic to map out the distribution of gas. observations of variable x-rayabsorption in multiple seyferts and over a wide range of timescales indicatethe presence of clumps/clouds of gas within the circumnuclear material. eclipseevents by clumps transiting the line of sight allow us to explore theproperties of the clumps over a wide range of radial distances from theoptical/uv broad line region (blr) to beyond the dust sublimation radius.time-resolved absorption events have been extremely rare so far, but suggest arange of density profiles across seyferts. we resolve a weeks-long absorptionevent in the seyfert ngc 3227. we examine six suzaku and twelve swiftobservations from a 2008 campaign spanning 5 weeks. we use a model accountingfor the complex spectral interplay of three differently-ionized absorbers. weperform time-resolved spectroscopy to discern the absorption variabilitybehavior. we also examine the ir-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) totest for reddening by dust. the 2008 absorption event is due tomoderately-ionized ($\log \xi\sim 1.2-1.4$) gas covering 90% of the line ofsight. we resolve the density profile to be highly irregular, in contrast to aprevious symmetric and centrally-peaked event mapped with rxte in the sameobject. the uv data do not show significant reddening, suggesting that thecloud is dust-free. the 2008 campaign has revealed a transit by a filamentary,moderately-ionized cloud of variable density that is likely located in the blr,and possibly part of a disk wind.

astro-ph;0206142	non-radial oscillation modes as a probe of density discontinuities in  neutron stars	a phase transition occurring in the inner core of a neutron star could beassociated to a density discontinuity that would affect the frequency spectrumof the non-radial oscillation modes in two ways. firstly, it would produce asoftening of the equation of state, leading to more compact equilibriumconfigurations and changing the frequency of the fundamental and pressure modesof the neutron star. secondly, a new non-zero frequency g-- mode would appear,associated to each discontinuity. these discontinuity g--modes have typicalfrequencies larger than those of g--modes previously studied in the literature(thermal, core g-- modes, or g--modes due to chemical inhomogeneities in theouter layers), and smaller than that of the fundamental mode; therefore theyshould be distinguishable from the other modes of non radial oscillation. inthis paper we investigate how high density discontinuities change the frequencyspectrum of the non-radial oscillations, in the framework of the generalrelativistic theory of stellar perturbations. our purpose is to understandwhether a gravitational signal, emitted at the frequencies of the quasi normalmodes, may give some clear information on the equation of state of the neutronstar and, in particular, on the parameters that characterize the densitydiscontinuity. we discuss some astrophysical processes that may be associatedto the excitation of these modes, and estimate how much gravitational energyshould the modes convey to produce a signal detectable by high frequencygravitational detectors.

astro-ph;0307163	the lack of variability of the iron line in mcg-6-30-15: general  relativistic effects	the spectrum and variability of the seyfert galaxy mcg-6-30-15 can bedecomposed into two apparently disconnected components: a highly variable powerlaw and an almost constant component which contains a broad and strong ironline. we explore a possible explanation of the puzzling lack of variability ofthe iron line, by assuming that the variations of the power law component aredue to changes in the height of the primary source in the near vicinity of arotating black hole. due to the bending of light in the strong field of thecentral black hole, the apparent brightness of the power-law component can varyby about a factor 4 according to its position, while the total iron line fluxvariability is less than 20 percent. this behaviour is obtained if the primarysource is located within 3-4 gravitational radii ($r_{\rm g}$) from therotation axis with a variable height of between $\sim$ 3 and 8 $r_{\rm g}$.these results revive the possibility that future x-ray observations ofmcg-6-30-15 can map out the strong gravity regime of accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0311037	the relativistic fe emission line in xte j1650-500 with bepposax:  evidence for black hole spin and light bending effects?	we report spectral results from three bepposax observations of the black holecandidate xte j1650-500 during its 2001/2002 outburst. we find strong evidencefor the presence of a broad and strongly relativistic fe emission line. theline profile indicates an accretion disc extending down to two gravitationalradii (or less) suggesting the presence of a rapidly rotating central kerrblack hole. thanks to the broadband spectral coverage of bepposax, we couldanalyze the 1.5-200 kev spectra of the three observations and report thepresence of a strong reflection component from the accretion disc, which istotally consistent with the observed broad fe emission line. the shape of thereflection component appears to be affected by the same special and generalrelativistic effects that produce the broad fe line. we study the variation ofthe different spectral components from the first to the third observation andwe find that they are well reproduced by a recently proposed light bendingmodel.

astro-ph;0405160	x-ray reflection in the nls1 1h 0707-495	we apply a reflection-dominated model to the second xmm-newton observation ofthe narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h 0707-495. as in the first xmm-newtonobservation a sharp spectral drop is detected with energy that has shifted from7 kev to 7.5 kev in two years. the drop is interpreted in terms ofrelativistically blurred ionised reflection from the accretion disc, while theenergy shift can be accounted for by changes in the ionisation state and, moreimportantly, emissivity profile on the disc. a flatter emissivity profileduring the second higher flux observation reduces gravitational redshifteffects, therefore shifting the edge to higher energy. remarkably, ionised discreflection and the associated power law continuum provide a reasonabledescription of the broadband spectrum, including the soft excess. consideringboth observations, the spectral variability in 1h 0707-495 appears to be due tothe interplay between these two spectral components. the reflection componentin the second observation is significantly less variable than the power law.changes of the emissivity profile, spectral shape and variability properties(such as the rms spectrum) within the two observations are all consistent witha recently proposed model in which relativistic effects in the very innerregions of the nucleus play a major role.

astro-ph;0409293	flux and energy modulation of redshifted iron emission in ngc3516:  implications for the black hole mass	we report the tentative detection of the modulation of a transient,redshifted fe kalpha emission feature in the x-ray spectrum of the seyfertgalaxy ngc3516. the detection of the spectral feature at 6.1 kev, in additionto a stable 6.4 kev line, has been reported previously. we find on re-analysingthe xmm-newton data that the feature varies systematically in flux at intervalsof 25 ks. the peak moves in energy between 5.7 kev and 6.5 kev. the spectralevolution of the feature agrees with fe k emission arising from a spot on theaccretion disc, illuminated by a corotating flare located at a radius of (7-16)rg, modulated by doppler and gravitational effects as the flare orbits aroundthe black hole. combining the orbital timescale and the location of theorbiting flare, the mass of the black hole is estimated to be (1-5)e+7 msun,which is in good agreement with values obtained from other techniques.

astro-ph;0411562	fe k emission in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp220	prominent fe k line emission is detected at around 6.7 kev in the xmm-newtonspectrum of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp220. the continuum emission inthe 2.5-10 kev band is flat and a few other spectral features are suggested.the large ew of the fe k line poses a problem with interpreting the hard x-rayemission as integrated x-ray binary emission. a thermal emission spectrum witha temperature of kt~7 kev modified by some absorption, which would be expectedfrom an internally shocked hot bubble in a starburst region, can describe thespectrum. an ensemble of radio supernovae in a dense environment, as suggestedfrom vlbi imaging, could be another possibility, if frequent occurence of suchpowerful supernovae is sustained. however, the apparent lack of x-ray binaryemission does not match the high supernova rate required by bothinterpretations. highly photoionized, low-density gas illuminated by a hiddencompton-thick agn is a possible alternative, which can be tested bypresence/absence of radiative recombination continua in better quality dataexpected from a forthcoming observation.

astro-ph;0504472	x-ray reflection in the seyfert galaxy 1h0419-577 revealing strong  relativistic effects in the vicinity of a kerr black hole	we report results obtained from six xmm-newton observations of the seyfertgalaxy 1h 0419-577. here we show that the x-ray spectrum and variability arewell described by a two-component model comprising a power law with constantspectral shape and variable normalisation and a much more constant ionisedreflection component from the inner accretion. one of the observations wasperformed when the source was in a particularly low flux state in which thex-ray spectrum is rather peculiar and exhibits a very flat hard spectrum withbroad residuals below 6.6 kev and a steep soft excess below about 1 kev. weinterpret the spectrum as being reflection-dominated by x-ray reprocessedemission from the inner accretion disc. the primary continuum is almostcompletely unobserved possibly because of strong light bending towards thecentral black hole. the ionised reflection model simultaneously accounts forthe broad residuals and hard flat spectrum and for the soft excess. the samemodel provides an excellent description of the data at all the other fluxlevels, the most important difference being a variation in the power lawnormalisation. our results imply that most of the x-ray emission in this sourceoriginates from within few gravitational radii from the central black hole andrequires that the compact object is an almost maximally spinning kerr blackhole.

astro-ph;0602191	xmm-newton study of the complex and variable spectrum of ngc 4051	we study the x-ray spectral variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxyngc 4051 as observed during two xmm-newton observations. the data show evidencefor a neutral and constant reflection component and for constant emission fromphotoionized gas, which are included in all spectral models. the nuclearemission can be modelled both in terms of a ``standard model'' (pivoting powerlaw plus a black body component for the soft excess) and of a two--componentone (power law plus ionized reflection from the accretion disc). the standardmodel results indicate that the soft excess does not follow the standard blackbody law. moreover, although the spectral slope is correlated with flux, whichis consistent with spectral pivoting, the hardest photon indexes are so flat asto require rather unusual scenarios. these problems can be solved in terms ofthe two-component model in which the soft excess is not thermal, but due to theionized reflection component. the variability of the reflection component fromthe inner disc closely follows the predictions of the light bending model,suggesting that most of the primary nuclear emission is produced in the veryinnermost regions, only a few gravitational radii from the central black hole.(abridged)
