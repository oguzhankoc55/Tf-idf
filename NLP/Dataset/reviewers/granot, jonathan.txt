0905.2206	grb theory in the fermi era	before the launch of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope there were only ahandful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected at high energies (above 100 mev),while several different suggestions have been made for possible high-energyemission sites and mechanisms. here i briefly review some of the theoreticalexpectations for high-energy emission from grbs, outline some of the hopes forimproving our understanding of grb physics through fermi observations of theprompt grb emission or the early afterglow (first few hours after the grb), andsummarize what we have learned so far from the existing fermi grb observations(over its first half-year of operation). highlights include the first detectionof &gt; gev emission from a short grb, as well as detailed temporal and spectralinformation for the first grb with &gt; gev emission and a measured redshift, thathas the highest measured apparent (isotropic equivalent) radiated energy output(for any grb), the largest lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor of theemitting region, and constrains possible lorentz invariance violation byplacing a robust lower limit on the quantum gravity mass.

0908.0030	limits on radioactive-powered emission associated with a short-hard grb  070724a in a star-forming galaxy	we present results of an extensive observing campaign of the short duration,hard spectrum gamma-ray burst (grb) 070724a, aimed at detecting theradioactively-powered emission that might follow from a binary merger orcollapse involving compact objects. our multi-band observations span the rangein time over which this so-called li-paczynski mini-supernova could be active,beginning within 3 hours of the grb trigger, and represent some of the deepestand most comprehensive searches for such emission. we find no evidence for suchactivity and place limits on the abundances and the lifetimes of the possibleradioactive nuclides that could form in the rapid decompression ofnuclear-density matter. furthermore, our limits are significantly fainter thanthe peak magnitude of any previously detected broad-lined type ic supernova(sn) associated with other grbs, effectively ruling out a long grb-like sn forwith this event. given the unambiguous redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.456),grb 070724a represents one of a small, but growing, number of short-hard grbsfor which firm physical/restframe quantities currently exist. the host of grb070724a is a moderately star-forming galaxy with an older stellar populationcomponent and a relatively high metallicity of 12+log(o/h)_kd02=9.1. we find nosignificant evidence for large amounts of extinction along the line of sightthat could mask the presence of a sn explosion and estimate a small probabilityfor chance alignment with the putative host. we discuss how our derivedconstraints fit into the evolving picture of short-hard grbs, their potentialprogenitors, and the host environments in which they are thought to beproduced.

0911.1503	the long rapid decay phase of the extended emission from the short grb  080503	grb080503 was classified as a short grb with extended emission (perley et al.2009). the origin of such extended emission (found in about a quarter of swiftshort grbs) is still unclear and may provide some clues to the identity of theelusive progenitors of short grbs. the extended emission from grb 080503 isfollowed by a rapid decay phase (rdp) that is detected over an unusually largedynamical range (one decade in time and ~3.5 decades in flux). we model thebroad envelope of extended emission and the subsequent rdp using a physicalmodel (genet &amp; granot 2009), in which the prompt emission (and its tail) is thesum of its individual pulses (and their tails). for grb 080503, a single pulsefit is found to be unacceptable. the rdp displays very strong spectralevolution and shows some evidence for the presence of two spectral componentswith different temporal behaviour, likely arising from distinct physicalregions. a two pulse fit provides a much better fit to the data. the shallowgamma-ray and steep hard x-ray decays are hard to account for simultaneously,and require the second pulse to deviate from the simplest version of the modelwe use. therefore, while high latitude emission is a viable explanation for therdp in grb080503, it is quite plausible that another mechanism is at work here.finally, we note that the properties of the rdp following the extended emissionof short grbs appear to have different properties than that following theprompt emission of long grbs. however, a larger sample of short grbs withextended emission is required before any strong conclusion can be drawn.

1003.2452	highlights from fermi grb observations	the fermi gamma-ray space telescope has more than doubled the number ofgamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected above 100 mev within its first year ofoperation. thanks to the very wide energy range covered by fermi's gamma-rayburst monitor (gbm; 8 kev to 40 mev) and large area telescope (lat; 25 mev to&gt;300 gev) it has measured the prompt grb emission spectrum over anunprecedentedly large energy range (from ~8 kev to ~30 gev). here i brieflyoutline some highlights from fermi grb observations during its first ~1.5 yr ofoperation, focusing on the prompt emission phase. interesting new observationsare discussed along with some of their possible implications, including: (i)what can we learn from the fermi-lat grb detection rate, (ii) a limit on thevariation of the speed of light with photon energy (for the first time beyondthe planck scale for a linear energy dependence from direct time of arrivalmeasurements), (iii) lower-limits on the bulk lorentz factor of the grb outflow(of ~1000 for the brightest fermi lat grbs), (iv) the detection (or in othercases, lack thereof) of a distinct spectral component at high (and sometimesalso at low) energies, and possible implications for the prompt grb emissionmechanism, (v) the later onset (and longer duration) of the high-energyemission (&gt;100 mev), compared to the low-energy (&lt; ~1 mev) emission, that isseen in most fermi-lat grbs.

1004.0959	impulsive acceleration of strongly magnetized relativistic flows	the strong variability of magnetic central engines of agn and grbs may resultin highly intermittent strongly magnetized relativistic outflows. we find a newmagnetic acceleration mechanism for such impulsive flows that can be much moreeffective than the acceleration of steady-state flows. this impulsiveacceleration results in kinetic-energy-dominated flows at astrophysicallyrelevant distances from the central source. for a spherical flow, a discreteshell ejected from the source over a time t_0 with lorentz factor gamma~1 andinitial magnetization sigma_0 = b_0^2/(4 pi rho_0 c^2) &gt;&gt; 1 quickly reaches atypical lorentz factor gamma ~ sigma_0^{1/3} and magnetization sigma ~sigma_0^{2/3} at the distance r_0 ~ ct_0. at this point the magnetized shell ofwidth delta ~ r_0 in the lab frame loses causal contact with the source andcontinues to accelerate by spreading significantly in its own rest frame. theexpansion is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient and leads to relativisticrelative velocities between the front and back of the shell. while theexpansion is roughly symmetric in the center of momentum frame, in the labframe most of the energy and momentum remain in a region (or shell) of widthdelta ~ r_0 at the head of the flow. this acceleration proceeds as gamma ~(sigma_0 r/r_0)^{1/3} and sigma ~ sigma_0^{2/3} (r/r_0)^{-1/3} until reaching acoasting radius r_c ~ r_0 sigma_0^2 where the kinetic energy becomes dominant:gamma ~ sigma_0 and sigma ~ 1 at r_c. then the shell starts coasting andspreading (radially) causing its magnetization to drop as sigma ~ r_c/r atr&gt;r_c. given the typical variability time-scales of agn and grbs, the magneticacceleration in these sources is a combination of the quasi-steady-statecollimation acceleration close to the source and the impulsive accelerationfurther out. the interaction with the external medium is briefly discussed.

0708.4228	opacity build-up in impulsive relativistic sources	opacity effects in relativistic sources of high-energy gamma-rays, such asgamma-ray bursts (grbs) or blazars, can probe the lorentz factor of the outflowand the distance of the emission site from the source, and thus help constrainthe composition of the outflow (protons, pairs, magnetic field) and theemission mechanism. most previous works consider the opacity in steady state.here we study time dependent effects of the opacity to pair production($\gamma\gamma \to e^+e^-$) in impulsive relativistic sources. we present asimple, yet rich, semi-analytic model for the time and energy dependence of theoptical depth, $\tau$, where an ultra-relativistic thin spherical shell emitsisotropically in its own rest frame over a finite range of radii, $r_0 &lt; r &lt;r_0 + \delta r$. this is very relevant for grb internal shocks. we find that inan impulsive source ($\delta r &lt;~ r_0$), while the instantaneous spectrum hasan exponential cutoff above the photon energy $\epsilon_1(t)$ where $\tau = 1$,the time integrated spectrum has a power-law high-energy tail above a photonenergy $\epsilon_{1*} \sim \epsilon_1(\delta t)$ where $\delta t$ is theduration of the emission episode. furthermore, photons with $\epsilon &gt;\epsilon_{1*}$ will arrive mainly near the onset of the spike or flare from tothe short emission episode, as in impulsive sources it takes time to build-upthe (target) photon field, and thus $\tau(\epsilon)$ initially increases withtime and $\epsilon_1(t)$ decreases with time, so that photons of energy$\epsilon &gt; \epsilon_{1*}$ are able to escape the source mainly very early onwhile $\epsilon_1(t) &gt; \epsilon$. as the source approaches a quasi-steady state($\delta r &gt;&gt; r_0$), the time integrated spectrum develops an exponentialcutoff, while the power-law tail becomes increasingly suppressed.

1107.2121	fermi/gbm observations of sgr j0501+4516 bursts	we present our temporal and spectral analyses of 29 bursts from sgrj0501+4516, detected with the gamma-ray burst monitor onboard the fermigamma-ray space telescope during the 13 days of the source activation in 2008(august 22 to september 3). we find that the t90 durations of the bursts can befit with a log-normal distribution with a mean value of ~ 123 ms. we alsoestimate for the first time event durations of soft gamma repeater (sgr) burstsin photon space (i.e., using their deconvolved spectra) and find that these arevery similar to the t90s estimated in count space (following a log-normaldistribution with a mean value of ~ 124 ms). we fit the time-integrated spectrafor each burst and the time-resolved spectra of the five brightest bursts withseveral models. we find that a single power law with an exponential cutoffmodel fits all 29 bursts well, while 18 of the events can also be fit with twoblack body functions. we expand on the physical interpretation of these twomodels and we compare their parameters and discuss their evolution. we showthat the time-integrated and time-resolved spectra reveal that epeak decreaseswith energy flux (and fluence) to a minimum of ~30 kev at f=8.7e-6 erg/cm2/s,increasing steadily afterwards. two more sources exhibit a similar trend: sgrsj1550-5418 and 1806-20. the isotropic luminosity corresponding to these fluxvalues is roughly similar for all sources (0.4-1.5 e40 erg/s).

1109.5314	interaction of a highly magnetized impulsive relativistic flow with an  external medium	important astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts (grbs) or tidaldisruption events, are impulsive -- strongly varying with time. these outflowsare likely highly magnetized near the central source, but their interactionwith the external medium is not yet fully understood. here i consider thecombined impulsive magnetic acceleration of an initially highly magnetizedshell of plasma and its deceleration by the external medium. i find four maindynamical regimes, that (for a given outflow) depend on the external density.(i) for small enough external densities the shell becomes kinetically dominatedbefore it is significantly decelerated, thus reverting to the familiarunmagnetized "thin shell" case, which produces bright reverse shock emissionthat peaks well after the prompt grb. (ii) for larger external densities theshell remains highly magnetized and the reverse shock is strongly suppressed.it eventually transfers most of its energy through pdv work to the shockedexternal medium, whose afterglow emission peaks on a timescale similar to theprompt grb duration. (iii) for even larger external densities there is noinitial impulsive acceleration phase. (iv) for the highest external densitiesthe flow remains newtonian.

1109.5315	the effects of sub-shells in highly magnetized relativistic flows	astrophysical sources of relativistic jets or outflows, such as gamma-raybursts (grbs), active galactic nuclei (agn) or micro-quasars, often show strongtime variability. despite such impulsive behavior, most models of these sourcesassume a steady state for simplicity. here i consider a time-dependent outflowthat is initially highly magnetized and divided into many well-separatedsub-shells, as it experiences impulsive magnetic acceleration and interactswith the external medium. in agn the deceleration by the external medium isusually unimportant and most of the initial magnetic energy is naturallyconverted into kinetic energy, leading to efficient dissipation in internalshocks as the sub-shells collide. such efficient low-magnetization internalshocks can also naturally occur in grbs, where the deceleration by the externalmedium can be important. a strong low-magnetization reverse shock can develop,and the initial division into sub-shells allows it to be relativistic and itsemission to peak on the timescale of the prompt grb duration (which is notpossible for a single shell). sub-shells also enable the outflow to reach muchhigher lorentz factors that help satisfy existing constraints on grbs fromintrinsic pair opacity and from the afterglow onset time.

1109.6468	on the lateral expansion of grb jets	the dynamics of grb jets during the afterglow phase have an important effecton the interpretation of their observations and for inferring key physicalparameters such as their true energy and event rate. semi-analytic modelsgenerally predict a fast lateral expansion, where the jet opening angleasymptotically grows exponentially with its radius. numerical simulations,however, show a much more modest lateral expansion, where the jet retainsmemory of its initial opening angle for a very long time, and the flow remainsnon-spherical until it becomes sub-relativistic, and only then graduallyapproaches spherical symmetry. here we suggest a new analytic model based on anew physically derived recipe for the lateral expansion. we also generalize themodel by relaxing the common approximations of ultra-relativistic motion and anarrow jet opening angle. we find that the new analytic model fits much betterthe results of numerical simulations, mainly because it remains valid also inthe mildly relativistic, quasi spherical regime. this model shows that formodest initial jet half-opening angles, \theta_0, the outflow is notsufficiently ultra-relativistic when its lorentz factor reaches \gamma =1/\theta_0 and therefore the sideways expansion is rather slow, showing norapid, exponential phase. on the other hand, we find that jets with anextremely narrow initial half-opening angle, of about \theta_0 &lt;&lt; 10^{-1.5} orso, which are still sufficiently ultra-relativistic at \gamma = 1/\theta_0, doshow a phase of rapid, exponential lateral expansion. however, even such jetsthat expand sideways exponentially are still not spherical when they becomesub-relativistic.

1111.6667	simulations of grb jets in a stratified external medium: dynamics,  afterglow lightcurves, jet breaks and radio calorimetry	the dynamics of grb jets during the afterglow phase is most reliably andaccurately modelled using hydrodynamic simulations. all published simulations,however, have considered only a uniform external medium, while a stratifiedexternal medium is expected around long duration grb progenitors. here wepresent simulations of the dynamics of grb jets and the resulting afterglowemission for both uniform and stratified external media with $\rho \proptor^{-k}$ for k = 0, 1, 2. the simulations are performed in 2d using the specialrelativistic version of the mezcal code. the dynamics for stratified externalmedia are broadly similar to those derived for expansion into a uniformexternal medium. the jet half-opening angle start increasing logarithmicallywith time once the lorentz factor drops below 1/theta_0. for larger k valuesthe lateral expansion is faster at early times and slower at late times withthe jet expansion becoming newtonian and slowly approaching spherical symmetryover progressively longer timescales. we find that contrary to analyticexpectations, there is a reasonably sharp jet break in the lightcurve for k = 2although the shape of the break is affected more by the viewing angle than bythe slope of the external density profile. steeper density profiles are foundto produce more gradual jet breaks while larger viewing angles cause smootherand later appearing jet breaks. the counter-jet becomes visible as it becomessub-relativistic, and for k=0 this results in a clear bump-like feature in thelight curve. however, for larger k values the jet decelerates more gradually,causing only a mild flattening in the radio light curve that might be hard todiscern when k=2. late time radio calorimetry is likely to consistentlyover-estimate the true energy by up to a factor of a few for k=2, and eitherover-predict or under-predict it by a smaller factor for k = 0,1.

1111.6865	scaling relations between numerical simulations and physical systems  they represent	the dynamical equations describing the evolution of a physical systemgenerally have a freedom in the choice of units, where different choicescorrespond to different physical systems that are described by the sameequations. since there are three basic physical units, of mass, length andtime, there are up to three free parameters in such a rescaling of the units,$n_f \leq 3$. in newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually threefree parameters, $n_f = 3$. if, however, the dynamical equations contain auniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or thegravitational constant $g$, then the requirement that its value remains thesame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of freeparameters by one, to $n_f = 2$. this is the case, for example, inmagneto-hydrodynamics (mhd) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$appears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units toscale by the same factor, or in newtonian gravity where the gravitationalconstant $g$ appears in the equations. more generally, when there are $n_{udc}$independent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then thenumber of free parameters is $n_f = max(0,3-n_{udc})$. when both gravity andrelativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($n_f = 1$, as both$g$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $n_{udc} = 2$), and the units ofmass, length and time must all scale by the same factor. the explicitrescalings for different types of systems are discussed and summarized here.such rescalings of the units also hold for discrete particles, e.g. in n-bodyor particle in cell simulations. they are very useful when numericallyinvestigating a large parameter space or when attempting to fit particularexperimental results, by significantly reducing the required number ofsimulations.

1111.6890	gamma-ray burst dynamics and afterglow radiation from adaptive mesh  refinement, special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations	we report on the development of mezcal-srhd, a new adaptive mesh refinement,special relativistic hydrodynamics (srhd) code, developed with the aim ofstudying the highly relativistic flows in gamma-ray burst sources. the srhdequations are solved using finite volume conservative solvers. the correctimplementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1d) shock tubeand multidimensional tests. the code is then applied to study the propagationof 1d spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with$\rho \propto r^{-k}$, bridging between the relativistic and newtonian phases,as well as to a two-dimensional (2d) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jetpropagating in a constant density medium. it is shown that the deceleration tonon-relativistic speeds in one-dimension occurs on scales significantly largerthan the sedov length. this transition is further delayed with respect to thesedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium isincreased. this result, together with the scaling of position, lorentz factorand the shock velocity as a function of time and shock radius, is explainedhere using a simple analytical model based on energy conservation. the methodused for calculating the afterglow radiation by post-processing the results ofthe simulations is described in detail. the light curves computed using theresults of 1d numerical simulations during the relativistic stage correctlyreproduce those calculated assuming the self-similar blandford-mckee solutionfor the evolution of the flow. the jet dynamics from our 2d simulations and theresulting afterglow lightcurves, including the jet break, are in good agreementwith those presented in previous works. finally, we show how the details of thedynamics critically depend on properly resolving the structure of therelativistic flow.

1206.4915	detection of spectral evolution in the bursts emitted during the  2008-2009 active episode of sgr j1550 - 5418	in early october 2008, the soft gamma repeater sgrj1550 - 5418 (1e 1547.0 -5408, axj155052 - 5418, psr j1550 - 5418) became active, emitting a series ofbursts which triggered the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) after which asecond especially intense activity period commenced in 2009 january and athird, less active period was detected in 2009 march-april. here we analyze thegbm data all the bursts from the first and last active episodes. we performedtemporal and spectral analysis for all events and found that their temporalcharacteristics are very similar to the ones of other sgr bursts, as well theones reported for the bursts of the main episode (average burst durations \sim170 ms). in addition, we used our sample of bursts to quantify the systematicuncertainties of the gbm location algorithm for soft gamma-ray transients to &lt;8 deg. our spectral analysis indicates significant spectral evolution betweenthe first and last set of events. although the 2008 october events are best fitwith a single blackbody function, for the 2009 bursts an optically thin thermalbremsstrahlung (ottb) is clearly preferred. we attribute this evolution tochanges in the magnetic field topology of the source, possibly due to effectsfollowing the very energetic main bursting episode.

1207.1434	broadband spectral investigations of sgr j1550-5418 bursts	we present the results of our broadband spectral analysis of 42 sgrj1550-5418 bursts simultaneously detected with the swift/x-ray telescope (xrt)and the fermi/gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm), during the 2009 january activeepisode of the source. the unique spectral and temporal capabilities of the xrtwindowed timing mode have allowed us to extend the gbm spectral coverage forthese events down to the x-ray domain (0.5-10 kev). our earlier analysis of thegbm data found that the sgr j1550-5418 burst spectra were described equallywell with a comptonized model or with two blackbody functions; the two modelswere statistically indistinguishable. our new broadband (0.5 - 200 kev)spectral fits show that, on average, the burst spectra are better describedwith two blackbody functions than with the comptonized model. thus, our jointxrt/gbm analysis clearly shows for the first time that the sgr j1550-5418 burstspectra might naturally be expected to exhibit a more truly thermalizedcharacter, such as a two-blackbody or even a multi-blackbody signal. using theswift and rxte timing ephemeris for sgr j1550-5418 we construct thedistribution of the xrt burst counts with spin phase and find that it is notcorrelated with the persistent x-ray emission pulse phase from sgr j1550-5418.these results indicate that the burst emitting sites on the neutron star neednot be co-located with hot spots emitting the bulk of the persistent x-rayemission. finally, we show that there is a significant pulse phase dependenceof the xrt burst counts, likely demonstrating that the surface magnetic fieldof sgr j1550-5418 is not uniform over the emission zone, since it isanticipated that regions with stronger surface magnetic field could triggerbursts more efficiently.

1212.1011	quasi-periodic oscillations and broadband variability in short magnetar  bursts	the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in magnetar giant flareshas opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. however, with onlythree giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient qualityto search for qpos, such analysis is seriously data limited. we set out aprocedure for doing qpo searches in the far more numerous, short, lessenergetic magnetar bursts. the short, transient nature of these bursts requiresthe implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliableinferences. using bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as acombination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at highfrequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. we useempirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodicand quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies. we compare our methodwith previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole moreconservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives. weillustrate our bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from themagnetar sgr j0501+4516 observed by the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor, and wefind no evidence for the presence of qpos in any of the bursts in the unbinnedspectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst.however, whether this signal is due to a genuine quasi-periodic process, or canbe attributed to unmodeled effects in the noise is at this point a matter ofinterpretation.

1303.1370	new methods for timing analysis of transient events, applied to  fermi/gbm magnetar bursts	in order to discern the physical nature of many gamma-ray sources in the sky,we must look not only in spectral and spatial dimensions, but also understandtheir temporal variability. however, timing analysis of sources with a highlytransient nature, such as magnetar bursts, is difficult: standard fouriertechniques developed for long-term variability generally observed, for example,from agn often do not apply. here, we present newly developed timing methodsapplicable to transient events of all kinds, and show their successfulapplication to magnetar bursts observed with fermi/gbm. magnetars are a primesubject for timing studies, thanks to the detection of quasi-periodicities inmagnetar giant flares and their potential to help shed light on the structureof neutron stars. using state-of-the art statistical techniques, we search forquasi-periodicities (qpos) in a sample of bursts from soft gamma repeater sgrj0501+4516 observed with fermi/gbm and provide upper limits for potential qpodetections. additionally, for the first time, we characterise the broadbandvariability behaviour of magnetar bursts and highlight how this new informationcould provide us with another way to probe these mysterious objects.

1308.6403	constraints on lorentz invariance violation with fermi-lat observations  of gamma-ray bursts	some quantum gravity (qg) theories allow for a violation of lorentzinvariance (liv), manifesting as a dependence of the velocity of light invacuum on its energy. if such a dependence exists, then photons of differentenergies emitted together by a distant source will arrive at the earth atdifferent times. high-energy (gev) transient emissions from distantastrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and active galaxy nucleican be used to search for and constrain liv. the fermi collaboration haspreviously analyzed two grbs in order to put constraints on the dispersionparameter in vacuum, and on the energy scale at which qg effects causing livmay arise. we used three different methods on four bright grbs observed by thefermi-lat to get more stringent and robust constraints. no delays have beendetected and strong limits on the qg energy scale are derived: for lineardispersion we set tight constraints placing the qg energy scale above theplanck mass; a quadratic leading liv effect is also constrained.

1402.4142	the dynamics of a highly magnetized jet propagating inside a star	the collapsar model explains the association of long duration gamma-raybursts (grbs) with stellar collapse. it involves a relativistic jet that formsat the core of a collapsing massive star. the jet penetrates the stellarenvelope and the prompt grb emission is produced once the jet is well outsidethe star. most current models for generation of relativistic jets involvepoynting flux dominated outflows. we explore here the propagation of such a jetthrough a stellar envelope. the jet forms a bow shock around it. energydissipation at the head of this shock supplies energy to a cocoon thatsurrounds the jet. this cocoon exerts pressure on the jet and collimates it.while this description resembles the propagation of a hydrodynamic jets thereare significant qualitative differences. two strong shocks, the reverse shockthat slows down the hydrodynamic jet and the collimation shock that collimatesit, cannot form within the poynting flux dominated jet. as a result this jetmoves much faster and dissipates much less energy while it crosses the stellarenvelope. we construct here a simple analytic model that explores, selfconsistently, the jet-cocoon interaction and dynamics. using this model wedetermine the properties of the jet, including its velocity, propagation timeand shape.

1404.2756	quasi-periodic oscillations in short recurring bursts of the soft-gamma  repeater j1550-5418	the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in magnetar giant flareshas opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. the scarcity ofgiant flares makes a search for qpos in the shorter, far more numerous burstsfrom soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) desirable. in huppenkothen et al (2013), wedeveloped a bayesian method for searching for qpos in short magnetar bursts,taking into account the effects of the complicated burst structure, and haveshown its feasibility on a small sample of bursts. here, we apply the samemethod to a much larger sample from a burst storm of 286 bursts from sgrj1550-5418. we report a candidate signal at 260 hz in a search of theindividual bursts, which is fairly broad. we also find two qpos at 93 hz andone at 127 hz, when averaging periodograms from a number of bursts inindividual triggers, at frequencies close to qpos previously observed inmagnetar giant flares. finally, for the first time, we explore the overallburst variability in the sample, and report a weak anti-correlation between thepower-law index of the broadband model characterising aperiodic burstvariability, and the burst duration: shorter bursts have steeper power lawindices than longer bursts. this indicates that longer bursts vary over abroader range of time scales, and are not simply longer versions of the shortbursts.

1407.0123	on the composition of grbs' collapsar jets	the duration distribution of long gamma ray bursts reveals a plateau atdurations shorter than ~20 s (in the observer frame) and a power-law decline atlonger durations (bromberg et al., 2012). such a plateau arises naturally inthe collapsar model. in this model the engine has to operate long enough topush the jet out of the stellar envelope and the observed duration of the burstis the difference between the engine's operation time and the jet breakouttime. we compare the jet breakout time inferred from the duration distribution(~10 s in the burst's frame) to the breakout time of a hydrodynamic jet (~10 sfor typical parameters) and of a poynting flux dominated jet with the sameoverall energy (&lt;~1 s). as only the former is compatible with the duration ofthe plateau in the grb duration distribution, we conclude that the jet ishydrodynamic during most of the time that its head is within the envelope ofthe progenitor star and around the time when it emerges from the star. thiswould naturally arise if the jet forms as a hydrodynamic jet in the first placeor if it forms poynting flux dominated but dissipates most of its magneticenergy early on within the progenitor star and emerges as a hydrodynamic jet.

astro-ph;0001160	the synchrotron spectrum of fast cooling electrons revisited	we discuss the spectrum arising from synchrotron emission by fast cooling(fc) electrons, when fresh electrons are continually accelerated by a strongblast wave, into a power law distribution of energies. the fc spectrum was sofar described by four power law segments divided by three break frequencies$\nu_{sa} &lt; \nu_{c} &lt; \nu_{m}$. this is valid for a homogeneous electrondistribution. however, hot electrons are located right after the shock, whilemost electrons are farther down stream and have cooled. this spatialdistribution changes the optically thick part of the spectrum, introducing anew break frequency, $\nu_{ac} &lt; \nu_{sa}$, and a new spectral slope, $f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{11/8}$ for $\nu_{ac} &lt; \nu &lt; \nu_{sa}$. the familiar $f_{\nu}\propto \nu ^{2}$ holds only for $\nu &lt; \nu_{ac}$. this ordering of the breakfrequencies is relevant for typical gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows in an ismenvironment. other possibilities arise for internal shocks or afterglows indense circumstellar winds. we discuss possible implications of this spectrumfor grbs and their afterglows, in the context of the internal-external shockmodel. observations of $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{11/8}$ would enable us to probescales much smaller than the typical size of the system, and constrain theamount of turbulent mixing behind the shock.

astro-ph;0103038	light curves from an expanding relativistic jet	we perform fully relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the decelerationand lateral expansion of a relativistic jet as it expands into an ambientmedium. the hydrodynamic calculations use a 2d adaptive mesh refinement (amr)code, which provides adequate resolution of the thin shell of matter behind theshock. we find that the sideways propagation is different than predicted bysimple analytic models. the physical conditions at the sides of the jet arefound to be significantly different than at the front of the jet, and most ofthe emission occurs within the initial opening angle of the jet. the lightcurves, as seen by observers at different viewing angles with respect to thejet axis, are then calculated assuming synchrotron emission. for an observeralong the jet axis, we find a sharp achromatic `jet break' in the light curveat frequencies above the typical synchrotron frequency, at $t_{jet}\approx5.8(e_{52}/n_1)^{1/3}(\theta_0/0.2)^{8/3}$ days, while the temporal decay index$\alpha$ ($f_{\nu}\propto t^{\alpha}$) after the break is steeper than $-p$($\alpha=-2.85$ for $p=2.5$). at larger viewing angles $t_{jet}$ increases andthe jet break becomes smoother.

astro-ph;0103108	radiative hydromagnetic shocks in relativistic outflow sources	we calculate the structure of a relativistic shock wave in which the internalenergy of the shocked fluid is radiated away on a time scale much shorter thanthe characteristic shock propagation time. the shock is assumed to move througha uniformly magnetized, neutral plasma consisting of protons, electrons, andpositrons, and allowance is made for the possible production ofelectron/positron pairs in the shock itself. the radiation mechanism is takento be synchrotron and inverse-compton emission (the latter involving bothsynchrotron-produced and externally supplied seed photons) by the electrons andpositrons. we simplify the discussion by considering a shock in which themagnetic field is transverse to the direction of propagation and focusattention on the properties of the radiative zone that forms behind the shocktransition. in particular, we investigate the possibility that the compressioninduced by the cooling of the gas amplifies the magnetic pressure until itreaches (and ultimately exceeds) equipartition with the thermal pressure(which, in turn, limits the overall compression). we show that, if asignificant fraction of the postshock thermal energy is deposited in theelectron/positron component, then a considerable portion of the emittedradiation will come from regions of strong magnetic field even if the fieldimmediately behind the shock transition is well below equipartition. this fieldamplification mechanism may be relevant to the production of synchrotron flaresin blazars, miniquasars, and gamma-ray burst sources. we consider the latterapplication in some detail and show that this process may play a role in theprompt $\gamma$-ray and possibly also the optical ``flash'' and radio ``flare''emission, but probably not in the afterglow.

astro-ph;0105240	microlensing and the surface brightness profile of the afterglow image  of grb 000301c	the optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (grb) 000301c exhibited asignificant, short-timescale deviation from the power-law flux decline expectedin the standard synchrotron shock model. garnavich, loeb &amp; stanek found thatthis deviation was well-fit by an ad hoc model in which a thin ring of emissionis microlensed by an intervening star. we revisit the microlensinginterpretation of this variability, first by testing whether microlensing ofafterglow images with realistic surface brightness profiles (sbps) can fit thedata, and second by directly inverting the observed light curve to obtain anon-parametric measurement of the sbp. we find that microlensing of realisticsbps can reproduce the observed deviation, provided that the optical emissionarises from frequencies above the cooling break. conversely, if the variabilityis indeed caused by microlensing, the sbp must be significantlylimb-brightened. specifically, greater than 60% of the flux must originate fromthe outer 25% of the area of the afterglow image. the latter requirement issatisfied by the best fit theoretical sbp. the underlying optical/infraredafterglow lightcurve is consistent with a model in which a jet is propagatinginto a uniform medium with the cooling break frequency below the optical band.

astro-ph;0108027	the shape of spectral breaks in grb afterglows	gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows are well described by synchrotron emissionfrom relativistic blast waves expanding into an external medium. the blast waveis believed to amplify the magnetic field and accelerate the electrons into apower law distribution of energies promptly behind the shock. these electronsthen cool both adiabatically and by emitting synchrotron and inverse comptonradiation. the resulting spectra is known to consist several power lawsegments, which smoothly join at certain break frequencies. here, we give acomplete description of all possible spectra under those assumptions, and findthat there are 5 possible regimes, depending on the ordering of the breakfrequencies. the flux density is calculated by integrating over thecontributions from all the shocked region, using the blandford mckee solution.this allows us to calculate more accurate expressions for the value of thesebreak frequencies, and describe the shape of the spectral breaks around them.this also provides the shape of breaks in the light curves caused by thepassage of a break frequency through the observed band. these new, more exact,estimates are different from more simple calculations by up to a factor ofabout 70, and describe some new regimes which where previously ignored.

astro-ph;0112087	gamma-ray burst afterglows in pulsar-wind bubbles	we propose to identify pulsar-wind bubbles (pwbs) as the environment in whichthe afterglow emission in at least some gamma-ray bursts (grbs) originates.such bubbles could naturally account for the high fraction of the internalenergy residing in relativistic electrons/positrons ($\epsilon_e$) and the highmagnetic-to-internal energy ratio ($\epsilon_b$) that have been inferred in anumber of sources. grbs might occur within pwbs under a number of scenarios: inparticular, in the supranova model of grb formation a prolonged (months toyears) period of intense pulsar-type wind from the grb progenitor precedes theburst. focusing on this scenario, we construct a simple model of the early-timestructure of a plerionic supernova remnant. the model is based on theassumption of an ``equipartition'' upper bound on the electromagnetic-to-thermal pressure ratio in the bubble and takes into account synchrotron-radiation cooling. we derive an expression for the effective hydrogen numberdensity $n_{h,equiv}$ of the shocked pulsar wind in terms of the comovingparticle pressure and electromagnetic fields. we show that, for plausibleparameter values, $n_{h,equiv}$ spans the range inferred from spectral fits togrb afterglows and that its radial profile varies within the bubble and mayresemble a uniform interstellar medium or a stellar wind. we consider how thestandard expressions for the characteristic synchrotron spectrum are modifiedwhen the afterglow-emitting shock propagates inside a pwb and demonstrate thatthe predictions for the empirically inferred values of $\epsilon_e$ and$\epsilon_b$ are compatible with the observations. finally, we outline aself-consistent interpretation of the x-ray emission features detected insources like grb 991216 in the context of the supranova/pwb picture.

astro-ph;0204203	the detectability of orphan afterglows	the realization that grbs release a constant amount of energy implies thatthe post jet-break afterglow evolution would be largely universal. for a givenredshift all afterglows should be detected up to a fixed observer angle. weestimate the observed magnitude and the implied detectability of orphanafterglows. we show that for reasonable limiting magnitudes ($m_{lim}=25$)orphan afterglows would typically be detected from small ($\sim 10^\circ$)angles away from the grb jet axis. a detected orphan afterglow would generallycorrespond to a "near-miss" of the grb whose jet was pointing just slightlyaway from us. with our most optimistic parameters we expect that 15 orphanafterglows will be recorded in the sdss and 35 transients will be recorded in adedicated 2m class telescope operating full time for a year in an orphanafterglow search. the rate is smaller by a factor of 15 for our "canonical"parameters. we show that for a given facility an optimal survey should beshallower, covering larger area rather than deeper. the limiting magnitudeshould not be, however, lower than $\sim$ 23rd as in this case more transientsfrom on-axis grbs will be discovered than orphan afterglows. about 15% of thetransients could be discovered with a second exposure of the same area providedthat it follows after 3, 4 and 8 days for $m_{lim}=23$, 25 and 27.

astro-ph;0208156	observational implications of a plerionic environment for grbs	we consider grbs that occur inside pulsar wind bubbles (pwbs), in the contextof the supranova model, where initially a supernova explosion takes place,leaving behind a supra-massive neutron star (smns), which eventually loses itsrotational energy and collapses to a black hole, triggering a grb explosion.the most natural mechanism by which the smns can lose its rotational energy isthrough a strong pulsar type wind, between the supernova and the grb events,which is expected to create a pwb. we analyze in some detail the observationalimplications of such a plerionic environment on the afterglow (ag) and promptgrb emissions, and the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission.we find that for a simple spherical model, grbs with iron lines detected in thex-ray ag should not have a detectable radio afterglow, and should have smalljet break times and non-relativistic transition times, in disagreement withobservations for some of the grbs with x-ray lines. these discrepancies withthe observations may be reconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry,where the pwb is elongated along the polar axis. we find that lack of detectionof the plerion emission provides interesting constraints on the modelparameters. finally, we predict that the inverse compton upscattering of thepwb photons by the relativistic electrons of the ag (external compton, ec)should lead to high energy emission during the early ag that might explain thegev photons detected by egret for a few grbs, and should be detectable byfuture missions such as glast.

astro-ph;0208439	the mean number of extra micro-image pairs for macro-lensed quasars	when a gravitationally lensed source crosses a caustic, a pair of images iscreated or destroyed. we calculate the mean number of such pairs ofmicro-images $&lt;n&gt;$ for a given macro-image of a gravitationally lensed pointsource, due to microlensing by the stars of the lensing galaxy. this quantitywas calculated by wambsganss, witt &amp; schneider (1992) for the case of zeroexternal shear, $\gamma=0$, at the location of the macro-image. since inrealistic lens models a non-zero shear is expected to be induced by the lensinggalaxy, we extend this calculation to a general value of $\gamma$. we find acomplex behavior of $&lt;n&gt;$ as a function of $\gamma$ and the normalized surfacemass density in stars $\kappa_*$. specifically, we find that at highmagnifications, where the average total magnification of the macro-image is$&lt;\mu&gt;=|(1-\kappa_*)^2-\gamma^2|^{-1}\gg 1$, $&lt;n&gt;$ becomes correspondinglylarge, and is proportional to $&lt;\mu&gt;$. the ratio $&lt;n&gt;/&lt;\mu&gt;$ is largest nearthe line $\gamma=1-\kappa_*$ where the magnification $&lt;\mu&gt;$ becomes infinite,and its maximal value is 0.306. we compare our semi-analytic results for $&lt;n&gt;$to the results of numerical simulations and find good agreement. we find thatthe probability distribution for the number of extra image pairs is reasonablydescribed by a poisson distribution with a mean value of $&lt;n&gt;$, and that thewidth of the macro-image magnification distribution tends to be largest for$&lt;n&gt;\sim 1$.

astro-ph;0209578	high energy emission from the prompt gamma-ray burst	we study the synchrotron and synchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission frominternal shocks that are responsible for the prompt gamma-ray emission in grbs,and consider the relation between these two components, taking into account thehigh energy (he) cutoff due to pair production and thomson scattering. we findthat in order for the peak energy of the synchrotron to be e_p\sim 300 kev witha variability time t_v&gt;1 ms, a lorentz factor \gamma&lt;350 is needed, implying nohe emission above \sim 30 mev and the synchrotron component would dominate atall energies. if we want both e_p\sim 300 kev and prompt he emission up to 2gev, as detected by egret for grb 940217, we need \gamma\sim 600 and t_v\sim0.1 ms, which might be resolved by super agile. if such prompt he emission iscommon in grbs, as may be tested by glast, then for t_v\gtrsim 1 ms we need\gamma\gtrsim 350, which implies e_p\lesssim 100 kev. therefore if x-rayflashes are grbs with high values of t_v and \gamma, they should produce\gtrsim 1 gev emission. for an electron power law index p&gt;2, the ssc componentdominates the emission above 100 mev. future observations by glast may helpdetermine the value of p and whether the he emission is consistent with asingle power law (one component--the synchrotron, dominates) or has a breakwhere the \nuf_\nu slope turns from negative to positive, implying that the ssccomponent becomes dominant above \sim 100 mev. the he emission is expected toshow similar variability and time structure to that of the soft gamma-rayemission. finally, we find that in order to see delayed he emission from theprompt grb due to pair production with the cosmic ir background, extremelysmall intergalactic magnetic fields (\lessim 10^{-22} g) are required.

astro-ph;0210631	variability in grb afterglows and grb 021004	we present general analytic expressions for grb afterglow light curvesarising from a variable external density profile and/or a variable energy inthe blast wave. the former could arise from a clumpy ism or a variable stellarwind; the latter could arise from refreshed shocks or from an angular dependentjet structure (patchy shell). both scenarios would lead to a variable lightcurve. our formalism enables us to invert the observed light curve and obtainpossible density or energy profiles. the optical afterglow of grb 021004 wasdetected 537 seconds ab (after the burst) (fox et al. 2002). extensive followup observations revealed a significant temporal variability. we apply ourformalism to the r-band light curve of grb 021004 and we find that severalmodels provide a good fit to the data. we consider the patchy shell model with$p=2.2$ as the most likely explanation. according to this model our line ofsight was towards a "cold spot" that has lead to a relativity low $\gamma$-rayflux and an initially weak afterglow (while the x-ray afterglow flux after aday was above average). observations above the cooling frequency, $\nu_c$,could provide the best way to distinguish between our different models.

astro-ph;0211136	gamma-ray bursts in pulsar wind bubbles: putting the pieces together	we present the main observational features expected for grbs that occurinside pulsar wind bubbles (pwbs). this is the most natural outcome ofsupranova model where initially a supernova explosion takes place, leaving asupra-massive ns, which loses its rotational energy over a time t_sd andcollapses to a bh, triggering a grb explosion. we find that the time delay t_sdbetween the supernova and grb events is the most important parameter thatdetermines the behavior of the system. we consider the afterglow, prompt grband direct emission from the pwb. the observational signatures for differentt_sd are described and joined together into one coherent framework. constraintson the model are derived for a spherical pwb, from the lack of detection of thepwb emission and afterglow observations. for very low values of t_sd&lt;1 hr thesupranova model reduces to the collapsar model; 0.4&lt;t_sd/1yr&lt;1 is required toproduce the iron lines seen in some x-ray afterglows. however, we find that fora spherical pwb, this implies no detectable radio afterglow, a small jet breaktime and non-relativistic transition time, in disagreement with observationsfor some of these grbs. these discrepancies with the observations may bereconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry. we find that light elementlines, recently detected in a few x-ray afterglows, are expected to dominateover iron lines for small t_sd, while for large t_sd the situation is reversed.finally, we predict that external compton scattering of the pwb photons by theafterglow relativistic electrons, should lead to high energy emission duringthe early afterglow that may explain the gev photons detected by egret in somegrbs, and should be detectable by future missions (glast).

astro-ph;0301627	the jet angular profile and the afterglow light curves	we investigate how the angular structure of grb jets effects the afterglowlight curves at different viewing angles, $\theta_{v}$, from the jet symmetryaxis. a numerical hydrodynamical modeling for the evolution of a relativisticcollimated outflow, as it interacts with the surrounding medium, is carriedout, and compared to two simple models that make opposite and extremeassumptions for the degree of lateral energy transfer. the lorentz factor,$\gamma$, and kinetic energy per unit solid angle, $\epsilon$, are initiallytaken to be power laws of the angle $\theta$ from the jet axis. we find thatthe lateral velocity in the comoving frame, $v'_\theta$, is typically muchsmaller than the sound speed, $c_s$, as long as $\gamma\gg 1$, and the dynamicsof relativistic structured jets may be reasonably described by a simpleanalytic model where $\epsilon$ is independent of time, as long as$\gamma(\theta=0)\ga$ a few. we perform a qualitative comparison between theresulting light curves and afterglow observations. this constrains the jetstructure, and poses problems for a `universal' jet model, where all grb jetsare assumed to be intrinsically identical, and differ only by our viewingangle, $\theta_{v}$.

astro-ph;0303174	the evolution of a structured relativistic jet and grb afterglow  light-curves	we carry out a numerical hydrodynamical modeling for the evolution of arelativistic collimated outflow, as it interacts with the surrounding medium,and calculate the light-curve resulting from synchrotron emission of theshocked fluid. the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to 1-d by assuming axialsymmetry and integrating over the radial profile of the flow, thus considerablyreducing the computation time. we present results for a number of differentinitial jet structures, including several different power-laws and a gaussianprofile for the dependence of the energy per unit solid angle, $\epsilon$, andthe lorentz factor, $\gamma$, on the angle from the jet symmetry axis. ourchoice of parameters for the various calculations is motivated by the currentknowledge of relativistic outflows from gamma-ray bursts and the observedafterglow light-curves. comparison of the light curves for different jetprofiles with grb afterglow observations provides constraints on the jetstructure. one of the main results we find is that the transverse fluidvelocity in the comoving frame ($v_t$) and the speed of sideways expansion, forsmooth jet profiles, is typically much smaller than the speed of sound ($c_s$)throughout much of the evolution of the jet; $v_t$ approaches $c_s$ when$\gamma$ along the jet axis becomes of order a few (for large angular gradientof $\epsilon$, $v_t\sim c_s$ while $\gamma$ is still large). this resultsuggests that the dynamics of relativistic structured jets may be reasonablydescribed by a simple analytic model where $\epsilon$ is independent of time,as long as $\gamma$ along the jet-axis is larger than a few.

astro-ph;0304286	linear polarization in gamma-ray bursts: the case for an ordered  magnetic field	linear polarization at the level of $\sim 1-3%$ has by now been measured inseveral gamma-ray burst afterglows. whereas the degree of polarization, $p$,was found to vary in some sources, the position angle, $\theta_p$, was roughlyconstant in all cases. until now, the polarization has been commonly attributedto synchrotron radiation from a jet with a tangled magnetic field that isviewed somewhat off axis. however, this model predicts either a peak in $p$ ora $90^\circ$ change in $\theta_p$ around the ``jet break'' time in thelightcurve, for which there has so far been no observational confirmation. wepropose an alternative interpretation, wherein the polarization is attributed,at least in part, to a large-scale, ordered magnetic field in the ambientmedium. the ordered component may dominate the polarization even if the totalemissivity is dominated by a tangled field generated by postshock turbulence.in this picture, $\theta_p$ is roughly constant because of the uniformity ofthe field, whereas $p$ varies as a result of changes in the ratio of theordered-to-random mean-squared field amplitudes. we point out that variableafterglow light curves should be accompanied by a variable polarization. theradiation from the original ejecta, which includes the prompt gamma-rayemission and the emission from the reverse shock (the `optical flash' and`radio flare'), could potentially exhibit a high degree of polarization (up to$\sim 60%$) induced by an ordered transverse magnetic field advected from thecentral source.

astro-ph;0304563	the variable light curve of grb 030329: the case for refreshed shocks	grb 030329 is unique in many aspects. it has a very low redshift for a grb,$z=0.1685$, and is therefore very bright and easy to monitor, making it themost well studied afterglow to date. it shows a supernova bump in the lightcurve, with a spectrum very similar to sn 1998bw, thus establishing with muchbetter confidence the connection between grbs and core collapse sne. there arealso two important physical characteristics that make this burst especiallyinteresting, aside from its remarkably low redshift. first, unlike most grbafterglows, the light curve of grb 030329 shows a very large variability a fewdays after the burst. these fluctuations show a roughly constact amplitude, anda constant duration $\delta t$, while $\delta t/t$ decreases with time $t$.second, its $\gamma$-ray energy output and x-ray luminosity at $10 $hr are afactor of $\sim 20$ and $\sim 30$, respectively, below the average value aroundwhich most grbs are narrowly clustered. we consider several interpretations forthe variability in the light curve, in the context of different physicalmechanisms, and find that the most likely cause is refreshed shocks, i.e. slowshells that are ejected from the source and catch up with the afterglow shockat late times. in grb 030329 this happens after the jet break, which implies anapproximately constant duration $\delta t$ of the bumps, in agreement with theobservations. this interpretation also explains the anomalously low initialenergy of this burst, as the total energy of the afterglow shock is increasedby a factor of $\sim 10$ due to the refreshed shocks, thus bringing the totalenergy output close to the average value for all grbs.

astro-ph;0305379	radio imaging of grb jets in nearby supernovae	we calculate the time evolution of the flux, apparent size, and imagecentroid motion of gamma-ray burst (grb) radio jets, and show that they can beresolved by the vlba at distances of hundreds of mpc. we find that grb 030329which showed spectroscopic evidence for an associated type ic supernova (sn) ata distance of $\approx$ 800 mpc might just be resolvable by vlba after severalmonths. the prospects are much better for jets that are oriented sideways insimilar sne with no grb counterpart; in particular, the motion of the fluxcentroid in such jets can be detected by vlba up to $z\sim 1$ even when the jetcannot be resolved. if most grbs are accompanied by a type ib/c sn, then thereshould be a few sn/grb jets per year within a distance $\lesssim$ 200 mpc, andmost of them would be oriented sideways with no gamma-ray or x-ray precursor.detection of these jets can be used to calibrate the fraction of all corecollapse sne that produce relativistic outflows and determine the local grbrate. overall, the rate of type ib/c sne that do not produce a grb at all, butrather make relativistic radio jets with an initial lorentz factor of a few,may be larger by up to 2 orders of magnitude than the rate of those thatproduce grbs.

astro-ph;0306322	the most probable cause for the high gamma-ray polarization in grb  021206	the exciting detection of a very high degree of linear polarization,$p=(80\pm 20)%$, in the prompt gamma-ray emission of grb 021206, supportssynchrotron emission as being the dominant radiation mechanism. there were alsoclaims that this implies a magnetic field ordered on large scales within theejecta, that must therefore be produced at the source, which in turn was usedas an argument in favor magnetic fields playing an active role in theproduction of grb jets. however, an alternative explanation was suggested whichalso works with a magnetic field that is generated in the internal shocks anddoes not originate at the source: a very narrow jet, of opening angle$\theta_j\sim 1/\gamma$, where $\gamma\gtrsim 100$ is the lorentz factor duringthe grb, viewed at $\theta_j&lt;\theta_{obs}\lesssim\theta_j+1/\gamma$. wecalculate $p$ for these two scenarios, and find that it is significantly easierto produce $p\gtrsim 50%$ with an ordered field. more specifically, we obtain$p\sim(43-61)%$ for an ordered transverse magnetic field, $b_{ord}$, whereas arandom field within the plane of the shock, $b_\perp$, produces$p\lesssim(38-54)%$ for a single pulse in the grb light curve, but theintegrated emission over many pulses (as measured in grb 021206) is a factor of$\sim 2$ lower. a magnetic field normal to the shock front, $b_\parallel$,produces $p\sim(35-62)%$ for the emission integrated over many pulses. however,polarization measurements from grb afterglows suggest a more isotropicshock-produced field configuration that would reduce $p$ by a factor $\sim2-3$. therefore, an ordered magnetic field, $b_{ord}$, that originates at thesource, can produce the observed polarization most naturally, while$b_\parallel$ is less likely, and $b_\perp$ is the least likely of the above.

astro-ph;0309231	explaining the high energy spectral component in grb 941017	the gamma-ray burst (grb) of october 17, 1994 (941017), showed a distincthigh energy spectral component extending from $\lesssim$ a few mev to $\gtrsim$200 mev, in addition to the typical grb emission which peaked at $\lesssim$ afew hundred kev. the high energy component carried at least $\sim$ 3 times moreenergy than the lower energy component. it displayed an almost constant fluxwith a rather hard spectrum ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \sim0$) from $\lesssim$ 20 s into the burst up to $\sim$ 200 s, while the durationof the grb, where 90% of the energy in the lower energy component was emitted,was only 77 s. such a high energy component was seen in only one out of $\sim$30 grbs in which a similar component could have been detected, and thus appearsto be quite rare. we examine possible explanations for this high energyspectral component and find that most models fail. the only emission regionthat provides the right temporal behavior is the reverse shock that goes intothe grb ejecta as it is decelerated by the ambient medium, or possibly the veryearly forward shock while the reverse shock is still going on. the bestcandidate for the emission mechanism is synchrotron self-compton emission fromthe reverse shock. even in this model the most natural spectral slope is onlymarginally consistent with the observed value, and some degree of fine tuningis required in order to improve the agreement. this might suggest that anadditional or alternative emission mechanism is at work here. a prediction ofthis interpretation is that such a high energy component should be accompaniedby a bright optical transient, similar to the one observed in grb 990123.

astro-ph;0311545	testing the predictions of the universal structured grb jet model	the two leading models for the structure of grb jets are the uniform jetmodel and the universal structured jet (usj) model. in the latter, all grb jetsare intrinsically identical and the energy per solid angle drops as the inversesquare of the angle from the jet axis. the simplicity of the usj model gives ita strong predictive power, including a specific prediction for the observed grbdistribution as a function of both the redshift $z$ and the viewing angle$\theta$. we show that the current sample of grbs with known $z$ and estimated$\theta$ does not agree with the predictions of the usj model. this can be bestseen for a relatively narrow range in $z$, in which the usj model predicts thatmost grbs should be near the upper end of the observed range in $\theta$, whilein the observed sample most grbs are near the lower end of that range. sincethe current sample is very inhomogeneous (i.e. involves many differentdetectors), it should be taken with care and cannot be used to rule out the usjmodel. nevertheless, this sample strongly disfavors the usj model. comparingthe prediction for the observed grb distribution both in $\theta$ and in $z$,with a larger and more homogeneous grb sample, like the one expected fromswift, would either clearly rule out the usj model, or alternatively, provide astrong support for it. the test presented here is general, and can be used totest any model that predicts both a luminosity function and a luminosity-anglerelation.

astro-ph;0403421	the case for a misaligned relativistic jet from sn 2001em	sn 2001em, identified as a type ic supernova, has recently been detected inthe radio and x-rays, $\gtrsim$ 2 yr after the explosion. the high luminositiesat such late times might arise from a relativistic jet viewed substantiallyoff-axis that becomes visible only when it turns mildly relativistic and itsemission is no longer strongly beamed away from us. alternatively, the emissionmight originate from the interaction of the sn shell with the circumstellarmedium. we find that the latter scenario is hard to reconcile with the observedrapid rise in the radio flux and optically thin spectrum,$f_\nu\propto\nu^{-0.36\pm 0.16}t^{1.9\pm 0.4}$, while these features arisenaturally from a misaligned relativistic jet. the high x-ray luminosityprovides an independent and more robust constraint -- it requires $\sim10^{51}$ erg in mildly relativistic ejecta. the source should thereforecurrently have a large angular size ($\sim$ 2 mas) which could be resolved inthe radio with vlba. it is also expected to be bipolar and is thus likely toexhibit a large degree of linear polarization ($\sim 10%-20%$). the presence ofa relativistic outflow in sn 2001em would have interesting implications. itwould suggest that several percent of sne ib/c produce mildly relativisticjets, with an initial lorentz factor $\gamma_0\gtrsim 2$, while the fractionthat produce grb jets (with $\gamma_0\gtrsim 100$) is $\sim 100$ times smaller.this could considerably increase the expected number of transients similar toorphan grb afterglows in the radio, and to a lesser extent in the optical andx-rays, if there is a continuous distribution in $\gamma_0$. furthermore, thismay give further credence to the idea that core collapse sne, and in particularsne type ib/c, are triggered by bipolar jets.

astro-ph;0407063	constraining the structure of grb jets through the log(n)-log(s)  distribution	a general formalism is developed for calculating the luminosity function andthe expected number $n$ of observed grbs above a peak photon flux $s$ for anygrb jet structure. this new formalism directly provides the true grb ratewithout the need for a `correction factor'. we apply it to the uniform jet (uj)and universal structured jet (usj) models for the structure of grb jets andperform fits to the observed log(n)-log(s) distribution from the gusbad catalogwhich contains 2204 batse bursts. a core angle $\theta_c$ and an outer edge at$\theta_{max}$ are introduced for the structured jet, and a finite range ofhalf-opening angles $\theta_{min}\leq\theta_j\leq\theta_{max}$ is assumed forthe uniform jets. the efficiency $\epsilon_\gamma$ for producing gamma-rays,and the energy per solid angle $\epsilon$ in the jet are allowed to vary with$\theta_j$ (the viewing angle $\theta_{obs}$) in the uj (usj) model,$\epsilon_\gamma\propto\theta^{-b}$ and $\epsilon\propto\theta^{-a}$. we findthat a single power-law luminosity function provides a good fit to the data.such a luminosity function arises naturally in the usj model, while in the ujmodel it implies a power-law probability distribution for $\theta_j$,$p(\theta_j)\propto\theta_j^{-q}$. the value of $q$ cannot be directlydetermined from the fit to the observed log(n)-log(s) distribution, and anadditional assumption on the value of $a$ or $b$ is required. alternatively, anindependent estimate of the true grb rate would enable one to determine $a$,$b$ and $q$. the implied values of $\theta_c$ (or $\theta_{min}$) and$\theta_{max}$ are close to the current observational limits. the true grb ratefor the usj model is found to be $r_{grb}(z=0)=0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.05} gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0412309	radio flares and the magnetic field structure in grb outflows	the magnetic field structure in grb outflows is of great interest as it canprovide valuable clues that can help pin down the mechanism responsible for theacceleration and collimation of grb jets. the most promising way of probing itis through polarization measurements of the synchrotron emission from the grbejecta, which includes the gamma-ray emission and the reverse shock emission.measuring polarization in gamma-rays with current instruments is extremelydifficult: so far there is only one claim of detection (in grb 021206) whichdespite the favorable conditions remains very controversial. the emission fromthe reverse shock that propagates into the ejecta as it is decelerated by theambient medium peaks in the optical after tens of seconds (the `optical flash')and dominates the optical emission up to about ten minutes after the grb.unfortunately, no polarization measurements of this optical emission have beenmade to date. however, after the reverse shock finishes crossing the shell ofgrb ejecta, the shocked ejecta cools adiabatically and radiates at lower andlower frequencies, peaking in the radio after $\sim 1$ day (the `radio flare').we use vla data of radio flares from grbs to constrain the polarization of thisemission. we find only upper limits for both linear and circular polarization.our best limits are for grb 991216, for which we find $3\sigma$ upper limits onthe linear and circular polarization of 7% and 9%, respectively. these limitsprovide interesting constraints on existing grb models. specifically, ourresults are hard to reconcile with a predominantly ordered toroidal magneticfield in the grb outflow together with a `structured' jet, where the energy persolid angle drops as the inverse square of the angle from the jet axis, that isexpected in models where the outflow is poynting flux dominated.

astro-ph;0502300	afterglow observations shed new light on the nature of x-ray flashes	x-ray flashes (xrfs) and x-ray rich gamma-ray bursts (xrgrbs) share manyobservational characteristics with long duration grbs, but the reason for whichtheir prompt emission peaks at lower photon energies, $e_p$, is still underdebate. although many different models have been invoked in order to explainthe lower $e_p$ values, their implications for the afterglow emission were notconsidered in most cases, mainly because observations of xrf afterglows havebecome available only recently. here we examine the predictions of the variousxrf models for the afterglow emission, and test them against the observationsof xrf 030723 and xrgrb 041006, the events with the best monitored afterglowlight curves in their respective class. we show that most existing xrf modelsare hard to reconcile with the observed afterglow light curves, which are veryflat at early times. such light curves are, however, naturally produced by aroughly uniform jet with relatively sharp edges that is viewed off-axis (i.e.from outside of the jet aperture). this type of model self consistentlyaccommodates both the observed prompt emission and the afterglow light curvesof xrgrb 041006 and xrf 030723, implying viewing angles $\theta_{obs}$ from thejet axis of $(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)\sim 0.15\theta_0$ and $\sim \theta_0$,respectively, where $\theta_0\sim 3$ deg is the jet half-opening angle. thissuggests that grbs, xrgrbs and xrfs are intrinsically similar relativistic jetsviewed from different angles, corresponding to $\gamma(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)$of less than 1, between 1 and a few, and more than a few, respectively, where$\gamma$ is the lorentz factor. future observations with swift could help testthis unification scheme in which grbs, xrgrbs and xrfs share the same basicphysics and differ only by their orientation relative to our line of sight.

astro-ph;0504254	afterglow light curves from impulsive relativistic jets with an  unconventional structure	the jet structure in gamma-ray burst (grb) sources is still largely an openquestion. the leading models invoke either (i) a roughly uniform jet with sharpedges, or (ii) a jet with a narrow core and wide wings where the energy persolid angle drops as a power law with the angle $\theta$ from the jet symmetryaxis. recently, a two component jet model has also been considered, with anarrow uniform jet of initial lorentz factor $\gamma_0 \gtrsim 100$ surroundedby a wider uniform jet with $\gamma_0 \sim 10-30$. some models predict moreexotic jet profiles, such as a thin uniform ring (i.e. the outflow is boundedby two concentric cones of half opening angle $\theta_c$ and $\theta_c +\delta\theta$, with $\delta\theta \ll \theta_c$) or a fan (a thin outflow with$\delta\theta \ll 1$ along the rotational equator, $\theta_c = \pi/2 +\delta\theta/2$). in this paper we calculate the expected afterglow lightcurves from such jet structures, using a simple formalism that is developedhere for this purpose, and could also have other applications. these lightcurves are qualitatively compared to observations of grb afterglows. it isshown that the two component jet model cannot produce sharp features in theafterglow model due to the deceleration of the wide jet or the narrow jetbecoming visible at lines of sight outside of it. we find that a "ring" shapedjet or a "fan" shaped jet produce a jet break in the afterglow light curve thatis too shallow compared to observations, where the change in the temporal decayindex across the jet break is about half of that for a uniform conical jet. fora "ring" jet, the jet break is divided into two distinct and smaller breaks,the first occurring when $\gamma\delta\theta \sim 1-2$ and the second when$\gamma\theta_c \sim 1/2$.

astro-ph;0506104	a compact binary merger model for the short, hard grb 050509b	the first x-ray afterglow for a short (~30 ms), hard gamma-ray burst wasdetected by swift on 9 may 2005 (grb 050509b). no optical or radio counterpartwas identified in follow-up observations. the tentative association of the grbwith a nearby giant elliptical galaxy at redshift z=0.2248 would imply a totalenergy release e(gamma, isotropic) ~3 x 10**48 erg, and that the progenitor hadtraveled several tens of kpc from its point of origin, in agreement withexpectations linking these events to the final merger of compact binariesdriven by gravitational wave emission. we model the dynamical merger of such asystem and the time-dependent evolution of the accretion tori thus created. theresulting energetics, variability, and expected durations are consistent withgrb 050509b originating from the tidal disruption of a neutron star by astellar mass black hole, or of the merger of two neutron stars followed byprompt gravitational collapse of the massive remnant. we discuss how theavailable gamma-ray and x-ray data provide a probe for the nature of therelativistic ejecta and the surrounding medium.

astro-ph;0601056	implications of the early x-ray afterglow light curves of swift grbs	according to current models, gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are produced when theenergy carried by a relativistic outflow is dissipated and converted intoradiation. the efficiency of this process, $\epsilon_\gamma$, is one of thecritical factors in any grb model. the x-ray afterglow light curves of swiftgrbs show an early stage of flat decay. this has been interpreted as reflectingenergy injection. when combined with previous estimates, which have concludedthat the kinetic energy of the late ($\gtrsim 10$ hr) afterglow is comparableto the energy emitted in gamma-rays, this interpretation implies very highvalues of $\epsilon_\gamma \gtrsim 0.9$. such a high efficiency is hard toreconcile with most models, including in particular the popular internal-shocksmodel. we re-analyze the derivation of the kinetic energy from the afterglowx-ray flux and re-examine the resulting estimates of the efficiency. we confirmthat, if the flatt decay arises from energy injection and the pre-swiftbroad-band estimates of the kinetic energy are correct, then $\epsilon_\gamma\gtrsim 0.9$. we point out, however, that another interpretation of theflattish decay - a variable x-ray afterglow efficiency (e.g., due to a timedependence of afterglow shock microphysical parameters) - is possible. we alsoshow that direct estimates of the kinetic energy from the late x-ray afterglowflux are sensitive to the assumed values of the shock microphysical parametersand suggest that broad-band afterglow fits might have underestimated thekinetic energy (e.g., by overestimating the fraction of electrons that areaccelerated to relativistic energies). either one of these possibilitiesimplies a lower gamma-ray efficiency, and their joint effect could conceivablyreduce the estimate of the typical $\epsilon_\gamma$ to $\sim 0.1-0.5$.

astro-ph;0606011	smooth light curves from a bumpy ride: relativistic blast wave  encounters a density jump	some grb afterglow light curves show significant variability, which oftenincludes episodes of rebrightening. this was attributed in several cases tolarge fluctuations in the external density. here we examine the effect of asharp increase in the external density on the light curve by considering, forthe first time, a full treatment of both the hydrodynamic evolution and theradiation in this scenario. to this end we develop a semi-analytic model forthe light curve and carry out several elaborate numerical simulations using a1d hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation code.two sphericallysymmetric cases are explored in detail: a density jump in a uniform externalmedium, and a wind termination shock. contrary to previous works, we find thateven a sharp (step function) and large (by a factor of $a&gt;&gt;1$) increase in theexternal density does not produce sharp features in the light curve, and cannotaccount for significant temporal variability. for a wind termination shock, thelight curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic power-laws over aboutone decade in time, and there is no rebrightening in the optical or x-rays toserve as a clear observational signature. for a sharp jump in a uniform densitywe find that the maximal deviation $\delta\alpha_max$ of the temporal decayindex $\alpha$ from its asymptotic value, is bounded (e.g., $\delta\alpha_max&lt;0.4$ for $a=10$); $\delta\alpha_max$ slowly increases with $a$, converging to$\delta\alpha_{max} \approx 1$ at very large $a$ values. therefore, no opticalrebrightening is expected here as well. in the x-rays, while the asymptoticflux is unaffected by the density jump, the fluctuations in $\alpha$ are foundto be comparable to those in the optical. finally, we discuss the implicationsof our results for the origin of the fluctuations in several afterglows.

astro-ph;0608379	a simple test of the external shock model for the prompt emission in  gamma-ray bursts	it is demonstrated here that if the prompt grb emission is produced by thesimplest version of the external shock model, a specific relation shouldprevail between the observed duration, isotropic equivalent energy, and photonpeak energy. in essence, this relation arises because both the burst durationand the typical energy of the emitted synchrotron photons depend on the samecombination of the, usually poorly constrained, external density at thedeceleration radius, $n_{dec}$, and initial bulk lorentz factor, $\gamma_0$.this has the fortunate consequence of making the relation independent of both$\gamma_0$ and $n_{dec}$. unless the efficiency of electron acceleration isvery low, synchrotron gamma-rays from the external shock would fail to meet thecurrent observational constraints for the vast majority of grbs, includingthose with a smooth, single peak temporal profile. this argues either againstan external shock origin for the prompt emission in grbs or for changes in ourunderstanding of the microphysical and radiation processes occurring within theshocked region.

astro-ph;9806192	images and spectra from the interior of a relativistic fireball	the detection of an afterglow, following a gamma-ray burst (grb), can bedescribed reasonably well by synchrotron emission from a relativistic sphericalexpanding blast wave, driven by an expanding fireball. we perform detailedcalculations considering the emission from the whole region behind the shockfront. we use the blandford mckee self similar adiabatic solution to describethe fluid behind the shock. using this detailed model, we derive expressionsfor the peak flux, and the peak frequency at a given observed time. theseexpressions provide important numerical corrections to previous, moresimplified models. we calculate the observed light curve and spectra forseveral magnetic field models. we show that both the light curve and thespectra are flat near the peak. this rules out the interpretation of theoptical peak of grb970508 as the peak of the light curve, predicted by theexisting fireball models. we calculate the observed image of a grb afterglow.the observed image is bright near the edge and dimmer at the center, thuscreating a ring. the contrast between the edge and the center is larger at highfrequencies and the width of the ring is smaller.

0812.1217	late time observations of grb080319b: jet break, host galaxy and  accompanying supernova	the swift discovered grb080319b was by far the most distant source everobserved at naked eye brightness, reaching a peak apparent magnitude of 5.3 ata redshift of z=0.937. we present our late-time optical (hst, gemini &amp; vlt) andx-ray (chandra) observations, which confirm that an achromatic break occurredin the power-law afterglow light curve at ~11 days post-burst. this most likelyindicates that the gamma-ray burst (grb) outflow was collimated, which for auniform jet would imply a total energy in the jet e_{jet} \gsim 10^{52} erg.our observations also show a late-time excess of red light, which is wellexplained if the grb was accompanied by a supernova (sn), similar to those seenin some other long-duration grbs. the latest observations are dominated bylight from the host and show that the grb took place in a faint dwarf galaxy(r(ab)\approx27.0, rest-frame m_b\approx-17.2). this galaxy is small even bythe standards of other grb hosts, which is suggestive of a low metallicityenvironment. intriguingly, the properties of this extreme event - a small hostand bright supernova - are entirely typical of the very low-luminosity burstssuch as grb980425 and grb060218.
