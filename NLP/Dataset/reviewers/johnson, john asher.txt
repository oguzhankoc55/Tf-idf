0902.3461	on the spin-orbit misalignment of the xo-3 exoplanetary system	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 feb. 2transit of the exoplanet xo-3b. the new data show that the planetary orbitalaxis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by hebrardand coworkers. we find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes tobe 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15deg. the significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there areindications of systematic effects. xo-3b is the first exoplanet known to have ahighly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, andas such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration ofmassive planets into close-in orbits. we revisit the statistical analysis ofspin-orbit alignment in hot-jupiter systems. assuming the stellar obliquitiesto be drawn from a single rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of thedistribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. however, it remains the case that a modelrepresenting two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawnfrom a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropicdistribution--is favored over a single rayleigh distribution.

0907.5205	the transit ingress and the tilted orbit of the extraordinarily  eccentric exoplanet hd 80606b	we present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009june 5 transit of the exoplanet hd 80606b. we report the first detection of thetransit ingress, revealing the transit duration to be 11.64 +/- 0.25 hr andallowing more robust determinations of the system parameters. keck spectraobtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift, giving definitiveevidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary orbital axis are misaligned.the keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle is between 32-87 degwith 68.3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99.73% confidence. thus theorbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0.93), but is also tiltedaway from the equatorial plane of its parent star. a large tilt had beenpredicted, based on the idea that the planet's eccentric orbit was caused bythe kozai mechanism. independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planetson eccentric orbits, suggesting that those systems migrate differently thanlower-mass planets on circular orbits.

0910.2365	analytic description of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets: cross-correlation method and comparison with simulated data	we obtain analytical expressions for the velocity anomaly due to therossiter- mclaughlin effect, for the case when the anomalous radial velocity isobtained by cross-correlation with a stellar template spectrum. in the limit ofvanishing width of the stellar absorption lines, our result reduces to theformula derived by ohta et al. (2005), which is based on the first moment ofdistorted stellar lines. our new formula contains a term dependent on thestellar linewidth, which becomes important when rotational line broadening isappreciable. we generate mock transit spectra for four existing exoplanetarysystems (hd17156, tres-2, tres- 4, and hd209458) following the procedure ofwinn et al. (2005), and find that the new formula is in better agreement withthe velocity anomaly extracted from the mock data. thus, our result provides amore reliable analytical description of the velocity anomaly due to therossiter-mclaughlin effect, and explains the previously observed dependence ofthe velocity anomaly on the stellar rotation velocity.

1005.3084	giant planet occurrence in the stellar mass-metallicity plane	correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanetscan be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts andprovide valuable clues about the planet formation process. we analyze a sampleof 1194 stars drawn from the california planet survey targets to determine theempirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giantplanet as a function of its mass and metallicity. our stellar sample rangesfrom m dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 msun to intermediate-mass subgiantswith masses as high as 1.9 msun. in agreement with previous studies, our sampleexhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fractionof stars that harbor giant planets scales as f \propto 10^{1.2 [fe/h]}. we canrule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98%confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets arenot likely due to convective envelope "pollution." our data also rule out aconstant planet occurrence rate for [fe/h]&lt; 0, indicating that giant planetscontinue to become rarer at sub-solar metallicities. we also find that planetoccurrence increases with stellar mass (f \propto mstar), characterized by arise from 3.5% around m dwarfs (0.5 msun) to 14% around a stars (2 msun), atsolar metallicity. we argue that the correlation between stellar properties andgiant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretionmodel of planet formation.

1010.4025	discerning exoplanet migration models using spin-orbit measurements	we investigate the current sample of exoplanet spin-orbit measurements todetermine whether a dominant planet migration channel can be identified, and atwhat confidence. we use the predictions of kozai migration plus tidal friction(fabrycky and tremaine 2007) and planet-planet scattering (nagasawa et al.2008) as our misalignment models, and we allow for a fraction of intrinsicallyaligned systems, explainable by disk migration. bayesian model comparisondemonstrates that the current sample of 32 spin-orbit measurements stronglyfavors a two-mode migration scenario combining planet-planet scattering anddisk migration over a single-mode kozai migration scenario. our analysisindicates that between 34% and 76% of close-in planets (95% confidence)migrated via planet-planet scattering. separately analyzing the subsample of 12stars with t_eff &gt; 6250 k---which winn et al. (2010) predict to be the onlytype of stars to maintain their primordial misalignments---we find that thedata favor a single-mode scattering model over kozai with 81% confidence. wealso assess the number of additional hot star spin-orbit measurements that willlikely be necessary to provide a more confident model selection, finding thatan additional 20-30 measurements has a &gt;50% chance of resulting in a95%-confident model selection, if the current model selection is correct. whilewe test only the predictions of particular kozai and scattering migrationmodels in this work, our methods may be used to test the predictions of anyother spin-orbit misaligning mechanism.

1101.5630	on the low false positive probabilities of kepler planet candidates	we present a framework to conservatively estimate the probability that anyparticular planet-like transit signal observed by the kepler mission is in facta planet, prior to any ground-based follow-up efforts. we use monte carlomethods based on stellar population synthesis and galactic structure models,and report a priori false positive probabilities for every kepler object ofinterest in tabular form, assuming a 20% intrinsic occurrence rate of close-inplanets in the radius range 0.5 rearth &lt; rp &lt; 20 rearth. almost every candidatehas fpp &lt;10%, and over half have fpp &lt;5%. this probability varies most stronglywith the magnitude and galactic latitude of the kepler target star, and moreweakly with transit depth. we establish that a single deep high-resolutionimage will be an extremely effective follow-up tool for the shallowest(earth-sized) transits, providing the quickest route towards probabilistically"validating" the smallest candidates by potentially decreasing the falsepositive probability of an earth-sized transit around a faint star from &gt;10% to&lt;1%. on the other hand, we show that the most useful follow-up observations formoderate-depth (super-earth and neptune-sized) candidates are shallower aoimaging and high s/n spectroscopy. since kepler has detected many moreplanetary signals than can be positively confirmed with ground-based follow-upefforts in the near term, these calculations will be crucial to using theensemble of kepler data to determine population characteristics of planetarysystems. we also describe how our analysis complements the kepler team's moredetailed blender false positive analysis for planet validation.

1103.4910	estimates of the planet yield from ground-based high-contrast imaging  observations as a function of stellar mass	we use monte carlo simulations to estimate the number of extrasolar planetsthat are directly detectable in the solar-neighborhood using current andforthcoming high-contrast imaging instruments. our calculations take intoaccount the important factors that govern the likelihood for imaging a planet,including the statistical properties of nearby stars, correlations between starand planet properties, observational effects, and selection criteria. weconsider several different ground-based surveys and express the resultingyields as a function of stellar mass. selecting targets based on their youth,visual brightness, and proximity to the sun, we find that strong correlationsbetween star mass and planet properties are required to reproduce high-contrastimaging results to date. using the most recent empirical findings for theoccurrence rate of planets from rv surveys, our simulations indicate thatextrapolation of the doppler planet population to separations accessible tohigh-contrast instruments provides excellent agreement between simulations andobservations using present-day contrast levels. in addition to beingintrinsically young and bright to serve as their own beacon for ao correction,a-stars have a high planet occurrence rate and propensity to form massiveplanets in wide orbits, making them ideal targets. the same effects responsiblefor creating a multitude of detectable planets around massive stars conspire toreduce the number orbiting low-mass stars. however, in the case of a youngstellar cluster, mk-stars can dominate the number of detections because of anobservational bias related to small number statistics. the degree to whichlow-mass stars produce the most detections in this special case depends uponformation mechanism.

1203.5537	the photoeccentric effect and proto-hot jupiters i. measuring  photometric eccentricities of individual transiting planets	exoplanet orbital eccentricities offer valuable clues about the history ofplanetary systems. eccentric, jupiter-sized planets are particularlyinteresting: they may link the "cold" jupiters beyond the ice line to close-inhot jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. to date,eccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radialvelocity measurements. kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting jupitersspanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludesradial velocity follow-up of most. here we demonstrate a bayesian method ofmeasuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit lightcurve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. we show that eccentricjupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transitdurations -- part of the "photoeccentric" light curve signature of a planet'seccentricity --- even with long-cadence kepler photometry andloosely-constrained stellar parameters. a markov chain monte carlo explorationof parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle andautomatically accounts for the transit probability. to demonstrate, we usethree published transit light curves of hd 17156 b to measure an eccentricityof e = 0.71 +0.16/-0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e =0.67+/-0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. we present two additionaltests using actual kepler data. in each case the technique proves to be aviable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidenceintervals. finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effectivemeans of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto hot jupiters predicted bysocrates et al. (2012).

1206.5579	the photoeccentric effect and proto-hot jupiters ii. koi-1474.01, a  candidate eccentric planet perturbed by an unseen companion	the exoplanets known as hot jupiters---jupiter-sized planets with periodsless than 10 days---likely are relics of dynamical processes that shape allplanetary system architectures. socrates et al. (2012) argued that higheccentricity migration (hem) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-inplanets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hotjupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. hem should also createfailed-hot jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fastcircularization. using the technique we previously presented for measuringeccentricities from photometry (the "photoeccentric effect"), we are distillinga collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot jupiters from the keplerobjects of interest (koi). here we present the first, koi-1474.01, which has along orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot jupiter boundary. combining keplerphotometry, ground-based spectroscopy, and stellar evolution models, wecharacterize host koi-1474 as a rapidly-rotating f-star. statistical argumentsreveal that the transiting candidate has a low false-positive probability of3.1%. koi-1474.01 also exhibits transit timing variations of order an hour. weexplore characteristics of the third-body perturber, which is possibly the"smoking-gun" cause of koi-1474.01's large eccentricity. using the host-star'srotation period, radius, and projected rotational velocity, we findkoi-1474.01's orbit is marginally consistent with aligned with the stellar spinaxis, although a reanalysis is warranted with future additional data. finally,we discuss how the number and existence of proto-hot jupiters will not onlydemonstrate that hot jupiters migrate via hem, but also shed light on thetypical timescale for the mechanism.

1208.4377	retired a stars: the effect of stellar evolution on the mass estimates  of subgiants	doppler surveys have shown that the occurrence rate of jupiter-mass planetsappears to increase as a function of stellar mass. however, this result dependson the ability to accurately measure the masses of evolved stars. recently,lloyd (2011) called into question the masses of subgiant stars targeted bydoppler surveys. lloyd argues that very few observable subgiants have massesgreater than 1.5 msun, and that most of them have masses in the range 1.0-1.2msun. to investigate this claim, we use galactic stellar population models togenerate an all-sky distribution of stars. we incorporate the effects that makemassive subgiants less numerous, such as the initial mass function anddifferences in stellar evolution timescales. we find that these effects lead tonegligibly small systematic errors in stellar mass estimates, in contrast tothe roughly 50% errors predicted by lloyd. additionally, our simulated targetsample does in fact include a significant fraction of stars with masses greaterthan 1.5 msun, primarily because the inclusion of an apparent magnitude limitresults in a malmquist-like bias toward more massive stars, in contrast to thevolume-limited simulations of lloyd. the magnitude limit shifts the mean of oursimulated distribution toward higher masses and results in a relatively smallernumber of evolved stars with masses in the range 1.0-1.2 msun. we concludethat, within the context of our present-day understanding of stellar structureand evolution, many of the subgiants observed in doppler surveys are indeed asmassive as main-sequence a stars.

1211.0554	a paucity of proto-hot jupiters on super-eccentric orbits	gas giant planets orbiting within 0.1 au of their host stars, unlikely tohave formed in situ, are evidence for planetary migration. it is debatedwhether the typical hot jupiter smoothly migrated inward from its formationlocation through the proto-planetary disk or was perturbed by another body ontoa highly eccentric orbit, which tidal dissipation subsequently shrank andcircularized during close stellar passages. socrates and collaboratorspredicted that the latter class of model should produce a population ofsuper-eccentric proto-hot jupiters readily observable by kepler. we find apaucity of such planets in the kepler sample, inconsistent with the theoreticalprediction with 96.9% confidence. observational effects are unlikely to explainthis discrepancy. we find that the fraction of hot jupiters with orbital periodp &gt; 3 days produced by the star-planet kozai mechanism does not exceed (attwo-sigma) 44%. our results may indicate that disk migration is the dominantchannel for producing hot jupiters with p &gt; 3 days. alternatively, the typicalhot jupiter may have been perturbed to a high eccentricity by interactions witha planetary rather than stellar companion and began tidal circularization muchinterior to 1 au after multiple scatterings. a final alternative is that tidalcircularization occurs much more rapidly early in the tidal circularizationprocess at high eccentricities than later in the process at low eccentricities,contrary to current tidal theories.

1211.4028	model-independent stellar and planetary masses from multi-transiting  exoplanetary systems	precise exoplanet characterization requires precise classification ofexoplanet host stars. the masses of host stars are commonly estimated bycomparing their spectra to those predicted by stellar evolution models.however, spectroscopically determined properties are difficult to measureaccurately for stars that are substantially different from the sun, such asm-dwarfs and evolved stars. here, we propose a new method to dynamicallymeasure the masses of transiting planets near mean-motion resonances and theirhost stars by combining observations of transit timing variations with radialvelocity measurements. we derive expressions to analytically determine the massof each member of the system and demonstrate the technique on the kepler-18system. we compare these analytic results to numerical simulations and find thetwo are consistent. we identify eight systems for which our technique could beapplied if follow-up radial velocity measurements are collected. we concludethis analysis would be optimal for systems discovered by next generationmissions similar to tess or plato, which will target bright stars that areamenable to efficient rv follow-up.

1301.0023	characterizing the cool kois iv: kepler-32 as a prototype for the  formation of compact planetary systems throughout the galaxy	the kepler space telescope has opened new vistas in exoplanet discovery spaceby revealing populations of earth-sized planets that provide a new context forunderstanding planet formation. approximately 70% of all stars in the galaxybelong to the diminutive m dwarf class, several thousand of which lie withinkepler's field of view, and a large number of these targets show planet transitsignals. kepler-32 is a typical star in the kepler m dwarf sample that presentsus with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star giving us anexpansive view of its architecture. all five planets of this compact systemorbit their host star within a distance one third the size of mercury's orbitwith the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellarphotosphere. new observations limit possible false positive scenarios allowingus to validate the entire kepler-32 system making it the richest known systemof transiting planets around an m dwarf. based on considerations of the stellardust sublimation radius, the near period commensurability of three adjacentplanets, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the volatile contentinferred for the planets, we propose that the kepler-32 planets formed atlarger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. thevolatile content inferred for the kepler-32 planets and order of magnitudeestimates for the disk migration rates suggest these planets may have formedbeyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. thekepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidatesorbiting the kepler m dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0+/- 0.1 planet per star. the formation of the kepler-32 planets thereforeoffers a plausible blueprint for the formation of one of the largest knownpopulations of planets in our galaxy.

1301.6289	the stellar obliquity and the long-period planet in the hat-p-17  exoplanetary system	we present the measured projected obliquity -- the sky-projected anglebetween the stellar spin axis and orbital angular momentum -- of the innerplanet of the hat-p-17 multi-planet system. we measure the sky-projectedobliquity of the star to be \lambda=19+/-15 degrees by modeling therossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect in keck/hires radial velocities (rvs). theanomalous rv time series shows an asymmetry relative to the midtransit time,ordinarily suggesting a nonzero obliquity -- but in this case at least part ofthe asymmetry may be due to the convective blueshift, increasing theuncertainty in the determination of \lambda. we employ the semi-analyticalapproach of hirano et al. (2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model theanomaly in the net rv caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planetformation and migration. to date, the measured obliquities of ~50 jovianplanets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbitingcool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetaryorbits. our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidalinteractions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. inaddition, our 1.8 years of new rvs for this system show that the orbit of theouter planet is more poorly constrained than previously thought, with anorbital period now in the range of 10-36 years.

1302.3910	optimizing doppler surveys for planet yield	one of the most promising methods of discovering nearby, low-mass planets inthe habitable zones of stars is the precision radial velocity technique.however, there are many challenges that must be overcome to efficiently detectlow-amplitude doppler signals. this is both due to the required instrumentalsensitivity and the limited amount of observing time. in this paper, we examinestatistical and instrumental effects on precision radial velocity detection ofextrasolar planets, an approach by which we maximize the planet yield in afixed amount of observing time available on a given telescope. from thisperspective, we show that g and k dwarfs observed at 400-600 nm are the besttargets for surveys complete down to a given planet mass and out to a specifiedorbital period. overall we find that m dwarfs observed at 700-800 nm are thebest targets for habitable-zone planets, particularly when including theeffects of systematic noise floors. also, we give quantitative specificationsof the instrumental stability necessary to achieve the required velocityprecision.

1303.2150	the mass of koi-94d and a relation for planet radius, mass, and incident  flux	we measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, koi-94d. we wishto determine whether this planet, which is in a 22-day orbit and receives 2700times as much incident flux as jupiter, is as dense as jupiter or rarefied likeinflated hot jupiters. koi-94 also hosts 3 smaller transiting planets, all ofwhich were detected by the kepler mission. with 26 radial velocities of koi-94from the w. m. keck observatory and a simultaneous fit to the kepler lightcurve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is notinflated. support for the planetary interpretation of the other threecandidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timingvariations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against falsepositives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within thephotometric aperture. the radial velocity analyses of koi-94b and koi-94e offermarginal (&gt;2\sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of koi-94c offeronly an upper limit to its mass. using the koi-94 system and other planets withpublished values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35with m &lt; 150 earth masses), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanetsthat relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few earth masses up toten jupiter masses. these equations can be used to predict the radius or massof a planet.

1307.5849	the trends high-contrast imaging survey. iv. the occurrence rate of  giant planets around m-dwarfs	doppler-based planet surveys have discovered numerous giant planets but areincomplete beyond several au. at larger star-planet separations, direct planetdetection through high-contrast imaging has proven successful, but thistechnique is sensitive only to young planets and characterization relies upontheoretical evolution models. here we demonstrate that radial velocitymeasurements and high-contrast imaging can be combined to overcome theseissues. the presence of widely separated companions can be deduced byidentifying an acceleration (long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star.by obtaining high spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we ruleout scenarios in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binarycompanions with high statistical confidence. we report results from an analysisof doppler measurements of a sample of 111 m-dwarf stars with a median of 29radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr. bytargeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend") withadaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5% +/- 3.0% of m-dwarf stars hostone or more massive companions with 1 &lt; m/m_jupiter &lt; 13 and 0 &lt; a &lt; 20 au.these results are lower than analyses of the planet occurrence rate aroundhigher-mass stars. we find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by adouble power law in stellar mass m and metallicity f = [fe/h] such that f(m,f)= 0.039(+0.056,-0.028) m^(0.8(+1.1,-0.9)) 10^((3.8 +/- 1.2)f). our results areconsistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of the planetoccurrence rate; this study represents the first model-independent comparisonwith microlensing observations.

1311.0280	the trends high-contrast imaging survey. v. discovery of an old and cold  benchmark t-dwarf orbiting the nearby g-star hd 19467	the nearby sun-like star hd 19467 shows a subtle radial velocity (rv)acceleration of -1.37+/-0.09 m/s/yr over an 16.9 year time baseline (an rvtrend), hinting at the existence of a distant orbiting companion. we haveobtained high-contrast adaptive optics images of the star using nirc2 at keckobservatory and report the direct detection of the body that causes theacceleration. the companion, hd 19467 b, is dk=12.57+/-0.09 mag fainter thanits parent star (contrast ratio of 9.4e-6), has blue colors j-k_s=-0.36+/-0.14(j-h=-0.29+/-0.15), and is separated by 1.653+/-0.004" (51.1+/-1.0 au).follow-up astrometric measurements obtained over an 1.1 year time baselinedemonstrate physical association through common parallactic and proper motion.we calculate a firm lower-limit of m&gt;51.9^{+3.6}_{-4.3}mjup for the companionmass from orbital dynamics using a combination of doppler observations andimaging. we estimate a model-dependent mass of m=56.7^{+4.6}_{-7.2}mjup from agyrochronological age of 4.3^{+1.0}_{-1.2} gyr. isochronal analysis suggests amuch older age of $9\pm1$ gyr, which corresponds to a mass ofm=67.4^{+0.9}_{-1.5}mjup. hd 19467 b's measured colors and absolute magnitudeare consistent with a late t-dwarf [~t5-t7]. we may infer a low metallicity of[fe/h]=-0.15+/-0.04 for the companion from its g3v parent star. hd 19467 b isthe first directly imaged benchmark t-dwarf found orbiting a sun-like star witha measured rv acceleration.

1407.2249	the dynamics of the multi-planet system orbiting kepler-56	kepler-56 is a multi-planet system containing two coplanar inner planets thatare in orbits misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the host star, and anouter planet. various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the broaddistribution of spin-orbit angles among exoplanets, and these theories fallunder two broad categories. the first is based on dynamical interactions in amulti-body system, while the other assumes that disk migration is the drivingmechanism in planetary configuration and that the star (or disk) is titled withrespect to the planetary plane. here we show that the large observed obliquityof kepler-56 system is consistent with a dynamical origin. in addition, we useobservations by huber et al. (2013) to derive the obliquity's probabilitydistribution function, thus improving the constrained lower limit. the outerplanet may be the cause of the inner planets' large obliquities, and we givethe probability distribution function of its inclination, which depends on theinitial orbital configuration of the planetary system. we show that even in thepresence of precise measurement of the true obliquity, one cannot distinguishthe initial configurations. finally we consider the fate of the system as thestar continues to evolve beyond the main sequence, and we find that theobliquity of the system will not undergo major variations as the star climbsthe red giant branch. we follow the evolution of the system and find that theinnermost planet will be engulfed in ~129 myr. furthermore we put an upperlimit of ~155 myr for the engulfment of the second planet. this corresponds to~ 3% of the current age of the star.

1407.2329	the physical parameters of the retired a star hd185351	we report here an analysis of the physical stellar parameters of the giantstar hd185351 using kepler short-cadence photometry, optical and near infraredinterferometry from chara, and high-resolution spectroscopy. asteroseismicoscillations detected in the kepler short-cadence photometry combined with aneffective temperature calculated from the interferometric angular diameter andbolometric flux yield a mean density, rho_star = 0.0130 +- 0.0003 rho_sun andsurface gravity, logg = 3.280 +- 0.011. combining the gravity and density wefind rstar = 5.35 +- 0.20 rsun and mstar = 1.99 +- 0.23 msun. the trigonometricparallax and chara angular diameter give a radius rstar = 4.97 +- 0.07 rsun.this smaller radius,when combined with the mean stellar density, corresponds toa stellar mass mstar = 1.60 +- 0.08 msun, which is smaller than theasteroseismic mass by 1.6-sigma. we find that a larger mass is supported by theobservation of mixed modes in our high-precision photometry, the spacing ofwhich is consistent only for mstar =~ 1.8 msun. our various and independentmass measurements can be compared to the mass measured from interpolating thespectroscopic parameters onto stellar evolution models, which yields amodel-based mass m_star = 1.87 +- 0.07 msun. this mass agrees well with theasteroseismic value,but is 2.6-sigma higher than the mass from the combinationof asteroseismology and interferometry. the discrepancy motivates futurestudies with a larger sample of giant stars. however, all of our massmeasurements are consistent with hd185351 having a mass in excess of 1.5 msun.

1408.3143	on the spectroscopic properties of the retired a star hd 185351	doppler-based planet surveys have shown that, besides metallicity, the planetoccurrence is also correlated with stellar mass, increasing from m to f-aspectral types. however, it has recently been argued that the subgiants (whichrepresent a stars after they evolve off the main sequence) may not be asmassive as suggested initially, which would significantly change thecorrelation found. to start investigating this claim, we have studied thesubgiant star hd 185351, which has precisely measured physical properties basedon asteroseismology and interferometry. an independent spectroscopicdifferential analysis based on excitation and ionization balance of iron linesyielded the atmospheric parameters $t_{\rm eff}$ = 5035 $\pm$ 29 k, $\log$ g =3.30 $\pm$ 0.08 and [fe/h] = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.04. these were used in conjunctionwith the parsec stellar evolutionary tracks to infer a mass m = 1.77 $\pm$ 0.04m$_{\odot}$, which agrees well with the previous estimates. lithium abundancewas also estimated from spectral synthesis (a(li) = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.07) and,together with $t_{\rm eff}$ and [fe/h], allowed to determine a mass m = 1.64$\pm$ 0.06 m$_{\odot}$, which is independent of the star's parallax and surfacegravity. our new measurements of the stellar mass support the notion thathd185351 is a retired a star with a mass in excess of 1.6 m$_{\odot}$.

1503.03874	extracting radial velocities of a- and b-type stars from echelle  spectrograph calibration spectra	we present a technique to extract radial velocity measurements from echellespectrograph observations of rapidly rotating stars ($v\sin{i} \gtrsim 50$ kms$^{-1}$). this type of measurement is difficult because the line widths ofsuch stars are often comparable to the width of a single echelle order. tocompensate for the scarcity of lines and doppler information content, we havedeveloped a process that forward-models the observations, fitting the radialvelocity shift of the star for all echelle orders simultaneously with theechelle blaze function. we use our technique to extract radial velocitymeasurements from a sample of rapidly rotating a- and b-type stars used ascalibrator stars observed by the california planet survey observations. wemeasure absolute radial velocities with a precision ranging from 0.5-2.0 kms$^{-1}$ per epoch for more than 100 a- and b-type stars. in our sample of 10well-sampled stars with radial velocity scatter in excess of their measurementuncertainties, three of these are single-lined binaries with long observationalbaselines. from this subsample, we present detections of two previously unknownspectroscopic binaries and one known astrometric system. our technique will beuseful in measuring or placing upper limits on the masses of sub-stellarcompanions discovered by wide-field transit surveys, and conducting futurespectroscopic binarity surveys and galactic space-motion studies of massiveand/or young, rapidly-rotating stars.

1505.01494	planets around low-mass stars (palms). v. age-dating low-mass companions  to members and interlopers of young moving groups	we present optical and near-infrared adaptive optics (ao) imaging andspectroscopy of 13 ultracool (&gt;m6) companions to late-type stars (k7-m4.5),most of which have recently been identified as candidate members of nearbyyoung moving groups (ymgs; 8-120 myr) in the literature. the inferred masses ofthe companions (~10-100 mjup) are highly sensitive to the ages of the primarystars so we critically examine the kinematic and spectroscopic properties ofeach system to distinguish bona fide ymg members from old field interlopers.2mass j02155892-0929121 c is a new m7 substellar companion (40-60 mjup) withclear spectroscopic signs of low gravity and hence youth. the primary, possiblya member of the ~40 myr tuc-hor moving group, is visually resolved into threecomponents, making it a young low-mass quadruple system in a compact (&lt;100 au)configuration. in addition, li 1 $\lambda$6708 absorption in theintermediate-gravity m7.5 companion 2mass j15594729+4403595 b providesunambiguous evidence that it is young (&lt;200 myr) and resides below the hydrogenburning limit. three new close-separation (&lt;1") companions (2massj06475229-2523304 b, pyc j11519+0731 b, and gj 4378 ab) orbit stars previouslyreported as candidate ymg members, but instead are likely old (&gt;1 gyr)tidally-locked spectroscopic binaries without convincing kinematic associationswith any known moving group. the high rate of false positives in the form ofold active stars with ymg-like kinematics underscores the importance of radialvelocity and parallax measurements to validate candidate young stars identifiedvia proper motion and activity selection alone. finally, we spectroscopicallyconfirm the cool temperature and substellar nature of hd 23514 b, a recentlydiscovered m8 benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the dustiest-known member of thepleiades.

1508.01254	beyond the main sequence: testing the accuracy of stellar masses  predicted by the parsec evolutionary tracks	characterizing the physical properties of exoplanets, and understanding theirformation and orbital evolution requires precise and accurate knowledge oftheir host stars. accurately measuring stellar masses is particularly importantbecause they likely influence planet occurrence and the architectures ofplanetary systems. single main-sequence stars typically have masses estimatedfrom evolutionary tracks, which generally provide accurate results due to theirextensive empirical calibration. however, the validity of this method forsubgiants and giants has been called into question by recent studies, withsuggestions that the masses of these evolved stars could have beenoverestimated. we investigate these concerns using a sample of 59 benchmarkevolved stars with model-independent masses (from binary systems orasteroseismology) obtained from the literature. we find very good agreementbetween these benchmark masses and the ones estimated using evolutionarytracks. the average fractional difference in the mass interval $\sim$0.7 - 4.5m$_{\odot}$, is consistent with zero (-1.30 $\pm$ 2.42%), with no significanttrends in the residuals relative to the input parameters. a good agreementbetween model-dependent and -independent radii (-4.81 $\pm$ 1.32%) and surfacegravities (0.71 $\pm$ 0.51%) is also found. the consistency betweenindependently determined ages for members of binary systems adds furthersupport for the accuracy of the method employed to derive the stellar masses.taken together, our results indicate that determination of masses of evolvedstars using grids of evolutionary tracks is not significantly affected bysystematic errors, and is thus valid for estimating the masses of isolatedstars beyond the main sequence.

1510.06387	a disintegrating minor planet transiting a white dwarf	white dwarfs are the end state of most stars, including the sun, after theyexhaust their nuclear fuel. between 1/4 and 1/2 of white dwarfs have elementsheavier than helium in their atmospheres, even though these elements shouldrapidly settle into the stellar interiors unless they are occasionallyreplenished. the abundance ratios of heavy elements in white dwarf atmospheresare similar to rocky bodies in the solar system. this and the existence of warmdusty debris disks around about 4% of white dwarfs suggest that rocky debrisfrom white dwarf progenitors' planetary systems occasionally pollute the stars'atmospheres. the total accreted mass can be comparable to that of largeasteroids in the solar system. however, the process of disrupting planetarymaterial has not yet been observed. here, we report observations of a whitedwarf being transited by at least one and likely multiple disintegratingplanetesimals with periods ranging from 4.5 hours to 4.9 hours. the strongesttransit signals occur every 4.5 hours and exhibit varying depths up to 40% andasymmetric profiles, indicative of a small object with a cometary tail of dustyeffluent material. the star hosts a dusty debris disk and the star's spectrumshows prominent lines from heavy elements like magnesium, aluminium, silicon,calcium, iron, and nickel. this system provides evidence that heavy elementpollution of white dwarfs can originate from disrupted rocky bodies such asasteroids and minor planets.

1510.06434	multiwavelength transit observations of the candidate disintegrating  planetesimals orbiting wd 1145+017	we present multiwavelength, multi-telescope, ground-based follow-upphotometry of the white dwarf wd 1145+017, that has recently been suggested tobe orbited by up to six or more, short-period, low-mass, disintegratingplanetesimals. we detect 9 significant dips in flux of between 10% and 30% ofthe stellar flux from our ground-based photometry. we observe transits deeperthan 10% on average every ~3.6 hr in our photometry. this suggests that wd1145+017 is indeed being orbited by multiple, short-period objects. throughfits to the multiple asymmetric transits that we observe, we confirm that thetransit egress timescale is usually longer than the ingress timescale, and thatthe transit duration is longer than expected for a solid body at these shortperiods, all suggesting that these objects have cometary tails streaming behindthem. the precise orbital periods of the planetesimals in this system areunclear from the transit-times, but at least one object, and likely more, haveorbital periods of ~4.5 hours. we are otherwise unable to confirm the specificperiods that have been reported, bringing into question the long-term stabilityof these periods. our high precision photometry also displays low amplitudevariations suggesting that dusty material is consistently passing in front ofthe white dwarf, either from discarded material from these disintegratingplanetesimals or from the detected dusty debris disk. for the significanttransits we observe, we compare the transit depths in the v- and r-bands of ourmultiwavelength photometry, and find no significant difference; therefore, forlikely compositions the radius of single-size particles in the cometary tailsstreaming behind the planetesimals in this system must be ~0.15 microns orlarger, or ~0.06 microns or smaller, with 2-sigma confidence.

1511.09097	the kepler-454 system: a small, not-rocky inner planet, a jovian world,  and a distant companion	kepler-454 (koi-273) is a relatively bright (v = 11.69 mag), sun-likestarthat hosts a transiting planet candidate in a 10.6 d orbit. fromspectroscopy, we estimate the stellar temperature to be 5687 +/- 50 k, itsmetallicity to be [m/h] = 0.32 +/- 0.08, and the projected rotational velocityto be v sin i &lt;2.4 km s-1. we combine these values with a study of theasteroseismic frequencies from short cadence kepler data to estimate thestellar mass to be 1.028+0:04-0:03 m_sun, the radius to be 1.066 +/- 0.012r_sun and the age to be 5.25+1:41-1:39 gyr. we estimate the radius of the 10.6d planet as 2.37 +/- 0.13 r_earth. using 63 radial velocity observationsobtained with the harps-n spectrograph on the telescopio nazionale galileo and36 observations made with the hires spectrograph at keck observatory, wemeasure the mass of this planet to be 6.8 +/- 1.4m_earth. we also detect twoadditional non-transiting companions, a planet with a minimum mass of 4.46 +/-0.12 m_j in a nearly circular 524 d orbit and a massive companion with a period&gt;10 years and mass &gt;12.1m_j . the twelve exoplanets with radii &lt;2.7 r_earth andprecise mass measurements appear to fall into two populations, with those &lt;1.6r_earth following an earth-like composition curve and larger planets requiringa significant fraction of volatiles. with a density of 2.76 +/- 0.73 g cm-3,kepler-454b lies near the mass transition between these two populations andrequires the presence of volatiles and/or h/he gas.

astro-ph;0412498	the history of the mysterious eclipses of kh 15d ii. asiago, kiso, kitt  peak, mt. wilson, palomar, tautenburg and rozhen observatories, 1954-97	the unusual pre-main-sequence binary star named kh 15d undergoes remarkablydeep and long-lasting periodic eclipses. some clues about the reason for theseeclipses have come from the observed evolution of the system's light curve overthe last century. here we present ubvri photometry of kh 15d based onphotographic plates from various observatories, ranging in time from 1954 to1997. the system has been variable at the ~1 mag level since at least 1965.there is no evidence for color variations, with a typical limit of delta(b-v) &lt;0.2 mag. we confirm some previously published results that were based on asmaller sample of plates: from approximately 1965 to 1990, the total flux wasmodulated with the 48-day orbital period of the binary, but the maximum fluxwas larger, the fractional variations were smaller, and the phase of minimumflux was shifted by almost a half-cycle relative to the modern light curve. allthese results are consistent with the recently proposed theory that kh 15d isbeing occulted by an inclined, precessing, circumbinary ring.
