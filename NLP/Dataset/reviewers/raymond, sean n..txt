0901.1698	the hd 40307 planetary system: super-earths or mini-neptunes?	three planets with minimum masses less than 10 earth masses orbit the star hd40307, suggesting these planets may be rocky. however, with only radialvelocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky orgaseous. here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order toassess the physical properties of the planets. observations allow for circularorbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be atleast 0.0001. also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effectsare significant. if planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrialplanets in the solar system and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,going back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime ofthe star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 gyr). moreover, if theeccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidalheating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic io, on aper unit surface area basis. if planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. neptune-like,these physical constraints would not apply. this analysis suggests the planetsare not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets. in either case,we find that the planets probably formed at larger radii and migrated early-on(via disk interactions) into their current orbits. this study demonstrates howthe orbital and dynamical properties of exoplanet systems may be used toconstrain the planets' physical properties.

0901.3364	al-26 and the formation of the solar system from a molecular cloud  contaminated by wolf-rayet winds	in agreement with previous work, we show that the presence of the short-livedradionuclide al-26 in the early solar system was unlikely (&lt;2% a prioriprobability) to be the result of direct introduction of supernova ejecta intothe gaseous disk during the class ii stage of protosolar evolution. we alsoshow that any bondi-hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natalstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial al-26 inventoryof the solar system. these results are consistent with the absence of theoxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernovaejecta into the protoplanetary disk. instead, the presence of al-26 in theoldest solar system solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or cais) and itsapparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical al-26/al-27 ratio of(4.5-5)e-5 support the inheritance of al-26 from the parent giant molecularcloud. we propose that this radionuclide originated in a prior generation ofmassive stars that formed in the same host molecular cloud as the sun andcontaminated that cloud by wolf-rayet winds. we calculated the galacticdistribution of al-26/al-27 ratios that arise from such contamination using theestablished embedded cluster mass and stellar initial mass functions, publishednucleosynthetic yields from the winds of massive stars, and by assuming rapidand uniform mixing into the cloud. although our model predicts that themajority of stellar systems contain no al-26 from massive stars, and that the apriori probability that the al-26/al-27 ratio will reach or exceed thecanonical solar system value is only ~6%, the maximum in the distribution ofnon-zero values is close to the canonical ratio.

0903.3597	stability of additional planets in and around the habitable zone of the  hd 47186 planetary system	we study the dynamical stability of an additional, potentially habitableplanet in the hd 47186 planetary system. two planets are currently known inthis system: a "hot neptune" with a period of 4.08 days and a saturn-massplanet with a period of 3.7 years. here we consider the possibility that one ormore undetected planets exist between the two known planets and possibly withinthe habitable zone in this system. given the relatively low masses of the knownplanets, additional planets could have masses $\lsim 10 \mearth$, and hence beterrestrial-like and further improving potential habitability. we perform$n$-body simulations to identify the stable zone between planets $b$ and $c$and find that much of the inner habitable zone can harbor a $10 \mearth$planet. with the current radial-velocity threshold of $\sim 1$ m/s, anadditional planet should be detectable if it lies at the inner edge of thehabitable zone at 0.8 au. we also show that the stable zone could contain twoadditional planets of $10 \mearth$ each if their eccentricities are lower than$\sim 0.3$.

0905.3741	planet-planet scattering in planetesimal disks	we study the final architecture of planetary systems that evolve under thecombined effects of planet-planet and planetesimal scattering. using n-bodysimulations we investigate the dynamics of marginally unstable systems of gasand ice giants both in isolation and when the planets form interior to aplanetesimal belt. the unstable isolated systems evolve under planet-planetscattering to yield an eccentricity distribution that matches that observed forextrasolar planets. when planetesimals are included the outcome depends uponthe total mass of the planets. for system masses exceeding about one jupitermass the final eccentricity distribution remains broad, whereas for lower massplanetary systems a combination of divergent orbital evolution andrecircularization of scattered planets results in a preponderance of nearlycircular final orbits. we also study the fate of marginally stable multipleplanet systems in the presence of planetesimal disks, and find that for highplanet masses the majority of such systems evolve into resonance. a significantfraction lead to resonant chains that are planetary analogs of jupiter'sgalilean satellites. we predict that a transition from eccentric tonear-circular orbits will be observed once extrasolar planet surveys detectsub-jovian mass planets at orbital radii of 5-10 au.

0905.3750	building the terrestrial planets: constrained accretion in the inner  solar system	to date, no accretion model has succeeded in reproducing all observedconstraints in the inner solar system. these constraints include 1) the orbits,in particular the small eccentricities, and 2) the masses of the terrestrialplanets -- mars' relatively small mass in particular has not been adequatelyreproduced in previous simulations; 3) the formation timescales of earth andmars, as interpreted from hf/w isotopes; 4) the bulk structure of the asteroidbelt, in particular the lack of an imprint of planetary embryo-sized objects;and 5) earth's relatively large water content, assuming that it was deliveredin the form of water-rich primitive asteroidal material. here we presentresults of 40 high-resolution (n=1000-2000) dynamical simulations of late-stageplanetary accretion with the goal of reproducing these constraints, althoughneglecting the planet mercury. we assume that jupiter and saturn arefully-formed at the start of each simulation, and test orbital configurationsthat are both consistent with and contrary to the "nice model." we find that aconfiguration with jupiter and saturn on circular orbits forms low-eccentricityterrestrial planets and a water-rich earth on the correct timescale, but mars'mass is too large by a factor of 5-10 and embryos are often stranded in theasteroid belt. a configuration with jupiter and saturn in their currentlocations but with slightly higher initial eccentricities (e = 0.07-0.1)produces a small mars, an embryo-free asteroid belt, and a reasonable earthanalog but rarely allows water delivery to earth. none of the configurations wetested reproduced all the observed constraints.

0906.1785	tidal limits to planetary habitability	the habitable zones of main sequence stars have traditionally been defined asthe range of orbits that intercept the appropriate amount of stellar flux topermit surface water on a planet. terrestrial exoplanets discovered to orbit mstars in these zones, which are close-in due to decreased stellar luminosity,may also undergo significant tidal heating. tidal heating may span a wide rangefor terrestrial exoplanets and may significantly affect conditions near thesurface. for example, if heating rates on an exoplanet are near or greater thanthat on io (where tides drive volcanism that resurface the planet at leastevery 1 myr) and produce similar surface conditions, then the development oflife seems unlikely. on the other hand, if the tidal heating rate is less thanthe minimum to initiate plate tectonics, then co_2 may not be recycled throughsubduction, leading to a runaway greenhouse that sterilizes the planet. thesetwo cases represent potential boundaries to habitability and are presentedalong with the range of the traditional habitable zone for main sequence,low-mass stars. we propose a revised habitable zone that incorporates bothstellar insolation and tidal heating. we apply these criteria to gj 581 d andfind that it is in the traditional habitable zone, but its tidal heating alonemay be insufficient for plate tectonics.

0906.4369	dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation	we review the problem of the formation of terrestrial planets, withparticular emphasis on the interaction of dynamical and geochemical models. thelifetime of gas around stars in the process of formation is limited to a fewmillion years based on astronomical observations, while isotopic dating ofmeteorites and the earth-moon system suggest that perhaps 50-100 million yearswere required for the assembly of the earth. therefore, much of the growth ofthe terrestrial planets in our own system is presumed to have taken place underlargely gas-free conditions, and the physics of terrestrial planet formation isdominated by gravitational interactions and collisions. the earliest phase ofterrestrial-planet formation involve the growth of km-sized or largerplanetesimals from dust grains, followed by the accumulations of theseplanetesimals into ~100 lunar- to mars-mass bodies that are initiallygravitationally isolated from one-another in a swarm of smaller planetesimals,but eventually grow to the point of significantly perturbing one-another. themutual perturbations between the embryos, combined with gravitational stirringby jupiter, lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth toearth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years. numerical treatmentof this process has focussed on the use of symplectic integrators which canrapidly integrate the thousands of gravitationally-interacting bodies necessaryto accurately model planetary growth. while the general nature of theterrestrial planets--their sizes and orbital parameters--seem to be broadlyreproduced by the models, there are still some outstanding dynamical issues.one of these is the presence of an embryo-sized body, mars, in our system inplace of the more massive objects that simulations tend to yield.

0707.1711	a decreased probability of habitable planet formation around low-mass  stars	smaller terrestrial planets (&lt; 0.3 earth masses) are less likely to retainthe substantial atmospheres and ongoing tectonic activity probably required tosupport life. a key element in determining if sufficiently massive "sustainablyhabitable" planets can form is the availability of solid planet-formingmaterial. we use dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation fromplanetary embryos and simple scaling arguments to explore the implications ofcorrelations between terrestrial planet mass, disk mass, and the mass of theparent star. we assume that the protoplanetary disk mass scales with stellarmass as mdisk ~ f mstar^h, where f measures the relative disk mass, and 1/2 &lt; h&lt; 2, so that disk mass decreases with decreasing stellar mass. we considersystems without jovian planets, based on current models and observations for mstars. we assume the mass of a planet formed in some annulus of a disk withgiven parameters is proportional to the disk mass in that annulus, and showwith a suite of simulations of late-stage accretion that the adoptedprescription is surprisingly accurate. our results suggest that the fraction ofsystems with sufficient disk mass to form &gt; 0.3 earth mass habitable planetsdecreases for low-mass stars for every realistic combination of parameters.this "habitable fraction" is small for stellar masses below a mass in theinterval 0.5 to 0.8 solar masses, depending on disk parameters, an intervalthat excludes most m stars. radial mixing and therefore water delivery areinefficient in lower-mass disks commonly found around low-mass stars, such thatterrestrial planets in the habitable zones of most low-mass stars are likely tobe small and dry.

0912.1337	corot-7 b: super-earth or super-io?	corot-7 b, a planet about 70% larger than the earth orbiting a sun-like star,is the first-discovered rocky exoplanet, and hence has been dubbed a"super-earth". some initial studies suggested that since the planet is so closeto its host star, it receives enough insolation to partially melt its surface.however, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role thattides may play in this system. even if the planet's eccentricity has alwaysbeen zero, we show that tidal decay of semi-major axis could have been largeenough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation.moreover, corot-7 b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates itsgeophysics and drives extreme volcanism. in this case, corot-7 b is a"super-io" that, like jupiter's volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism andrapid resurfacing. such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10^-5.this small value could be driven by corot-7 c if its own eccentricity is largerthan ~10^-4. corot-7 b may be the first of a class of planetary super-ioslikely to be revealed by the corot and kepler spacecraft.

1001.3409	planet-planet scattering in planetesimal disks ii: predictions for outer  extrasolar planetary systems	we develop an idealized dynamical model to predict the typical properties ofouter extrasolar planetary systems, at radii beyond 5 au. our hypothesis isthat dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by acombination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with anexterior disk of small bodies ("planetesimals"). using 5,000 long durationn-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50earth mass primordial planetesimal disk. for large planet masses (above that ofsaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observedeccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smallerradii). we explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invokingstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. for lower massplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, suddenjumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization ofscattered low-mass planets in the disk. we present distributions of the finaleccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass andinitial system architecture. we predict a transition to lower eccentricitiesfor low mass planets at radii where disks influence the dynamics. radialvelocity measurements capable of detecting planets with k~5 m/s and periods inexcess of 10 years will constrain this regime. we also study the population ofresonant and non-resonant multiple planet systems. we show that, among systemswith jupiter-mass planets that avoid close encounters, the planetesimal diskacts as a damping mechanism that frequently populates mean motion resonances.resonant chains ought to be common among massive planets in outer planetarysystems.

1002.4875	habitable climates: the influence of eccentricity	in the outer regions of the habitable zone, the risk of transitioning into aglobally frozen "snowball" state poses a threat to the habitability of planetswith the capacity to host water-based life. we use a one-dimensional energybalance climate model (ebm) to examine how obliquity, spin rate, orbitaleccentricity, and ocean coverage might influence the onset of such a snowballstate. for an exoplanet, these parameters may be strikingly different from thevalues observed for earth. since, for constant semimajor axis, the annual meanstellar irradiation scales with (1-e^2)^(-1/2), one might expect the greatesthabitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as(1-e^2)^(-1/4). we find that this standard ansatz provides a reasonable lowerbound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone, but the influence ofobliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets oneccentric orbits. for planets with eccentricity 0.5, our ebm suggests that thegreatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0.8 au (78%!) dependingon obliquity, with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable againstsnowball transitions. one might also expect that the long winter at aneccentric planet's apoastron would render it more susceptible to globalfreezing. our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for earth-likeplanets around sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermalinertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. sinceplanets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from thestar, such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for directobservations with missions such as tpf-darwin. nevertheless, the extremetemperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-earths raise questionsabout the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitableconditions.

1002.4877	generalized milankovitch cycles and longterm climatic habitability	although the earth's orbit is never far from circular, terrestrial planetsaround other stars might experience substantial changes in eccentricity thatcould lead to climate changes, including possible "phase transitions" such asthe snowball transition (or its opposite). there is evidence that earth hasgone through at least one globally frozen, "snowball" state in the last billionyears, which it is thought to have exited after several million years becauseglobal ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle, thereby allowinggreenhouse gases to build up to sufficient concentration to melt the ice. dueto the positive feedback caused by the high albedo of snow and ice,susceptibility to falling into snowball states might be a generic feature ofwater-rich planets with the capacity to host life. this paper has two mainthrusts. first, we revisit one-dimensional energy balance climate models astools for probing possible climates of exoplanets, investigate the dimensionalscaling of such models, and introduce a simple algorithm to treat the meltingof the ice layer on a globally-frozen planet. we show that if a terrestrialplanet undergoes milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity that are ofgreat enough magnitude, it could melt out of a snowball state. second, weexamine the kinds of variations of eccentricity that a terrestrial planet mightexperience due to the gravitational influence of a giant companion. we showthat a giant planet on a sufficiently eccentric orbit can excite extremeeccentricity oscillations in the orbit of a habitable terrestrial planet. moregenerally, these two results demonstrate that the longterm habitability (andastronomical observables) of a terrestrial planet can depend on the detailedarchitecture of the planetary system in which it resides.

1005.2186	the roles of tidal evolution and evaporative mass loss in the origin of  corot-7 b	corot-7 b is the first confirmed rocky exoplanet, but, with an orbitalsemi-major axis of 0.0172 au, its origins may be unlike any rocky planet in oursolar system. in this study, we consider the roles of tidal evolution andevaporative mass loss in corot-7 b's history, which together have modified theplanet's mass and orbit. if corot-7 b has always been a rocky body, evaporationmay have driven off almost half its original mass, but the mass loss may dependsensitively on the extent of tidal decay of its orbit. as tides caused corot-7b's orbit to decay, they brought the planet closer to its host star, therebyenhancing the mass loss rate. such a large mass loss also suggests thepossibility that corot-7 b began as a gas giant planet and had its originalatmosphere completely evaporated. in this case, we find that corot-7 b'soriginal mass probably didn't exceed 200 earth masses (about 2/3 of a jupitermass). tides raised on the host star by the planet may have significantlyreduced the orbital semi-major axis, perhaps causing the planet to migratethrough mean-motion resonances with the other planet in the system, corot-7 c.the coupling between tidal evolution and mass loss may be important not onlyfor corot-7 b but also for other close-in exoplanets, and future studies ofmass loss and orbital evolution may provide insight into the origin and fate ofclose-in planets, both rocky and gaseous.

1104.0007	debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation	circumstantial evidence suggests that most known extra-solar planetarysystems are survivors of violent dynamical instabilities. here we explore howgiant planet instabilities affect the formation and survival of terrestrialplanets. we simulate planetary system evolution around sun-like stars frominitial conditions that comprise: an inner disk of planetesimals and planetaryembryos, three giant planets at jupiter-saturn distances, and a massive outerplanetesimal disk. we then calculate dust production rates and debris disk sedsassuming that each planetesimal particle represents an ensemble of smallerbodies in collisional equilibrium. we predict a strong correlation between thepresence of terrestrial planets and debris disks, mediated by the giantplanets. strong giant planet instabilities destroy all rocky material -including fully-formed terrestrial planets if the instabilities occur late -along with the icy planetesimals. stable or weakly unstable systems allowterrestrial planets to accrete and significant dust to be produced in theirouter regions. stars older than ~100 myr with bright cold dust emission (at ~70microns) signpost the dynamically calm environments conducive to efficientterrestrial accretion. we predict that while the typical eccentricities ofterrestrial planets are small, there should exist a novel class of terrestrialplanet system whose single planet undergoes large amplitude oscillations ineccentricity and inclination. by scaling to the observed semimajor axisdistribution of giant exoplanets, we estimate that terrestrial exoplanets inthe same systems should be a few times more abundant at 0.5 au than giant orterrestrial exoplanets at 1 au. finally, we discuss the solar system, whichappears to be unusual in combining a rich terrestrial planet system with a lowdust content.

1107.5656	two phase, inward-then-outward migration of jupiter and saturn in the  gaseous solar nebula	it has recently been shown that the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt canbe reproduced if the giant planets underwent an inward-then-outward migration(the "grand tack"; walsh et al 2011). inward migration occurs when jupiteropens a gap and type ii migrates inward. the planets "tack" and migrate outwardwhen saturn reaches the gap-opening mass and is caught in the 3:2 resonancewith jupiter. the aim is to test the viability of the grand tack model and tostudy the dynamical evolution of jupiter and saturn during their growth from 10earth masses cores. we have performed numerical simulations using a grid-basedhydrodynamical code. most of our simulations assume an isothermal equation ofstate for the disk but a subset use a fully-radiative version of the code. foran isothermal disk the two phase migration of jupiter and saturn is very robustand independent of the mass-growth history of these planets provided the diskis cool enough. for a radiative disk the we find some outcomes with two phasemigrations and others with more complicated behavior. we construct a simple,1-d model of an evolving viscous disk to calculate the evolution of the disk'sradiative properties: the disk transitions from radiative to isothermal fromits outermost regions inward in time. we show that a two-phase migration is anatural outcome at late times even under the limiting assumption thatisothermal conditions are required. thus, our simulations provide strongsupport for the grand tack scenario.

1109.2906	tidal evolution of planets around brown dwarfs	the tidal evolution of planets orbiting brown dwarfs (bds) presents aninteresting case study because bds' terrestrial planet forming region islocated extremely close-in. in fact, the habitable zones of bds range fromroughly 0.001 to 0.03 au and for the lowest-mass bds are located interior tothe roche limit. in contrast with stars, bds spin up as they age. thus, thecorotation distance moves inward. this has important implications for the tidalevolution of planets around bds. we used a standard equilibrium tidal model tocompute the orbital evolution of a large ensemble of planet-bd systems. wetested the effect of numerous parameters such as the initial semi-major axisand eccentricity, the rotation period of the bd, the masses of both the bd andplanet, and the tidal dissipation factors. we find that all planets that format or beyond the corotation distance and with initial eccentricities smallerthan \sim 0.1 are repelled from the bd. some planets initially interior tocorotation can survive if their inward tidal evolution is slower than the bd'sspin evolution, but most initially close-in planets fall onto the bd. we findthat the most important parameter for the tidal evolution is the initialorbital distance with respect to the corotation distance. some planets cansurvive in the habitable zone for gyr timescales, although in many cases thehabitable zone moves inward past the planet's orbit in just tens to hundreds ofmyr. surviving planets can have orbital periods of less than 10 days (as smallas 10 hrs), so they could be observable by transit.

1201.5177	a low mass for mars from jupiter's early gas-driven migration	jupiter and saturn formed in a few million years (haisch et al. 2001) from agas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migrationof their orbits on timescales of only ~100,000 years (armitage 2007).hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage,inward-then-outward, migration (masset &amp; snellgrove 2001, morbidelli &amp; crida2007, pierens &amp; nelson 2008). the terrestrial planets finished accreting muchlater (klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including mars' smallmass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outeredge at about one astronomical unit from the sun (wetherill 1978, hansen 2009)(1 au is the earth-sun distance). here we report simulations of the early solarsystem that show how the inward migration of jupiter to 1.5 au, and itssubsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 au;the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 millionyears, with an earth/mars mass ratio consistent with observations. scatteringby jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, withinner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 au and outer-belt bodiesoriginating between and beyond the giant planets. this explains the significantcompositional differences across the asteroid belt. the key aspect missing fromprevious models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radialmigration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is moresimilar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.

0711.2015	observable consequences of planet formation models in systems with  close-in terrestrial planets	to date, two planetary systems have been discovered with close-in,terrestrial-mass planets (&lt; 5-10 earth masses). many more such discoveries areanticipated in the coming years with radial velocity and transit searches. herewe investigate the different mechanisms that could form "hot earths" and theirobservable predictions. models include: 1) in situ accretion; 2) formation atlarger orbital distance followed by inward "type 1" migration; 3) formationfrom material being "shepherded" inward by a migrating gas giant planet; 4)formation from material being shepherded by moving secular resonances duringdispersal of the protoplanetary disk; 5) tidal circularization of eccentricterrestrial planets with close-in perihelion distances; and 6)photo-evaporative mass loss of a close-in giant planet. models 1-4 have beenvalidated in previous work. we show that tidal circularization can form hotearths, but only for relatively massive planets (&gt; 5 earth masses) with veryclose-in perihelion distances (&lt; 0.025 au), and even then the net inwardmovement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 au. for planets of lessthan about 70 earth masses, photo-evaporation can remove the planet's envelopeand leave behind the solid core on a gyr timescale, but only for planets inside0.025-0.05 au. using two quantities that are observable by current and upcomingmissions, we show that these models each produce unique signatures, and can beobservationally distinguished. these observables are the planetary systemarchitecture (detectable with radial velocities, transits and transit-timing)and the bulk composition of transiting close-in terrestrial planets (measuredby transits via the planet's radius).

1207.2127	effect of the stellar spin history on the tidal evolution of close-in  planets	we investigate how the evolution of the stellar spin rate affects, and isaffected by, planets in close orbits, via star-planet tidal interactions. to dothis, we used a standard equilibrium tidal model to compute the orbitalevolution of single planets orbiting both sun-like stars and 0.1 m\odotm-dwarfs. we tested two stellar spin evolution profiles, one with fast initialrotation (p=1.2 day) and one with slow initial rotation (p=8 day). we testedthe effect of varying the stellar and planetary dissipation and the planet'smass and initial orbital radius. conclusions: tidal evolution allows todifferentiate the early behaviors of extremely close-in planets orbiting eithera rapidly rotating star or a slowly rotating star. the early spin-up of thestar allows the close-in planets around fast rotators to survive the earlyevolution. for planets around m-dwarfs, surviving the early evolution meanssurviving on gyr timescales whereas for sun-like stars the spin-down bringsabout late mergers of jupiter planets. in light of this study, we can say thatdifferentiating between one spin evolution from another given the presentposition of planets can be very tricky. unless we can observe some markers offormer evolution it is nearly impossible to distinguish the two very differentspin profiles, let alone intermediate spin profiles. though some conclusionscan still be drawn from statistical distributions of planets around fullyconvective m-dwarfs. however, if the tidal evolution brings about a merger latein its history it can also entail a noticeable acceleration of the star in lateages, so that it is possible to have old stars that spin rapidly. this raisesthe question of better constraining the age of stars.

1209.5125	the compositional diversity of extrasolar terrestrial planets: ii.  migration simulations	prior work has found that a variety of terrestrial planetary compositions areexpected to occur within known extrasolar planetary systems. however, suchstudies ignored the effects of giant planet migration, which is thought to bevery common in extra-solar systems. here we present calculations of thecompositions of terrestrial planets that formed in dynamical simulationsincorporating varying degrees of giant planet migration. we used chemicalequilibrium models of the solid material present in the disks of five knownplanetary host stars: the sun, gj 777, hd4203, hd19994 and hd213240. giantplanet migration has a strong effect on the compositions of simulatedterrestrial planets as the migration results large-scale mixing betweenterrestrial planet building blocks that condensed at a range of temperatures.this mixing acts to 1) increase the typical abundance of mg-rich silicates inthe terrestrial planets feeding zones and thus increase the frequency ofplanets with earth-like compositions compared with simulations with staticgiant planet orbits; and 2) drastically increase the efficiency of the deliveryof hydrous phases (water and serpentine) to terrestrial planets and thusproduce water worlds and/or wet earths. our results demonstrate that although awide variety of terrestrial planet compositions can still be produced, planetswith earth-like compositions should be common within extrasolar planetarysystems.

1211.2809	mini-oort clouds: compact isotropic planetesimal clouds from  planet-planet scattering	starting from planetary systems with three giant planets and an outer disk ofplanetesimals, we use dynamical simulations to show how dynamical instabilitiescan transform planetesimal disks into 100-1000 au-scale isotropic clouds. theinstabilities involve a phase of planet-planet scattering that concludes withthe ejection of one or more planets and the inward-scattering of the survivinggas giant(s) to remove them from direct dynamical contact with theplanetesimals. "mini-oort clouds" are thus formed from scattered planetesimalswhose orbits are frozen by the abrupt disappearance of the perturbing giantplanet. although the planetesimal orbits are virtually isotropic, the survivinggiant planets tend to have modest inclinations (typically ~10 degrees) withrespect to the initial orbital plane. the collisional lifetimes of mini-oortclouds are long (10 myr to &gt;10 gyr) and there is a window of ~100 myr or longerduring which they produce spherical clouds of potentially observable dust at 70microns. if the formation channel for hot jupiters commonly involves planetaryclose encounters, we predict a correlation between this subset of extrasolarplanetary systems and mini-oort clouds.

1301.3145	planetary system disruption by galactic perturbations to wide binary  stars	nearly half of the exoplanets found within binary star systems reside in verywide binaries with average stellar separations beyond 1,000 au (1 au being theearth-sun distance), yet the influence of such distant binary companions onplanetary evolution remains largely unstudied. unlike their tightercounterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries continually change under theinfluence of the galactic tide and impulses from other passing stars. here wereport numerical simulations demonstrating that the variable nature of widebinary star orbits dramatically reshapes the planetary systems they host,typically gyrs after formation. contrary to previous understanding, wide binarycompanions may often strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetaryejections and exciting orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. indeed,observed exoplanet eccentricities offer evidence of this; giant exoplanetorbits within wide binaries are statistically more eccentric than those aroundisolated stars. both eccentricity distributions are well-reproduced when weassume isolated stars and wide binaries host similar planetary systems whoseoutermost giant planets are scattered beyond ~10 au from their parent stars viaearly internal instabilities. consequently, our results suggest that althoughwide binaries eventually truncate their planetary systems, most isolated giantexoplanet systems harbor additional distant, still undetected planets.

1304.0459	tidal dissipation and eccentricity pumping: implications for the depth  of the secondary eclipse of 55 cnc e	we use the super earth 55 cnc e as a case study to address an observableeffect of tidal heating. we investigate whether planet-planet interactions canforce the eccentricity of this planet to a level affecting the eclipse depthobserved with spitzer. using the constant time lag tidal model, we firstcalculate the observed planet flux as a function of albedo and eccentricity,for different tidal dissipation constants and for two extreme cases: a planetwith no heat redistribution and a planet with full heat redistribution. wederive the values of albedo and eccentricity that match the observed transitdepth. we then perform n-body simulations of the planetary system includingtides and general relativity to follow the evolution of the eccentricity ofplanet e. we compare the range of eccentricities given by the simulations withthe eccentricities required to alter the eclipse depth. we find that theeccentricity of planet e can be large enough to contribute at a measurablelevel to the thermal emission measured with spitzer. this affects theconstraints on the albedo of the planet, which can be as high as 0.9 (insteadof 0.55 when ignoring tidal heating). we also derive a maximum value for theeccentricity of planet e directly from the eclipse depth: e&lt;0.015 assumingearth's dissipation constant. transiting exoplanets in multiple planet systemsare exceptional targets for testing tidal models because their tidal luminositymay be observable. future multi-wavelengths observations of eclipse depth andphase curves (for instance with echo and jwst) should allow us to betterresolve the temperature map of these planets and break the degeneracy betweenalbedo and tidal heating that remains for single band observations. inaddition, an accurate determination of the eccentricity will make it possibleto constrain the dissipation rate of the planet and to probe its internalstructure.

1306.4325	dynamical and collisional constraints on a stochastic late veneer on the  terrestrial planets	given their tendency to be incorporated into the core during differentiation,the highly-siderophile elements (hses) in earth's mantle are thought to havebeen accreted as a `late veneer' after the end of the giant impact phase.bottke et al (2010) proposed that the large earth-to-moon hse abundance ratiocan be explained if the late veneer was characterized by large (d =1000-4000km) impactors. here we simulate the evolution of the terrestrialplanets during a stochastic late veneer phase from the end of accretion untilthe start of the late heavy bombardment ~500 myr later. we show that a lateveneer population of 0.05 earth masses dominated by large (d &gt; 1000km) bodiesnaturally delivers a ~0.01 earth mass veneer to earth, consistent withconstraints. the eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets areexcited by close encounters with the largest late veneer bodies. we find thebest agreement with their post-veneer orbits if either a) the terrestrialplanets' pre-veneer angular momentum deficit amd_0 was less than half of thecurrent one amd_now, or b) amd_0 &lt;= amd_now and the veneer was limited tosmaller (d_max &lt;= 2000km) bodies. veneer impacts on venus, earth and mars weremostly accretionary but on mercury and the moon they were mostly erosive. in~20% of simulations an energetic impact occurred that could have removed &gt;25%of mercury's mass, thereby increasing its iron mass fraction. we show that, dueto the erosive nature of larger impacts, the moon cannot accrete any materialfrom objects larger than 500-1000km. the large earth-to-moon hse abundanceratio is explained if the late veneer included large impactors (d &gt;=500-1000km) regardless of their size distribution, as long as most of earth'sveneer came from large bodies. the spin angular momenta imparted by stochasticlate veneer impacts was far in excess of the current ones for mercury andvenus.

1307.4761	secular behavior of exoplanets: self-consistency and comparisons with  the planet-planet scattering hypothesis	if mutual gravitational scattering among exoplanets occurs, then it mayproduce unique orbital properties. for example, two-planet systems that lienear the boundary between circulation and libration of their periapses couldresult if planet-planet scattering ejected a former third planet quickly,leaving one planet on an eccentric orbit and the other on a circular orbit. wefirst improve upon previous work that examined the apsidal behavior of knownmultiplanet systems by doubling the sample size and including observationaluncertainties. this analysis recovers previous results that demonstrated thatmany systems lay on the apsidal boundary between libration and circulation. wethen performed over 12,000 three-dimensional n-body simulations of hypotheticalthree-body systems that are unstable, but stabilize to two-body systems afteran ejection. using these synthetic two-planet systems, we test theplanet-planet scattering hypothesis by comparing their apsidal behavior, over arange of viewing angles, to that of the observed systems and find that they arestatistically consistent regardless of the multiplicity of the observedsystems. finally, we combine our results with previous studies to show that,from the sampled cases, the most likely planetary mass function prior toplanet-planet scattering follows a power law with index -1.1. we find that thispre-scattering mass function predicts a mutual inclination frequencydistribution that follows an exponential function with an index between -0.06and -0.1.

0801.2560	terrestrial planet formation in extra-solar planetary systems	terrestrial planets form in a series of dynamical steps from the solidcomponent of circumstellar disks. first, km-sized planetesimals form likely viaa combination of sticky collisions, turbulent concentration of solids, andgravitational collapse from micron-sized dust grains in the thin disk midplane.second, planetesimals coalesce to form moon- to mars-sized protoplanets, alsocalled "planetary embryos". finally, full-sized terrestrial planets accretefrom protoplanets and planetesimals. this final stage of accretion lasts about10-100 myr and is strongly affected by gravitational perturbations from any gasgiant planets, which are constrained to form more quickly, during the 1-10 myrlifetime of the gaseous component of the disk. it is during this final stagethat the bulk compositions and volatile (e.g., water) contents of terrestrialplanets are set, depending on their feeding zones and the amount of radialmixing that occurs. the main factors that influence terrestrial planetformation are the mass and surface density profile of the disk, and theperturbations from giant planets and binary companions if they exist. simpleaccretion models predicts that low-mass stars should form small, dry planets intheir habitable zones. the migration of a giant planet through a disk of rockybodies does not completely impede terrestrial planet growth. rather, "hotjupiter" systems are likely to also contain exterior, very water-richearth-like planets, and also "hot earths", very close-in rocky planets. roughlyone third of the known systems of extra-solar (giant) planets could allow aterrestrial planet to form in the habitable zone.

1309.1467	solar system moons as analogs for compact exoplanetary systems	the field of exoplanetary science has experienced a recent surge of newsystems that is largely due to the precision photometry provided by the keplermission. the latest discoveries have included compact planetary systems inwhich the orbits of the planets all lie relatively close to the host star,which presents interesting challenges in terms of formation and dynamicalevolution. the compact exoplanetary systems are analogous to the moons orbitingthe giant planets in our solar system, in terms of their relative sizes andsemi-major axes. we present a study that quantifies the scaled sizes andseparations of the solar system moons with respect to their hosts. we perform asimilar study for a large sample of confirmed kepler planets in multi-planetsystems. we show that a comparison between the two samples leads to a similarcorrelation between their scaled sizes and separation distributions. thedifferent gradients of the correlations may be indicative of differences in theformation and/or long-term dynamics of moon and planetary systems.

1309.3272	very wide binary stars as the primary source of stellar collisions in  the galaxy	we present numerical simulations modeling the orbital evolution of very widebinaries, pairs of stars separated by over ~1000 au. due to perturbations fromother passing stars and the milky way's tide, the orbits of very wide binarystars occasionally become extremely eccentric, which forces close encountersbetween the companion stars (kaib et al. 2013). we show that this processcauses a stellar collision between very wide binary companion stars once every1000-7500 years on average in the milky way. one of the main uncertainties inthis collision rate is the amount of energy dissipated by dynamic tides duringclose (but not collisional) periastron passages. this dissipation presents adynamical barrier to stellar collisions and can instead transform very widebinaries into close or contact binaries. however, for any plausible tidaldissipation model, very wide binary stars are an unrealized, and potentiallythe dominant, source of stellar collisions in our galaxy. such collisionsshould occur throughout the thin disk of the milky way. stellar collisionswithin very wide binaries should yield a small population of single,li-depleted, rapidly rotating massive stars.

1401.3743	no universal minimum-mass extrasolar nebula: evidence against in-situ  accretion of systems of hot super-earths	it has been proposed that the observed systems of hot super-earths formed insitu from high-mass disks. by fitting a disk profile to the entire populationof kepler planet candidates, chiang &amp; laughlin (2013) constructed a"minimum-mass extrasolar nebula" with surface density profile sigma r^-1.6.here we use multiple-planet systems to show that it is inconsistent to assume auniversal disk profile. systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planetcandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface densityprofiles ranging from sigma r^-3.2 to sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). bysimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systemsdesigned to match the properties of observed super-earth systems, we show thata universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. rather,the underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized by a broadrange of surface density slopes. models of gaseous disks can only explain anarrow range of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). yet accretion ofterrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radialdistribution of building blocks. the known systems of hot super-earths musttherefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can nothave predominantly formed in situ. we instead interpret the diversity of diskslopes as the imprint of a process that re-arranged the solids relative to thegas in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks. a plausible mechanism is inwardtype 1 migration of mars- to earth-mass planetary embryos, perhaps followed bya final assembly phase.

1403.6821	vega's hot dust from icy planetesimals scattered inward by an  outward-migrating planetary system	vega has been shown to host multiple dust populations, including both hotexo-zodiacal dust at sub-au radii and a cold debris disk extending beyond 100au. we use dynamical simulations to show how vega's hot dust can be created bylong-range gravitational scattering of planetesimals from its cold outerregions. planetesimals are scattered progressively inward by a system of 5-7planets from 30-60 au to very close-in. in successful simulations the outermostplanets are typically neptune-mass. the back-reaction of planetesimalscattering causes these planets to migrate outward and continually interactwith fresh planetesimals, replenishing the source of scattered bodies. the mostfavorable cases for producing vega's exo-zodi have negative radial massgradients, with sub-saturn- to jupiter-mass inner planets at 5-10 au and outerplanets of 2.5 to 20 earth masses. the mechanism fails if a jupiter-sizedplanet exists beyond ~15 au because the planet preferentially ejectsplanetesimals before they can reach the inner system. direct-imaging planetsearches can therefore directly test this mechanism.

1404.2606	planetesimal driven migration as an explanation for observations of high  levels of warm, exozodiacal dust	high levels of exozodiacal dust have been observed in the inner regions of alarge fraction of main sequence stars. given the short lifetime of the observedsmall dust grains, these 'exozodis' are difficult to explain, especially forold (&gt;100 myr) stars. the exozodiacal dust may be observed as excess emissionin the mid-infrared, or using interferometry. we hypothesise that exozodi aresustained by planetesimals scattered by planets inwards from an outerplanetesimal belt, where collision timescales are long. in this work, we usen-body simulations to show that the outwards migration of a planet into a belt,driven by the scattering of planetesimals, can increase, or sustain, the rateat which planetesimals are scattered from the outer belt to the exozodi region.we hypothesise that this increase is sufficient to sustain the observed exozodion gyr timescales. no correlation between observations of an outer belt and anexozodi is required for this scenario to work, as the outer belt may be toofaint to detect. if planetesimal driven migration does explain the observedexozodi, this work suggests that the presence of an exozodi indicates thepresence of outer planets and a planetesimal belt.

1407.3290	water delivery and giant impacts in the 'grand tack' scenario	a new model for terrestrial planet formation (hansen 2009, walsh et al. 2011)has explored accretion in a truncated protoplanetary disk, and found that sucha configuration is able to reproduce the distribution of mass among the planetsin the solar system, especially the earth/mars mass ratio, which earliersimulations have generally not been able to match. walsh et al. tested apossible mechanism to truncate the disk--a two-stage, inward-then-outwardmigration of jupiter and saturn, as found in numerous hydrodynamicalsimulations of giant planet formation. in addition to truncating the disk andproducing a more realistic earth/mars mass ratio, the migration of the giantplanets also populates the asteroid belt with two distinct populations ofbodies--the inner belt is filled by bodies originating inside of 3 au, and theouter belt is filled with bodies originating from between and beyond the giantplanets (which are hereafter referred to as `primitive' bodies).  we find here that the planets will accrete on order 1-2% of their total massfrom primitive planetesimals scattered onto planet-crossing orbits during theformation of the planets. for an assumed value of 10% for the water massfraction of the primitive planetesimals, this model delivers a total amount ofwater comparable to that estimated to be on the earth today. while the radialdistribution of the planetary masses and the dynamical excitation of theirorbits are a good match to the observed system, we find that the last giantimpact is typically earlier than 20 myr, and a substantial amount of mass isaccreted after that event. however, 5 of the 27 planets larger than half anearth mass formed in all simulations do experience large late impacts andsubsequent accretion consistent with the dating of the moon-forming impact andthe estimated amount of mass accreted by earth following that event.

1407.6011	hot super-earths and giant planet cores from different migration  histories	planetary embryos embedded in gaseous protoplanetary disks undergo type iorbital migration. migration can be inward or outward depending on the localdisk properties but, in general, only planets more massive than several$m_\oplus$ can migrate outward. here we propose that an embryo's migrationhistory determines whether it becomes a hot super-earth or the core of a giantplanet. systems of hot super-earths (or mini-neptunes) form when embryosmigrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. giant planet coresform when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch directionand migrate outward. we present simulations of this process using a modifiedn-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. systems of hotsuper-earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interiorto the disk inner edge. resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamicalinstabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. giant planetcores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward andeventually disappear as the disk disperses. giant planet cores migrate inwardwith these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 au. our model reproduces severalproperties of the observed extra-solar planet populations. the frequency ofgiant planet cores increases strongly when the mass in solids is increased,consistent with the observed giant exoplanet - stellar metallicity correlation.the frequency of hot super-earths is not a function of stellar metallicity,also in agreement with observations. our simulations can reproduce the broadcharacteristics of the observed super-earth population.

1409.6340	the grand tack model: a critical review	the `grand tack' model proposes that the inner solar system was sculpted bythe giant planets' orbital migration in the gaseous protoplanetary disk.jupiter first migrated inward then jupiter and saturn migrated back outwardtogether. if jupiter's turnaround or "tack" point was at ~1.5 au the inner diskof terrestrial building blocks would have been truncated at ~1 au, naturallyproducing the terrestrial planets' masses and spacing. during the gas giants'migration the asteroid belt is severely depleted but repopulated by distinctplanetesimal reservoirs that can be associated with the present-day s and ctypes. the giant planets' orbits are consistent with the later evolution of theouter solar system.  here we confront common criticisms of the grand tack model. we show that someuncertainties remain regarding the tack mechanism itself; the most criticalunknown is the timing and rate of gas accretion onto saturn and jupiter.current isotopic and compositional measurements of solar system bodies --including the d/h ratios of saturn's satellites -- do not refute the model. wediscuss how alternate models for the formation of the terrestrial planets eachsuffer from an internal inconsistency and/or place a strong and very specificrequirement on the properties of the protoplanetary disk.  we conclude that the grand tack model remains viable and consistent with ourcurrent understanding of planet formation. nonetheless, we encourage additionaltests of the grand tack as well as the construction of alternate models.

1412.0284	dynamics of exoplanetary systems, links to their habitability	our knowledge of planets' orbital dynamics, which was based on solar systemstudies, has been challenged by the diversity of exoplanetary systems.  around cool and ultra cool dwarfs, the influence of tides on the orbital andspin evolution of planets can strongly affect their climate and their capacityto host surface liquid water.  we illustrate the role of tides and dynamics with the extreme case of planetsorbiting around brown dwarfs. in multiple planet systems, the eccentricity isexcited by planet-planet interactions. planets are therefore heated up from theinside by the tidally-induced friction. this process can heat a habitable zoneplanet to such a level that surface liquid water cannot exist.  we also talk about the newly discovered potentially habitable earth-sizedplanet kepler-186f. given the poorly estimated age of the system, the planetcould still be evolving towards synchronization and have a high obliquity or bepseudo-synchronized with a zero obliquity. these two configurations would havea different effect on the climate of this planet.

1502.07346	a primordial origin for the composition similarity between the earth and  the moon	most of the properties of the earth-moon system can be explained by acollision between a planetary embryo and the growing earth late in theaccretion process. simulations show that most of the material that eventuallyaggregates to form the moon originates from the impactor. however, analysis ofthe terrestrial and lunar isotopic composition show them to be highly similar.in contrast, the compositions of other solar system bodies are significantlydifferent than the earth and moon. this poses a major challenge to the giantimpact scenario since the moon-forming impactor is then thought to also havediffered in composition from the proto-earth. here we track the feeding zonesof growing planets in a suite of simulations of planetary accretion, in orderto measure the composition of moon-forming impactors. we find that differentplanets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but thecompositions of giant impactors are systematically more similar to the planetsthey impact. a significant fraction of planet-impactor pairs have virtuallyidentical compositions. thus, the similarity in composition between the earthand moon could be a natural consequence of a late giant impact.

1504.01421	highly siderophile elements in the earth's mantle as a clock for the  moon-forming impact	according to the generally accepted scenario, the last giant impact on theearth formed the moon and initiated the final phase of core formation bymelting the earth's mantle. a key goal of geochemistry is to date this event,but different ages have been proposed. some argue for an early moon-formingevent, approximately 30 million years (myr) after the condensation of the firstsolids in the solar system, whereas others claim a date later than 50 myr (andpossibly as late as around 100 my) after condensation. here we show that amoon-forming event at 40 myr after condensation, or earlier, is ruled out at a99.9 per cent confidence level. we use a large number of n-body simulations todemonstrate a relationship between the time of the last giant impact on anearth-like planet and the amount of mass subsequently added during the eraknown as late accretion. as the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accretedmass decreases in a predictable fashion. this relationship exists within boththe classical scenario and the grand tack scenario of terrestrial planetformation, and it holds across a wide range of disk conditions. theconcentration of highly siderophile elements (hses) in earth's mantleconstrains the mass of chondritic material added to earth during lateaccretion. using hse abundance measurements, we determine a moon-formation ageof 95 +/- 32 myr since condensation. the possibility exists that some lateprojectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete hse record in earth'smantle. even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest thatthe late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of earth's mass, and so thehse clock still robustly limits the timing of the moon-forming event tosignificantly later than 40 my after condensation.

1506.03029	accretion of uranus and neptune from inward-migrating planetary embryos  blocked by jupiter and saturn	reproducing uranus and neptune remains a challenge for simulations of solarsystem formation. the ice giants' peculiar obliquities suggest that they bothsuffered giant collisions during their formation. thus, there must have been anepoch of accretion dominated by collisions among large planetary embryos in theprimordial outer solar system. we test this idea using n-body numericalsimulations including the effects of a gaseous protoplanetary disk. one strongconstraint is that the masses of the ice giants are very similar -- theneptune/uranus mass ratio is $\sim1.18$. we show that similar-size ice giantsdo indeed form by collisions between planetary embryos beyond saturn. thefraction of successful simulations varies depending on the initial number ofplanetary embryos in the system, their individual and total masses.similar-sized ice giants are consistently reproduced in simulations startingwith 5-10 planetary embryos with initial masses of $\sim$3-6 ${\rm m_\oplus}$.we conclude that accretion from a population of planetary embryos is aplausible scenario for the origin of uranus and neptune.

1507.04751	mercury-t: a new code to study tidally evolving multi-planet systems.  applications to kepler-62	a large proportion of observed planetary systems contain several planets in acompact orbital configuration, and often harbor at least one close-in object.these systems are then most likely tidally evolving. we investigate how theeffects of planet-planet interactions influence the tidal evolution of planets.  we introduce for that purpose a new open-source addition to the mercuryn-body code, mercury-t, which takes into account tides, general relativity andthe effect of rotation-induced flattening in order to simulate the dynamicaland tidal evolution of multi-planet systems. it uses a standard equilibriumtidal model, the constant time lag model. besides, the evolution of the radiusof several host bodies has been implemented (brown dwarfs, m-dwarfs of mass$0.1~m_\odot$, sun-like stars, jupiter). we validate the new code by comparingits output for one-planet systems to the secular equations results. we findthat this code does respect the conservation of total angular momentum.  we applied this new tool to the planetary system kepler-62. we find thattides influence the stability of the system in some cases. we also show thatwhile the four inner planets of the systems are likely to have slow rotationrates and small obliquities, the fifth planet could have a fast rotation rateand a high obliquity. this means that the two habitable zone planets of thissystem, kepler-62e ad f are likely to have very different climate features, andthis of course would influence their potential at hosting surface liquid water.

1508.01365	terrestrial planet formation constrained by mars and the structure of  the asteroid belt	reproducing the large earth/mars mass ratio requires a strong mass depletionin solids within the protoplanetary disk between 1 and 3 au. the grand tackmodel invokes a specific migration history of the giant planets to remove mostof the mass initially beyond 1 au and to dynamically excite the asteroid belt.however, one could also invoke a steep density gradient created by inward driftand pile-up of small particles induced by gas-drag, as has been proposed toexplain the formation of close-in super earths. here we show that the asteroidbelt's orbital excitation provides a crucial constraint against this scenariofor the solar system. we performed a series of simulations of terrestrialplanet formation and asteroid belt evolution starting from disks ofplanetesimals and planetary embryos with various radial density gradients andincluding jupiter and saturn on nearly circular and coplanar orbits. disks withshallow density gradients reproduce the dynamical excitation of the asteroidbelt by gravitational self-stirring but form mars analogs significantly moremassive than the real planet. in contrast, a disk with a surface densitygradient proportional to $r^{-5.5}$ reproduces the earth/mars mass ratio butleaves the asteroid belt in a dynamical state that is far colder than the realbelt. we conclude that no disk profile can simultaneously explain the structureof the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt. the asteroid belt must have beendepleted and dynamically excited by a different mechanism such as, forinstance, in the grand tack scenario.

0807.0680	tides and the evolution of planetary habitability	tides raised on a planet by its host star's gravity can reduce a planet'sorbital semi-major axis and eccentricity. this effect is only relevant forplanets orbiting very close to their host stars. the habitable zones oflow-mass stars are also close-in and tides can alter the orbits of planets inthese locations. we calculate the tidal evolution of hypothetical terrestrialplanets around low-mass stars and show that tides can evolve planets past theinner edge of the habitable zone, sometimes in less than 1 billion years. thismigration requires large eccentricities (&gt;0.5) and low-mass stars (&lt;0.35m_sun). such migration may have important implications for the evolution of theatmosphere, internal heating and the gaia hypothesis. similarly, a planetdetected interior to the habitable zone could have been habitable in the past.we consider the past habitability of the recently-discovered, ~5 m_earthplanet, gliese 581 c. we find that it could have been habitable for reasonablechoices of orbital and physical properties as recently as 2 gyr ago. however,when we include constraints derived from the additional companions, we see thatmost parameter choices that predict past habitability require the two innerplanets of the system to have crossed their mutual 3:1 mean motion resonance.as this crossing would likely have resulted in resonance capture, which is notobserved, we conclude that gl 581 c was probably never habitable.

0807.4186	extrasolar planet eccentricities from scattering in the presence of  residual gas disks	gravitational scattering between massive planets has been invoked to explainthe eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets. for scattering to occur,the planets must either form in -- or migrate into -- an unstableconfiguration. in either case, it is likely that a residual gas disk, with amass comparable to that of the planets, will be present when scattering occurs.using explicit hydrodynamic simulations, we study the impact of gas disks onthe outcome of two-planet scattering. we assume a specific model in which theplanets are driven toward instability by gravitational torques from an outerlow mass disk. we find that the accretion of mass and angular momentum thatoccurs when a scattered planet impacts the disk can strongly influence thesubsequent dynamics by reducing the number of close encounters. theeccentricity of the innermost surviving planet at the epoch when the systembecomes hill stable is not substantially altered from the gas-free case, butthe outer planet is circularized by its interaction with the disk. thesignature of scattering initiated by gas disk migration is thus a high fractionof low eccentricity planets at larger radii accompanying known eccentricplanets. subsequent secular evolution of the two planets in the presence ofdamping can further damp both eccentricities, and tends to push systems awayfrom apsidal alignment and toward anti-alignment. we note that the late burstof accretion when the outer planet impacts the disk is in principle observable,probably via detection of a strong near-ir excess in systems with otherwiseweak disk and stellar accretion signatures.

astro-ph;0308159	making other earths: dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet  formation and water delivery	we present results from 42 simulations of late stage planetary accretion,focusing on the delivery of volatiles (primarily water) to the terrestrialplanets. our simulations include both planetary "embryos" (defined as moon tomars sized protoplanets) and planetesimals, assuming that the embryos formedvia oligarchic growth. we investigate volatile delivery as a function ofjupiter's mass, position and eccentricity, the position of the snow line, andthe density (in solids) of the solar nebula.  in all simulations, we form 1-4 terrestrial planets inside 2 au, which varyin mass and volatile content. in 42 simulations we have formed 43 planetsbetween 0.8 and 1.5 au, including 11 "habitable" planets between 0.9 and 1.1au. these planets range from dry worlds to "water worlds" with 100+ oceans ofwater (1 ocean = 1.5x10^24 g), and vary in mass between 0.23 and 3.85 earthmasses.  there is a good deal of stochastic noise in these simulations, but the mostimportant parameter is the planetesimal mass we choose, which reflects thesurface density in solids past the snow line. a high density in this regionresults in the formation of a smaller number of terrestrial planets with largermasses and higher water content, as compared with planets which form in systemswith lower densities.  we find that an eccentric jupiter produces drier terrestrial planets withhigher eccentricities than a circular one. in cases with jupiter at 7 au, weform what we call "super embryos," 1-2 earth mass protoplanets which can serveas the accretion seeds for 2+ earth mass planets with large water contents.

0808.3295	a dynamical perspective on additional planets in 55 cancri	five planets are known to orbit the star 55 cancri. the recently-discoveredplanet f at 0.78 au (fischer et al. 2008) is located at the inner edge of apreviously-identified stable zone that separates the three close-in planetsfrom planet d at 5.9 au. here we map the stability of the orbital space betweenplanets f and d using a suite of n-body integrations that include anadditional, yet-to-be-discovered planet g with a radial velocity amplitude of 5m/s (planet mass = 0.5-1.2 saturn masses). we find a large stable zoneextending from 0.9 to 3.8 au at eccentricities below 0.4. for each system wequantify the probability of detecting planets b-f on their current orbits givenperturbations from hypothetical planet g, in order to further constrain themass and orbit of an additional planet. we find that large perturbations areassociated with specific mean motion resonances (mmrs) with planets f and d. weshow that two mmrs, 3f:1g (the 1:3 mmr between planets g and f) and 4g:1dcannot contain a planet g. the 2f:1g mmr is unlikely to contain a planet moremassive than about 20 earth masses. the 3g:1d and 5g:2d mmrs could contain aresonant planet but the resonant location is strongly confined. the 3f:2g,2g:1d and 3g:2d mmrs exert a stabilizing influence and could contain a resonantplanet. furthermore, we show that the stable zone may in fact contain 2-3additional planets, if they are ~50 earth masses each. finally, we show thatany planets exterior to planet d must reside beyond 10 au.

astro-ph;0404211	predicting planets in known extra-solar planetary systems ii: testing  for saturn-mass planets	recent results have shown that many of the known extrasolar planetary systemscontain regions which are stable for massless test particles. we examine thepossibility that saturn-mass planets exist in these systems, just below thedetection threshold, and attempt to predict likely orbital parameters for suchunseen planets. to do this, we insert a saturn-mass planet into the stableregions of these systems and integrate its orbit for 100 million years. weconduct 200-600 of these experiments to test parameter space in hd37124,hd38529, 55cnc, and hd74156. in hd37124 the global maximum of the survival rateof saturns in parameter space is at semimajor axis a = 1.03 au, eccentricitye=0.1. in hd38529, only 5% of saturns are unstable, and the region in which asaturn could survive is very broad, centered on 0.5&lt;a&lt;0.6, e&lt;0.2. in 55cnc wefind three maxima at (a,e) = (1.0 au, 0.02), (2.0 au, 0.08), and (3.0 au,0.17). in hd74156 we find a broad maximum with $a$ = 0.9-1.2 au, e&lt;=0.15.several of these maxima are located in the habitable zones of their parentstars and are therefore of astrobiological interest. we suggest the possibilitythat companions may lie in these locations of parameter space, and encouragefurther observational investigation of these systems.

astro-ph;0407620	the formation and habitability of terrestrial planets in the presence of  hot jupiters	`hot jupiters,' giant planets with orbits very close to their parent stars,are thought to form farther away and migrate inward via interactions with amassive gas disk. if a giant planet forms and migrates quickly, theplanetesimal population has time to re-generate in the lifetime of the disk andterrestrial planets may form (armitage 2003). we present results of simulationsof terrestrial planet formation in the presence of hot jupiters, broadlydefined as having orbital radii &lt;= 0.5 au. we show that terrestrial planetssimilar to those in the solar system can form around stars with hot jupiters,and can have water contents equal to or higher than the earth's. for smallorbital radii of hot jupiters (e.g. 0.15, 0.25 au) potentially habitableplanets can form, but for semi-major axes of 0.5 au or greater their formationis suppressed. we show that the presence of an outer giant planet such asjupiter does not enhance the water content of the terrestrial planets, butrather decreases their formation and water delivery timescales. we speculatethat asteroid belts may exist interior to the terrestrial planets in systemswith hot jupiters.

astro-ph;0507004	terrestrial planet formation in disks with varying surface density  profiles	the ``minimum-mass solar nebula'' (mmsn) model estimates the surface densitydistribution of the protoplanetary disk by assuming the planets to have formedin situ. however, significant radial migration of the giant planets likelyoccurred in the solar system, implying a distortion in the values derived bythe mmsn method. the true density profiles of protoplanetary disks is thereforeuncertain. here we present results of simulations of late-stage terrestrialaccretion, each starting from a disk of planetary embryos. we assume apower-law surface density profile that varies with heliocentric distance r asr^-alpha, and vary alpha between 1/2 and 5/2 (alpha = 3/2 for the mmsn model).we find that for steeper profiles (higher values of alpha), the terrestrialplanets (i) are more numerous, (ii) form more quickly, (iii) form closer to thestar, (iv) are more massive, (v) have higher iron contents, and (vi) have lowerwater contents. however, the possibility of forming potentially habitableplanets does not appear to vary strongly with alpha.

astro-ph;0510284	high-resolution simulations of the final assembly of earth-like planets  1: terrestrial accretion and dynamics	the final stage in the formation of terrestrial planets consists of theaccumulation of ~1000-km ``planetary embryos'' and a swarm of billions of 1-10km ``planetesimals.'' during this process, water-rich material is accreted bythe terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies from beyond roughly2.5 au. we present results from five high-resolution dynamical simulations.these start from 1000-2000 embryos and planetesimals, roughly 5-10 times moreparticles than in previous simulations.  each simulation formed 2-4 terrestrial planets with masses between 0.4 and2.6 earth masses. the eccentricities of most planets were ~0.05, lower than inprevious simulations, but still higher than for venus, earth and mars. eachplanet accreted at least the earth's current water budget.  we demonstrate several new aspects of the accretion process: 1) the feedingzones of terrestrial planets change in time, widening and moving outward. evenin the presence of jupiter, water-rich material from beyond 2.5 au is notaccreted for several millions of years. 2) even in the absence of secularresonances, the asteroid belt is cleared of &gt;99% of its original mass byself-scattering of bodies into resonances with jupiter. 3) if planetary embryosform relatively slowly, following the models of kokubo &amp; ida, then theformation of embryos in the asteroid belt may have been stunted by the presenceof jupiter. 4) self-interacting planetesimals feel dynamical friction fromother small bodies, which has important effects on the eccentricity evolutionand outcome of a simulation.

astro-ph;0510285	high-resolution simulations of the final assembly of earth-like planets  2: water delivery and planetary habitability	the water content and habitability of terrestrial planets are determinedduring their final assembly, from perhaps a hundred 1000-km "planetary embryos"and a swarm of billions of 1-10 km "planetesimals." during this process, weassume that water-rich material is accreted by terrestrial planets via impactsof water-rich bodies that originate in the outer asteroid region. we presentanalysis of water delivery and planetary habitability in five high-resolutionsimulations containing about ten times more particles than in previoussimulations (raymond et al 2006a, icarus, 183, 265-282). these simulationsformed 15 terrestrial planets from 0.4 to 2.6 earth masses, including fiveplanets in the habitable zone. every planet from each simulation accreted atleast the earth's current water budget; most accreted several times that amount(assuming no impact depletion). each planet accreted at least five water-richembryos and planetesimals from past 2.5 au; most accreted 10-20 water-richbodies.  we present a new model for water delivery to terrestrial planets indynamically calm systems, with low-eccentricity or low-mass giant planets --such systems may be very common in the galaxy. we suggest that water isaccreted in comparable amounts from a few planetary embryos in a "hit or miss"way and from millions of planetesimals in a statistically robust process.variations in water content are likely to be caused by fluctuations in thenumber of water-rich embryos accreted, as well as from systematic effects suchas planetary mass and location, and giant planet properties.

astro-ph;0605136	the search for other earths: limits on the giant planet orbits that  allow habitable terrestrial planets to form	gas giant planets are far easier than terrestrial planets to detect aroundother stars, and are thought to form much more quickly than terrestrialplanets. thus, in systems with giant planets, the late stages of terrestrialplanet formation are strongly affected by the giant planets' dynamicalpresence. observations of giant planet orbits may therefore constrain thesystems that can harbor potentially habitable, earth-like planets. we presentresults of 460 n-body simulations of terrestrial accretion from a disk of moon-to mars-sized planetary embryos. we systematically vary the orbital semimajoraxis of a jupiter-mass giant planet between 1.6 and 6 au, and eccentricitybetween 0 and 0.4. we find that for sun-like stars, giant planets insideroughly 2.5 au inhibit the growth of 0.3 earth-mass planets in the habitablezone. if planets accrete water from volatile-rich embryos past 2-2.5 au, thenwater-rich habitable planets can only form in systems with giant planets beyond3.5 au. giant planets with significant orbital eccentricities inhibit bothaccretion and water delivery. the majority of the current sample of extra-solargiant planets appears unlikely to form habitable planets.

astro-ph;0701048	formation of earth-like planets during and after giant planet migration	close-in giant planets are thought to have formed in the cold outer regionsof planetary systems and migrated inward, passing through the orbital parameterspace occupied by the terrestrial planets in our own solar system. we presentdynamical simulations of the effects of a migrating giant planet on a disk ofprotoplanetary material and the subsequent evolution of the planetary system.we numerically investigate the dynamics of post-migration planetary systemsover 200 million years using models with a single migrating giant planet, onemigrating and one non-migrating giant planet, and excluding the effects of agas disk. material that is shepherded in front of the migrating giant planet bymoving mean motion resonances accretes into "hot earths", but survival of thesebodies is strongly dependent on dynamical damping. furthermore, a significantamount of material scattered outward by the giant planet survives in highlyexcited orbits; the orbits of these scattered bodies are then damped by gasdrag and dynamical friction over the remaining accretion time. in allsimulations earth-mass planets accrete on approximately 100 myr timescales,often with orbits in the habitable zone. these planets range in mass and watercontent, with both quantities increasing with the presence of a gas disk anddecreasing with the presence of an outer giant planet. we use scaling argumentsand previous results to derive a simple recipe that constrains which giantplanet systems are able to form and harbor earth-like planets in the habitablezone, demonstrating that roughly one third of the known planetary systems arepotentially habitable.

0809.3449	mean motion resonances from planet-planet scattering	planet-planet scattering is the leading mechanism to explain the largeeccentricities of the observed exoplanet population. however, scattering hasnot been considered important to the production of pairs of planets in meanmotion resonances (mmrs). we present results from a large number of numericalsimulations of dynamical instabilities in 3-planet systems. we show that mmrsarise naturally in about five percent of cases. the most common resonances wepopulate are the 2:1 and 3:1 mmrs, although a wide variety of mmrs can occur,including high-order mmrs (up to eleventh order). mmrs are generatedpreferentially in systems with uneven mass distributions: the smallest planetis typically ejected after a series of close encounters, leaving the remaining,more massive planets in resonance. the distribution of resonant planets isconsistent with the phase-space density of resonant orbits, meaning thatplanets are randomly thrown into mmrs rather than being slowly pulled intothem. it may be possible to distinguish between mmrs created by scattering vs.convergent migration in a gaseous disk by considering planetary mass ratios:resonant pairs of planets beyond ~1 au with more massive outer planets arelikely to have formed by scattering. in addition, scattering may be responsiblefor pairs of planets in high-order mmrs (3:1 and higher) that are not easilypopulated by migration. the frequency of mmrs from scattering is comparable tothe expected survival rate of mmrs in turbulent disks. thus, planet-planetscattering is likely to be a major contributor to the population of resonantplanets.
