0902.2582	modeling the chemical evolution of a collapsing prestellar core in two  spatial dimensions	the physical conditions in a collapsing cloud can be traced by observationsof molecular lines. to correctly interpret these observations the abundancedistributions of the observed species need to be derived. the chemistry in acollapsing molecular cloud is not in a steady state as the density andtemperature evolve. we therefore need to follow chemical reactions, both in thegas phase and on dust grains, as well as gas-grain interactions, to predict theabundance distributions. our aim is to model the abundances of molecules, inthe gas phase and on grain mantles in the form of ice, from prestellar corecollapse to disk formation. we use a 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation asa physical model from which we take the density, temperature, and the flow ofthe gas. trace particles, moving along with the gas, are used to follow thechemistry during prestellar core collapse and disk formation. the evolution ofthe abundances and the composition of ices on grain mantles were compared toobservations. we also investigated the initial abundances to be adopted in moredetailed modeling of protoplanetary disks by following the chemical evolutionof trace particles accreting onto the disk. fractional abundances of hco+,n2h+, h2co, hc3n, and ch3oh from our model with grain surface reactions providea good match to observations, while abundances of co, cs, so, hcn, and hnc showbetter agreement without grain surface reactions. the observed mantlecomposition of dust grains is best reproduced when we include surfacereactions. the initial chemical abundances to be used for detailed modeling ofa protoplanetary disk are found to be different from those in dark interstellarclouds. ices with a binding energy lower than about 1200 k sublimate beforeaccreting onto the disk, while those with a higher binding energy do not.

0902.4005	the nature of the class i population in ophiuchus as revealed through  gas and dust mapping	the ophiuchus clouds, in particular l~1688, are an excellent region to studythe embedded phases of star formation, due to the relatively large number ofprotostars. however, the standard method of finding and characterizing embeddedyoung stellar objects (ysos) through just their infrared spectral slope doesnot yield a reliable sample. this may affect the age determinations, oftenderived from the statistics on the total number of embedded ysos and pre-mainsequence stars within a cloud.our aim is to characterize the structure ofprotostellar envelopes on an individual basis and to correctly identify theembedded yso population of l1688. spectral maps of the hco+ j=4--3 and c18oj=3--2 lines using the harp-b array on the james clerk maxwell telescope andscuba 850 micron dust maps are obtained of all sources in the l1688 region withinfrared spectral slopes consistent with, or close to, that of embedded ysos.selected 350 micron maps obtained with the caltech submillimeter observatoryare presented as well. the properties, extent and variation of dense gas,column density and dust on scalesup to 1' are probed at 15" resolution. usingthe spatial variation of the gas and dust, together with the intensity of thehco+ j=4--3 line, we are able to accurately identify the truly embedded ysosand determine their properties. results the protostellar envelopes range from0.05 to 0.5 msun in mass. the concentration of hco+ emission (~0.5 to 0.9) isgenerally higher than that of the dust concentration. combined with absoluteintensities, hco+ proves to be a better tracer of protostellar envelopes thandust, which can contain disk and cloud contributions. our total sample of 45sources, including all previously classified class i sources, severalflat-spectrum sources and some known disks, was re-classified using the ....

0905.4575	the kinematics of ngc1333-iras2a - a true class 0 protostar	low-mass star formation is described by gravitational collapse of dense coresof gas and dust. at some point during the collapse, a disk is formed around theprotostar and the disk will spin up and grow in size as the core contractsbecause of angular momentum conservation. the question is how early the diskformation process occurs. in this paper we aim to characterize the kinematicalstate of a deeply embedded, class 0 young stellar object, ngc1333-iras2a, basedon high angular resolution (&lt; 1$''$ $\approx$ 200 au) interferometricobservations of hcn and h$^{13}$cn j = 4-3 from the submillimeter array, andtest whether a circumstellar disk can be detected based on gas kinematicfeatures. we adopt a physical model which has been shown to describe the objectwell and obtain a fit of a parameterized model of the velocity field, using atwo-dimensional axis-symmetric radiation transfer code. the parameterizationand fit to the high angular resolution data characterize the central dynamicalmass and the ratio of infall velocity to rotation velocity. we find a largeamount of infall and very little rotation on all scales. the central object hasa relatively low mass of 0.25 m$_\odot$ . as an object with a low stellar masscompared to the envelope mass, we conclude that ngc1333-iras2a is consistentwith the suggestion that, as a class 0 object, it represents the earlieststages of star formation. the large amount of infall relative to rotation alsosuggests that this is a young object. we do however find the need of a centralcompact component on scales of a few hundred au based on the continuum data,which suggests that disk formation happens shortly after the initialgravitational collapse. the data do not reveal a distinct velocity field forthis 0.1 m$_\odot$ component.

0908.3446	apex-champ+ high-j co observations of low-mass young stellar objects:  ii. distribution and origin of warm molecular gas	the origin and heating mechanisms of warm (50&lt;t&lt;200 k) molecular gas inlow-mass young stellar objects (ysos) are strongly debated. both passiveheating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as wellas active heating by shocks and by uv associated with the outflows or accretionhave been proposed. we aim to characterize the warm gas within protostellerobjects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolaroutflows and the quiescent cloud. high-j co maps (12co j=6--5 and 7--6) of theimmediate surroundings (up to 10,000 au) of eight low-mass ysos are obtainedwith the champ+ 650/850 ghz array receiver mounted on the apex telescope. inaddition, isotopologue observations of the 13co j=6--5 transition and [c i]3p_2-3p_1 line were taken. strong quiescent narrow-line 12co 6--5 and 7--6emission is seen toward all protostars. in the case of hh~46 and ced 110 irs 4,the on-source emission originates in material heated by uv photons scattered inthe outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. warmquiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by uv photons fromshocks. shock-heated warm gas is only detected for class 0 flows and the moremassive class i sources such as hh~46. outflow temperatures, estimated from theco 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 k, close to model predictions, with theexception of the l~1551 irs 5 and iras 12496-7650, for which temperatures &lt;50 kare found. apex-champ+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar'sfeedback on its accreting envelope gas in terms of heating, photodissociation,and outflow dispersal by mapping 1'x1' regions in high-j co and [c i] lines.

0910.1034	dense and warm molecular gas in the envelopes and outflows of southern  low-mass protostars	observations of dense molecular gas lie at the basis of our understanding ofthe density and temperature structure of protostellar envelopes and molecularoutflows. we aim to characterize the properties of the protostellar envelope,molecular outflow and surrounding cloud, through observations of highexcitation molecular lines within a sample of 16 southern sources presumed tobe embedded ysos. observations of submillimeter lines of co, hco+ and theirisotopologues, both single spectra and small maps were taken with the flash andapex-2a instruments mounted on apex to trace the gas around the sources. theharp-b instrument on the jcmt was used to map iras 15398-3359 in these lines.hco+ mapping probes the presence of dense centrally condensed gas, acharacteristic of protostellar envelopes. the rare isotopologues c18o andh13co+ are also included to determine the optical depth, column density, andsource velocity. the combination of multiple co transitions, such as 3-2, 4-3and 7-6, allows to constrain outflow properties, in particular the temperature.archival submillimeter continuum data are used to determine envelope masses.eleven of the sixteen sources have associated warm and/or dense quiescent ascharacteristic of protostellar envelopes, or an associated outflow. using thestrength and degree of concentration of the hco+ 4-3 and co 4-3 lines as adiagnostic, five sources classified as class i based on their spectral energydistributions are found not to be embedded ysos. the c18o 3-2 lines show thatfor none of the sources, foreground cloud layers are present. strong molecularoutflows are found around six sources, ..

1002.2020	the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt: a first look at taurus with  harp	as part of a jcmt legacy survey of star formation in the gould belt, wepresent early science results for taurus. co j=3-2 maps have been secured alongthe north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as l 1495, along with deep13co and c18o j=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. with these data we search formolecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, hh objects and shockedh2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across thisextensive region. in total 21 outflows are identified. it is clear that thebowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of t tauristars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. by comparison, theridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostarswhich, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. weestimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in l 1495to be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. if we take previousestimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates aprestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. from the number of outflows we alsocrudely estimate the star formation efficiency in l 1495, finding it to becompatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. we note that molecularoutflow-driving sources have redder near-ir colours than their hh jet-drivingcounterparts. we also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated withthe more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flowincreases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.

1004.2217	methanol maps of low-mass protostellar systems: the serpens molecular  core	observations of serpens have been performed at the jcmt using harp-b. mapsover a 4.5'x5.4' region were made in a frequency window around 338 ghz,covering the 7-6 transitions of methanol. emission is extended over eachsource, following the column density of h2 but showing up also particularlystrongly around outflows. the rotational temperature is low, 15-20 k, and doesnot vary with position within each source. the abundance is typically 10^-9 -10^-8 with respect to h2 in the outer envelope, whereas "jumps" by factors ofup to 10^2 -10^3 inside the region where the dust temperature exceeds 100 k arenot excluded. a factor of up to ~ 10^3 enhancement is seen in outflow gas. inone object, smm4, the ice abundance has been measured to be ~ 3x10^-5 withrespect to h2 in the outer envelope, i.e., a factor of 10^3 larger than thegas-phase abundance. comparison with c18o j=3-2 emission shows that strong codepletion leads to a high gas-phase abundance of ch3oh not just for the serpenssources, but for a larger sample of protostars. the observations illustrate thelarge-scale, low-level desorption of ch3oh from dust grains, extending out toand beyond 7500 au from each source, a scenario which is consistent withnon-thermal (photo-)desorption from the ice. the observations also illustratethe usefulness of ch3oh as a tracer of energetic input in the form of outflows,where methanol is sputtered from the grain surfaces. finally, the observationsprovide further evidence of ch3oh formation through co hydrogenation proceedingon grain surfaces in low-mass envelopes.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1007.3408	herschel-hifi detections of hydrides towards afgl 2591 (envelope  emission versus tenuous cloud absorption)	the heterodyne instrument for the far infrared (hifi) onboard the herschelspace observatory allows the first observations of light diatomic molecules athigh spectral resolution and in multiple transitions. here, we report deepintegrations using hifi in different lines of hydrides towards the high-massstar forming region afgl 2591. detected are ch, ch+, nh, oh+, h2o+, while nh+and sh+ have not been detected. all molecules except for ch and ch+ are seen inabsorption with low excitation temperatures and at velocities different fromthe systemic velocity of the protostellar envelope. surprisingly, the ch(jf,p =3/2_2,- - 1/2_1,+) and ch+(j = 1 - 0, j = 2 - 1) lines are detected in emissionat the systemic velocity. we can assign the absorption features to a foregroundcloud and an outflow lobe, while the ch and ch+ emission stems from theenvelope. the observed abundance and excitation of ch and ch+ can be explainedin the scenario of fuv irradiated outflow walls, where a cavity etched out bythe outflow allows protostellar fuv photons to irradiate and heat the envelopeat larger distances driving the chemical reactions that produce thesemolecules.

1007.3986	water in massive star-forming regions: hifi observations of w3 irs5	we present herschel observations of the water molecule in the massivestar-forming region w3 irs5. the o-h17o 110-101, p-h18o 111-000, p-h2o 22202-111, p-h2o 111-000, o-h2o 221-212, and o-h2o 212-101 lines, covering afrequency range from 552 up to 1669 ghz, have been detected at high spectralresolution with hifi. the water lines in w3 irs5 show well-definedhigh-velocity wings that indicate a clear contribution by outflows. moreover,the systematically blue-shifted absorption in the h2o lines suggests expansion,presumably driven by the outflow. no infall signatures are detected. the p-h2o111-000 and o-h2o 212-101 lines show absorption from the cold material (t ~ 10k) in which the high-mass protostellar envelope is embedded. one-dimensionalradiative transfer models are used to estimate water abundances and to furtherstudy the kinematics of the region. we show that the emission in the rareisotopologues comes directly from the inner parts of the envelope (t &gt; 100 k)where water ices in the dust mantles evaporate and the gas-phase abundanceincreases. the resulting jump in the water abundance (with a constant innerabundance of 10^{-4}) is needed to reproduce the o-h17o 110-101 and p-h18o111-000 spectra in our models. we estimate water abundances of 10^{-8} to10^{-9} in the outer parts of the envelope (t &lt; 100 k). the possibility of twoprotostellar objects contributing to the emission is discussed.

1008.0981	recurring millimeter flares as evidence for star-star magnetic  reconnection events in the dq tauri pms binary system	observations of the t tauri spectroscopic binary dq tau in april 2008captured an unusual flare at 3 mm, which peaked at an observed max flux of 0.5jy (about 27x the quiescent value). here we present follow-up mm observationsthat demonstrate a periodicity to the phenomenon. while monitoring 3 newperiastron encounters, we detect flares within 17.5 hrs (or 4.6%) of theorbital phase of the first reported flare, and we constrain the main emittingregion to a stellar height of 3.7-6.8 rstar. the recorded activity isconsistent with the proposed picture for synchrotron emission initiated by amagnetic reconnection event when the two stellar magnetospheres of the highlyeccentric (e=0.556) binary are believed to collide near periastron as the starsapproach a minimum separation of 8 rstar (~13 rsolar). the similar light curvedecay profiles allow us to estimate an average flare duration of 30 hrs.assuming one mm flare per orbit, dq tau could spend approximately 8% of its15.8-d orbital period in an elevated flux state. our analysis of the mmemission provides an upper limit of 5% on the linear polarization. we discussthe extent to which a severely entangled magnetic field structure and faradayrotation effects are likely to reduce the observed polarization fraction. wealso predict that, for the current picture, the stellar magnetospheres must bemisaligned at a significant angle or, alternatively, that the topologies of theouter magnetospheres are poorly described by a well-ordered dipole inside aradius of 7 rstar. finally, to investigate whether reorganization of themagnetic field during the interaction affects mass accretion, we also presentsimultaneous optical (vri) monitoring, as an established tracer of accretionactivity in this system. we find that an accretion event can occur coincidentin both time and duration with the synchrotron fallout of a magneticreconnection event.

1008.1492	lime - a flexible, non-lte line excitation and radiation transfer method  for millimeter and far-infrared wavelengths	we present a new code for solving the molecular and atomic excitation andradiation transfer problem in a molecular gas and predicting emergent spectra.this code works in arbitrary three dimensional geometry using unstructureddelaunay latices for the transport of photons. various physical models can beused as input, ranging from analytical descriptions over tabulated models tosph simulations. to generate the delaunay grid we sample the input modelrandomly, but weigh the sample probability with the molecular density and otherparameters, and thereby we obtain an average grid point separation that scaleswith the local opacity. our code does photon very efficiently so that the slowconvergence of opaque models becomes traceable. when convergence between thelevel populations, the radiation field, and the point separation has beenobtained, the grid is ray-traced to produced images that can readily becompared to observations. because of the high dynamic range in scales that canbe resolved using this type of grid, our code is particularly well suited formodeling of alma data. our code can furthermore deal with overlapping lines ofmultiple molecular and atomic species.

1012.3936	hunting for millimeter flares from magnetic reconnection in pre-main  sequence spectroscopic binaries	recent observations of the low-mass pre-main sequence, eccentricspectroscopic binaries dq tau and v773 tau a reveal that their millimeterspectrum is occasionally dominated by flares from non-thermal emissionprocesses. the transient activity is believed to be synchrotron in nature,resulting from powerful magnetic reconnection events when the separate magneticstructures of the binary components are capable of interacting and forced toreorganize, typically near periastron. we conducted the first systematic studyof the millimeter variability toward a sample of 12 pms spectroscopic binarieswith the aim to characterize the proliferation of flares amongst sources likelyto experience similar interbinary reconnection events. the source sampleconsists of short-period, close-separation binaries that possess either a highorbital eccentricity or a circular orbit. using the mambo2 array on the iram30m telescope, we carried out continuous monitoring at 1.25 mm over a 4-nightperiod during which all of the high-eccentricity binaries approachedperiastron. we also obtained simultaneous optical vri measurements, since astrong link is often observed between stellar reconnection events and opticalbrightenings. uz tau e is the only source to be detected at millimeterwavelengths: it exhibited significant variation; it is also the only source toundergo strong simultaneous optical variability. the binary possesses thelargest orbital eccentricity in the current sample, a predicted factor instar-star magnetic interaction events. with orbital parameters and variableaccretion activity similar to dq tau, the millimeter behavior of uz tau e drawsmany parallels to the dq tau model for colliding magnetospheres. however, onthe basis of our observations alone, we cannot determine whether thevariability is repetitive, or if it could also be due to variable free-freeemission in an ionized wind.

1204.0009	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish): ii. evolution of 557  ghz 110-101 emission in low-mass protostars	(abridged) water is a key tracer of dynamics and chemistry in low-massprotostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited insensitivity and angular resolution. in this first systematic survey ofspectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, h2o wasobserved in the ground-state transition at 557 ghz with hifi on herschel in 29embedded class 0 and i protostars. complementary far-ir and sub-mm continuumdata (including pacs data from our program) are used to constrain the spectralenergy distribution of each source. h2o intensities are compared to inferredenvelope and outflow properties and co 3-2 emission. h2o emission is detectedin all objects except one. the line profiles are complex and consist of severalkinematic components. the profiles are typically dominated by a broad gaussianemission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises inoutflows, not the quiescent envelope. several sources show multiple shockcomponents in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internalgeometry of the system. furthermore, the components include inverse p-cygniprofiles in 7 sources (6 class 0, 1 class i) indicative of infalling envelopes,and regular p-cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 class i, 1 class 0) indicative ofexpanding envelopes. "bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1204.4367	kinematics of the inner thousand au region around the young massive star  afgl 2591-vla3: a massive disk candidate?	[context] recent detections of disks around young high-mass stars support theidea of massive star formation through accretion rather than coalescence, butthe detailed kinematics in the equatorial region of the disk candidates is notwell known, which limits our understanding of the accretion process. [aims]this paper explores the kinematics of the gas around a young massive star withmillimeter-wave interferometry to improve our understanding of the formation ofmassive stars though accretion. [methods] we use plateau de bureinterferometric images to probe the environment of the nearby (~1 kpc) andluminous (~20000 lsun) high-mass (10-16 msun) young star afgl 2591-vla3 incontinuum and in lines of hdo, h218o and so2 in the 115 and 230 ghz bands.radiative transfer calculations are employed to investigate the kinematics ofthe source. [results] at ~0.5" (500 au) resolution, the line images clearlyresolve the velocity field of the central compact source (diameter of ~ 800 au)and show linear velocity gradients in the northeast-southwest direction.judging from the disk-outflow geometry, the observed velocity gradient resultsfrom rotation and radial expansion in the equatorial region of vla3. radiativetransfer calculations suggest that the velocity field is consistent withsub-keplerian rotation plus hubble-law like expansion. the line profiles of theobserved molecules suggest a layered structure, with hdo emission arising fromthe disk mid-plane, h218o from the warm mid-layer, and so2 from the upper disk.[conclusions] we propose afgl 2591-vla3 as a new massive disk candidate, withpeculiar kinematics. the rotation of this disk is sub-keplerian, probably dueto magnetic braking, while the stellar wind may be responsible for theexpansion of the disk. the expansion motion [...]

1204.5037	herschel images of fomalhaut. an extrasolar kuiper belt at the height of  its dynamical activity	fomalhaut is a young, nearby star that is suspected to harbor an infantplanetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris. wepresent far-infrared images obtained with the herschel space observatory withan angular resolution between 5.7 and 36.7 arcsec at wavelengths between 70 and500 micrometer. the images show the main debris belt in great detail. even athigh spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. the region in between thebelt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission isobserved here as well. also at the location of the star, excess emission isdetected.  we use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive theparameters of the debris disk. we include detailed models of the interaction ofthe dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and thetemperature determination. comparing these models to the spatially resolvedtemperature information contained in the images allows us to place strongconstraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system byradiation pressure. we use this to derive the dynamical parameters of thesystem.  the appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in whichdust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in anarrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. dust particleswith sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. the equivalent of2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoiramounting to 110 earth masses. from comparison of their scattering and thermalproperties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, whichindicates a cometary origin. the excess emission at the location of the starmay be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be dueto gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind.

[oi] and some of the oh emission probe dissociative shocks in theinner envelope. the total far-infrared cooling is dominated by h2o and co, with[oi] increasing for class i sources.

1304.5436	alma detection of the rotating molecular disk wind from the young star  hd 163296	disk winds have been postulated as a mechanism for angular momentum releasein protostellar systems for decades. hd 163296 is a herbig ae star surroundedby a disk and has been shown to host a series of hh knots (hh 409) with bowshocks associated with the farthest knots. here we present alma scienceverification data of co j=2-1 and j=3-2 emission which are spatially coincidentwith the blue shifted jet of hh knots, and offset from the disk by -18.6 km/s.the emission has a double corkscrew morphology and extends more than 10" fromthe disk with embedded emission clumps coincident with jet knots. we interpretthis double corkscrew as emission from material in a molecular disk wind, andthat the compact emission near the jet knots is being heated by the jet whichis moving at much higher velocities. we show that the j=3-2 emission is likelyheavily filtered by the interferometer, but the j=2-1 emission suffers less dueto the larger beam and measurable angular scales. excitation analysis suggeststemperatures exceeding 900 k in these compact features, with the wind mass,momentum and energy being of order 10^{-5} m_sun, 10^{-4} m_sun km/s and10^{40} erg respectively. the high mass loss rate suggests that this star isdispersing the disk faster than it is funneling mass onto the star.

1308.5119	waterfalls around protostars: infall motions towards class 0/i envelopes  as probed by water	abridged abstract: for stars to form, material must fall inwards from corescales through the envelope towards the central protostar. the velocity profilearound protostars is poorly constrained. 6 class 0 protostars and one class iprotostars observed with hifi on board herschel as part of the "water instar-forming regions with herschel" (wish) survey show infall signatures inwater line observations. we use 1-d non-lte ratran radiative transfer models ofthe observed water lines to constrain the infall velocity and chemistry in theprotostellar envelopes of these sources. we assume a free-fall velocity profileand, having found the best fit, vary the radii over which infall takes place.in the well-studied class 0 protostar ngc1333-iras4a we find that infall takesplace over the whole envelope to which our observations are sensitive (r&gt;~1000au). for 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.~10000-3000 au). in 2 sources the inverse p-cygni profiles seen in theground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foregroundclouds. models including a simple consideration of the chemistry are consistentwith the observations, while using step abundance profiles are not. thenon-detection of excited water in the inner envelope in 6/7 protostars isfurther evidence that water must be heavily depleted from the gas-phase atthese radii. infall in four of the sources is supersonic and infall in allsources must take place at the outer edge of the envelope, which may beevidence that collapse is global or outside-in rather than inside-out. the massinfall rate in iras4a is large (&gt;~10^-4 msol\yr), higher than the mass outflowrate and expected mass accretion rates onto the star, suggesting that anyflattened disk-like structure on small scales will be gravitationally unstable,potentially leading to rotational fragmentation and/or episodic accretion.

1308.5151	dense molecular cocoons in the massive protocluster w3 irs5: a test case  for models of massive star formation	[context] two competing models describe the formation of massive stars inobjects like the orion trapezium. in the turbulent core accretion model, theresulting stellar masses are directly related to the mass distribution of thecloud condensations. in the competitive accretion model, the gravitationalpotential of the protocluster captures gas from the surrounding cloud for whichthe individual cluster members compete. [aims] with high resolutionsubmillimeter observations of the structure, kinematics, and chemistry of theproto-trapezium cluster w3 irs5, we aim to determine which mode of starformation dominates. [methods] we present 354 ghz submillimeter arrayobservations at resolutions of 1"-3" (1800-5400 au) of w3 irs5. ......[results] the observations show five emission peaks (smm1-5). smm1 and smm2contain massive embedded stars (~20 msun); smm3-5 are starless or containlow-mass stars (&lt;8 msun). the inferred densities are high, &gt;= 10^7 cm^-3, butthe core masses are small, 0.2-0.6 msun. the detected molecular emissionreveals four different chemical zones. ...... [conclusions] the proto-trapeziumcluster w3 irs5 is an ideal test case to discriminate between models of massivestar formation. either the massive stars accrete locally from their localcores; in this case the small core masses imply that w3 irs5 is at the very endstages (1000 yr) of infall and accretion, or the stars are accreting from theglobal collapse of a massive, cluster forming core. we find that the observedmasses, densities and line widths observed toward w3 irs 5 and the surroundingcluster forming core are consistent with the competitive accretion of gas atrates of macc~10^-4 msun yr^-1 by the massive young forming stars. ......

0801.4139	characterizing the nature of embedded young stellar objects through  silicate, ice and millimeter observations	(abridged) classification schemes for ysos are based on evaluating the degreeof dissipation of the surrounding envelope, whose main effects are theextinction of the optical radiation from the central yso and re-emission in thefar-infrared. since extinction is a property of column density along the lineof sight, the presence of a protoplanetary disk may lead to a misclassificationwhen the system is viewed edge-on.  we performed radiative transfer calculations, using the axysimmetric 3dradiative transfer codes radmc and radical, to show the effects of differentgeometries on the main indicators of yso evolutionary stage, like the slope ofthe flux between 2 and 24mum, the bolometric temperature and the optical depthof silicates and ices.  we show that for systems viewed at intermediate angles the 'classical'indicators of evolution accurately trace the envelope column density, and theyall agree with each other. on the other hand, edge-on system are misclassifiedfor inclinations larger than ~65deg. in particular, silicate emission, typicalof pre-main sequence stars with disks, turns into absorption when the diskcolumn density reaches 1e22cm-2, corresponding e.g. to a 5e-3 msun flaring diskviewed at 64deg. a similar effect is noticed in all the other classificationindicators studied alpha, tbol, and the h2o and co2 ices absorption strengths.this misclassification has a big impact on the nature of the flat-spectrumsources (alpha ~0), whose number can be explained by simple geometricalarguments without invoking evolution. a reliable classification scheme using aminimal number of observations is constituted by observations of the mm-fluxwith both a single dish and an interferometer.

0801.4763	gas and dust emission at the outer edge of protoplanetary disks	we investigate the apparent discrepancy between gas and dust outer radiiderived from millimeter observations of protoplanetary disks. using 230 and 345ghz continuum and co j=3-2 data from the submillimeter array for four nearbydisk systems (hd 163296, tw hydrae, gm aurigae, and mwc 480), we examine modelsof circumstellar disk structure and the effects of their treatment of the outerdisk edge. we show that for these disks, models described by power laws insurface density and temperature that are truncated at an outer radius areincapable of reproducing both the gas and dust emission simultaneously: theouter radius derived from the dust continuum emission is always significantlysmaller than the extent of the molecular gas disk traced by co emission.however, a simple model motivated by similarity solutions of the time evolutionof accretion disks that includes a tapered exponential edge in the surfacedensity distribution (and the same number of free parameters) does much betterat reproducing both the gas and dust emission. while this analysis does notrule out the disparate radii implied by the truncated power-law models, arealistic alternative disk model, grounded in the physics of accretion,provides a consistent picture for the extent of both the gas and dust.

1409.5704	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish) v. the physical  conditions in low-mass protostellar outflows revealed by multi-transition  water observations	context: outflows are an important part of the star formation process as boththe result of ongoing active accretion and one of the main sources ofmechanical feedback on small scales. water is the ideal tracer of these effectsbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.method: we present \textit{herschel} hifi spectra of multiple water-transitionstowards 29 nearby class 0/i protostars as part of the wish survey. these aredecomposed into different gaussian components, with each related to one ofthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock andspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. we then constrain theexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. results:water emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios thatdo not vary with velocity, in contrast to co. the physical conditions of thecavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock h$_{2}$ densities of order10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and h$_{2}$o column densities of order10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$. h$_{2}$o emission originates in compactemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources withradii of order 10-200\,au, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thinlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\,au.conclusions: water emission at the source position traces two distinctkinematic components in the outflow; j shocks at the base of the outflow or inthe jet, and c shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. class i sources havesimilar excitation conditions to class 0 sources, but generally smallerline-widths and emitting region sizes. we suggest that it is the velocity ofthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density ormass, that is the cause of the decrease in h$_{2}$o intensity between class 0and i.

0805.0772	modeling water emission from low-mass protostellar envelopes	within low-mass star formation, water vapor plays a key role in the chemistryand energy balance of the circumstellar material. the herschel spaceobservatory will open up the possibility to observe water lines originatingfrom a wide range of excitation energies.our aim is to simulate the emission ofrotational water lines from envelopes characteristic of embedded low-massprotostars. a large number of parameters that influence the water line emissionare explored: luminosity, density,density slope and water abundances.both dustand water emission are modelled using full radiative transfer in sphericalsymmetry. the temperature profile is calculated for a given density profile.the h2o level populations and emission profiles are in turn computed with anon-lte line code. the results are analyzed to determine the diagnostic valueof different lines, and are compared with existing observations. lines can becategorized in: (i) optically thick lines, including ground-state lines, mostlysensitive to the cold outer part; (ii) highly excited (e_u&gt;200-250 k) opticallythin lines sensitive to the abundance in the hot inner part; and (iii) lineswhich vary from optically thick to thin depending on the abundances. dustinfluences the emission of water significantly by becoming optically thick atthe higher frequencies, and by pumping optically thin lines. a good physicalmodel of a source, including a correct treatment of dust, is a prerequisite toinfer the water abundance structure and possible jumps at the evaporationtemperature from observations. the inner warm (t&gt;100 k) envelope can be probedbyhighly-excited lines, while a combination of excited and spectrally resolvedground state lines probes the outer envelope. observations of h218o lines,although weak, provide even stronger constraints on abundances.

0807.1049	characterizing the velocity field in hydrodynamical simulations of  low-mass star formation using spectral line profiles	when low-mass stars form, the collapsing cloud of gas and dust goes throughseveral stages which are usually characterized by the shape of their spectralenergy distributions. such classification is based on the cloud morphology onlyand does not address the dynamical state of the object. in this paper weinvestigate the initial cloud collapse and subsequent disk formation throughthe dynamical behavior as reflected in the sub-millimeter spectral emissionline profiles. if a young stellar object is to be characterized by itsdynamical structure it is important to know how accurately information aboutthe velocity field can be extracted and which observables provide the bestdescription of the kinematics. of particular interest is the transition frominfalling envelope to rotating disk, because this provides the initialconditions for the protoplanetary disk, such as mass and size. we use ahydrodynamical model, describing the collapse of a core and formation of adisk, to produce synthetic observables which we compare to calculated lineprofiles of a simple parameterized model. because we know the velocity fieldfrom the hydrodynamical simulation we can determine in a quantitative way howwell our best-fit parameterized velocity field reproduces the original. we usea molecular line excitation and radiation transfer code to produce spectra ofboth our hydro dynamical simulation as well as our parameterized model. we findthat information about the velocity field can reasonably well be derived byfitting a simple model to either single-dish lines or interferometric data, butpreferentially by using a combination of the two. our result shows that it ispossible to establish relative ages of a sample of young stellar objects usingthis method, independently of the details of the hydrodynamical model.

0807.1057	time-dependent co depletion during the formation of protoplanetary disks	understanding the gas abundance distribution is essential when tracing starformation using molecular line observations. changing density and temperatureconditions cause gas to freeze-out onto dust grains, and this needs to be takeninto account when modeling a collapsing molecular cloud. this study aims toprovide a realistic estimate of the co abundance distribution throughout thecollapse of a molecular cloud. we provide abundance profiles and syntheticspectral lines which can be compared to observations. we use a 2dhydrodynamical simulation of a collapsing cloud and subsequent formation of aprotoplanetary disk as input for the chemical calculations. from the resultingabundances, synthetic spectra are calculated using a molecular excitation andradiation transfer code. we compare three different methods to calculate theabundance of co. our models also consider cosmic ray desorption and the effectsof an increased co binding energy. the resulting abundance profiles arecompared to observations from the literature and are found to agree well. theresulting abundance profiles agree well with analytic approximations, and thecorresponding line fluxes match observational data. our developed method tocalculate abundances in hydrodynamical simulations should greatly aid incomparing these to observations, and can easily be generalized to includegas-phase reaction networks.

astro-ph;0310110	the structure of the ngc1333-iras2 protostellar system on 500 au scales:  an infalling envelope, a circumstellar disk, multiple outflows, and chemistry	this paper investigates small-scale structures of dense gas and dust aroundthe low-mass protostellar binary ngc1333-iras2 using millimeter-wavelengthaperture-synthesis observations from the ovro and bima interferometers. thedetected 3 mm continuum emission is consistent with models of the envelopearound iras2a, based on previously reported submillimeter continuum images,down to the 3", or 500 au, resolution of the interferometer data. our dataconstrain the contribution of an unresolved point source to 22 mjy. within theaccuracy of the parameters describing the envelope model, the point source fluxhas an uncertainty by up to 25%. we interpret this point source as a cold diskof mass \gtrsim 0.3 m_\odot. the same envelope model also reproducesaperture-synthesis line observations of the optically thin isotopic speciesc34s and h13co+. the more optically thick main isotope lines show a variety ofcomponents in the protostellar environment: n2h+ is closely correlated withdust concentrations as seen at submillimeter wavelengths and is particularlystrong toward the starless core iras2c. we hypothesize that n2h+ is destroyedthrough reactions with co that is released from icy grains near theprotostellar sources iras2a and b. cs, hco+, and hcn have complex line shapesapparently affected by both outflow and infall. in addition to the east-westjet from iras2a, a north-south velocity gradient near this source indicates asecond, perpendicular outflow. this suggests the presence of a binary companionwithin 0.3" (65 au) from iras2a as driving source of this outflow. alternativeexplanations of the velocity gradient such as rotation in a circumstellarenvelope or a single, wide-angle outflow are less likely.

astro-ph;0311132	the impact of shocks on the chemistry of molecular clouds: high  resolution images of chemical differentiation along the ngc1333-iras2a  outflow	this paper presents a detailed study of the chemistry in the outflowassociated with the low-mass protostar ngc1333-iras2a down to 3" (650 au)scales. millimeter-wavelength aperture-synthesis observations from the ovro andbima interferometers and (sub)millimeter single-dish observations from theonsala 20m telescope and cso are presented. the interaction of the highlycollimated protostellar outflow with a molecular condensation ~15000 au fromthe central protostar is clearly traced by molecular species such as hcn, sio,so, cs, and ch3oh. especially sio traces a narrow high velocity component atthe interface between the outflow and the molecular condensation.multi-transition single-dish observations are used to distinguish the chemistryof the shock from that of the molecular condensation and to address thephysical conditions therein. statistical equilibrium calculations revealtemperatures of 20 and 70 k for the quiescent and shocked components,respectively, and densities near 10^6 cm^{-3}. significant abundanceenhancements of two to four orders of magnitude are found in the shocked regionfor molecules such as ch3oh, sio and the sulfur-bearing molecules. hco+ is seenonly in the aftermath of the shock consistent with models where it is destroyedthrough release of h2o from grain mantles in the shock. n2h+ shows narrowlines, not affected by the outflow but rather probing the ambient cloud.differences in abundances of hcn, h2co and cs are seen between differentoutflow regions and are suggested to be related to differences in the atomiccarbon abundance. compared to the warm inner parts of protostellar envelopes,higher abundances of in particular ch3oh and sio are found in the outflows,which may be related to density differences between the regions.

astro-ph;0511786	hot organic molecules toward a young low-mass star: a look at inner disk  chemistry	spitzer space telescope spectra of the low mass young stellar object (yso)irs 46 (l_bol ~ 0.6 l_sun) in ophiuchus reveal strong vibration-rotationabsorption bands of gaseous c2h2, hcn, and co2. this is the only source out ofa sample of ~100 yso's that shows these features and the first time they areseen in the spectrum of a solar-mass yso. analysis of the spitzer data combinedwith keck l- and m-band spectra gives excitation temperatures of &gt; 350 k andabundances of 10(-6)-10(-5) with respect to h2, orders of magnitude higher thanthose found in cold clouds. in spite of this high abundance, the hcn j=4-3 lineis barely detected with the james clerk maxwell telescope, indicating a sourcediameter less than 13 au. the (sub)millimeter continuum emission and theabsence of scattered light in near-infrared images limits the mass andtemperature of any remnant collapse envelope to less than 0.01 m_sun and 100 k,respectively. this excludes a hot-core type region as found in high-mass yso's.the most plausible origin of this hot gas rich in organic molecules is in theinner (&lt;6 au radius) region of the disk around irs 46, either the disk itselfor a disk wind. a nearly edge-on 2-d disk model fits the spectral energydistribution (sed) and gives a column of dense warm gas along the line of sightthat is consistent with the absorption data. these data illustrate the uniquepotential of high-resolution infrared spectroscopy to probe organic chemistry,gas temperatures and kinematics in the planet-forming zones close to a youngstar.

astro-ph;0605509	warm molecular gas in the outflow and envelope of iras 12496-7650 (dk  cha)	aims:to obtain insight into the physical structure of the warm gas in theinner envelope of protostars and the interaction with the outflow. methods:sub-millimeter observations of 12co, 13co and/or c18o in j=3-2, j=4-3 and j=7-6were obtained with the apex telescope towards iras 12496-7650, an intermediatemass young stellar object. the data are compared to iso-lws observations of coj=14-13 up to j=19-18 lines to test the different proposed origins of the colines. results: the outflow is prominently detected in the 3-2 and 4-3 lines,but not seen at similar velocities in the 7-6 line, constraining thetemperature in the high-velocity (&gt; 5 km/s from line center) gas to less than50 k, much lower than inferred from the analysis of the iso-lws data. inaddition, no isothermal gas model can reproduce the emission in both the 7-6and the higher-j iso-lws lines.the 7-6 line probably originates in the inner(&lt;250 au) region of the envelope at ~150 k. detailed radiative transfercalculations suggest that the iso-lws lines are excited by a differentmechanism, possibly related to the larger-scale outflow. all possiblemechanisms on scales smaller than 8 " are excluded. high-resolution continuumas well as high-j 12co and isotopic line mapping are needed to better constrainthe structure of the warm gas in the inner envelope and the interaction withthe outflow.

astro-ph;0609590	the rotating molecular core and precessing outflow of the young stellar  object barnard 1c	we investigate the structure of the core surrounding the recently identifieddeeply embedded young stellar object barnard 1c which has an unusualpolarization pattern as traced in submillimeter dust emission. barnard 1c lieswithin the perseus molecular cloud at a distance of 250 pc. it is a deeplyembedded core of 2.4 solar masses (kirk et al.) and a luminosity of 4 +/- 2solar luminosities. observations of co, 13co, c18o, hco+ and n2h+ were obtainedwith the bima array, together with the continuum at 3.3 mm and 2.7 mm.single-dish measurements of n2h+ and hco+ with fcrao reveal the larger scaleemission in these lines, the co and hco+ emission traces the outflow, whichcoincides in detail with the s-shaped jet recently found in spitzer iracimaging. the n2h+ emission, which anticorrelates spatially with the c18oemission, originates from a rotating envelope with effective radius ~ 2400 auand mass 2.1 - 2.9 solar masses. n2h+ emission is absent from a 600 au diameterregion around the young star. the remaining n2h+ emission may lie in a coherenttorus of dense material. with its outflow and rotating envelope, b1c closelyresembles the previously studied object l483-mm, and we conclude that it is aprotostar in an early stage of evolution. we hypothesize that heating by theoutflow and star has desorbed co from grains which has destroyed n2h+ in theinner region and surmise that the presence of grains without ice mantles inthis warm inner region can explain the unusual polarization signature from b1c.

astro-ph;0610672	structure and dynamics of the class i young stellar object l1489 irs	we investigate the velocity transition in the low-mass protostar l1489 irs,which is known to be embedded in a flattened, disc-like structure that showsboth infall and rotation. we construct a model for l1489 irs consisting of anflattened envelope and a velocity field that can vary from pure infall to purerotation. we obtain best-fit parameters by comparison to 24 moleculartransitions from the literature, and using a molecular excitation code and avoronoi optimisation algorithm. we test the model against existing millimeterinterferometric observations, near-infrared scattered light imaging, and 12coro-vibrational lines.we find that l1489 irs is well described by a centralstellar mass of 1.3m$_\odot$ surrounded by a 0.10m$_\odot$ flattened envelopewith approximate scale height h\approx 0.57 r, inclined at 74^\circ. thevelocity field is strongly dominated by rotation, with the velocity vectormaking an angle of 15^\circ with the azimuthal direction. reproducinglow-excitation transitions requires that the emission and absorption by thestarless core 1' (8400 au) east of l1489 irs is included properly, implyingthat l1489 irs is located partially behind this core. we speculate that l1489irs was originally formed closer to the center of this core, but has migratedto its current position over the past few times 10^5 yr, consistent with theirradial velocity difference of 0.4 kms-1. this suggests that l1489 irs' unusualappearance may be result of its migration, and that it would appear as a`normal' embedded protostar if it were still surrounded by an extended cloudcore. conversely, we hypothesize that the inner envelopes of embeddedprotostars resemble the rotating structure seen around l1489 irs.
