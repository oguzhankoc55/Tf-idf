0912.4229	hess j1507-622: an unique unidentified source off the galactic plane	galactic very high energy (vhe, &gt; 100 gev) gamma ray sources in the innergalaxy h.e.s.s. survey tend to cluster within 1 degree in latitude around thegalactic plane. hess j1507-622 instead is unique, since it is located atlatitude of ~3.5 degrees. hess j1507-622 is slightly extended over the psf ofthe instrument and hence its galactic origin is clear. the search forcounterparts in other wavelength regimes (radio, infrared and x-rays) failed toshow any plausible counterparts; and given its position off the galactic planeand hence the absorption almost one order of magnitude lower, it is verysurprising to not see any counterparts especially at x-rays wavelengths (byrosat, xmm newton and chandra). its latitude implies that it is either ratherclose, within about 1 kpc, or is located well off the galactic plane. and alsothe models reflect the uniqueness of this object: a leptonic pwn scenario wouldplace this source due to its quite small extension to multi-kpc distancewhereas a hadronic scenario would preferentially locate this object atdistances of &lt; 1 kpc where the density of target material is higher.

1002.2951	gamma-ray excess from a stacked sample of high- and  intermediate-frequency peaked blazars observed with the magic telescope	between 2004 and 2009 a sample of 28 x-ray selected high- andintermediate-frequency peaked blazars with a x-ray flux larger than 2 ujy at 1kev in the redshift range from 0.018 to 0.361 was observed with the magictelescope at energies above 100 gev. seven among them were detected and theresults of these observations are discussed elsewhere. here we concentrate onthe remaining 21 blazars which were not detected during this observationcampaign and present the 3 sigma (99.7 %) confidence upper limits on theirflux. the individual flux upper limits lie between 1.6 % and 13.6 % of theintegral flux from the crab nebula. applying a stacking method to the sample ofnon-detections with a total of 394.1 hours exposure time, we find evidence foran excess with a cumulative significance of 4.9 standard deviations. it is notdominated by individual objects or flares, but increases linearly with theobservation time as for a constant source with an integral flux level of ~1.5 %of that observed from the crab nebula above 150 gev.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1010.2395	gamma-rays from pulsar wind nebulae in starburst galaxies (head 2010)	recently, two nearby prominent starburst galaxies, m82 and ngc253, have beendetected as point-like sources with gamma-ray telescopes at tev energies [1][2]. it has been claimed that these detections show that the cosmic rayintensity in the starburst galaxies is three orders of magnitude higher than inthe milky way galaxy, assuming that the observed gamma rays arise due to pionproduction of cosmic rays interacting with the ambient gas. the observedspectrum is flatter than the cosmic ray spectrum in the milky way galaxy, andthis could be due to the much higher gas density in the starburst galaxies [3].the interpretation seems to be in line with the ginzburg-model of the origin ofcosmic rays according to which the cosmic rays are accelerated in the shells ofsupernova remnants. as an immediate corollary it follows that the cosmic raydriven gamma ray luminosity should scale with the gas density and supernovarate. at lower energies, gamma-ray measurements with the fermi lat instrumentcould provide support for this scaling [4]. however, there are nagging doubtsabout the interpretation of the observations at very high energies. at thedistance of the observed galaxies, point-like sources cannot be discriminatedfrom diffuse emission for an angular resolution of the order of 0.1 deg. hence,the question about the contribution of unresolved point-like sources to thegamma-ray luminosity arises.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1109.3144	new developments in the ancient pulsarwind nebulae scenario	in a pulsar wind nebula (pwn), the lifetime of inverse compton emittingelectrons exceeds the lifetime of its progenitor pulsar, but it exceeds alsothe age of the electrons that emit via synchrotron radiation; i.e. while thepwn grows older, it can remain bright in ic, whereas its gev-tev gamma-ray (for$10^5-10^6$ years) flux remains high for timescales much larger than the pulsarlifetime and the pwn visible in x-rays. the shell-type remnant of the supernovaexplosion that led to the formation of the pulsar also has a much shorterlifetime. in this scenario, the magnetic field in the cavity induced by thewind of the progenitor star plays a crucial role, but also the magnetic fieldin the interstellar medium cannot be negligible and its outward decrease awayfrom the galactic disk further reduces their x-ray brightness. this is in linewith the discovery of several unidentified sources in the tev gamma-ray bandwithout x-ray counterparts. moreover, the consequences are important also inorder to reinterprete the detection of starburst galaxies in the tev gamma-rayband considering a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray signal.

1109.3628	1es 0229+200: an extreme blazar with a very high minimum lorentz factor	the blazar 1es 0229+200 is a high frequency peaked bl lac object with a hardtev spectrum extending to 10 tev. its unusual spectral characteristics make ita frequently used probe for intergalactic radiation and magnetic fields. withnew, simultaneous observations in the optical, ultraviolet (uv) and x-rays, thesynchrotron emission is probed in great detail. the x-ray emission varies by afactor of ~2 in 2009, while being rather stable in 2010. the x-ray spectrum isvery hard (\gamma ~ 1.8) and it shows an indication of excess absorption abovethe galactic value. the x-ray emission is detected up to ~100 kev without anysignificant cut-off, thus 1es 0229+200 belongs to the class of extreme blazars.the simultaneous measured, host galaxy- and extinction-corrected optical and uvfluxes illustrate that the cut-off of the low energy part of the synchrotronemission is located in the uv regime. the minimum energy of the electrondistribution has to be rather high to account for this cut-off. this impliesthat there is a narrow-band energy distribution function of radiatingelectrons, which is responsible for the unusually hard tev spectrum. otherextreme blazars have similar synchrotron peak frequencies but much softer tevspectra, hence 1es 0229+200 has one of the highest inverse compton (ic) peakfrequency and the narrowest electron distribution among the extreme blazarsknown to date.

1109.4658	gamma-ray observations of the supernova remnant rx j0852.0-4622 with the  fermi lat	we report on gamma-ray observations of the supernova remnant (snr) rxj0852.0-4622 with the large area telescope (lat) aboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope. in the fermi lat data, we find a spatially extended source atthe location of the snr. the extension is consistent with the snr size seen inother wavelengths such as x-rays and tev gamma rays, leading to theidentification of the gamma-ray source with the snr. the spectrum is welldescribed as a power law with a photon index of gamma = 1.85 +/- 0.06 (stat)(+0.18,-0.19) (sys), which smoothly connects to the h.e.s.s. spectrum in thetev energy band. we discuss the gamma-ray emission mechanism based onmultiwavelength data. the broadband data can be fit well by a model in whichthe gamma rays are of hadronic origin. we also consider a scenario with inversecompton scattering of electrons as the emission mechanism of the gamma rays.although the leptonic model predicts a harder spectrum in the fermi lat energyrange, the model can fit the data considering the statistical and systematicerrors.

1109.6124	phase-resolved energy spectra of the crab pulsar in the range of 50-400  gev measured with the magic telescopes	we use 73 h of stereoscopic data taken with the magic telescopes toinvestigate the very high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission of the crab pulsar.our data show a highly significant pulsed signal in the energy range from 50 to400 gev in both the main pulse (p1) and the interpulse (p2) phase regions. weprovide the widest spectra to date of the vhe components of both peaks, andthese spectra extend to the energy range of satellite-borne observatories. thegood resolution and background rejection of the stereoscopic magic systemallows us to cross-check the correctness of each spectral point of the pulsarby comparison with the corresponding (strong and well-known) crab nebula flux.the spectra of both p1 and p2 are compatible with power laws with photonindices of 4.0 \pm 0.8 (p1) and 3.42 \pm 0.26 (p2), respectively, and the ratiop1/p2 between the photon counts of the two pulses is 0.54 \pm 0.12. the vheemission can be understood as an additional component produced by the inversecompton scattering of secondary and tertiary e\pm pairs on ir-uv photons.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1201.4074	morphological and spectral properties of the w51 region measured with  the magic telescopes	the w51 complex hosts the supernova remnant w51c which is known to interactwith the molecular clouds in the star forming region w51b. in addition, apossible pulsar wind nebula cxo j192318.5+140305 was found likely associatedwith the supernova remnant. gamma-ray emission from this region was discoveredby fermi/lat (between 0.2 and 50 gev) and h.e.s.s. (&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1309.6893	discovery of an extended x-ray jet in ap librae	chandra observations of the low-energy peaked bl lac object ap libraerevealed the clear discovery of a non-thermal x-ray jet. ap lib is the firstlow energy peaked bl lac object with an extended non-thermal x-ray jet thatshows emission into the vhe range. the x-ray jet has an extension of ~15'' (~14 kpc). the x-ray jet morphology is similar to the radio jet observed with vlaat 1.36 ghz emerging in south-east direction and bends by 50 degrees at adistance of 12'' towards north-east. the intensity profiles of the x-rayemission are studied consistent with those found in the radio range. thespectral analysis reveals that the x-ray spectra of the core and jet region areboth inverse compton dominated. this adds to a still small sample of bl lacobjects whose x-ray jets are ic dominated and thus more similar to the highluminosity frii sources than to the low luminosity fri objects, which areusually considered to be the parent population of the bl lac objects.

1309.7137	time-dependent modeling of pulsar wind nebulae	a spatially independent model that calculates the time evolution of theelectron spectrum in a spherically expanding pulsar wind nebula (pwn) ispresented, allowing one to make broadband predictions for the pwn's non-thermalradiation. the source spectrum of electrons injected at the termination shockof the pwn is chosen to be a broken power law. in contrast to previous pwnmodels of a similar nature, the source spectrum has a discontinuity inintensity at the transition between the low and high-energy components. to testthe model, it is applied to the young pwn g21.5--0.9, where it is found that adiscontinuous source spectrum can model the emission at all wavelengths betterthan a continuous one. the model is also applied to the unidentified sourceshess j1427--608 and hess j1507--622. parameters are derived for these twocandidate nebulae that are consistent with the values predicted for other pwne.for hess j1427--608 a present-day magnetic field of $b\s{age}=0.4\,\mu\text{g}$is derived. as a result of the small present-day magnetic field, this sourcehas a low synchrotron luminosity, while remaining bright at gev/tev energies.it is therefore possible to interpret hess j1427--608 within the ancient pwnscenario. for the second candidate pwn hess j1507--622, a present-day magneticfield of $b\s{age}=1.7\,\mu\text{g}$ is derived. furthermore, for thiscandidate pwn a scenario is favoured in the present paper in which hessj1507--622 has been compressed by the reverse shock of the supernova remnant.

1310.8500	contemporaneous observations of the radio galaxy ngc 1275 from radio to  very high energy gamma-rays	the radio galaxy ngc 1275, recently identified as a very high energy (vhe,&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray emitter by magic, is one of the few non-blazar agn detectedin the vhe regime. in order to better understand the origin of the gamma-rayemission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneousmulti-frequency observations of ngc 1275 and modeled the overall spectralenergy distribution (sed). we analyzed unpublished magic observations carriedout between oct. 2009 and feb. 2010, and the previously published ones takenbetween aug. 2010 and feb. 2011. we studied the multi-band variability andcorrelations by analyzing data of fermi-lat (0.1-100 gev), as well as chandra(x-ray), kva (optical) and mojave (radio) data taken during the same period.using customized monte carlo simulations corresponding to early magic stereodata, we detect ngc 1275 also in the earlier campaign. the flux level andenergy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. the monthlylight curve &gt;100 gev shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. in thefermi-lat band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. theoptical light curve is variable and shows a clear correlation with thegamma-ray flux &gt;100 mev. in radio, 3 compact components are resolved in theinnermost part of the jet. one of them shows a similar trend as the lat and kvalight curves. the 0.1-650 gev spectra measured simultaneously with magic andfermi-lat can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with asub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. a single-zonesynchrotron-self-compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-lawwith an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband sed and the multi-bandbehavior of the source. however, this model suggests an untypical lowbulk-lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight thanthe pc-scale radio jet.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1407.3707	magic search for vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from ae aquarii in a  multiwavelength context	it has been claimed that the nova-like cataclysmic variable (cv) ae aquarii(ae aqr) is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;$100 gev) source both on observationaland theoretical grounds. we aim to search for vhe gamma-ray emission from aeaqr during different states of the source at several wavelengths to confirm orrule out previous claims of detection of gamma-ray emission from this object.we report on observations of ae aqr performed by magic. the source was observedduring 12 hours as part of a multiwavelength campaign carried out between mayand june 2012 covering the optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray ranges. besides magic,the other facilities involved were the kva, skinakas, and vidojevica telescopesin the optical and swift in x-rays. we calculated integral upper limitscoincident with different states of the source in the optical. we computedupper limits to the pulsed emission limiting the signal region to 30% of thephaseogram and we also searched for pulsed emission at different frequenciesapplying the rayleigh test. ae aqr was not detected at vhe energies during themultiwavelength campaign. we establish integral upper limits at the 95\%confidence level for the steady emission assuming the differential fluxproportional to a power-law function d\phi/de \propto e^{-gamma}, with acrab-like photon spectral index of gamma=2.6. the upper limit above 200 gev is6.4\times10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1} and above 1 tev is 7.4\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}. we obtained an upper limit for the pulsed emission of2.6\times10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1} for energies above 200 gev. applying therayleigh test for pulsed emission at different frequencies we did not find anysignificant signal. our results indicate that ae aqr is not a vhe gamma-rayemitter at the level of emission previously claimed. we have established themost constraining upper limits for the vhe gamma-ray emission of ae aqr.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1511.02109	the icecube neutrino observatory, the pierre auger observatory and the  telescope array: joint contribution to the 34th international cosmic ray  conference (icrc 2015)	we have conducted three searches for correlations between ultra-high energycosmic rays detected by the telescope array and the pierre auger observatory,and high-energy neutrino candidate events from icecube. two cross-correlationanalyses with uhecrs are done: one with 39 cascades from the icecube`high-energy starting events' sample and the other with 16 high-energy `trackevents'. the angular separation between the arrival directions of neutrinos anduhecrs is scanned over. the same events are also used in a separate searchusing a maximum likelihood approach, after the neutrino arrival directions arestacked. to estimate the significance we assume uhecr magnetic deflections tobe inversely proportional to their energy, with values $3^\circ$, $6^\circ$ and$9^\circ$ at 100 eev to allow for the uncertainties on the magnetic fieldstrength and uhecr charge. a similar analysis is performed on stacked uhecrarrival directions and the icecube sample of through-going muon track eventswhich were optimized for neutrino point-source searches.

1512.00192	multiwavelength survey of a sample of flat-spectrum radio-loud  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on a multiwavelength survey of a sample of 42 flat-spectrumradio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s). this is the largest knownsample of this type of active galactic nucleus (agn) to date. we found that 17%of sources were detected at high-energy gamma rays (e&gt;100 mev), and 90% atx-rays (0.3-10 kev). the masses of the central black holes are in the range$\sim 10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than the values of blazars. the diskluminosities are about 1-49% of the eddington value, with one outlier at 0.3%,comparable with the luminosities observed in flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). the jet powers are $\sim 10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable with bllac objects, yet relatively smaller than fsrqs. however, once renormalized bythe mass of the central black hole, the jet powers of rlnls1s, bl lacs, andfsrqs are consistent each other, indicating the scalability of the jets. wefound episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours.in some cases, dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as theinterplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk. we concludethat, despite the distinct observational properties, the central engines ofrlnls1s are similar to those of blazars.
