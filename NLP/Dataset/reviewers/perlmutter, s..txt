0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0905.0340	using spectral flux ratios to standardize sn ia luminosities	we present a new method to standardize type ia supernova (sn ia) luminositiesto ~&lt;0.13 magnitudes using flux ratios from a single flux-calibrated spectrumper sn. using nearby supernova factory spectrophotomery of 58 sne ia, weperformed an unbiased search for flux ratios which correlate with sn ialuminosity. after developing the method and selecting the best ratios from atraining sample, we verified the results on a separate validation sample andwith data from the literature. we identified multiple flux ratios whosecorrelations with luminosity are stronger than those of light curve shape andcolor, previously identified spectral feature ratios, or equivalent widthmeasurements. in particular, the flux ratio r(642/443) = f(642 nm) / f(443 nm)has a correlation of 0.95 with sn ia absolute magnitudes. using this singleratio as a correction factor produces a hubble diagram with a residual scatterstandard deviation of 0.125 +- 0.011 mag, compared with 0.161 +- 0.015 mag whenfit with the salt2 light curve shape and color parameters x1 and c. the ratior(642/443) is an effective correction factor for both extrinsic dust reddeningand instrinsic variations such as those of sn 1991t-like and sn 1999aa-likesne. when combined with broad-band color measurements, spectral flux ratios canstandardize sn ia magnitudes to ~0.12 mag. these are the first spectral metricsthat improve over the standard normalization methods based upon light curveshape and color and they provide among the lowest scatter hubble diagrams everpublished.

0906.4318	constraining dust and color variations of high-z sne using nicmos on  hubble space telescope	we present data from the supernova cosmology project for five high redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) that were obtained using the nicmos infrared cameraon the hubble space telescope. we add two sne from this sample to a rest-framei-band hubble diagram, doubling the number of high redshift supernovae on thisdiagram. this i-band hubble diagram is consistent with a flat universe(omega_matter, omega_lambda= 0.29, 0.71). a homogeneous distribution of largegrain dust in the intergalactic medium (replenishing dust) is incompatible withthe data and is excluded at the 5 sigma confidence level, if the sn host galaxyreddening is corrected assuming r_v=1.75. we use both optical and infraredobservations to compare photometric properties of distant sne ia with those ofnearby objects. we find generally good agreement with the expected colorevolution for all sne except the highest redshift sn in our sample (sn 1997ekat z=0.863) which shows a peculiar color behavior. we also present spectraobtained from ground based telescopes for type identification and determinationof redshift.

0908.3897	hubble space telescope weak-lensing study of the galaxy cluster xmmu  j2235.3-2557 at z=1.4: a surprisingly massive galaxy cluster when the  universe is one-third of its current age	we present a weak-lensing analysis of the z=1.4 galaxy cluster xmmuj2235.3-2557, based on deep advanced camera for surveys images. despite theobservational challenge set by the high redshift of the lens, we detect asubstantial lensing signal at the &gt;~ 8 sigma level. this clear detection isenabled in part by the high mass of the cluster, which is verified by our bothparametric and non-parametric estimation of the cluster mass. assuming that thecluster follows a navarro-frenk-white mass profile, we estimate that theprojected mass of the cluster within r=1 mpc is (8.5+-1.7) x 10^14 solar mass,where the error bar includes the statistical uncertainty of the shear profile,the effect of possible interloping background structures, the scatter inconcentration parameter, and the error in our estimation of the mean redshiftof the background galaxies. the high x-ray temperature 8.6_{-1.2}^{+1.3} kev ofthe cluster recently measured with chandra is consistent with this high lensingmass. when we adopt the 1-sigma lower limit as a mass threshold and use thecosmological parameters favored by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe5-year (wmap5) result, the expected number of similarly massive clusters at z&gt;~ 1.4 in the 11 square degree survey is n ~ 0.005. therefore, the discovery ofthe cluster within the survey volume is a rare event with a probability &lt; 1%,and may open new scenarios in our current understanding of cluster formationwithin the standard cosmological model.

1003.2217	nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2007if: first total mass  measurement of a super-chandrasekhar-mass progenitor	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2007if, anoverluminous (m_v = -20.4), red (b-v = 0.16 at b-band maximum), slow-rising(t_rise = 24 days) type ia supernova in a very faint (m_g = -14.10) hostgalaxy. a spectrum at 5 days past b-band maximum light is a direct match to thesuper-chandrasekhar-mass candidate sn ia 2003fg, showing si ii and c ii at~9000 km/s. a high signal-to-noise co-addition of the sn spectral time seriesreveals no na i d absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the hostgalaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the lirarelation for normal sne ia. the ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strongmaximum in i-band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing innear-maximum-light spectra. sn2007 if also displays a plateau in the si iivelocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for anoverdense shell in the sn ejecta. we calculate the bolometric light curve ofthe sn and use it and the \ion{si}{2} velocity evolution to constrain the massof the shell and the underlying sn ejecta, and demonstrate that sn2007 if isstrongly inconsistent with a chandrasekhar-mass scenario. within the context ofa "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, andassuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4+/- 0.2 solar masses, with 1.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of nickel-56 and with0.3-0.5 solar masses in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. ourmodeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a moreefficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the lowvelocities typical of super-chandrasekhar-mass sneia.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1008.2308	supernova legacy survey: using spectral signatures to improve type ia  supernovae as distance indicators	gmos optical long-slit spectroscopy at the gemini-north telescope was used toclassify targets from the supernova legacy survey (snls) from july 2005 and may2006 - may 2008. during this time, 95 objects were observed. where possible theobjects' redshifts (z) were measured from narrow emission or absorptionfeatures in the host galaxy spectrum, otherwise they were measured from thebroader supernova features. we present spectra of 68 confirmed or probable sneia from snls with redshifts in the range 0.17 \leq z \leq 1.02. in combinationwith earlier snls gemini and vlt spectra, we used these new observations tomeasure pseudo-equivalent widths (ews) of three spectral features - caii h&amp;k,siii and mgii - in 144 objects and compared them to the ews of low-redshift sneia from a sample drawn from the literature. no signs of changes with z are seenfor the caii h&amp;k and mgii features. systematically lower ew siii is seen athigh redshift, but this can be explained by a change in demographics of the sneia population within a two-component model combined with an observedcorrelation between ew siii and photometric lightcurve stretch.

1009.1423	cluster galaxies in xmmu j2235-2557: galaxy population properties in  most massive environments at z~1.4	we present a multi-wavelength study of galaxy populations in the core of themassive, x-ray luminous cluster xmmu j2235 at z=1.39, based on vlt and hstoptical and near-infrared photometry. luminosity functions in the z, h, and ksbands show a faint-end slope consistent with being flat, and a characteristicmagnitude m* close to passive evolution predictions of m* of local massiveclusters, with a formation redshift z&gt;2. the color-magnitude and color-massdiagrams show evidence of a tight red sequence of massive galaxies, withoverall old stellar populations, generally early-type morphology, typicallyshowing early-type spectral features and rest-frame far-uv emission consistentwith very low star formation rates (sfr&lt;0.2msun/yr). star forming spectroscopicmembers, with sfrs of up to ~100msun/yr, are all located at clustercentricdistances &gt;~250kpc, with the central cluster region already appearingeffectively quenched. massive galaxies in the core of this cluster appear to bein an advanced evolutionary stage in terms of both star formation and massassembly. the high-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function is essentiallyalready in place, and the stellar mass fraction estimated within r500 (~1%,kroupa imf) is already similar to that of local massive clusters. on the otherhand, morphological analysis of the massive red sequence galaxies suggests thatthey are smaller than similarly massive local early-types. while possiblyaffected by systematics and biases, this result might imply that, in spite ofthe overall early assembly of these sources, their evolution is not complete,and processes like minor (and likely dry) merging might still shape theirstructural properties to resemble those of their local counterparts, withoutsubstantially affecting their stellar mass or host stellarpopulations.[abridged]

1103.5300	the reddening law of type ia supernovae: separating intrinsic  variability from dust using equivalent widths	we employ 76 type ia supernovae with optical spectrophotometry within 2.5days of b-band maximum light obtained by the nearby supernova factory to derivethe impact of si and ca features on supernovae intrinsic luminosity anddetermine a dust reddening law. we use the equivalent width of si ii{\lambda}4131 in place of light curve stretch to account for first-orderintrinsic luminosity variability. the resultant empirical spectral reddeninglaw exhibits strong features associated with ca ii and si ii {\lambda}6355.after applying a correction based on the ca ii h&amp;k equivalent width we find areddening law consistent with a cardelli extinction law. using the same inputdata, we compare this result to synthetic rest-frame ubvri-like photometry inorder to mimic literature observations. after corrections for signaturescorrelated with si ii {\lambda}4131 and ca ii h&amp;k equivalent widths, andintroducing an empirical correlation between colors, we determine the dustcomponent in each band. we find a value of the total-to-selective extinctionratio, rv = 2.8 \pm 0.3. this agrees with the milky way value, in contrast tothe low rv values found in most previous analyses. this result suggests thatthe long-standing controversy in interpreting sn ia colors and theircompatibility with a classical extinction law, critical to their use ascosmological probes, can be explained by the treatment of the dispersion incolors, and by the variability of features apparent in sn ia spectra.

1109.0948	photometric selection of type ia supernovae in the supernova legacy  survey	we present a sample of 485 photometrically identified type ia supernovacandidates mined from the first three years of data of the cfht supernovalegacy survey (snls). the images were submitted to a deferred processingindependent of the snls real-time detection pipeline. light curves of alltransient events were reconstructed in the g_m, r_m, i_m and z_m filters andsubmitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possiblesupernovae. pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by lightcurve shape criteria. type ia supernova identification relied on eventcharacteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normalsne ia. the light curve fitter salt2 was used for this purpose, assigning hostgalaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. the selected sample of 485candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the snls spectroscopicidentification. the contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated tobe 4%. testing hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us tomeasure the malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. the resultis fully consistent with the precise monte carlo based estimate used to correctsn ia distance moduli in the snls 3-year cosmological analyses. this paperdemonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshiftsupernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects forcosmological analyses from future large photometric sn ia surveys.

1109.1312	type ia supernova carbon footprints	we present convincing evidence of unburned carbon at photospheric velocitiesin new observations of 5 type ia supernovae (sne ia) obtained by the nearbysupernova factory. these sne are identified by examining 346 spectra from 124sne obtained before +2.5 d relative to maximum. detections are based on thepresence of relatively strong c ii 6580 absorption "notches" in multiplespectra of each sn, aided by automated fitting with the synapps code. four ofthe 5 sne in question are otherwise spectroscopically unremarkable, with ionsand ejection velocities typical of sne ia, but spectra of the fifth exhibitshigh-velocity (v &gt; 20,000 km/s) si ii and ca ii features. on the other hand,the light curve properties are preferentially grouped, strongly suggesting aconnection between carbon-positivity and broad band light curve/color behavior:three of the 5 have relatively narrow light curves but also blue colors, and afourth may be a dust-reddened member of this family. accounting forsignal-to-noise and phase, we estimate that 22 +10/-6% of sne ia exhibitspectroscopic c ii signatures as late as -5 d with respect to maximum. we placethese new objects in the context of previously recognized carbon-positive sneia, and consider reasonable scenarios seeking to explain a physical connectionbetween light curve properties and the presence of photospheric carbon. we alsoexamine the detailed evolution of the detected carbon signatures and thesurrounding wavelength regions to shed light on the distribution of carbon inthe ejecta. our ability to reconstruct the c ii 6580 feature in detail underthe assumption of purely spherical symmetry casts doubt on a "carbon blobs"hypothesis, but does not rule out all asymmetric models. a low volume fillingfactor for carbon, combined with line-of-sight effects, seems unlikely toexplain the scarcity of detected carbon in sne ia by itself.

0710.3120	a new determination of the high redshift type ia supernova rates with  the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys	we present a new measurement of the volumetric rate of type ia supernova upto a redshift of 1.7, using the hubble space telescope (hst) goods datacombined with an additional hst dataset covering the north goods fieldcollected in 2004. we employ a novel technique that does not requirespectroscopic data for identifying type ia supernovae (although spectroscopicmeasurements of redshifts are used for over half the sample); instead we employa bayesian approach using only photometric data to calculate the probabilitythat an object is a type ia supernova. this bayesian technique can easily bemodified to incorporate improved priors on supernova properties, and it iswell-suited for future high-statistics supernovae searches in whichspectroscopic follow up of all candidates will be impractical. here, the methodis validated on both ground- and space-based supernova data having somespectroscopic follow up. we combine our volumetric rate measurements with lowredshift supernova data, and fit to a number of possible models for theevolution of the type ia supernova rate as a function of redshift. the data donot distinguish between a flat rate at redshift &gt; 0.5 and a previously proposedmodel, in which the type ia rate peaks at redshift &gt;1 due to a significantdelay from star-formation to the supernova explosion. except for the highestredshifts, where the signal to noise ratio is generally too low to apply thistechnique, this approach yields smaller or comparable uncertainties thanprevious work.

1201.3989	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: iii. correlated  properties of type ia supernovae and their hosts at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.46	using the sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the hubblespace telescope (hst) cluster supernova survey and augmented with hst-observedsne ia in the goods fields, we search for correlations between the propertiesof sne and their host galaxies at high redshift. we use galaxy color andquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters anddevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies fromstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. with this approach, weidentify six sn ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven sn iahosts that are early-type field galaxies. we confirm for the first time atz&gt;0.9 that sne ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quicklythan sne ia hosted by late-type galaxies. we also show that the two samples ofhosts produce sne ia with similar color distributions. the relatively simplespectral energy distributions (seds) expected for passive galaxies enable us tomeasure stellar masses of early-type sn hosts. in combination with stellar massestimates of late-type goods sn hosts from thomson &amp; chary (2011), weinvestigate the correlation of host mass with hubble residual observed at lowerredshifts. although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hintof this relation is found at z&gt;0.9. by simultaneously fitting the averagecluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,we show that the reddening of early-type cluster sn hosts is likely e(b-v) &lt;~0.06. the similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggeststhat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also beminimally affected by dust. hence, the early-type hosted sne ia studied hereoccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshiftstandard candles than other sne ia.

1203.4839	constraining type ia supernova models: sn 2011fe as a test case	the nearby supernova sn 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail.therefore, it is an important test case for type ia supernova (sn ia) models,which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of theseobjects. here, we explore how available and expected future observations of sn2011fe can be used to constrain sn ia explosion scenarios. we base ourdiscussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two whitedwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the mostwidely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to sne ia. althoughboth models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early andnear-maximum spectra of sn 2011fe obtained by the nearby supernova factory(snfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. the levelof agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating theexplosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leadsto differences in the 55co production. sn 2011fe is close enough to be followedsufficiently long to study this effect.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1309.1182	evidence of environmental dependencies of type ia supernovae from the  nearby supernova factory indicated by local h{\alpha}	(abridged) we study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to type iasupernovae (sne ia) to analyze relations between the properties of sn ia eventsand environments most similar to where their progenitors formed. we focus onlocal h\alpha\ emission as an indicator of young environments. the nearbysupernova factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for sne iausing integral field spectroscopy, allowing the simultaneous measurement of thesn and its immediate vicinity. for 89 sne ia we measure h\alpha\ emissiontracing ongoing star formation within a 1 kpc radius around each sn. thisconstitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sampleof sne ia also having accurate luminosity, color and stretch measurements. wefind that sne ia with local h\alpha\ emission are redder by 0.036+/-0.017 mag,and that the previously-noted correlation between stretch and host mass isentirely driven by the sne ia coming from passive regions. most importantly,the mean standardized brightness for sne ia with local h\alpha\ emission is0.094+/-0.031 mag fainter than for those without. this offset arises from abimodal structure in the hubble residuals, that also explains thepreviously-known host-mass bias. we combine this bimodality with the cosmicstar-formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean sn iabrightness and the host-mass bias. this change is confirmed using high-redshiftsne ia from the literature. these environmental dependences point to remainingsystematic errors in sne ia standardization. the observed brightness offset ispredicted to cause a significant bias in measurements of the dark energyequation of state. recognition of these effects offers new opportunities toimprove sne ia as cosmological probes - e.g. sne ia having local h\alpha\emission are more homogeneous, having a brightness dispersion of 0.105+/-0.012mag.

1411.4424	a metric space for type ia supernova spectra	we develop a new framework for use in exploring type ia supernova (sn ia)spectra. combining principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squareanalysis (pls) we are able to establish correlations between the principalcomponents (pcs) and spectroscopic/photometric sne ia features. the techniquewas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the nearby supernovafactory. the ability of pca to group together sne ia with similar spectralfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by twoimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivativesof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines anddiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through theuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input datamatrix. these allow us to define a stable pc parameter space which can be usedto characterize synthetic sn ia spectra by means of real sn features. usingpls, we demonstrate that the information from important previously knownspectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pew) of si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 and the line velocity of s ii 5640 / si ii 6355) at a given epoch,is contained within the pc space and can be determined through a linearcombination of the most important pcs. we also show that the pc spaceencompasses photometric features like b or v magnitudes, b-v color and salt2parameters c and x1. the observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavilyaffected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. allthe above mentioned applications allowed us to construct a metric space forcomparing synthetic sn ia spectra with observations.

1412.5533	type ia supernova distance modulus bias and dispersion from k-correction  errors: a direct measurement using lightcurve fits to observed spectral time  series	we estimate systematic errors due to k-corrections in standard photometricanalyses of high redshift type ia supernovae. errors due to k-correction occurwhen the spectral template model underlying the lightcurve fitter poorlyrepresents the actual supernova spectral energy distribution, meaning that thedistance modulus cannot be recovered accurately. in order to quantify thiseffect, synthetic photometry is performed on artificially redshiftedspectrophotometric data from 119 low-redshift supernovae from the nearbysupernova factory, and the resulting lightcurves are fit with a conventionallightcurve fitter. we measure the variation in the standardized magnitude thatwould be fit for a given supernova if located at a range of redshifts andobserved with various filter sets corresponding to current and future supernovasurveys. we find significant variation in the measurements of the samesupernovae placed at different redshifts regardless of filters used, whichcauses dispersion greater than $\sim0.05$ mag for measurements of photometryusing the sloan-like filters and a bias that corresponds to a $0.03$ shift in$w$ when applied to an outside data set. to test the result of a shift insupernova population or environment at higher redshifts, we repeat ourcalculations with the addition of a reweighting of the supernovae as a functionof redshift and find that this strongly affects the results and would haverepercussions for cosmology. we discuss possible methods to reduce thecontribution of the k-correction bias and uncertainty.

1412.6501	confirmation of a star formation bias in type ia supernova distances and  its effect on measurement of the hubble constant	previously we used the nearby supernova factory sample to show that sne~iahaving locally star-forming environments are dimmer than sne~ia having locallypassive environments.here we use the \constitution\ sample together with hostgalaxy data from \galex\ to independently confirm that result. the effect isseen using both the salt2 and mlcs2k2 lightcurve fitting and standardizationmethods, with brightness differences of $0.094 \pm 0.037\ \mathrm{mag}$ forsalt2 and $0.155 \pm 0.041\ \mathrm{mag}$ for mlcs2k2 with $r_v=2.5$. whencombined with our previous measurement the effect is $0.094 \pm 0.025\\mathrm{mag}$ for salt2. if the ratio of these local sn~ia environments changeswith redshift or sample selection, this can lead to a bias in cosmologicalmeasurements. we explore this issue further, using as an example the directmeasurement of $h_0$. \galex{} observations show that the sne~ia havingstandardized absolute magnitudes calibrated via the cepheid period--luminosityrelation using {\textit{hst}} originate in predominately star-formingenvironments, whereas only ~50% of the hubble-flow comparison sample havelocally star-forming environments. as a consequence, the $h_0$ measurementusing sne~ia is currently overestimated. correcting for this bias, we find avalue of $h_0^{corr}=70.6\pm 2.6\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ mpc^{-1}}$ when using thelmc distance, milky way parallaxes and the ngc~4258 megamaser as the cepheidzeropoint, and $68.8\pm 3.3\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ mpc^{-1}}$ when only usingngc~4258. our correction brings the direct measurement of $h_0$ within $\sim1\,\sigma$ of recent indirect measurements based on the cmb power spectrum.

1502.01026	a calibration of nicmos camera 2 for low count-rates	nicmos 2 observations are crucial for constraining distances to most of theexisting sample of z &gt; 1 sne ia. unlike the conventional calibration programs,these observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. reciprocityfailure is known to exist in hgcdte devices and a correction for this effecthas already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. howeverobservations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. here instead, weprovide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. thisis obtained via inter-calibration of nic2 f110w/f160w with wfc3 in the lowcount-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.these objects have relatively simple near-ir seds, uniform colors, and theirextended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate thanwould stars. the use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on psfprofiles. we find st magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the nicmoscooling system, ncs) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for f110w and 25.803 +- 0.023 forf160w, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799). before the installation of the ncs, wefind 24.843 +- 0.025 for f110w and 25.498 +- 0.021 for f160w, also in agreementwith the high-count-rate calibration (24.815 and 25.470). we also check thestandard bandpasses of wfc3 and nicmos 2 using a range of stars and galaxies atdifferent colors and find mild tension for wfc3, limiting the accuracy of thezeropoints. to avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was "blinded" in thatthe fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.

(2012) and the previous wfirst-2.4drm, reported by spergel et. (2013). the 2.4-m primary mirror enables a missionwith greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-mdesigns considered previously, increasing both the science return of theprimary surveys and the capabilities of wfirst as a guest observer facility.the addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline designenables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.

0805.3983	clustering of supernova ia host galaxies	for the first time the cross-correlation between type ia supernova hostgalaxies and surrounding field galaxies is measured using the supernova legacysurvey sample. over the z=0.2 to 0.9 redshift range we find that supernovahosts are correlated an average of 60% more strongly than similarly selectedfield galaxies over the 3-100 arcsec range and about a factor of 3 morestrongly below 10 arcsec. the correlation errors are empirically establishedwith a jackknife analysis of the four snls fields. the hosts are morecorrelated than the field at a significance of 99% in the fitted amplitude andslope, with the point-by-point difference of the two correlation functionshaving a reduced $\chi^2$ for 8 degrees of freedom of 4.3, which has aprobability of random occurrence of less than 3x10^{-5}. the correlation angleis 1.5+/-0.5 arcsec, which deprojects to a fixed co-moving correlation lengthof approximately 6.5+/- 2/h mpc. weighting the field galaxies with the mass andstar formation rate supernova frequencies of the simple a+b model produces goodagreement with the observed clustering. we conclude that these supernovaclustering differences are primarily the expected outcome of the dependence ofsupernova rates on galaxy masses and stellar populations with their clusteringenvironment.

1511.01102	improving cosmological distance measurements using twin type ia  supernovae	we introduce a method for identifying "twin" type ia supernovae, and usingthem to improve distance measurements. this novel approach to type ia supernovastandardization is made possible by spectrophotometric time series observationsfrom the nearby supernova factory (snfactory). we begin with a well-measuredset of supernovae, find pairs whose spectra match well across the entireoptical window, and then test whether this leads to a smaller dispersion intheir absolute brightnesses. this analysis is completed in a blinded fashion,ensuring that decisions made in implementing the method do not inadvertentlybias the result. we find that pairs of supernovae with more closely matchedspectra indeed have reduced brightness dispersion. we are able to standardizethis initial set of snfactory supernovae to 0.083 +/- 0.012 magnitudes,implying a dispersion of 0.072 +/- 0.010 magnitudes in the absence of peculiarvelocities. we estimate that with larger numbers of comparison sne, e.g, usingthe final snfactory spectrophotometric dataset as a reference, this method willbe capable of standardizing high-redshift supernovae to within 0.06-0.07magnitudes. these results imply that at least 3/4 of the variance in hubbleresiduals in current supernova cosmology analyses is due to previouslyunaccounted-for astrophysical differences among the supernovae

astro-ph;0104382	timescale stretch parameterization of type ia supernova b-band light  curves	r-band intensity measurements along the light curve of type ia supernovaediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) are fitted in brightness totemplates allowing a free parameter the time-axis width factor w = s(1+z). thedata points are then individually aligned in the time-axis, normalized andk-corrected back to the rest frame, after which the nearly 1300 normalizedintensity measurements are found to lie on a well-determined common rest-frameb-band curve which we call the ``composite curve''. the same procedure isapplied to 18 low-redshift calan/tololo sne with z &lt; 0.11; these nearly 300b-band photometry points are found to lie on the composite curve equally well.the scp search technique produces several measurements before maximum light foreach supernova. we demonstrate that the linear stretch factor, s, whichparameterizes the light-curve timescale appears independent of z,and appliesequally well to the declining and rising parts of the light curve. in fact, theb-band template that best fits this composite curve fits the individualsupernova photometry data when stretched by a factor s with chi^2/dof approx =1, thus as well as any parameterization can, given the current data sets. themeasurement of the date of explosion, however, is model dependent and nottightly constrained by the current data.  we also demonstrate the 1+z light-curve time-axis broadening expected fromcosmological expansion. this argues strongly against alternative explanations,such as tired light, for the redshift of distant objects.

astro-ph;0207409	the type ia supernova 1999aw: a probable 1999aa-like event in a  low-luminosity host galaxy	sn 1999aw was discovered during the first campaign of the nearby galaxiessupernova search (ngss) project. this luminous, slow-declining (delta m_{15}(b) = 0.81 \pm 0.03) type ia supernova was noteworthy in at least two respects.first, it occurred in an extremely low luminosity host galaxy that was notvisible in the template images, nor in initial subsequent deep imaging.secondly, the photometric and spectral properties of this supernova indicatethat it very likely was similar to the subclass of type ia supernovae whoseprototype is sn 1999aa. this paper presents the bvri and j_{s} hk_{s}lightcurves of sn 1999aw (through 100 days past maximum light), as well asseveral epochs of optical spectra. from these data we calculate the bolometriclight curve, and give estimates of the luminosity at maximum light and theinitial ^{56}ni mass. in addition, we present deep bvi images obtained recentlywith the baade 6.5-meter telescope at las campanas observatory which reveal theremarkably low-luminosity host galaxy.

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

astro-ph;0309368	new constraints on $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from an  independent set of eleven high-redshift supernovae observed with hst	we report measurements of $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from elevensupernovae at z=0.36-0.86 with high-quality lightcurves measured using wfpc-2on the hst. this is an independent set of high-redshift supernovae thatconfirms previous supernova evidence for an accelerating universe. combinedwith earlier supernova cosmology project data, the new supernovae yield aflat-universe measurement of the mass density $\omega_m=0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$(statistical) $\pm0.04$ (identified systematics), or equivalently, acosmological constant of $\omega_\lambda=0.75^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ (statistical)$\pm0.04$ (identified systematics). when the supernova results are combinedwith independent flat-universe measurements of $\omega_m$ from cmb and galaxyredshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of$w=-1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ (statistical) $\pm0.09$ (identified systematic), if wis assumed to be constant in time. the new data offer greatly improved colormeasurements of the high-redshift supernovae, and hence improved host-galaxyextinction estimates. these extinction measurements show no anomalous negativee(b-v) at high redshift. the precision of the measurements is such that it ispossible to perform a host-galaxy extinction correction directly for individualsupernovae without any assumptions or priors on the parent e(b-v) distribution.our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that darkenergy is required with $p(\omega_\lambda&gt;0)&gt;0.99$, a result consistent withprevious and current supernova analyses which rely upon the identification of alow-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinctiondistribution.

astro-ph;0504481	a definitive measurement of time dilation in the spectral evolution of  the moderate-redshift type ia supernova 1997ex	we have obtained high-quality keck optical spectra at three epochs of thetype ia supernova 1997ex, whose redshift z is 0.361. the elapsed calendar timebetween the first two spectra was 24.88 d, and that between the first and thirdspectra was 30.95 d. in an expanding universe where 1 + z represents the factorby which space has expanded between the emission and detection of light, theamount of aging in the supernova rest frame should be a factor of 1 / (1 + z)smaller than the observed-frame aging; thus, we expect sn 1997ex to have aged18.28 d and 22.74 d between the first epoch and the second and third epochs,respectively. the quantitative method for determining the spectral-feature ageof a sn ia, developed by riess et al.

astro-ph;0512081	grb 050408: an atypical gamma-ray burst as a probe of an atypical  galactic environment	the bright grb 050408 was localized by hete-ii near local midnight, enablingan impressive ground-based followup effort as well as space-based followup fromswift. the swift data from the x-ray telescope (xrt) and our own opticalphotometry and spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for ouranalysis. under the traditional assumption that the visible waveband was abovethe peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the opticalphotometry from 0.03 to 5.03 days show an afterglow decay corresponding to anelectron energy index of p_lc = 2.05 +/- 0.04, without a jet break as suggestedby others. a break is seen in the x-ray data at early times (at ~12600 secafter the grb). the spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent withp_lc assuming a host-galaxy extinction of a_v = 1.18 mag. the optical-nirbroadband spectrum is also consistent with p = 2.05, but prefers a_v = 0.57mag. the x-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26 x 10^4 sec, which may be theresult of a refreshed shock. this burst stands out in that the optical andx-ray data suggest a large h i column density of n_hi ~ 10^22 cm^-2; it is verylikely a damped lyman alpha system and so the faintness of the host galaxy (m_v&gt; -18 mag) is noteworthy. moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong ti iiabsorption lines with a column density through the grb host that exceeds thelargest values observed for the milky way by an order of magnitude.furthermore, the ti ii equivalent width is in the top 1% of mg iiabsorption-selected qsos. this suggests that the large-scale environment of grb050408 has significantly lower ti depletion than the milky way and a largevelocity width (delta v &gt; 200 km/s).

astro-ph;0602411	measurement of \omega_m, \omega_{\lambda} from a blind analysis of type  ia supernovae with cmagic: using color information to verify the acceleration  of the universe	we present measurements of \omega_m and \omega_{\lambda} from a blindanalysis of 21 high-redshift supernovae using a new technique (cmagic) forfitting the multi-color lightcurves of type ia supernovae, first introduced inwang et al. (2003). cmagic takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior oftype ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages overcurrent techniques based on maximum magnitudes. among these are a reducedsensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-widthrelation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. this allows usto provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite thefact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for cmagic.we describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed toprevent experimenter bias. the data are broadly consistent with the picture ofan accelerating universe, and agree with a flat universe within 1.7\sigma,including systematics. we also compare the cmagic results directly with thoseof a maximum magnitude fit to the same sne, finding that cmagic favors moreacceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlationbetween the two measurements. a fit for w assuming a flat universe yields avalue which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2\sigma.

astro-ph;0605455	rates and properties of type ia supernovae as a function of mass and  star-formation in their host galaxies	(abridged) we show that type ia supernovae (sne ia) are formed within bothvery young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on thestellar mass and mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of their host galaxies.models where the sn ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass areruled out with 99% confidence. our analysis is based on 100spectroscopically-confirmed sne ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,all from the supernova legacy survey (snls) and distributed over 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.75.using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and sfrs for the sn iahost galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions withthe galaxy spectral synthesis code, pegase.2. we show that the sn ia rate perunit mass is proportional to the specific sfr of the parent galaxies -- morevigorously star-forming galaxies host more sne ia per unit stellar mass,broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing sn ia rate in later-type galaxiesseen in the local universe. following earlier suggestions for a simple"two-component" model approximating the sn ia rate, we find bivariate lineardependencies of the sn ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean sfrs ofthe host systems. we also demonstrate a dependence of distant sn ia light-curveshapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observedlocally. passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially hostfaster-declining/dimmer sne ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are onlyfound in systems with ongoing star-formation. we model the light-curve widthdistribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and anold component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0606499	nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2005gj: another type ia  supernova in a massive circumstellar envelope	we report nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2005gj, the secondconfirmed case of a "hybrid" type ia/iin supernova. our early-phase photometryof sn 2005gj shows that the interaction is much stronger than for theprototype, sn 2002ic. our first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad andnarrow h-alpha emission. later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst,show clear type ia features combined with broad and narrow h-gamma, h-beta,h-alpha and hei 5876,7065 in emission. at higher resolution, p cygni profilesare apparent. surprisingly, we also observe an inverted p cygni profile for[oiii] 5007. we find that the lightcurve and measured velocity of the unshockedcircumstellar material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. the earlylightcurve is well-described by a flat radial density profile for thecircumstellar material. however, our decomposition of the spectra into type iaand shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova,suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material.we suggest that the emission line velocity profiles arise from electronscattering rather than the kinematics of the shock. this is supported by theinferred high densities, and the lack of evidence for evolution in the linewidths. ground- and space-based photometry, and keck spectroscopy, of the hostgalaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity z/zsun &lt;0.3; (95% confidence) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant starformation event that began roughly 200+/-70 myr ago. we discuss theimplications of these observations for progenitor models and cosmology usingtype ia supernovae.

astro-ph;9309052	possible gravitational microlensing of a star in the large magellanic  cloud	there is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseenmatter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own$^{1,2}$. the nature ofthis `dark matter' is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars,dust, or gas, as they would be easily detected. exotic particles such asaxions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles(collectively known as wimps) have been proposed)$^{3,4}$, but have yet to bedetected. a less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies withmasses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \msun$. such objects,known collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (machos) might be browndwarfs or `jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),neutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. paczynski$^6$ suggested thatmachos might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing theapparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. we areconducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter haloof our galaxy is made up of machos. here we report a candidate for amicrolensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 millionstars in the large magellanic cloud for one year. the light curve shows novariation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lastingover 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\approx \bf 2$ mag. the most probablelens mass, inferred from the duration of the event, is $\bf \sim 0.1 \,\msun$.

astro-ph;9407009	probable gravitational microlensing towards the galatic bulge	the macho project carries out regular photometric monitoring of millions ofstars in the magellanic clouds and galactic bulge, to search for very raregravitational microlensing events due to compact objects in the galactic haloand disk. a preliminary analysis of one field in the galactic bulge, containing{$\sim430,000$} stars observed for 190 days, reveals four stars which showclear evidence for brightenings which are time-symmetric, achromatic in our twopassbands, and have shapes consistent with gravitational microlensing. this issignificantly higher than the $\sim 1$ event expected from microlensing byknown stars in the disk. if all four events are due to microlensing, a 95\%confidence lower limit on the optical depth towards our bulge field is $1.3\times 10^{-6}$, and a ``best fit" value is $\tau \approx 1.6 \times10^{-6}/\epsilon$,where $\epsilon$ is the detection efficiency of theexperiment, and $\epsilon &lt; 0.4$. if the true optical depth is close to the``best fit" value, possible explanations include a ``maximal" disk whichaccounts for most of the galactic circular velocity at the solar radius, a halowhich is centrally concentrated, or bulge-bulge microlensing.

astro-ph;9411019	theory of exploring the dark halo with microlensing 1: power--law models	the detection of microlensing has opened the way for the development of newmethods in galactic astronomy. this series of papers investigates whatmicrolensing can teach us about the structure and shape of the dark halo. inthis paper we present formulas for the microlensing rate, optical depth andevent duration distributions for a simple set of axisymmetric disk-halo models.the halos are based on the "power--law models" which have simple velocitydistributions. using these models, we show that there is a large uncertainty inthe predicted microlensing rate because of uncertainty in the halo parameters.for example, models which reproduce the measured galactic observables to withintheir errors still differ in microlensing rate towards the magellanic clouds bymore than a factor of ten. we find that while the more easily computed opticaldepth correlates well with microlensing rate, the ratio of optical depth torate can vary by a factor of two (or greater if the disk is maximal).comparison of microlensing rates towards the large and small magellanic clouds(lmc and smc) and m31 can be used to aid determinations of the halo flatteningand rotation curve slope. for example, the ratio of microlensing rates towardsthe lmc and smc is $\sim 0.7-0.8$ for e0 halos and $\sim 1.0 - 1.2$ for e7halos (c.f. sackett \&amp; gould 1993). once the flattening has been established,the ratio of microlensing rates towards m31 and the lmc may help to distinguishbetween models with rising, flat or falling rotation curves. comparison ofrates along lmc and galactic bulge lines-of-sight gives useful information onthe halo core radius, although this may not be so easy to extract in practice.maximal disk models provide substantially smaller halo optical depths, shorterevent durations and even larger model uncertainties.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.
