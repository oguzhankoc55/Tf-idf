0901.4179	submillimeter array observations of the molecular outflow in high-mass  star-forming region g240.31+0.07	we present submillimeter array observations toward the 10^{4.7} lsunstar-forming region g240.31+0.07, in the j=2-1 transition of 12co and 13co andat 1.3 mm continuum, as well as the 12co and 13co observations from the caltechsubmillimeter observatory to recover the extended emission filtered out by theinterferometer. maps of the 12co and 13co emission show a bipolar, wide-angle,quasi-parabolic molecular outflow, roughly coincident with an ir nebularevealed by the spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron emission. the outflow has ~98 msunmolecular gas, making it one of the most massive molecular outflows known, andresulting in a very high mass-loss rate of 4.1 by 10^{-3} msun yr^{-1} over adynamical timescale of 2.4 by 10^4 yr. the 1.3 mm continuum observations with a4" by 3" beam reveal a flattened dusty envelope of ~150 msun, which is furtherresolved with a 1.2" by 1" beam into three dense cores with a total mass of ~40msun. the central mm core, showing evidence of active star formation,approximately coincides with the geometric center of the bipolar outflow thusmost likely harbors the powering source of the outflow. overall ourobservations provide the best case to date of a well-defined wide-anglemolecular outflow in a &gt;10^4 lsun star-forming region. the outflow ismorphologically and kinematically similar to low-mass protostellar outflows buthas two to three orders of magnitude greater mass, momentum, and energy, and isapparently driven by an underlying wide-angle wind, hence further supports thathigh-mass stars up to late-o types, even in a crowded clustering environment,can form as a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation.

0902.0647	fragmentation at the earliest phase of massive star formation	we present 1.3mm continuum and spectral line images of two massive molecularclumps p1 and p2 in the g28.34+0.06 region with the submillimeter array. whilethe two clumps contain masses of 1000 and 880 \msun, respectively, p1 has aluminosity $&lt; 10^2$ \lsun, and a lower gas temperature and smaller line widththan p2. thus, p1 appears to be at a much earlier stage of massive starformation than p2. the high resolution sma observations reveal two distinctivecores in p2 with masses of 97 and 49 \msun, respectively. the 4 ghz spectralbandpass captures line emission from co isotopologues, so, ch$_3$oh, andch$_3$cn, similar to hot molecular cores harboring massive young stars. the p1clump, on the other hand, is resolved into five cores along the filament withmasses from 22 to 64 \msun and an average projected separation of 0.19 pc.except $^{12}$co, no molecular line emission is detected toward the p1 cores ata 1$\sigma$ rms of 0.1 k. since strong $^{12}$co and c$^{18}$o emissions areseen with the single dish telescope at a resolution of 11$''$, thenon-detection of these lines with the sma indicates a depletion factor upto$10^3$. while the spatial resolution of the sma is better than the expectedjeans length, the masses in p1 cores are much larger than the thermal jeansmass, indicating the importance of turbulence and/or magnetic fields in cloudfragmentation. the hierarchical structures in the p1 region provide a glimpseof the initial phase of massive star and cluster formation.

0907.5040	discovery of extremely high velocity "molecular bullets" in the hh 80-81  high-mass star-forming region	we present submillimter array 1.3 mm waveband continuum and molecular lineobservations of the hh 80-81 high-mass star-forming region. the dust continuumemission reveals two dominant peaks mm1 and mm2, and line emission fromhigh-density tracers suggests the presence of another core mc. molecular lineemission from mm1, which harbors the exciting source of the hh 80-81 radio jet,yields a hot molecular core at a gas temperature of 110 k. the two youngercores mm2 and mc both appear to power collimated co outflows. in particular,the outflow arising from mm2 exhibits a jet-like morphology and a broadvelocity range of 190 km/s. the outflow contains compact and fast movingmolecular clumps, known as "molecular bullets" first discovered in low-massclass 0 protostellar outflows. these "bullets" cannot be locally entrained orswept up from the ambient gas, but are more likely ejected from the closevicinity of the central protostar. the discovery of this remarkable outflowmanifests an episodic, disk-mediated accretion for massive star formation.

1002.1864	the standard model of star formation applied to massive stars: accretion  disks and envelopes in molecular lines	we address the question of whether the formation of high-mass stars issimilar to or differs from that of solar-mass stars through new molecular lineobservations and modeling of the accretion flow around the massive protostariras20126+4104. we combine new observations of nh3(1,1) and (2,2) made at thevery large array, new observations of chcn(13-12) made at the submillimeterarray, previous vla observations of nh(3,3), nh(4,4), and previous plateau debure observations of c34s(2-1), c34s(5-4), and chcn(12-11) to obtain a data setof molecular lines covering 15 to 419 k in excitation energy. we compare theseobservations against simulated molecular line spectra predicted from a modelfor high-mass star formation based on a scaled-up version of the standarddisk-envelope paradigm developed for accretion flows around low-mass stars. wefind that in accord with the standard paradigm, the observations require both awarm, dense, rapidly-rotating disk and a cold, diffuse infalling envelope. thisstudy suggests that accretion processes around 10 m stars are similar to thoseof solar mass stars.

1003.1355	the reflection-symmetric wiggle of the young protostellar jet hh 211	hh 211 is a highly collimated jet originating from a nearby young class 0protostar. here is a follow-up study of the jet with our previous observationsat unprecedented resolution up to ~ 0.3" in sio (j=8-7), co (j=3-2), and so(n_j=8_9-7_8). sio, co, and so can all be a good tracer of the hh 211 jet,tracing the internal shocks in the jet. although the emissions of thesemolecules show roughly the same morphology of the jet, there are detaileddifferences. in particular, the co emission traces the jet closer to the sourcethan the sio and so emissions. in addition, in the better resolved internalshocks, both the co and so emission are seen slightly ahead of the sioemission. the jet is clearly seen on both sides of the source with more thanone cycle of wiggle. the wiggle is reflection-symmetric about the source andcan be reasonably fitted by an orbiting source jet model. the best-fitparameters suggest that the source itself could be a very low-mass protobinarywith a total mass of ~ 60 m_jup and a binary separation of ~ 4.6 au. theabundances of sio and so in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced inthe jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds, even close to within 300au from the source where the dynamical time scale is &lt;10 yrs. the abundanceenhancements of these molecules are closely related to the internal shocks. thedetected sio is either the consequence of the release of si-bearing materialfrom dust grains or of its formation via gas chemistry in the shocks. the so,on the other hand, seems to form via gas chemistry in the shocks.

1004.2443	l1448 irs2e: a candidate first hydrostatic core	intermediate between the prestellar and class 0 protostellar phases, thefirst core is a quasi-equilibrium hydrostatic object with a short lifetime andan extremely low luminosity. recent mhd simulations suggest that the first corecan even drive a molecular outflow before the formation of the second core(i.e., protostar). using the submillimeter array and the spitzer spacetelescope, we present high angular resolution observations towards the embeddeddense core irs2e in l1448. we find that source l1448 irs2e is not visible inthe sensitive spitzer infrared images (at wavelengths from 3.6 to 70 um), andhas weak (sub-)millimeter dust continuum emission. consequently, this sourcehas an extremely low bolometric luminosity (&lt; 0.1 l_sun). infrared and(sub-)millimeter observations clearly show an outflow emanating from thissource; l1448 irs2e represents thus far the lowest luminosity source known tobe driving a molecular outflow. comparisons with prestellar cores and class 0protostars suggest that l1448 irs2e is more evolved than prestellar cores butless evolved than class 0 protostars, i.e., at a stage intermediate betweenprestellar cores and class 0 protostars. all these results are consistent withthe theoretical predictions of the radiative/magneto hydrodynamicalsimulations, making l1448 irs2e the most promising candidate of the firsthydrostatic core revealed so far.

1004.2466	from the convergence of filaments to disk-outflow accretion:  massive-star formation in w33a	interferometric observations of the w33a massive star-formation region,performed with the submillimeter array (sma) and the very large array (vla) atresolutions from 5 arcsec (0.1 pc) to 0.5 arcsec (0.01 pc) are presented. ourthree main findings are: (1) parsec-scale, filamentary structures of coldmolecular gas are detected. two filaments at different velocities intersect inthe zone where the star formation is occurring. this is consistent withtriggering of the star-formation activity by the convergence of such filaments,as predicted by numerical simulations of star formation initiated by convergingflows. (2) the two dusty cores (mm1 and mm2) at the intersection of thefilaments are found to be at different evolutionary stages, and each of them isresolved into multiple condensations. mm1 and mm2 have markedly differenttemperatures, continuum spectral indices, molecular-line spectra, and masses ofboth stars and gas. (3) the dynamics of the "hot-core" mm1 indicates thepresence of a rotating disk in its center (mm1-main) around a faint free-freesource. the stellar mass is estimated to be approximately 10 msun. a massivemolecular outflow is observed along the rotation axis of the disk.

1005.1652	a large, massive, rotating disk around an isolated young stellar object	we present multi-wavelengths observations and a radiative transfer model of anewly discovered massive circumstellar disk of gas and dust which is one of thelargest disks known today. seen almost edge-on, the disk is resolved inhigh-resolution near-infrared (nir) images and appears as a dark lane of highopacity intersecting a bipolar reflection nebula. based on molecular lineobservations we estimate the distance to the object to be 3.5 kpc. this leadsto a size for the dark lane of ~10500 au but due to shadowing effects the truedisk size could be smaller. in spitzer/irac 3.6 micron images the elongatedshape of the bipolar reflection nebula is still preserved and the bulk of theflux seems to come from disk regions that can be detected due to the slightinclination of the disk. at longer irac wavelengths, the flux is mainly comingfrom the central regions penetrating directly through the dust lane.interferometric observations of the dust continuum emission at millimeterwavelengths with the sma confirm this finding as the peak of the unresolvedmm-emission coincides perfectly with the peak of the spitzer/irac 5.8 micronflux and the center of the dark lane seen in the nir images. simultaneouslyacquired co data reveal a molecular outflow along the northern part of thereflection nebula which seems to be the outflow cavity. an elongated gaseousdisk component is also detected and shows signs of rotation. the emission isperpendicular to the molecular outflow and thus parallel to but even moreextended than the dark lane in the nir images. based on the dust continuum andthe co observations we estimate a disk mass of up to a few solar massesdepending on the underlying assumptions. whether the disk-like structure is anactual accretion disk or rather a larger-scale flattened envelope or pseudodiskis difficult to discriminate with the current dataset (abridged).

1009.2333	n2h+ depletion in the massive protostellar cluster afgl 5142	we aim at investigating with high angular resolution the nh3/n2h+ ratiotoward the high-mass star-forming region afgl 5142 in order to study whetherthis ratio behaves similarly to the low-mass case, for which the ratiodecreases from starless cores to cores associated with ysos. carma was used toobserve the 3.2 mm continuum and n2h+(1-0) emission. we used nh3(1,1) and(2,2), hco+(1-0) and h13co+(1-0) data from the literature and we performed atime-dependent chemical modeling of the region. the 3.2 mm continuum emissionreveals a dust condensation of ~23 msun associated with the massive ysos,deeply embedded in the strongest nh3 core (hereafter central core). the n2h+emission reveals two main cores, the western and eastern core, located to thewest and to the east of the mm condensation, and surrounded by a more extendedand complex structure of ~0.5 pc. toward the central core the n2h+ emissiondrops significantly, indicating a clear chemical differentiation in the region.we found low values of the nh3/n2h+ ratio ~50-100 toward the western/easterncores, and high values up to 1000 in the central core. the chemical modelindicates that density, and in particular temperature, are key parameters indetermining the nh3/n2h+ ratio. the high density and temperature reached in thecentral core allow molecules like co to evaporate from grain mantles. the codesorption causes a significant destruction of n2h+, favoring the formation ofhco+. this result is supported by our observations, which show that n2h+ andhco+ are anticorrelated in the central core. the observed values of thenh3/n2h+ ratio in the central core can be reproduced by our model for timest~4.5-5.3x10^5 yr (central) and t~10^4-3x10^6 yr (western/eastern). thenh3/n2h+ ratio in afgl 5142 does not follow the same trend as in regions oflow-mass star formation mainly due to the high temperature reached in hotcores.

1011.1442	is protostellar heating sufficient to halt fragmentation? a case study  of the massive protocluster g8.68-0.37	if star formation proceeds by thermal fragmentation and the subsequentgravitational collapse of the individual fragments, how is it possible to formfragments massive enough for o and b stars in a typical star-forming molecularcloud where the jeans mass is about 1msun at the typical densities (10^4 cm^-3)and temperatures (10k)? we test the hypothesis that a first generation oflow-mass stars may heat the gas enough that subsequent thermal fragmentationresults in fragments &gt;=10msun, sufficient to form b stars. we combine atca andsma observations of the massive star-forming region g8.68-0.37 with radiativetransfer modeling to derive the present-day conditions in the region and usethis to infer the conditions in the past, at the time of core formation.assuming the current mass/separation of the observed cores equals thefragmentation jeans mass/length and the region's average density has notchanged, requires the gas temperature to have been 100k at the time offragmentation. the postulated first-generation of low-mass stars would still bearound today, but the number required to heat the cloud exceeds the limitsimposed by the observations. several lines of evidence suggest the observedcores in the region should eventually form o stars yet none have sufficient rawmaterial. even if feedback may have suppressed fragmentation, it was notsufficient to halt it to this extent. to develop into o stars, the cores mustobtain additional mass from outside their observationally defined boundaries.the observations suggest they are currently fed via infall from the verymassive reservoir (~1500msun) of gas in the larger pc scale cloud around thestar-forming cores. this suggests that massive stars do not form in thecollapse of individual massive fragments, but rather in smaller fragments thatthemselves continue to gain mass by accretion from larger scales.

1105.4559	hierarchical fragmentation and jet-like outflows in irdc g28.34+0.06, a  growing massive protostar cluster	we present submillimeter array (sma) \lambda = 0.88mm observations of aninfrared dark cloud (irdc) g28.34+0.06. located in the quiescent southern partof the g28.34 cloud, the region of interest is a massive ($&gt;10^3$\,\msun)molecular clump p1 with a luminosity of $\sim 10^3$ \lsun, where our previoussma observations at 1.3mm have revealed a string of five dust cores of 22-64\msun\ along the 1 pc ir-dark filament. the cores are well aligned at aposition angle of 48 degrees and regularly spaced at an average projectedseparation of 0.16 pc. the new high-resolution, high-sensitivity 0.88\,mm imagefurther resolves the five cores into ten compact condensations of 1.4-10.6\msun, with sizes a few thousands au. the spatial structure at clump ($\sim 1$pc) and core ($\sim 0.1$ pc) scales indicates a hierarchical fragmentation.while the clump fragmentation is consistent with a cylindrical collapse, theobserved fragment masses are much larger than the expected thermal jeansmasses. all the cores are driving co(3-2) outflows up to 38 km/s, majority ofwhich are bipolar, jet-like outflows. the moderate luminosity of the p1 clumpsets a limit on the mass of protostars of 3-7 \msun. because of the largereservoir of dense molecular gas in the immediate medium and ongoing accretionas evident by the jet-like outflows, we speculate that p1 will grow andeventually form a massive star cluster. this study provides a first glimpse ofmassive, clustered star formation that currently undergoes through anintermediate-mass stage.

0704.2767	a jet-like outflow toward the high-mass (proto)stellar object iras  18566+0408	we performed interferometric observations of a high-mass protostellarcandidate iras 18566+0408 in the \nh3 (j,k)=(1,1), (2,2) and (3,3) inversiontransitions, the sio j=2-1 and hcn j=1-0 lines, and the 43 and 87 ghz continuumemission using the vla and ovro. the 87 ghz continuum emission reveals twocontinuum peaks mm-1 and mm-2 along a molecular ridge. the dominant peak mm-1coincides with a compact emission feature at 43 ghz, and arises mostly from thedust emission. for dust emissivity index $\beta$ of 1.3, the masses in the dustpeaks amount to 70 \msun for mm-1, and 27 \msun for mm-2. assuming internalheating, the central luminosities of mm-1 and mm-2 are $6 \times 10^4$ and $8\times 10^3$ \lsun, respectively.  the sio emission reveals a well collimated outflow emanating from mm-1. thejet-like outflow is also detected in \nh3 at velocities similar to the sioemission. the outflow, with a mass of 27 \msun, causes significant heating inthe gas to temperatures of 70 k, much higher than the temperature of $\lsim 15$k in the extended core. compact ($&lt; 3''$) and narrow line ($&lt;1.5$ \kms-1) \nh3(3,3) emission features are found associated with the outflow. they likelyarise from weak population inversion in \nh3 similar to the maser emission.  toward mm-1, there is a compact \nh3 structure with a linewidth thatincreases from 5.5 \kms-1 fhwm measured at 3$''$ resolution to 8.7 \kms-1\measured at 1$''$ resolution. this linewidth is much larger than the fwhm of$&lt;$ 2 \kms-1 in the entire core, and does not appear to originate from theoutflow. this large linewidth may arise from rotation/infall, or relativemotions of unresolved protostellar cores.

1109.3995	structure of the hot molecular core g10.47+0.03	the physical structure of hot molecular cores, where forming massive starshave heated up dense dust and gas, but have not yet ionized the molecules,poses a prominent challenge in the research of high-mass star formation andastrochemistry. we aim at constraining the spatial distribution of density,temperature, velocity field, and chemical abundances in the hot molecular coreg10.47+0.03. with the submillimeter array (sma), we obtained high spatial andspectral resolution of a multitude of molecular lines at different frequencies,including at 690 ghz. at 345 ghz, our beam size is 0.3", corresponding to 3000au. we analyze the data using the three-dimensional dust and line radiativetransfer code radmc-3d, and myxclass for line identification. we find hundredsof molecular lines from complex molecules and high excitations. evenvibrationally excited hc15n at 690 ghz is detected. the hcn abundance at hightemperatures is very high. absorption against the dust continuum occurs intwelve transitions, whose shape implies an outflow along the line-of-sight.outside the continuum peak, the line shapes are indicative of infall. dustcontinuum and molecular line emission are resolved at 345 ghz, revealingcentral flattening and rapid radial falloff of the density outwards of 10^4 au,best reproduced by a plummer radial profile of the density. no fragmentation isdetected, but modeling of the line shapes of vibrationally excited hcn suggeststhe density to be clumpy. we conclude that g10.47+0.03 is characterized bybeginning of feedback from massive stars, while infall is ongoing. large gasmasses (hundreds of msun) are heated to high temperatures, aided by diffusionof radiation in a high-column-density environment. the increased thermal,radiative, turbulent, and wind-driven pressure drives expansion in the centralregion and is likely responsible for the central flattening of the density.

1206.1907	fragmentation and ob star formation in high-mass molecular hub-filament  system	filamentary structures are ubiquitously seen in the interstellar medium. theconcentrated molecular mass in the filaments allows fragmentation to occur in ashorter timescale than the timescale of the global collapse. such hierarchicalfragmentation may further assist the dissipation of excessive angular momentum.it is crucial to resolve the morphology and the internal velocity structures ofthe molecular filaments observationally.  we perform 0".5-2".5 angular resolution interferometric observations towardthe nearly face-on ob cluster forming region g33.92+0.11. observations ofvarious spectral lines as well as the millimeter dust continuum emission,consistently trace several $\sim$1 pc scale, clumpy molecular arms. some of themolecular arms geometrically merge to an inner3.0$^{{\scriptsize{+2.8}}}_{{-\scriptsize{1.4}}}\cdot10^{3}$\,$m_{\odot}$, 0.6pc scale central molecular clump, and may directly channel the molecular gas tothe warm ($\sim$50 k) molecular gas immediately surrounding the centrallyembedded ob stars. the nh$_{3}$ spectra suggest a medium turbulence line widthof fwhm$\lesssim$2\,km\,s$^{-1}$ in the central molecular clump, implying a$\gtrsim$10 times larger molecular mass than the virial mass. feedbacks fromshocks and the centrally embedded ob stars and localized (proto)stellarclusters, likely play a key role in the heating of molecular gas and could leadto the observed chemical stratification. although (proto)stellar feedbacks arealready present, g33.92+0.11 chemically appears to be at an early evolutionarystage given by the low abundance limit of so$_{2}$ observed in this region.

1211.2666	early stages of cluster formation: fragmentation of massive dense cores  down to ~1000 au	in order to study the fragmentation of massive dense cores, which constitutethe cluster cradles, we observed with the pdbi in the most extendedconfiguration the continuum at 1.3 mm and the co(2-1) emission of four massivecores. we detect dust condensations down to ~0.3 msun and separate millimetersources down to 0.4" or ~1000 au, comparable to the sensitivities andseparations reached in optical/infrared studies of clusters. the co(2-1) highangular resolution images reveal high-velocity knots usually aligned withpreviously known outflow directions. this, in combination with additional coresfrom the literature observed at similar mass sensitivity and spatialresolution, allowed us to build a sample of 18 protoclusters with luminositiesspanning 3 orders of magnitude. among the 18 regions, ~30% show no signs offragmentation, while 50% split up into ~4 millimeter sources. we compiled alist of properties for the 18 massive dense cores, such as bolometricluminosity, total mass, and mean density, and found no correlation of any ofthese parameters with the fragmentation level. in order to investigate thecombined effects of magnetic field, radiative feedback and turbulence in thefragmentation process, we compared our observations to radiationmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations, and found that the low-fragmented regions arewell reproduced in the magnetized core case, while the highly-fragmentedregions are consistent with cores where turbulence dominates over the magneticfield. overall, our study suggests that the fragmentation in massive densecores could be determined by the initial magnetic field/turbulence balance ineach particular core.

1304.5136	properties of dense cores in clustered massive star-forming regions at  high angular resolution	we aim at characterising dense cores in the clustered environments associatedwith massive star-forming regions. for this, we present an uniform analysis ofvla nh3(1,1) and (2,2) observations towards a sample of 15 massive star-formingregions, where we identify a total of 73 cores, classify them as protostellar,quiescent starless, or perturbed starless, and derive some physical properties.the average sizes and ammonia column densities are 0.06 pc and 10^15 cm^-2,respectively, with no significant differences between the starless andprotostellar cores, while the linewidth and rotational temperature of quiescentstarless cores are smaller, 1.0 km/s and 16 k, than those of protostellar (1.8km/s, 21 k), and perturbed starless (1.4 km/s, 19 k) cores. such linewidths andtemperatures for these quiescent starless cores in the surroundings of massivestars are still significantly larger than the typical values measured instarless cores of low-mass star-forming regions, implying an importantnon-thermal component. we confirm at high angular resolutions the correlationspreviously found with single-dish telescopes between the linewidth, thetemperature of the cores, and the bolometric luminosity. in addition, we find acorrelation between the temperature of each core and the incident flux from themost massive star in the cluster, suggesting that the large temperaturesmeasured in the starless cores of our sample could be due to heating from thenearby massive star. a simple virial equilibrium analysis seems to suggest ascenario of a self-similar, self-graviting, turbulent, virialised hierarchy ofstructures from clumps (0.1-10 pc) to cores (0.05 pc). a closer inspection ofthe dynamical state taking into account external pressure effects, reveal thatrelatively strong magnetic field support may be needed to stabilise the cores,or that they are unstable and thus on the verge of collapse.

1310.8432	molecular jet of iras 04166+2706	the molecular outflow from iras 04166+2706 was mapped with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 350 ghz continuum and co j = 3$-$2 at an angular resolution of~1 arcsec. the field of view covers the central arc-minute, which contains theinner four pairs of knots of the molecular jet. on the channel map, conicalstructures are clearly present in the low velocity range (|v$-$v$_0$|$&lt;$10 kms$^{-1}$), and the highly collimated knots appear in the extremely highvelocity range (ehv, 50$&gt;$|v$-$v$_0$|$&gt;$30 km s$^{-1}$). the higher angularresolution of ~1 arcsec reveals the first blue-shifted knot (b1) that wasmissing in previous pdbi observation of sant\'iago-garc\'ia et al. (2009) at anoffset of ~6 arcsec to the north-east of the central source. thisidentification completes the symmetric sequence of knots in both the blue- andred-shifted lobes of the outflow. the innermost knots r1 and b1 have thehighest velocities within the sequence. although the general features appear tobe similar to previous co j = 2$-$1 images in sant\'iago-garc\'ia et al.(2009), the emission in co j = 3$-$2 almost always peaks further away from thecentral source than that of co j = 2$-$1 in the red-shifted lobe of the channelmaps. this gives rise to a gradient in the line-ratio map of co j = 3$-$2/j =2$-$1 from head to tail within a knot. a large velocity gradient (lvg) analysissuggests that the differences may reflect a higher gas kinetic temperature atthe head. we also explore possible constraints imposed by the non-detection ofsio j = 8$-$7.

1311.0566	from poloidal to toroidal: detection of well-ordered magnetic field in  high-mass proto-cluster g35.2-0.74n	we report on detection of an ordered magnetic field (b field) threading amassive star-forming clump in the molecular cloud g35.2-0.74, usingsubmillimeter array observations of polarized dust emission. thanks to thesensitive and high-angular-resolution observations, we are able to resolve themorphology of the b field in the plane of sky and detect a great turn of 90degree in the b field direction: over the northern part of the clump, where avelocity gradient is evident, the b field is largely aligned with the long axisof the clump, whereas in the southern part, where the velocity field appearsrelatively uniform, the b field is slightly pinched with its mean directionperpendicular to the clump elongation. we suggest that the clump forms as itsparent cloud collapses more along the large scale b field. in this process, thenorthern part carries over most of the angular momentum, forming a fastrotating system, and pulls the b field into a toroidal configuration. incontrast, the southern part is not significantly rotating and the b fieldremains in a poloidal configuration. a statistical analysis of the observedpolarization dispersion yields a b field strength of ~ 1 mg, aturbulent-to-magnetic energy ratio of order unity, and a mass-to-magnetic fluxratio of ~ 2--3 in units of the critical value. detailed calculations supportour hypothesis that the b field in the northern part is being rotationallydistorted. our observations, in conjunction with early single-dish data,suggest that the b field may play a critical role in the formation of the denseclump, whereas rotation and turbulence could also be important in furtherdynamical evolution of the clump. the observations also provide evidence for awide-angle outflow driven from a strongly rotating region whose b field islargely toroidal.

1405.1013	core and filament formation in magnetized, self-gravitating isothermal  layers	we examine the role of the gravitational instability in an isothermal,self-gravitating layer threaded by magnetic fields on the formation offilaments and dense cores. using numerical simulation we follow the non-linearevolution of a perturbed equilibrium layer. the linear evolution of such alayer is described in the analytic work of nagai et al (1998). we find thatfilaments and dense cores form simultaneously. depending on the initialmagnetic field, the resulting filaments form either a spiderweb-like network(for weak magnetic fields) or a network of parallel filaments alignedperpendicular to the magnetic field lines (for strong magnetic fields).although the filaments are radially collapsing, the density profile of theircentral region (up to the thermal scale height) can be approximated by ahydrodynamical equilibrium density structure. thus, the magnetic field does notplay a significant role in setting the density distribution of the filaments.the density distribution outside of the central region deviates from theequilibrium. the radial column density distribution is then flatter than theexpected power law of $r^{-4}$ and similar to filament profiles observed withherschel. our results does not explain the near constant filament width of$\sim 0.1$pc. however, our model does not include turbulent motions. it isexpected that accretion-driven amplification of these turbulent motionsprovides additional support within the filaments against gravitationalcollapse. finally, we interpret the filamentary network of the massive starforming complex g14.225-0.506 in terms of the gravitational instability modeland find that the properties of the complex are consistent with being formedout of an unstable layer threaded by a strong, parallel magnetic field.

1407.3984	magnetic fields and massive star formation	massive stars ($m &gt; 8$ \msun) typically form in parsec-scale molecular clumpsthat collapse and fragment, leading to the birth of a cluster of stellarobjects. we investigate the role of magnetic fields in this process throughdust polarization at 870 $\mu$m obtained with the submillimeter array (sma).the sma observations reveal polarization at scales of $\lsim$ 0.1 pc. thepolarization pattern in these objects ranges from ordered hour-glassconfigurations to more chaotic distributions. by comparing the sma data withthe single dish data at parsec scales, we found that magnetic fields at densecore scales are either aligned within $40^\circ$ of or perpendicular to theparsec-scale magnetic fields. this finding indicates that magnetic fields playan important role during the collapse and fragmentation of massive molecularclumps and the formation of dense cores. we further compare magnetic fields indense cores with the major axis of molecular outflows. despite a limited numberof outflows, we found that the outflow axis appears to be randomly orientedwith respect to the magnetic field in the core. this result suggests that atthe scale of accretion disks ($\lsim 10^3$ au), angular momentum and dynamicinteractions possibly due to close binary or multiple systems dominate overmagnetic fields. with this unprecedentedly large sample massive clumps, weargue on a statistical basis that magnetic fields play an important role duringthe formation of dense cores at spatial scale of 0.01 - 0.1 pc in the contextof massive star and cluster star formation.

1503.08797	initial fragmentation in the infrared dark cloud g28.53-0.25	to study the fragmentation and gravitational collapse of dense cores ininfrared dark clouds (irdcs), we have obtained submillimeter continuum andspectral line data as well as multiple inversion transitions of nh3 and h2omaser data of four massive clumps in an irdc g28.53-0.25. combining single dishand interferometer nh3 data, we derive the rotation temperature of g28.53. weidentity 12 dense cores at 0.1 pc scale based on submillimeter continuum, andobtain their physical properties using nh3 and continuum data. by comparing thejeans masses of cores with the core masses, we find that turbulent pressure isimportant in supporting the gas when 1 pc scale clumps fragment into 0.1 pcscale cores. all cores have a virial parameter smaller than 1 assuming ainverse squared radial density profile, suggesting they are gravitationallybound, and the three most promising star forming cores have a virial parametersmaller than 1 even taking magnetic field into account. we also associate thecores with star formation activities revealed by outflows, masers, or infraredsources. unlike what previous studies suggested, mm1 turns out to harbor a fewstar forming cores and is likely a progenitor of high-mass star cluster. mm5 isintermediate while mm7/8 are quiescent in terms of star formation, but theyalso harbor gravitationally bound dense cores and have the potential of formingstars as in mm1.

1507.04205	sma observations of c2h in high-mass star forming regions	c$_2$h is a representative hydrocarbon that is abundant and ubiquitous in theinterstellar medium (ism). to study its chemical properties, we presentsubmillimeter array (sma) observations of the c$_2$h $n=3-2$ and hc$_3$n$j=30-29$ transitions and the 1.1 mm continuum emission toward four obcluster-forming regions, afgl 490, on 1, w33 main, and g10.6-0.4, which cover abolometric luminosity range of $\sim$10$^3$--10$^6$ $l_{\odot}$. we found thaton large scales, the c$_2$h emission traces the dense molecular envelope.however, for all observed sources, the peaks of c$_2$h emission are offset byseveral times times 10$^4$ au from the peaks of 1.1 mm continuum emission,where the most luminous stars are located. by comparing the distribution andprofiles of c$_2$h hyperfine lines and the 1.1 mm continuum emission, we findthat the c$_2$h column density (and abundance) around the 1.1 mm continuumpeaks is lower than those in the ambient gas envelope. chemical models suggestthat c$_2$h might be transformed to other species owing to increasedtemperature and density; thus, its reduced abundance could be the signpost ofthe heated molecular gas in the $\sim$10$^4$ au vicinity around the embeddedhigh-mass stars. our results support such theoretical prediction for centrallyembedded $\sim10^3$--$10^6l_{\odot}$ ob star-forming cores, while futurehigher-resolution observations are required to examine the c$_2$htransformation around the localized sites of high-mass star formation.

0806.0217	sma imaging of co(3-2) line and 860 micron continuum of arp 220 :  tracing the spatial distribution of luminosity	we used the submillimeter array (sma) to image 860 micron continuum andco(3-2) line emission in the ultraluminous merging galaxy arp 220, achieving aresolution of 0.23" (80 pc) for the continuum and 0.33" (120 pc) for the line.the co emission peaks around the two merger nuclei with a velocity signature ofgas rotation around each nucleus, and is also detected in a kpc-size diskencompassing the binary nucleus. the dust continuum, in contrast, is mostlyfrom the two nuclei. the beam-averaged brightness temperature of both line andcontinuum emission exceeds 50 k at and around the nuclei, revealing thepresence of warm molecular gas and dust. the dust emission morphologicallyagrees with the distribution of radio supernova features in the east nucleus,as expected when a starburst heats the nucleus. in the brighter west nucleus,however, the submillimeter dust emission is more compact than the supernovadistribution. the 860 micron core, after deconvolution, has a size of 50-80 pc,consistent with recent 1.3 mm observations, and a peak brightness temperatureof (0.9-1.6)x10^2 k. its bolometric luminosity is at least 2x10^{11} lsun andcould be ~10^{12} lsun depending on source structure and 860 micron opacity,which we estimate to be of the order of tau_{860} ~ 1 (i.e., n_{h_2} ~ 10^{25}cm^{-2}). the starbursting west nuclear disk must have in its center a dustenshrouded agn or a very young starburst equivalent to hundreds of super starclusters. further spatial mapping of bolometric luminosity throughsubmillimeter imaging is a promising way to identify the heavily obscuredheating sources in arp 220 and other luminous infrared galaxies.

1510.07094	self-similar fragmentation regulated by magnetic fields in a massive  star forming filament	most molecular clouds are filamentary or elongated. among those forminglow-mass stars, their long axes tend to be either parallel or perpendicular tothe large-scale (10-100 pc) magnetic field (b-field) in the surrounding intercloud medium. this arises because, along the dynamically dominant b-fields, thecompetition between self-gravity and turbulent pressure will shape the cloud tobe elongated either perpendicular or parallel to the fields. recent study alsosuggested that, on the scales of 0.1-0.01 pc, fields are dynamically importantwithin cloud cores forming massive stars. but whether the core fieldmorphologies are inherited from the inter cloud medium or governed by cloudturbulence is under vigorous debate, so is the role played by b-fields in cloudfragmentation at 10 - 0.1 pc scales. here we report b-field maps covering100-0.01 pc scales inferred from polarimetric observations of a massive-starforming region, ngc 6334. first, the main filament also lies perpendicular tothe ambient field. ngc 6334 hosts young star-forming sites where fields are notseverely affected by stellar feedback, and their directions do not changesignificantly over the entire scale range. this means that the fields aredynamically important. at various scales, we find that the hourglass-shapedfield lines are pinched where the gas column density peaks and the fieldstrength is proportional to the 0.4-power of the density. we conclude thatb-fields play a crucial role in the fragmentation of ngc 6334.

astro-ph;0612027	multiple jets from the high-mass (proto)stellar cluster afgl5142	we present studies of a massive protocluster afgl5142 in the j=2-1 transitionof the co isotopologues, so, ch_3oh and ch_3cn lines, as well as continuum at225 ghz and 8.4 ghz. the 225 ghz continuum emission reveals three prominentpeaks mm-1, mm-2 and mm-3. mm-1 and mm-2 are associated with strong ch_3cnemission with temperatures of 90 \pm 20 and 250 \pm 40 k, respectively, whileboth mm-1 and mm-3 are associated with faint continuum emission at 8.4 ghz.additional dust continuum peaks mm-4 and mm-5 appear to be associated with \h2omasers. with many continuum sources at cm and mm wavelengths, and those alreadyidentified in the infrared, this region is forming a cluster of stars.  the co and so emission reveals at least three molecular outflows originatingfrom the center of the dust core. the outflows are well collimated, withterminal velocities up to 50 \kms-1 from the cloud velocity. outflow acoincides with the sio jet identified previously by hunter et al. (1999). sincejet-like outflows and disk-mediated accretion process are physically connected,the well collimated outflows indicate that even in this cluster environment,accretion is responsible for the formation of individual stars in the cluster.

astro-ph;0701115	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. i. overview  of program: envelopes, disks, outflows and hot cores	this paper presents a large spectral line and continuum survey of 8 deeplyembedded, low-mass protostellar cores using the submillimeter array. eachsource was observed in high excitation lines of some of the most commonmolecular species, co, hco+, cs, so, h2co, ch3oh and sio. line emission from 11species originating from warm and dense gas have been imaged at high angularresolution (1-3"; typically 200-600 au) together with continuum emission at 230ghz (1.3 mm) and 345 ghz (0.8 mm). compact continuum emission is observed forall sources which likely originates in marginally optically thick circumstellardisks, with typical lower limits to their masses of 0.1 m_sun (1-10% of themasses of their envelopes) and having a dust opacity law with betaapproximately 1. prominent outflows are present in co 2-1 observations in allsources: the most diffuse outflows are found in the sources with the lowestratios of disk-to-envelope mass, and it is suggested that these sources are ina phase where accretion of matter from the envelope has almost finished and theremainder of the envelope material is being dispersed by the outflows. othercharacteristic dynamical signatures are found with inverse p cygni profilesindicative of infalling motions seen in the 13co 2-1 lines towardngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. outflow-induced shocks are present on all scales inthe protostellar environments and are most clearly traced by the emission ofch3oh in ngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. these observations suggest that theemission of ch3oh and h2co from these proposed "hot corinos" are related to theshocks caused by the protostellar outflows. only one source, ngc1333-iras2a,has evidence for hot, compact ch3oh emission coincident with the embeddedprotostar.

astro-ph;0701284	hh 212: sma observations of a remarkable protostellar jet	hh 212 is a nearby (460 pc) protostellar jet discovered in h$_2$ powered by aclass 0 source, iras 05413-0104, in the l1630 cloud of orion. it is highlycollimated and symmetric with matched pairs of bow shocks on either side of thesource. we have mapped it in 850 $\mu$m continuum, sio ($j=8-7$), co ($j=3-2$),so ($n_j=8_9-7_8$), hco$^+$ ($j = 4-3$), and h$^{13}$co$^+$ ($j = 4-3$)emission simultaneously at $\sim$ 1$''$ resolution with the submillimeter array(sma). thermal dust emission is seen in continuum around the source, mainlyarising from an inner envelope (i.e., the inner part of a previously seenflattened envelope) and a possible disk. the inner envelope is also seen withrotation in co, hco$^+$, and probably so. like h$_2$ emission, co and sioemission are seen along the jet axis but extending closer to the source,tracing the bow shocks with a broad range of velocities and the continuousstructures in between. so emission is seen only around the source, forming ajetlike structure extending along the jet axis from the source, likely tracingthe jet near the launching region. the jet is episodic and bending. it may alsobe slightly precessing as the jetlike so structure shows a slight s-shapedsymmetry about the source. a hint of jet rotation is also seen across the jetaxis. internal outflow shells are seen in co and hco$^+$, associated with thebow shocks in the inner part of the jet. the bases of the hco$^+$ shells areseen with a hint of rotation similar to that seen in the inner envelope,probably consisted mainly of the material extended from the inner envelope andeven the possible disk.

astro-ph;0701504	star formation in a clustered environment around the uchii region in  iras 20293+3952	we aim at studying the cluster environment surrounding the uchii region iniras 20293+3952, a region in the first stages of formation of a cluster arounda high-mass star. bima and vla were used to observe the 3 mm continuum,n2h+(1-0), nh3(1,1) and (2,2), and ch3oh(2-1) emission of the surroundings ofthe uchii region. we studied the kinematics of the region and computed therotational temperature and column density maps by fitting the hyperfinestructure of n2h+ and nh3. the dense gas traced by n2h+ and nh3 shows twodifferent clouds, a main cloud to the east of the uchii region, of 0.5 pc and250 msun, and a western cloud, of 0.15 pc and 30 msun. the dust emissionreveals two strong components in the northern side of the main cloud,associated with young stellar objects (ysos) driving molecular outflows, andtwo fainter components in the southern side, with no signs of star formingactivity. regarding the ch3oh, we found strong emission in a fork-likestructure associated with outflow b, as well as emission associated withoutflow a. the rotational temperature is higher in the northern side of themain cloud, around 22 k, where there are most of the ysos, than in the southernside, around 16 k. there is strong chemical differentiation in the region,since we determined low values of the nh3/n2h+ ratio, around 50, associatedwith ysos in the north of the main cloud, and high values, up to 300,associated with cores with no detected ysos, in the south of the main cloud.such a chemical differentiation is likely due to abundance/depletion effects.finally, interaction between the different sources in the region is important,mainly through their uv radiation and outflows (abridged).
