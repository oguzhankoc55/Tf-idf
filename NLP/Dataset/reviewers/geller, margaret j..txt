0707.0484	$\mu$--photoz: photometric redshifts by inverting the tolman surface  brightness test	surface brightness is a fundamental observational parameter of galaxies. weshow, for the first time in detail, how it can be used to obtain photometricredshifts for galaxies, the $\mu$-photoz method.  we demonstrate that the tolman surface brightness relation, $\mu \propto(1+z)^{-4}$, is a powerful tool for determining galaxy redshifts fromphotometric data.  we develop a model using $\mu$ and a color percentile (ranking) measure todemonstrate the $\mu$-photoz method. we apply our method to a set of galaxiesfrom the shels survey, and demonstrate that the photometric redshift accuracyachieved using the surface brightness method alone is comparable with the bestcolor-based methods.  we show that the $\mu$-photoz method is very effective in determining theredshift for red galaxies using only two photometric bands. we discuss theproperties of the small, skewed, non-gaussian component of the errordistribution.  we calibrate $\mu_r, (r-i)$ from the sdss to redshift, and tabulate theresult, providing a simple, but accurate look up table to estimate the redshiftof distant red galaxies.

0907.5567	runaway stars, hypervelocity stars, and radial velocity surveys	runaway stars ejected from the galactic disk populate the halo of the milkyway. to predict the spatial and kinematic properties of runaways, we injectstars into a galactic potential, compute their trajectories through the galaxy,and derive simulated catalogs for comparison with observations. runaways have aflattened spatial distribution, with higher velocity stars at galacticlatitudes less than 30 degrees. due to their shorter stellar lifetimes, massiverunaway stars are more concentrated towards the disk than low mass runaways.bound (unbound) runaways that reach the halo probably originate from distancesof 6--12 kpc (10--15 kpc) from the galactic center, close to the estimatedorigin of the unbound runaway star hd 271791. because runaways are brighter andhave smaller velocities than hypervelocity stars (hvss), radial velocitysurveys are unlikely to confuse runaway stars with hvss. we estimate that atmost 1 runaway star contaminates the current sample. we place an upper limit of2% on the fraction of a-type main sequence stars ejected as runaways.

0910.2242	velocity dispersion profile of the milky way halo	we present a spectroscopic sample of 910 distant halo stars from thehypervelocity star survey from which we derive the velocity dispersion profileof the milky way halo. the sample is a mix of 74% evolved horizontal branchstars and 26% blue stragglers. we estimate distances to the stars usingobserved colors, metallicities, and stellar evolution tracks. our samplecontains twice as many objects with r&gt;50 kpc as previous surveys. we computethe velocity dispersion profile in two ways: with a parametric method based ona milky way potential model, and with a non-parametric method based on thecaustic technique originally developed to measure galaxy cluster mass profiles.the resulting velocity dispersion profiles are remarkably consistent with thosefound by two independent surveys based on other stellar populations: the milkyway halo exhibits a mean decline in radial velocity dispersion of -0.38+-0.12km/s/kpc over 15&lt;r&lt;75 kpc. this measurement is a useful basis for calculatingthe total mass and mass distribution of the milky way halo.

0911.0417	evolution of the halpha luminosity function	the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey (shels) is a window on the starformation history over the last 4 gyr. shels is a spectroscopically completesurvey for rtot &lt; 20.3 over 4 square degrees. we use the 10k spectra to selecta sample of pure star forming galaxies based on their halpha emission line. weuse the spectroscopy to determine extinction corrections for individualgalaxies and to remove active galaxies in order to reduce systematicuncertainties. we use the large volume of shels with the depth of a narrowbandsurvey for halpha galaxies at z ~ 0.24 to make a combined determination of thehalpha luminosity function at z ~ 0.24. the large area covered by shels yieldsa survey volume big enough to determine the bright end of the halpha luminosityfunction from redshift 0.100 to 0.377 for an assumed fixed faint-end slopealpha = -1.20. the bright end evolves: the characteristic luminosity l*increases by 0.84 dex over this redshift range. similarly, the star formationdensity increases by 0.11 dex. the fraction of galaxies with a close neighborincreases by a factor of 2-5 for l(halpha) &gt;~ l* in each of the redshift bins.we conclude that triggered star formation is an important influence for starforming galaxies with halpha emission.

0912.2364	shels: testing weak lensing maps with redshift surveys	weak lensing surveys are emerging as an important tool for the constructionof "mass selected" clusters of galaxies. we evaluate both the efficiency andcompleteness of a weak lensing selection by combining a dense, completeredshift survey, the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey (shels), with a weaklensing map from the deep lens survey (dls). shels includes 11,692 redshiftsfor galaxies with r &lt; 20.6 in the four square degree dls field; the survey is asolid basis for identifying massive clusters of galaxies with redshift z &lt;0.55. the range of sensitivity of the redshift survey is similar to the rangefor the dls convergence map. only four the twelve convergence peaks withsignal-to-noise &gt; 3.5 correspond to clusters of galaxies with m &gt; 1.7 x 10^14solar masses. four of the eight massive clusters in shels are detected in theweak lensing map yielding a completeness of roughly 50%. we examine the sevenknown extended cluster x-ray sources in the dls field: three can be detected inthe weak lensing map, three should not be detected without boosting fromsuperposed large-scale structure, and one is mysteriously undetected eventhough its optical properties suggest that it should produce a detectablelensing signal. taken together, these results underscore the need for moreextensive comparisons among different methods of massive clusteridentification.

1001.0006	comparison of hectospec virial masses with sze measurements	we present the first comparison of virial masses of galaxy clusters withtheir sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) signals. we study 15 clusters from thehectospec cluster survey (hecs) with mmt/hectospec spectroscopy and publishedsze signals. we measure virial masses of these clusters from an average of 90member redshifts inside the radius $r_{100}$. the virial masses of the clustersare strongly correlated with their sze signals (at the 99% confidence levelusing a spearman rank-sum test). this correlation suggests that $y_{sz}$ can beused as a measure of virial mass. simulations predict a powerlaw scaling of$y_{sz}\propto m_{200}^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx$1.6. observationally, wefind $\alpha$=1.11$\pm$0.16, significantly shallower (given the formaluncertainty) than the theoretical prediction. however, the selection functionof our sample is unknown and a bias against less massive clusters cannot beexcluded (such a selection bias could artificially flatten the slope).moreover, our sample indicates that the relation between velocity dispersion(or virial mass estimate) and sze signal has significant intrinsic scatter,comparable to the range of our current sample. more detailed studies of scalingrelations are therefore needed to derive a robust determination of the relationbetween cluster mass and sze.

1002.0386	triggered star formation in galaxy pairs at z=0.08-0.38	we measure the strength, frequency, and timescale of tidally triggered starformation at redshift z=0.08-0.38 in a spectroscopically complete sample ofgalaxy pairs drawn from the magnitude-limited redshift survey of 9,825smithsonian hectospec lensing survey (shels) galaxies with r&lt;20.3. to examinethe evidence for tidal triggering, we identify a volume-limited sample of major(|\delta m_r|&lt;1.75, corresponding to mass ratio &gt;1/5) pair galaxies with $m_r &lt;-20.8 in the redshift range z=0.08-0.31. the size and completeness of thespectroscopic survey allows us to focus on regions of low local density. thespectrophotometric calibration enables the use of the 4000 ang break (d_n4000),the h\alpha specific star formation rate (ssfr_{h\alpha}), and populationmodels to characterize the galaxies. we show that d_n4000 is a usefulpopulation classification tool; it closely tracks the identification ofemission line galaxies. the sample of major pair galaxies in regions of lowlocal density with low d_n4000 demonstrates the expected anti-correlationbetween pair-wise projected separation and a set of star formation indicatorsexplored in previous studies. we measure the frequency of triggered starformation by comparing the ssfr_{h\alpha} in the volume-limited sample inregions of low local density: 32 +/-7% of the major pair galaxies havessfr_{h\alpha} at least double the median rate of the unpaired field galaxies.comparison of stellar population models for pair and for unpaired fieldgalaxies implies a timescale for triggered star formation of ~300-400 myr.

1005.2619	the mass profile of the galaxy to 80 kpc	the hypervelocity star survey presents the currently largest sample of radialvelocity measurements of halo stars out to 80 kpc. we apply spherical jeansmodeling to these data in order to derive the mass profile of the galaxy. werestrict the analysis to distances larger than 25 kpc from the galactic center,where the density profile of halo stars is well approximated by a single powerlaw with logarithmic slope between -3.5 and -4.5. with this restriction, wealso avoid the complication of modeling a flattened galactic disk. in the range25 &lt; r &lt; 80 kpc, the radial velocity dispersion declines remarkably little; arobust measure of its logarithmic slope is between -0.05 and -0.1. the circularvelocity profile also declines remarkably little with radius. the allowed rangeof v_c(80 kpc) lies between 175 and 231 km/s, with the most likely value 193km/s. compared with the value at the solar location, the galactic circularvelocity declines by less than 20% over an order of magnitude in radius. such aflat profile requires a massive and extended dark matter halo. the massenclosed within 80 kpc is 6.9(+3.0-1.2) 10^11 msun. our sample of radialvelocities is large enough that the biggest uncertainty in the mass is notstatistical but systematic, dominated by the density slope and anisotropy ofthe tracer population. further progress requires modeling observed datasetswithin realistic simulations of galaxy formation.

1006.2823	empirical optical k-corrections for redshifts &lt;= 0.7	the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey (shels) is a magnitude limitedspectroscopically complete survey for r&lt;=21.0 covering 4 square degrees. shelsprovides a large sample (15,513) of flux calibrated spectra. the wavelengthrange covered by the spectra allows empirical determination of k-correctionsfor the g- and r-band from z=0 to ~0.68 and 0.33, respectively, based on largesamples of spectra. we approximate the k-corrections using only two parametersin a standard way: dn4000 and redshift. we use dn4000 rather than the standardobserved galaxy color because dn4000 is a redshift independent tracer of thestellar population of the galaxy. our approximations for the k-correctionsusing dn4000 are as good as (or better than) those based on observed galaxycolor (g-r) (sigma of the scatter is ~0.08 mag). the approximations for thek-corrections are available in an on-line calculator. our results agree withpreviously determined analytical approximations from single stellar population(ssp) models fitted to multi-band optical and near-infrared photometry forgalaxies with a known redshift. galaxies with the smallest dn4000-the galaxieswith the youngest stellar populations-are always attenuated and/or containcontributions from older stellar populations. we use simple single ssp fits tothe shels spectra to study the influence of emission lines on the k-correction.the effects of emission lines can be ignored for rest-frame equivalent widths&lt;~ 100 a depending on required photometric accuracy. we also provide analyticapproximations to the k-corrections determined from our model fits for z&lt;=0.7as a function of redshift and dn4000 for ugriz and ubvri (sigma of the scatteris typically ~0.10 mag). again, the approximations using dn4000 are as good (orbetter than) those based on a suitably chosen observed galaxy color. we provideall analytical approximations in an on-line calculator.

0709.1471	hypervelocity stars iii. the space density and ejection history of main  sequence stars from the galactic center	we report the discovery of 3 new unbound hypervelocity stars (hvss), starstraveling with such extreme velocities that dynamical ejection from a massiveblack hole (mbh) is their only suggested origin. we also detect a population ofpossibly bound hvss. the significant asymmetry we observe in the velocitydistribution -- we find 26 stars with v_rf &gt; 275 km/s and 1 star with v_rf &lt;-275 km/s -- shows that the hvss must be short-lived, probably 3 - 4 msun mainsequence stars. any population of hypervelocity post-main sequence stars shouldcontain stars falling back onto the galaxy, contrary to the observations. thespatial distribution of hvss also supports the main sequence interpretation:longer-lived 3 msun hvss fill our survey volume; shorter-lived 4 msun hvss aremissing at faint magnitudes. we infer that there are 96 +- 10 hvss of mass 3 -4 msun within r &lt; 100 kpc, possibly enough hvss to constrain ejectionmechanisms and potential models. depending on the mass function of hvss, wepredict that segue may find up to 5 - 15 new hvss. the travel times of our hvssfavor a continuous ejection process, although a ~120 myr-old burst of hvss isalso allowed.

1107.2930	the faint end of the luminosity function and low surface brightness  galaxies	shels (smithsonian hectospec lensing survey) is a dense redshift surveycovering a 4 square degree region to a limiting r = 20.6. in the constructionof the galaxy catalog and in the acquisition of spectroscopic targets, we paidcareful attention to the survey completeness for lower surface brightness dwarfgalaxies. thus, although the survey covers a small area, it is a robust basisfor computation of the slope of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity functionto a limiting m_r = -13.3 + 5logh. we calculate the faint end slope in ther-band for the subset of shels galaxies with redshif ts in the range 0.02 &lt;= z&lt; 0.1, shels_{0.1}. this sample contains 532 galaxies with r&lt; 20.6 and with amedian surface brightness within the half light radius of sb_{50,r} = 21.82 magarcsec^{-2}. we used this sample to make one of the few direct measurements ofthe dependence of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function on surfacebrightness. for the sample as a whole the faint end slope, alpha = -1.31 +/-0.04, is consistent with both the blanton et al. (2005b) analysis of the sdssand the liu et al. (2008) analysis of the cosmos field. this consistency isimpressive given the very different approaches of th ese three surveys. amagnitude limited sample of 135 galaxies with optical spectroscopic reds hiftswith mean half-light surface brightness, sb_{50,r} &gt;= 22.5 mag arcsec^{-2} isunique to shels_{0.1}. the faint end slope is alpha_{22.5} = -1.52+/- 0.16.shels_{0.1} shows that lower surface brightness objects dominate the faint endslope of the l uminosity function in the field, underscoring the importance ofsurface brightness limits in evaluating measurements of the faint end slope andits evolution.

0710.1082	spectroscopic determination of the faint end of the luminosity function  in the nearby galaxy clusters a2199 and virgo	we report a new determination of the faint end of the galaxy luminosityfunction in the nearby clusters virgo and abell 2199 using data from sdss andthe hectospec multifiber spectrograph on the mmt. the luminosity function ofa2199 is consistent with a single schechter function to m_r=-15.6 + 5 log h_70with a faint-end slope of alpha=-1.13+/-0.07. the lf in virgo extends tom_r=-13.5= m^*+8 and has a slope of alpha=-1.28+/-0.06. the red sequence ofcluster members is prominent in both clusters, and almost no cluster galaxiesare redder than this sequence. we show that selecting objects on the redsequence and blueward produces a steeply rising faint-end. a large fraction ofphotometric red-sequence galaxies lie behind the cluster. we compare ourresults to previous estimates and find poor agreement with estimates based onstatistical background subtraction but good agreement with estimates based onphotometric membership classifications (e.g., colors, morphology, surfacebrightness). we conclude that spectroscopic data are critical for estimatingthe faint end of the luminosity function in clusters. the faint-end slope wefind is consistent with values found for field galaxies, weakening any argumentfor environmental evolution in the relative abundance of dwarf galaxies.however, dwarf galaxies in clusters are significantly redder than fieldgalaxies of similar luminosity or mass, indicating that star formationprocesses in dwarfs do depend on environment.

1112.1919	identifying star streams in the milky way halo	we develop statistical methods for identifying star streams in the halo ofthe milky way galaxy that exploit observed spatial and radial velocitydistributions. within a great circle, departures of the observed spatialdistribution from random provide a measure of the likelihood of a potentialstar stream. comparisons between the radial velocity distribution within agreat circle and the radial velocity distribution of the entire sample alsomeasure the statistical significance of potential streams. the radialvelocities enable construction of a more powerful joint statistical test foridentifying star streams in the milky way halo. applying our method to halostars in the hypervelocity star (hvs) survey, we detect the sagittarius streamat high significance. great circle counts and comparisons with theoreticalmodels suggest that the sagittarius stream comprises 10% to 17% of the halostars in the hvs sample. the population of blue stragglers and blue horizontalbranch stars varies along the stream and is a potential probe of thedistribution of stellar populations in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy prior todisruption.

1203.3543	mmt hypervelocity star survey. ii. five new unbound stars	we present the discovery of five new unbound hypervelocity stars (hvss) inthe outer milky way halo. using a conservative estimate of galactic escapevelocity, our targeted spectroscopic survey has now identified 16 unbound hvssas well as a comparable number of hvss ejected on bound trajectories. agalactic center origin for the hvss is supported by their unbound velocities,the observed number of unbound stars, their stellar nature, their ejection timedistribution, and their galactic latitude and longitude distribution. otherproposed origins for the unbound hvss, such as runaway ejections from the diskor dwarf galaxy tidal debris, cannot be reconciled with the observations. anintriguing result is the spatial anisotropy of hvss on the sky, which possiblyreflects an anisotropic potential in the central 10-100 pc region of thegalaxy. further progress requires measurement of the spatial distribution ofhvss over the southern sky. our survey also identifies seven b supergiantsassociated with known star-forming galaxies; the absence of b supergiantselsewhere in the survey implies there are no new star-forming galaxies in oursurvey footprint to a depth of 1-2 mpc.

1204.2597	a wise view of a nearby supercluster a2199	we use wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) data covering the entireregion (~130 deg^2) of the a2199 supercluster at z=0.03 to study themid-infrared (mir) properties of supercluster galaxies. we identify a `mirstar-forming sequence' in the wise [3.4]-[12] color-12 \mu m luminositydiagram, consisting of late-type, star-forming galaxies. at a fixed starformation rate (sfr), the mir-detected galaxies at 22 \mu m or 12 \mu m tend tobe more metal rich and to have higher surface brightness than those without mirdetection. using these mir-detected galaxies, we construct the ir luminosityfunction (lf) and investigate its environmental dependence. both total ir (tir)and 12 \mu m lfs are dominated by late-type, star-forming galaxies. thecontribution of active galactic nuclei (agn)-host galaxies increases with bothtir and 12 \mu m luminosities. the contribution of early-type galaxies to the12 \mu m lfs increases with decreasing luminosity. the faint-end slope of thetir lfs does not change with environment, but the change of faint-end slope inthe 12 \mu m lfs with the environment is significant: there is a steeperfaint-end slope in the cluster core than in the cluster outskirts. thissteepening results primarily from the increasing contribution of early-typegalaxies toward the cluster. these galaxies are passively evolving, and containold stellar populations with weak mir emission from the circumstellar dustaround asymptotic giant branch stars.

1206.4057	the nature of hypervelocity stars and the time between their formation  and ejection	we obtain keck hires spectroscopy of hvs5, one of the fastest unbound starsin the milky way halo. we show that hvs5 is a 3.62 +- 0.11 msun main sequence bstar at a distance of 50 +- 5 kpc. the difference between its age and itsflight time from the galactic center is 105 +-18(stat)+-30(sys) myr; flighttimes from locations elsewhere in the galactic disk are similar. this 10^8 yr`arrival time' between formation and ejection is difficult to reconcile withany ejection scenario involving massive stars that live for only 10^7 yr. forcomparison, we derive arrival times of 10^7 yr for two unbound runaway b stars,consistent with their disk origin where ejection results from a supernova in abinary system or dynamical interactions between massive stars in a dense starcluster. for hvs5, ejection during the first 10^7 yr of its lifetime is ruledout at the 3-sigma level. together with the 10^8 yr arrival times inferred forthree other well-studied hypervelocity stars (hvss), these results areconsistent with a galactic center origin for the hvss. if the hvss were indeedejected by the central black hole, then the galactic center was forming stars~200 myr ago, and the progenitors of the hvss took ~100 myr to enter the blackhole's loss cone.

1209.3786	measuring the ultimate mass of galaxy clusters: redshifts and mass  profiles from the hectospec cluster survey (hecs)	the infall regions of galaxy clusters represent the largest gravitationallybound structures in a $\lambda$cdm universe. measuring cluster mass profilesinto the infall regions provides an estimate of the ultimate mass of thesehaloes. we use the caustic technique to measure cluster mass profiles fromgalaxy redshifts obtained with the hectospec cluster survey (hecs), anextensive spectroscopic survey of galaxy clusters with mmt/hectospec. we survey58 clusters selected by x-ray flux at 0.1$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$0.3. the survey includes21,314 unique mmt/hectospec redshifts for individual galaxies; 10,275 of thesegalaxies are cluster members. for each cluster we acquired high signal-to-noisespectra for $\sim 200$ cluster members and a comparable number offoreground/background galaxies. the cluster members trace out infall patternsaround the clusters. the members define a very narrow red sequence. thevelocity dispersions decline with radius; we demonstrate that the determinationof the velocity dispersion is insensitive to the inclusion of bluer members (asmall fraction of the cluster population). we apply the caustic technique todefine membership and estimate the mass profiles to large radii. the ultimatehalo mass of clusters (the mass that remains bound in the far future of a$\lambda$cdm universe) is on average (1.99$\pm$0.11)$m_{200}$, a newobservational cosmological test in essential agreement with simulations. summedprofiles binned in $m_{200}$ and in $l_x$ demonstrate that the predicted nfwform of the density profile is a remarkably good representation of the data inagreement with weak lensing results extending to large radius. theconcentration of these summed profiles is also consistent with theoreticalpredictions.

1209.5675	measuring the mass distribution in galaxy clusters	cluster mass profiles are tests of models of structure formation. only twocurrent observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitationallensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption ofdynamical equilibrium. both techniques enable determination of the extendedmass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. for 19 clusters, we compare themass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurementstaken from the literature. this comparison offers a test of systematic issuesin both techniques. around the virial radius, the two methods of massestimation agree to within about 30%, consistent with the expected errors inthe individual techniques. at small radii, the caustic technique overestimatesthe mass as expected from numerical simulations. the ratio between the lensingprofile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weaklensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. at radiilarger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the causticmass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile bylarge-scale structures within the lensing kernel. we highlight the case of theclosely neighboring clusters ms0906+11 and a750 to illustrate the potentialseriousness of contamination of the the weak lensing signal by unrelatedstructures.

1304.4656	reducing systematic error in cluster scale weak lensing	weak lensing provides an important route toward collecting samples ofclusters of galaxies selected by mass. subtle systematic errors in imagereduction can compromise the power of this technique. we use the b-mode signalto quantify this systematic error and to test methods for reducing this error.we show that two procedures are efficient in suppressing systematic error inthe b-mode: (1) refinement of the mosaic ccd warping procedure to conform toabsolute celestial coordinates and (2) truncation of the smoothing procedure ona scale of 10$^{\prime}$. application of these procedures reduces thesystematic error to 20% of its original amplitude. we provide an analyticexpression for the distribution of the highest peaks in noise maps that can beused to estimate the fraction of false peaks in the weak lensing $\kappa$-s/nmaps as a function of the detection threshold. based on this analysis we selecta threshold s/n = 4.56 for identifying an uncontaminated set of weak lensingpeaks in two test fields covering a total area of $\sim 3$deg$^2$. takentogether these fields contain seven peaks above the threshold. among these, sixare probable systems of galaxies and one is a superposition. we confirm thereliability of these peaks with dense redshift surveys, x-ray and imagingobservations. the systematic error reduction procedures we apply are generaland can be applied to future large-area weak lensing surveys. our high peakanalysis suggests that with a s/n threshold of 4.5, there should be only 2.7spurious weak lensing peaks even in an area of 1000 deg$^2$ where we expect$\sim$ 2000 peaks based on our subaru fields.

1308.4442	measuring galaxy velocity dispersions with hectospec	we describe a robust technique based on the ulyss idl code for measuringvelocity dispersions of galaxies observed with the mmt's fiber-fedspectrograph, hectospec. this procedure is applicable to all hectospec spectrahaving a signal-to-noise &gt;5 and weak emission lines. we estimate the internalerror in the hectospec velocity dispersion measurements by comparing duplicatemeasurements of 171 galaxies. for a sample of 984 galaxies with a medianz=0.10, we compare velocity dispersions measured by hectospec through a 1.5arcsec diameter optical fiber with those measured by the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and baryon oscillation spectral survey (boss) through 3 arcsecand 2 arcsec diameter optical fibers, respectively. the systematic differencesbetween the hectospec and the sdss/boss measurements are &lt;7% for velocitydispersions between 100 and 300 km/s, the differences are no larger than thedifferences among the three boss velocity dispersion reductions. we analyze thescatter about the fundamental plane and find no significant redshift dependentsystematics in our velocity dispersion measurements to z~0.6. this analysisalso confirms our estimation of the measurement errors. in one hour in goodconditions, we demonstrate that we achieve 30 km/s velocity dispersion errorsfor galaxies with an sdss r fiber magnitude of 21.

1401.1440	a redshift survey of the strong lensing cluster abell 383	abell 383 is a famous rich cluster (z = 0.1887) imaged extensively as a basisfor intensive strong and weak lensing studies. nonetheless there are fewspectroscopic observations. we enable dynamical analyses by measuring 2360 newredshifts for galaxies with r$_{petro} \leq 20.5$ and within 50$^\prime$ of thebcg (brightest cluster galaxy: r.a.$_{2000} = 42.014125^\circ$, decl$_{2000} =-03.529228^\circ$). we apply the caustic technique to identify 275 clustermembers within 7$h^{-1}$ mpc of the hierarchical cluster center. the bcg lieswithin $-11 \pm 110$ km s$^{-1}$ and 21 $\pm 56 h^{-1}$ kpc of the hierarchicalcluster center; the velocity dispersion profile of the bcg appears to be anextension of the velocity dispersion profile based on cluster members. thedistribution of cluster members on the sky corresponds impressively with theweak lensing contours of okabe et al. (2010) especially when the impact offoreground and background structure is included. the values of r$_{200}$ =$1.22\pm 0.01 h^{-1}$ mpc and m$_{200}$ = $(5.07 \pm 0.09)\times 10^{14}h^{-1}$ m$_\odot$ obtained by application of the caustic technique agree wellwith recent completely independent lensing measures. the caustic estimateextends direct measurement of the cluster mass profile to a radius of $\sim 5h^{-1}$ mpc.

1403.5316	strong gravitational lensing as a tool to investigate the structure of  jets at high energies	the components of blazar jets that emit radiation span a factor of $10^{10}$in scale. the spatial structure of these emitting regions depends on theobserved energy. photons emitted at different sites cross the lens plane atdifferent distances from the mass-weighted center of the lens. thus there aredifferences in magnification ratios and time delays between the images oflensed blazars observed at different energies. when the lens structure andredshift are known from optical observations, these constraints can elucidatethe structure of the source at high energies. at these energies, currenttechnology is inadequate to resolve these sources and the observed light curveis thus the sum of the images. durations of $\gamma$-ray flares are shortcompared with typical time delays; thus both the magnification ratio and thetime delay can be measured for the delayed counterparts. these measurements area basis for localizing the emitting region along the jet. to demonstrate thepower of strong gravitational lensing, we build a toy model based on the beststudied and the nearest relativistic jet m87.

1405.2934	the number density of quiescent compact galaxies at intermediate  redshift	massive compact systems at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 are the missing link between thepredominantly compact population of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshiftand their analogs and relics in the local volume. the evolution in numberdensity of these extreme objects over cosmic time is the crucial constrainingfactor for the models of massive galaxy assembly. we select a large sample of~200 intermediate-redshift massive compacts from the boss spectroscopic datasetby identifying point-like sdss photometric sources with spectroscopicsignatures of evolved redshifted galaxies. a subset of our targets havepublicly available high-resolution ground-based images that we use to augmentthe dynamical and stellar population properties of these systems by theirstructural parameters. we confirm that all boss compact candidates are ascompact as their high-redshift massive counterparts and less than half the sizeof similarly massive systems at z~0. we use the completeness-corrected numbersof boss compacts to compute lower limits on their number densities in narrowredshift bins spanning the range of our sample. the abundance of extremelydense quiescent galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 is in excellent agreement with the numberdensities of these systems at high redshift. our lower limits support themodels of massive galaxy assembly through a series of minor mergers over theredshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2.

1410.3883	comparing dense galaxy cluster redshift surveys with weak lensing maps	we use dense redshift surveys of nine galaxy clusters at $z\sim0.2$ tocompare the galaxy distribution in each system with the projected matterdistribution from weak lensing. by combining 2087 new mmt/hectospec redshiftsand the data in the literature, we construct spectroscopic samples within theregion of weak-lensing maps of high (70--89%) and uniform completeness. withthese dense redshift surveys, we construct galaxy number density maps usingseveral galaxy subsamples. the shape of the main cluster concentration in theweak-lensing maps is similar to the global morphology of the number densitymaps based on cluster members alone, mainly dominated by red members. we crosscorrelate the galaxy number density maps with the weak-lensing maps. the crosscorrelation signal when we include foreground and background galaxies at0.5$z_{\rm cl}&lt;z&lt;2z_{\rm cl}$ is $10-23$% larger than for cluster members aloneat the cluster virial radius. the excess can be as high as 30% depending on thecluster. cross correlating the galaxy number density and weak-lensing mapssuggests that superimposed structures close to the cluster in redshift spacecontribute more significantly to the excess cross correlation signal thanunrelated large-scale structure along the line of sight. interestingly, theweak-lensing mass profiles are not well constrained for the clusters with thelargest cross correlation signal excesses ($&gt;$20% for a383, a689 and a750). thefractional excess in the cross correlation signal including foreground andbackground structures could be a useful proxy for assessing the reliability ofweak-lensing cluster mass estimates.

1504.05210	resolving the high energy universe with strong gravitational lensing:  the case of pks 1830-211	gravitational lensing is a potentially powerful tool for elucidating theorigin of gamma-ray emission from distant sources. cosmic lenses magnify theemission from distance sources and produce time delays between mirage images.gravitationally-induced time delays depend on the position of the emittingregions in the source plane. the fermi/lat satellite continuously monitors theentire sky and detects gamma-ray flares, including those fromgravitationally-lensed blazars. therefore, temporal resolution at gamma-rayenergies can be used to measure these time delays, which, in turn, can be usedto resolve the origin of the gamma-ray flares spatially. we provide a guide tothe application and monte carlo simulation of three techniques for analyzingthese unresolved light curves: the autocorrelation function, the double powerspectrum, and the maximum peak method. we apply these methods to derive timedelays from the gamma-ray light curve of the gravitationally-lensed blazar pks1830-211. the result of temporal analysis combined with the properties of thelens from radio observations yield an improvement in spatial resolution atgamma-ray energies by a factor of 10000. we analyze four active periods. fortwo of these periods, the emission is consistent with origination from the coreand for the other two, the data suggest that the emission region is displacedfrom the core by more that ~1.5 kpc. for the core emission, the gamma-ray timedelays, $23\pm0.5$ days and $19.7\pm1.2$ days, are consistent with the radiotime delay $26^{+4}_{-5}$ days.

astro-ph;0006287	rotation curve measurement using cross-correlation	longslit spectroscopy is entering an era of increased spatial and spectralresolution and increased sample size. improved instruments reveal complexvelocity structure that cannot be described with a one-dimensional rotationcurve, yet samples are too numerous to examine each galaxy in detail.therefore, one goal of rotation curve measurement techniques is to flag casesin which the kinematic structure of the galaxy is more complex than asingle-valued curve.  we examine cross-correlation as a technique that is easily automated andworks for low signal-to-noise spectra. we show that the technique yieldswell-defined errors which increase when the simple spectral model (template) isa poor match to the data, flagging those cases for later inspection.  we compare the technique to the more traditional, parametric technique ofsimultaneous emission line fitting. when the line profile at a single slitposition is non-gaussian, the techniques disagree. for our model spectra withtwo well-separated velocity components, assigned velocities from the twotechniques differ by up to ~52% of the velocity separation of the modelcomponents. however, careful use of the error statistics for either techniqueallows one to flag these non-gaussian spectra.

astro-ph;0011022	the tully-fisher relation as a measure of luminosity evolution: a low  redshift baseline for evolving galaxies	we use optical rotation curves to investigate the r-band tully-fisherproperties of a sample of 90 spiral galaxies in close pairs. the galaxiesfollow the tully-fisher relation remarkably well, with the exception of eightdistinct 3-sigma outliers. although most of the outliers show signs of recentstar formation, gasdynamical effects are probably the dominant cause of theiranomalous tully-fisher properties. four outliers with small emission linewidths have very centrally concentrated line emission and truncated rotationcurves; the central emission indicates recent gas infall after a closegalaxy-galaxy pass. these four galaxies may be local counterparts to compact,blue galaxies at intermediate redshift. the remaining galaxies have anegligible offset from the reference tully-fisher relation, but a shallowerslope (2.6-sigma significance) and a 25% larger scatter. we characterize thenon-outlier sample with measures of distortion and star formation to search forthird parameter dependence in the residuals of the tf relation. severekinematic distortion is the only significant predictor of tf residuals; thisdistortion is not, however, responsible for the slope difference from thereference distribution.  because the outliers are easily removed by sigma clipping, we conclude thateven in the presence of some tidal distortion, detection of moderate luminosityevolution should be possible with high-redshift samples the size of this90-galaxy study.

astro-ph;0401172	[oii] as a star formation rate indicator	we investigate the [oii] emission-line as a star formation rate (sfr)indicator using integrated spectra of 97 galaxies from the nearby fieldgalaxies survey (nfgs). the sample includes all hubble types and contains sfrsranging from 0.01 to 100 msun/yr. we compare the kennicutt [oii] and h-alphasfr calibrations and show that there are two significant effects which producedisagreement between sfr[oii] and sfr(h-alpha): reddening and metallicity.differences in the ionization state of the ism do not contribute significantlyto the observed difference between sfr([oii]) and sfr(h-alpha) for the nfgsgalaxies with metallicities log(o/h)12&gt;8.5. the kennicutt [oii]-sfr relationassumes a typical reddening for nearby galaxies; in practice, the reddeningdiffers significantly from sample to sample. we derive a new sfr([oii])calibration which does not contain a reddening assumption. our new sfr([oii])calibration also provides an optional correction for metallicity. our sfrsderived from [oii] agree with those derived from h-alpha to within 0.03-0.05dex. we apply our sfr([oii]) calibration with metallicity correction to twosamples: high-redshift 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.6 galaxies from the nicmos h-alpha survey, and0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1 galaxies from the canada-france redshift survey. the sfr([oii]) andsfr(h-alpha) for these samples agree to within the scatter observed for thenfgs sample, indicating that our sfr([oii]) relation can be applied to bothlocal and high-z galaxies. finally, we apply our sfr([oii]) to estimates of thecosmic star formation history. after reddening and metallicity corrections, thestar formation rate densities derived from [oii] and h-alpha agree to within30%.

astro-ph;0501177	discovery of an unbound hyper-velocity star in the milky way halo	we have discovered a star, sdss j090745.0+024507, leaving the galaxy with aheliocentric radial velocity of +853+-12 km/s, the largest velocity everobserved in the milky way halo. the star is either a hot blue horizontal branchstar or a b9 main sequence star with a heliocentric distance ~55 kpc. correctedfor the solar reflex motion and to the local standard of rest, the galacticrest-frame velocity is +709 km/s.  because its radial velocity vector points 173.8 deg from the galactic center,we suggest that this star is the first example of a hyper-velocity star ejectedfrom the galactic center as predicted by hills and later discussed by yu &amp;tremaine. the star has [fe/h]~0, consistent with a galactic center origin, anda travel time of &lt;80 myr from the galactic center, consistent with its stellarlifetime. if the star is indeed traveling from the galactic center, it shouldhave a proper motion of 0.3 mas/yr observable with gaia. identifying additionalhyper-velocity stars throughout the halo will constrain the production ratehistory of hyper-velocity stars at the galactic center.

astro-ph;0505328	the century survey galactic halo project ii: global properties and the  luminosity function of field blue horizontal branch stars	we discuss a 175 deg^2 spectroscopic survey for blue horizontal branch (bhb)stars in the galactic halo. we use the two micron all sky survey (2mass) andthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to select bhb candidates, and find that the2mass and sdss color-selection is 38% and 50% efficient, respectively, for bhbstars. our samples include one likely run-away b7 star 6 kpc below the galacticplane. the global properties of the bhb samples are consistent with membershipin the halo population: the median metallicity is [fe/h]=-1.7, the velocitydispersion is 108 km/s, and the mean galactic rotation of the bhb stars3&lt;|z|&lt;15 kpc is -4 +- 30 km/s. we discuss the theoretical basis of the preston,shectman &amp; beers m_v-color relation for bhb stars, and conclude that intrinsicshape of the bhb m_v-color relation results from the physics of stars on thehorizontal branch. we calculate the luminosity function for the field bhb starsamples using the efstathiou, ellis, &amp; peterson maximum-likelihood method whichis unbiased by density variations. the field bhb luminosity function exhibits asteep rise at bright luminosities, a peak between 0.8 &lt; m_v &lt; 1.0, and a tailat faint luminosities. we compare the field bhb luminosity functions with theluminosity functions derived from sixteen different globular cluster bhbs.kolmogorov-smirnov tests suggest that field bhb stars and bhb stars in globularclusters share a common distribution of luminosities, with the exception ofglobular clusters with extended bhbs.

astro-ph;0506660	cairns: the cluster and infall region nearby survey iii. environmental  dependence of h-alpha properties of galaxies	we investigate the environmental dependence of star formation in clustervirial regions and infall regions as part of cairns (cluster and infall regionnearby survey), a large spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surroundingnine nearby rich clusters of galaxies. our long-slit spectroscopy yieldsestimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to thegeneral large-scale structure. the fraction of galaxies with current starformation in their inner disks as traced by h-alpha emission increases withdistance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3virial radii, in agreement with other investigations. however, among galaxieswith significant current star formation (ew[ha]geq2\aa), there is no differencein the distribution of ew[ha] inside and outside the virial radius. thissurprising result, first seen by carter et al., suggests that (1) starformation is truncated on either very short timescales or only at moderate andhigh redshifts or (2) that projection effects contaminate the measurement. thenumber density profiles of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies indicatethat, among galaxies projected inside the virial radius, at least half of theformer and 20% of the latter are ``infall interlopers,'' galaxies in the infallregion but outside the virial region. the kinematics of star-forming galaxiesin the infall region closely match those of absorption-dominated galaxies. thisresult shows that the star forming galaxies in the infall regions are notinterlopers from the field and excludes one model of the backsplash scenario ofgalaxy transformation. finally, we quantify systematic uncertainties inestimating the global star formation in galaxies from their inner disks.

0809.1087	spectrophotometry with hectospec, the mmt's fiber-fed spectrograph	we describe techniques for photometric calibration of optical spectraobtained with the mmt's fiber-fed spectrograph, hectospec. the atmosphericdispersion compensation prisms built into the mmt's f/5 wide field correctoreffectively eliminate errors due to differential refraction, and simplify thecalibration procedure. the procedures that we describe here are applicable toall 220,000+ spectra obtained to date with hectospec because the instrumentresponse is stable. we estimate the internal error in the hectospecmeasurements by comparing duplicate measurements of $\sim$1500 galaxies. for asample of 400 galaxies in the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey (shels) witha median z=0.10, we compare line and continuum fluxes measured by hectospecthrough a 1.5 arcsec diameter optical fiber with those measured by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) through a 3 arcsec diameter optical fiber. agreementof the [oii] and h alpha shels and sdss line fluxes, after scaling by the rband flux in the different apertures, suggests that the spatial variation instar formation rates over a 1.5 to 3 kpc radial scale is small. the medianratio of the hectospec and sdss spectra, smoothed over 100 angstrom scales, isremarkably constant to ~5% over the range of 3850 to 8000 angstroms. offsets inthe ratio of the median [oii] and h alpha fluxes, the equivalent width of hdelta and the continuum index d4000 are a few percent, small compared withother sources of scatter.

astro-ph;0608159	hypervelocity stars: predicting the spectrum of ejection velocities	the disruption of binary stars by the tidal field of the black hole in thegalactic center can produce the hypervelocity stars observed in the halo. weuse numerical models to simulate the full spectrum of observable velocities ofstars ejected into the halo by this binary disruption process. our modelincludes a range of parameters for binaries with 3-4 m_solar primaries,consideration of radial orbits of the ejected stars through an approximate massdistribution for the galaxy, and the impact of stellar lifetimes. we calculatethe spectrum of ejection velocities and reproduce previous results for the meanejection velocity at the galactic center. the model predicts that the fullpopulation of ejected stars includes both the hypervelocity stars withvelocities large enough to escape from the galaxy and a comparable number ofejected, but bound, stars of the same stellar type. the predicted median speedsof the population of ejected stars as a function of distance in the halo areconsistent with current observations. combining the model with the data alsoshows that interesting constraints on the properties of binaries in thegalactic center and on the mass distribution in the galaxy can be obtained evenwith modest samples of ejected stars.

astro-ph;9602086	galaxy pairwise velocity distributions on non-linear scales	the redshift-space correlation function $\xi_s$ for projected galaxyseparations $\simless 1h^{-1}$ mpc can be expressed as the convolution of thereal-space correlation function with the galaxy pairwise velocity distributionfunction (pvdf). an exponential pvdf yields the best fit to the $\xi_s$measured from galaxy samples of different redshift surveys. we show that thisexponential pvdf is not merely a fitting function but arises from well definedgravitational processes. two ingredients conspire to yield a pvdf with a nearlyexponential shape: (i) the number density $n(\sigma)$ of systems with velocitydispersion $\sigma$; (ii) the unrelaxed dynamical state of most galaxy systems.the former ingredient determines the exponential tail and the latter thecentral peak of the pvdf. we compare the $\xi_s$ measured on non-linear scalesfrom galaxy samples of the cfa redshift surveys with different models of thepvdf convolved with the measured real-space correlation function. thispreliminary comparison indicates that the agreement between model andobservations depends strongly on both the underlying cosmological model and theinternal dynamics of galaxy systems. neither parameter dominates. moreover, theagreement depends sensitively on the accuracy of the galaxy position andvelocity measurements.

astro-ph;9701034	infall regions of galaxy clusters	in hierarchical clustering, galaxy clusters accrete mass through theaggregation of smaller systems. thus, the velocity field of the infall regionsof clusters contains significant random motion superimposed on radial infall.because the purely spherical infall model does not predict the amplitude of thevelocity field correctly, methods estimating the cosmological density parameteromega_0 based on this model yield unreliable biased results. in fact, theamplitude of the velocity field depends on local dynamics and only very weaklyon the global properties of the universe. we use n-body simulations of flat andopen universes to show that the amplitude of the velocity field of the infallregions of dark matter halos is a direct measure of the escape velocity withinthese regions. we can use this amplitude to estimate the mass of dark matterhalos within a few megaparsecs from the halo center. in this region dynamicalequilibrium assumptions do not hold. the method yields a mass estimate withbetter than 30% accuracy. if galaxies trace the velocity field of the infallregions of clusters reliably, this method provides a straightforward way toestimate the amount of mass surrounding rich galaxy clusters from redshift dataalone.

astro-ph;9909217	tidally-triggered star formation in close pairs of galaxies	we analyze new optical spectra of a sample of 502 galaxies in close pairs andn-tuples, separated by &lt;= 50/h kpc. we extracted the sample objectively fromthe cfa2 redshift survey, without regard to the surroundings of the tightsystems. we probe the relationship between star formation and the dynamics ofthe systems of galaxies. the equivalent widths of h\alpha (ew(h\alpha) andother emission lines anti-correlate strongly with pair spatial separation(\delta d) and velocity separation. we use the measured ew(h\alpha) and thestarburst models of leitherer et al. to estimate the time since the most recentburst of star for- mation began for each galaxy. in the absence of a largecontribution from an old stellar population to the continuum around h\alpha,the observed \delta d -- ew(h\alpha) correlation signifies that starbursts withlarger separations on the sky are, on average, older. by matching the dynamicaltimescale to the burst timescale, we show that the data support a simplepicture in which a close pass initiates a starburst; ew(h\alpha) decreases withtime as the pair separation increases, accounting for the anti-correlation.this picture leads to a method for measuring the duration and the initial massfunction of interaction-induced starbursts: our data are compatible with thestarburst and orbit models in many respects, as long as the starburst lastslonger than \sim10^8 years and the delay between the close pass and theinitiation of the starburst is less than a few \times 10^7 years. if there isno large contribution from an old stellar population to the continuum aroundh\alpha the miller-scalo and cutoff (m &lt;= 30 m_\sun) salpeter initial massfunctions fit the data much better than a standard salpeter imf.
