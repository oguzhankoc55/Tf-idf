0706.2962	variable stars in the open cluster ngc 6791 and its surrounding field	aims: this work presents a high--precision variability survey in the field ofthe old, super metal-rich open cluster ngc 6791.  methods: the data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision ccd timeseries measurements in the v band obtained mainly at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, with additional data from s. pedro martir and loiano observatories,over a time span of ten nights. the field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.  results: we have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods andamplitudes of 70 known variable stars. by means of a photometric evaluation ofthe membership in ngc 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the propermotions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster andsurrounding field in the range 16&lt;v&lt;23.5. accurate periods can be given for thevariables with p&lt;4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limitedtime-baseline hampered precise determinations. we categorized the entire sampleas follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variablesand 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables forwhich we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longerthan our time baseline.  conclusions: on the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positionsof the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 newvariable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membershipis doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. we also detected an outburst ofabout 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to thecluster and we suggest that this star could be a new u gem (dwarf nova)cataclysmic variable.

0906.2945	vlt/naco deep imaging survey of young, nearby austral stars	since november 2002, we have conducted the largest deep imaging survey of theyoung, nearby associations of the southern hemisphere. our goal is detectionand characterization of substellar companions at intermediate (10--500 au)physical separations. we have observed a sample of 88 stars, mostly g to mdwarfs, that we essentially identify as younger than 100 myr and closer toearth than 100 pc. the vlt/naco adaptive optics instrument of the eso paranalobservatory was used to explore the faint circumstellar environment betweentypically 0.1 and 10''. we report the discovery of 17 new close (0.1-5.0'')multiple systems. hip108195ab and c (f1iii-m6), hip84642ab (a~14 au, k0-m5) andtwa22ab (a~1.8 au; m6-m6) confirmed comoving systems. twa22ab is likely to be aastrometric calibrator that can be used to test evolutionary predictions. amongour complete sample, a total of 65 targets observed with deep coronagraphicimaging. about 240 faint candidates were detected around 36 stars. follow-upobservations vlt or hst for 83% of these stars enabled us to identify afraction of contaminants. the latest results about the substellar companions togsc08047-00232, ab pic and 2m1207, confirmed during this survey and publishedearlier, are reviewed. finally, the statistical analysis of our complete set ofcoronagraphic limits enables us to place constraints on the physical andproperties of giant planets between typically 20 and 150 au.

0909.4454	hipparcos preliminary astrometric masses for the two close-in companions  to hd 131664 and hd 43848. a brown dwarf and a low mass star	[abridged] we attempt to improve on the characterization of the properties(orbital elements, masses) of two doppler-detected sub-stellar companions tothe nearby g dwarfs hd 131664 and hd 43848. we carry out orbital fits to thehipparcos iad for the two stars, taking advantage of the knowledge of thespectroscopic orbits, and solving for the two orbital elements that can bedetermined in principle solely by astrometry, the inclination angle $i$ and thelongitude of the ascending node $\omega$. a number of checks are carried out inorder to assess the reliability of the orbital solutions thus obtained. thebest-fit solution for hd 131664 yields $i=55\pm33$ deg and $\omega=22\pm28$deg. the resulting inferred true companion mass is then $m_c = 23_{-5}^{+26}$$m_j$. for \object{hd 43848}, we find $i=12\pm7$ deg and $\omega=288\pm22$ deg,and $m_c = 120_{-43}^{+167}$ $m_j$. based on the statistical evidence from an$f$-test, the study of the joint confidence intervals of variation of $i$ and$\omega$, and the comparison of the derived orbital semi-major axes with adistribution of false astrometric orbits obtained for single stars observed byhipparcos, the astrometric signal of the two companions to hd 131664 and hd43848 is then considered detected in the hipparcos iad, with a level ofstatistical confidence not exceeding 95%. we constrain the true mass of hd131664b to that of a brown dwarf to within a somewhat statistically significantdegree of confidence ($\sim2-\sigma$). for hd 43848b, a true mass in the browndwarf regime is ruled out at the $1-\sigma$ confidence level.

0704.1668	a new search for planet transits in ngc 6791	context. searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.  aims. considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster ngc 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  methods. a ten-night observational campaign was performed using thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (3.6m), the san pedro m\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the loiano telescope (1.5m). to increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

1004.1959	race-oc project: rotation and variability in young stellar associations  within 100 pc	our goal is to determine the rotational and magnetic-related activityproperties of stars at different stages of evolution. we have focussed ourattention on 6 young loose stellar associations within 100 pc and ages in therange 8-70 myr: tw hydrae (~8 myr), beta pictoris (~10 myr), tucana/horologium,columba, carina (~30 myr), and ab doradus (~70 myr). additional data on alphapersei and the pleiades from the literature is also considered. rotationalperiods of stars showing rotational modulation due to photospheric magneticactivity (i.e. starspots) have been determined applying the lomb-scargleperiodogram technique to photometric time-series obtained by the all skyautomated survey (asas). the magnetic activity level has been derived from theamplitude of the v lightcurves. we detected the rotational modulation andmeasured the rotation periods of 93 stars for the first time, and confirmed theperiods of 41 stars already known from the literature. for further 10 stars werevised the period determinations by other authors. the sample was augmentedwith periods of 21 additional stars retrieved from the literature. in this way,for the first time we were able to determine largest set of rotation periods atages of ~8, ~10 and ~30 myr, as well as increase by 150\% the number of knownperiodic members of ab dor.the analysis of the rotation periods in youngstellar associations, supplemented by orion nebula cluster (onc) and ngc2264data from the literature, has allowed us to find that in the 0.6 - 1.2 solarmasses range the most significant variations of the rotation perioddistribution are the spin-up between 9 and 30 myr and the spin-down between 70and 110 myr. variations between 30 and 70 myr are rather doubtful, despite themedian period indicates a significant spin-up.

1102.3333	the debris disk host star hd 61005: a member of the argus association?	hd 61005 is a nearby young solar type star that shows a large infrared excessdue to a debris disk. the disk has been recently imaged from ground and space,with indications of several components. some characteristics of the disksuggest the presence of planetary companions around the star, that remainundetected in deep adaptive optics imaging. for a better understanding of thesystem we aim to refine the determination of the stellar parameters, withemphasis on the stellar age and system orientation. we used asas and hipparcosphotometry and feros spectra to determine the rotation period, radial androtational velocity, chromospheric emission, effective temperature, andchemical composition. we find no indication of any misalignment between thestar rotation axis and the disk. the standard age calibrations applied toseveral indicators yield an age close to that of the pleiades (120 myr);however the kinematic properties strongly support its membership in the younger(40 myr) argus association, which also includes the ic 2391 open cluster.detailed comparison of the properties of hd 61005 and ic 2391 members showsthat the characteristics of hd 61005 are compatible with membership to theargus association, once its rather slow rotation is taken into account, becauselithium and other age indicators are somewhat correlated with stellar rotationat a fixed age. we also identify systematic differences between the field andcluster population of the argus association, which are probably selectioneffects, so we suggest that additional members with slower rotation and loweractivity level are waiting to be identified.

1103.4766	simulation of planet detection with the sphere ifs	aims. we present simulations of the perfomances of the future sphere ifsinstrument designed for imaging extrasolar planets in the near infrared (y, j,and h bands). methods. we used the idl package code for adaptive opticssimulation (caos) to prepare a series of input point spread functions (psf).these feed an idl tool (csp) that we designed to simulate the datacuberesulting from the sphere ifs. we performed simulations under differentconditions to evaluate the contrast that ifs will be able to reach and toverify the impact of physical propagation within the limits of the near fieldof the aperture approximation (i.e. fresnel propagation). we then performed aseries of simulations containing planet images to test the capability of ourinstrument to correctly classify the found objects. to this purpose wedeveloped a separated idl tool. results. we found that using the sphere ifsinstrument and appropriate analysis techniques, such as multiple spectraldifferential imaging (mdi), spectral deconvolution (sd), and angulardifferential imaging (adi), we should be able to image companion objects downto a luminosity contrast of ? 10-7 with respect to the central star infavorable cases. spectral deconvolution resulted in the most effective methodfor reducing the speckle noise. we were then able to find most of the simulatedplanets (more than 90% with the y-j-mode and more than the 95% with they-h-mode) for contrasts down to 3 \times 10-7 and separations between 0.3 and1.0 arcsec. the spectral classification is accurate but seems to be moreprecise for late t-type spectra than for earlier spectral types. a possibledegeneracy between early l-type companion objects and field objects (flatspectra) is highlighted. the spectral classification seems to work better usingthe y-h-mode than with the y-j-mode.

1107.0918	a giant planet in the triple system hd132563	as part of our radial velocity planet-search survey performed with sarg attng, we monitored the components of hd 132563 for ten years. it is a binarysystem formed by two rather similar solar type stars with a projectedseparation of 4.1 arcsec, which corresponds to 400 au at the distance of 96 pc.the two components are moderately metal-poor and the age of the system is about5 gyr. we detected rv variations of hd 132563b with period of 1544 days andsemi-amplitude of 26 m/s. from the star characteristics and line profilemeasurements, we infer their keplerian origin. therefore hd 132563b turns outto host a planet with a projected mass msini=1.49 mjup at 2.6 au with amoderately eccentric orbit (e=0.22). the planet around hd 132563b is one of thefew that are known in triple stellar systems, as we found that the primary hd132563a is itself a spectroscopic binary with a period longer than 15 years andan eccentricity higher than 0.65. the spectroscopic component was not detectedin adaptive-optics images taken with adopt@tng, since it expected at aprojected separation that was smaller than 0.2 arcsec at the time of ourobservations. a small excess in k band difference between the components withrespect to the difference in v band is compatible with a companion of about0.55 msun. a preliminary statistical analysis of the occurrence of planets intriple systems indicate a similar frequency of planets around the isolatedcomponent in a triple system, components of wide binaries and single stars.there is no significant iron abundance difference between the components. thelack of stars in binary systems and open clusters showing strong enhancementsof iron abundance, comparable to the typical metallicity difference betweenstars with and without giant planets, agrees with the idea that accretion ofplanetary material producing iron abundance anomalies larger than 0.1 dex israre.

1110.4917	mess (multi-purpose exoplanet simulation system): a monte carlo tool for  the statistical analysis and prediction of exoplanets search results	the high number of planet discoveries made in the last years provides a goodsample for statistical analysis, leading to some clues on the distributions ofplanet parameters, like masses and periods, at least in close proximity to thehost star. we likely need to wait for the extremely large telescopes (elts) tohave an overall view of the extrasolar planetary systems. in this context itwould be useful to have a tool that can be used for the interpretation of thepresent results,and also to predict what the outcomes would be of the futureinstruments. for this reason we built mess: a monte carlo simulation code whichuses either the results of the statistical analysis of the properties ofdiscovered planets, or the results of the planet formation theories, to buildsynthetic planet populations fully described in terms of frequency, orbitalelements and physical properties. they can then be used to either test theconsistency of their properties with the observed population of planets givendifferent detection techniques or to actually predict the expected number ofplanets for future surveys. in addition to the code description, we presenthere some of its applications to actually probe the physical and orbitalproperties of a putative companion within the circumstellar disk of a givenstar and to test constrain the orbital distribution properties of a potentialplanet population around the members of the tw hydrae association. finally,using in its predictive mode, the synergy of future space and ground-basedtelescopes instrumentation has been investigated to identify the mass-periodparameter space that will be probed in future surveys for giant and rockyplanets

(2011). thesecondary instead does not show significant rv variations. the two componentsdo not differ significantly in chemical composition, as found for other pairsfor which one component hosts giant planets. adaptive optics images obtainedwith adopt@tng do not reveal additional stellar companions. from the analysisof the relative astrometry of the components of the wide pair we put an upperlimit on the mass of the newly detected companion of about 0.25 msun. state ofart or near future instrumentation can provide true mass determination, thanksto the availability of the wide companion hd106515b as reference. therefore,hd106515ab will allow deeper insight in the transition region between planetsand brown dwarfs.

1302.5367	a survey of young, nearby, and dusty stars to understand the formation  of wide-orbit giant planets	direct imaging has confirmed the existence of substellar companions on wideorbits. to understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of thesecompanions, the full population properties must be characterized. we aim atdetecting giant planet and/or brown dwarf companions around young, nearby, anddusty stars. our goal is also to provide statistics on the population of giantplanets at wide-orbits and discuss planet formation models. we report a deepsurvey of 59 stars, members of young stellar associations. the observationswere conducted with vlt/naco at l'-band (3.8 micron). we used angulardifferential imaging to reach optimal detection performance. a statisticalanalysis of about 60 % of the young and southern a-f stars closer than 65 pcallows us to derive the fraction of giant planets on wide orbits. we usegravitational instability models and planet population synthesis modelsfollowing the core-accretion scenario to discuss the occurrence of thesecompanions. we resolve and characterize new visual binaries and do not detectany new substellar companion. the survey's median detection performance reachescontrasts of 10 mag at 0.5as and 11.5 mag at 1as. we find the occurrence ofplanets to be between 10.8-24.8 % at 68 % confidence level assuming a uniformdistribution of planets in the interval 1-13 mj and 1-1000 au. considering thepredictions of formation models, we set important constraints on the occurrenceof massive planets and brown dwarf companions that would have formed by gi. weshow that this mechanism favors the formation of rather massive clump (mclump &gt;30 mj) at wide (a &gt; 40 au) orbits which might evolve dynamically and/orfragment. for the population of close-in giant planets that would have formedby ca, our survey marginally explore physical separations (&lt;20 au) and cannotconstrain this population.

1304.4130	astrophysical false positives in direct imaging for exoplanets: a white  dwarf close to a rejuvenated star	as is the case for all techniques involved in the research for exoplanets,direct imaging has to take into account the probability of so-calledastrophysical false positives, which are phenomena that mimic the signature ofobjects we are seeking. in this work we aim to present a case of a falsepositive found during a direct imaging survey conducted with vlt/naco. apromising exoplanet candidate was detected around the k2-type star hd\,8049 injuly 2010.its contrast of $\delta h$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guessthe presence of a 35 \mjup companion at 50 projected au, for the nominal systemage and heliocentric distance.to check whether it was gravitationally bound tothe host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed thesystem one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. wealso used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time rangeof $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, aswell as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectralenergy distribution. we also obtained for the companion $u$-band imaging withefosc and $nir$ spectroscopy. combining all these information we conclude thatthe companion of hd\,8049 is a white dwarf (wd), with temperature$t_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ k and mass $m_{wd}=0.56 \pm 0.08 m_{\odot}$. thesignificant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate thatthe most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 au.the discrepancybetween the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star. themoderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimickingthe properties of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass withthe progenitor of the wd. this example demonstrates some of the challenges indetermining accurate age estimates and identifications of faint companions.

1305.7428	discovery of a probable 4-5 jupiter-mass exoplanet to hd 95086 by  direct-imaging	direct imaging has just started the inventory of the population of gas giantplanets on wide-orbits around young stars in the solar neighborhood. followingthis approach, we carried out a deep imaging survey in the near-infrared usingvlt/naco to search for substellar companions. we report here the discovery inl' (3.8 microns) images of a probable companion orbiting at 56 au the young(10-17 myr), dusty, and early-type (a8) star hd 95086. this discovery is basedon observations with more than a year-time-lapse. our first epoch clearlyrevealed the source at 10 sigma while our second epoch lacked good observingconditions hence yielding a 3 sigma detection. various tests were thus made torule out possible artifacts. this recovery is consistent with the signal at thefirst epoch but requires cleaner confirmation. nevertheless, our astrometricprecision suggests the companion to be comoving with the star, with a 3 sigmaconfidence level. the planetary nature of the source is reinforced by anon-detection in ks-band (2.18 microns) images according to its possibleextremely red ks - l' color. conversely, background contamination is rejectedwith good confidence level. the luminosity yields a predicted mass of about4-5mjup (at 10-17 myr) using "hot-start" evolutionary models, making hd 95086 bthe exoplanet with the lowest mass ever imaged around a star.

1403.6728	the gaps programme with harps-n at tng. iii: the retrograde orbit of  hat-p-18b	the measurement of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting exoplanetsplaces constraints on the orientation of the orbital axis with respect to thestellar spin axis, which can shed light on the mechanisms shaping the orbitalconfiguration of planetary systems. here we present the interesting case of thesaturn-mass planet hat-p-18b, which orbits one of the coolest stars for whichthe rossiter-mclaughlin effect has been measured so far. we acquired aspectroscopic time-series, spanning a full transit, with the harps-nspectrograph mounted at the tng telescope. the very precise radial velocitymeasurements delivered by the harps-n pipeline were used to measure therossiter-mclaughlin effect. complementary new photometric observations ofanother full transit were also analysed to obtain an independent determinationof the star and planet parameters. we find that hat-p-18b lies on acounter-rotating orbit, the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axisand the planet orbital axis being lambda=132 +/- 15 deg. by joint modelling ofthe radial velocity and photometric data we obtain new determinations of thestar (m_star = 0.770 +/- 0.027 m_sun; r_star= 0.717 +/- 0.026 r_sun;vsin(i_star) = 1.58 +/- 0.18 km/s) and planet (m_pl = 0.196 +/- 0.008 m_j; r_pl= 0.947 +/- 0.044 r_j) parameters. our spectra provide for the host star aneffective temperature t_eff = 4870 +/- 50 k, a surface gravity of log(g_star) =4.57 +/- 0.07 cm/s, and an iron abundance of [fe/h] = 0.10 +/- 0.06. hat-p-18bis one of the few planets known to transit a star with t_eff &lt; 6250 k on aretrograde orbit. objects such as hat-p-18b (low planet mass and/or relativelylong orbital period) most likely have a weak tidal coupling with their parentstars, therefore their orbits preserve any original misalignment. as such, theyare ideal targets to study the causes of orbital evolution in coolmain-sequence stars.

1404.1574	search for cool extrasolar giant planets combining coronagraphy,  spectral and angular differential imaging	spectral differential imaging (sdi) is part of the observing strategy ofcurrent and on-going high-contrast imaging instruments on ground-basedtelescopes. although it improves the star light rejection, sdi attenuates thesignature of off-axis companions to the star, just like angular differentialimaging (adi). however, the attenuation due to sdi has the peculiarity of beingdependent on the spectral properties of the companions. to date, no study hasinvestigated these effects. our team is addressing this problem based on datafrom a direct imaging survey of 16 stars combining the phase-mask coronagraph,the sdi and the adi modes of vlt/naco. the objective of the survey is to searchfor cool (teff&lt;1000-1300 k) giant planets at separations of 5-10 au orbitingyoung, nearby stars (&lt;200 myr, &lt;25 pc). the data analysis did not yield anydetections. as for the estimation of the sensitivity limits of sdi-processedimages, we show that it requires a different analysis than that used inadi-based surveys. based on a method using the flux predictions of evolutionarymodels and avoiding the estimation of contrast, we determine directly the masssensitivity limits of the survey for the adi processing alone and with thecombination of sdi and adi. we show that sdi does not systematically improvethe sensitivity due to the spectral properties and self-subtraction of pointsources.

1409.0639	effects of xuv radiation on circumbinary planets	several circumbinary planets have recently been discovered. the orbit of aplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. theeffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheresmust be considered. because of the configuration of a close binary system,these stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of highstellar activity and copious xuv radiation. the accumulated effects arestronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a fasterevaporation of their atmospheres. we evaluate the effects that stellarradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on thesurvival of these planets. we considered the xuv spectral range to account forthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainlycomposed of hydrogen. a more complex atmospheric composition is expected toabsorb this radiation more efficiently. we used direct x-ray observations toevaluate the energy in the x-rays range and coronal models to calculate the(nondetectable) euv part of the spectrum. the simulations show that exoplanetsin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a totalloss of atmosphere in a short time. a binary system of two solar-like starswill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. thesesystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. still,planets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.currently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermalphotoevaporation processes, unless kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. thedistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to muchlonger periods than the average of kepler planets, which supports a scenario ofstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets.

1511.04076	first light of the vlt planet finder sphere. i. detection and  characterization of the sub-stellar companion gj 758 b	gj758 b is a brown dwarf companion to a nearby (15.76 pc) solar-type,metal-rich (m/h = +0.2 dex) main-sequence star (g9v) that was discovered withsubaru/hiciao in 2009. from previous studies, it has drawn attention as beingthe coldest (~600k) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star.we present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of thesphere instrument at the vlt. the data was obtained in y-, j-, h-, and ks-bandswith the dual-band imaging (dbi) mode of irdis, providing a broad coverage ofthe full near-infrared (near-ir) range at higher contrast and better spectralsampling than previously reported. in this new set of high-quality data, wereport the re-detection of the companion, as well as the first detection of anew candidate closer-in to the star. we use the new 8 photometric points for anextended comparison of gj758 b with empirical objects and 4 families ofatmospheric models. from comparison to empirical object, we estimate a t8spectral type, but none of the comparison object can accurately represent theobserved near-ir fluxes of gj758 b. from comparison to atmospheric models, weattribute a teff = 600k $\pm$ 100k, but we find that no atmospheric model canadequately fit all the fluxes of gj758 b. the photometry of the new candidatecompanion is broadly consistent with l-type objects, but a second epoch withimproved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. the new astrometry ofgj758 b shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. we use thisresult to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using twofitting approaches, least-square monte carlo and markov chain monte carlo.finally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-incompanions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companionsdown to 4-5 au.

1511.04082	first light of the vlt planet finder sphere. iv. physical and chemical  properties of the planets around hr8799	the system of four planets around hr8799 offers a unique opportunity to probethe physics and chemistry at play in the atmospheres of self-luminous young(~30 myr) planets. we recently obtained new photometry of the four planets andlow-resolution (r~30) spectra of hr8799 d and e with the sphere instrument(paper iii). in this paper (paper iv), we compare the available spectra andphotometry of the planets to known objects and atmospheric models (bt-settl14,cloud-ae60, exo-rem) to characterize the atmospheric properties of the planets.we find that hr8799d and e properties are well reproduced by those of l6-l8dusty dwarfs discovered in the field, among which some are candidate members ofyoung nearby associations. no known object reproduces well the properties ofplanets b and c. nevertheless, we find that the spectra and wise photometry ofpeculiar and/or young early-t dwarfs reddened by submicron grains made ofcorundum, iron, enstatite, or forsterite successfully reproduce the sed ofthese two planets. our analysis confirms that only the exo-rem models withthick clouds fit (within 2{\sigma}) the whole set of spectrophotometricdatapoints available for hr8799 d and e for teff = 1200 k, log g in the range3.0-4.5, and m/h=+0.5. the models still fail to reproduce the sed of hr8799cand b. the determination of the metallicity, log g, and cloud thickness aredegenerate. we conclude that an enhanced content in dust and decreased cia ofh2 is certainly responsible for the deviation of the properties of the planetwith respect to field dwarfs. the analysis suggests in addition that hr8799cand b have later spectral types than the two other planets, and therefore couldboth have lower masses.

astro-ph;0204332	the lithium content of the globular cluster ngc 6397	we make use of high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of 12turn-off stars in the metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397 to measure itslithium content. we conclude that they all have the same lithium abundancea(li) = 2.34 with a standard deviation of 0.056 dex. we use this result,together with monte carlo simulations, to estimate that the maximum allowedintrinsic scatter is of the order of 0.035 dex. this is a new stringentconstraint to be fulfilled by stellar models which predict li depletion. weargue that although a mild depletion of 0.1 -- 0.2 dex, as predicted by recentmodels, cannot be ruled out, there is no compelling reason for it. this fact,together with the good agreement with the li abundance observed in field stars,supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. taking the abovevalue as the primordial lithium abundance implies a cosmic baryonic densitywhich is either omega_b h^2 = 0.016 +/- 0.004 or omega_b h^2 = 0.005^{+0.0026}_{-0.0006}, from the predictions of standard big bangnucleosynthesis. the high baryonic density solution is in agreement with recentresults on the primordial abundance of deuterium and 3he and on the estimatesderived from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;0205288	the mysterious eruption of v838 mon	v838 mon is marking one of the most mysterious stellar outbursts on record.the spectral energy distribution of the progenitor resembles an under-luminousf main sequence star (at v=15.6 mag), that erupted into a cool supergiantfollowing a complex and multi-maxima lightcurve (peaking at v=6.7 mag). theoutburst spectrum show baii, lii and lines of several s-elements, with widep-cyg profiles and a moderate and retracing emission in the balmer lines. alight-echo discovered expanding around the object helped to constrain thedistance (d=790+/-30 pc), providing m_v=+4.45 in quiescence and m_v=-4.35 atoptical maximum (somewhat dependent on the still uncertain e(b-v)=0.5reddening). the general outburst trend is toward lower temperatures and largerluminosities, and continuing so at the time of writing. the object propertiesconflict with a classification within already existing categories: theprogenitor was not on a post-agb track and thus the similarities with theborn-again agb stars fg sge, v605 aql and sakurai's object are limited to thecool giant spectrum at maximum; the cool spectrum, the moderate wind velocity(500 km/sec and progressively reducing) and the monotonic decreasing of the lowionization condition argues against a classical nova scenario. the closestsimilarity is with a star that erupted into an m-type supergiant discovered inm31 by rich et al. (1989), that became however much brighter by peaking atm_v=-9.95, and with v4332 sgr that too erupted into an m-type giant (martini etal. 1999) and that attained a lower luminosity, closer to that of v838 mon.m31-redvar, v4332 sgr and v838 mon could be manifestations of the same and newclass of astronomical objects.

astro-ph;0403051	abundance differences between components of wide binaries	in this paper we present iron abundance analysis for 23 wide binaries withmain sequence components in the temperture range 4900-6300 k, taken from thesample of the pairs currently included in the radial velocity planet search ongoing at the tng. the use of a line-by-line differential analysis techniquebetween the components of each pair allows to reach errors of about 0.02 dex inthe iron content difference. most of the pairs have abundance differences lowerthan 0.02 dex and there are no pairs with differences larger than 0.07 dex. thefour cases of differences larger than 0.02 dex may be spouriuos because of thelarger error bars affecting pairs with large temperature difference, cold starsand rotating stars. the pair hd 219542, previously reported by us to havedifferent composition, results instead normal. for non-rotating stars warmerthan 5500 k, we are able to exclude in most cases the ingestion of more than 1earth mass of iron (about 5 earth masses of meteoritic material) during themain sequence lifetime of the stars, placing more stringent limits (about 0.4earth masses of iron) in five cases of warm stars. this latter limit is similarto the estimates of rocky material accreted by the sun during its main sequencelifetime. combining the results of the present analysis with those for thehyades and pleiades, we conclude that the hypothesis that pollution byplanetary material is the only responsible for the highest metallicity of thestars with planets may be rejected at more than 99% level of confidence if theincidence of planets in these samples is as high as 8% and similar to the fieldstars included in current radial velocity surveys. however, the significance ofthis result drops considerably if the incidence of planets around stars inbinary systems and clusters is less than a half than around normal field stars.

astro-ph;0610623	properties of planets in binary systems. the role of binary separation	the statistical properties of planets in binaries were investigated. anydifference to planets orbiting single stars can shed light on the formation andevolution of planetary systems. as planets were found around components ofbinaries with very different separation and mass ratio, it is particularlyimportant to study the characteristics of planets as a function of theeffective gravitational influence of the companion. a compilation of planets inbinary systems was made; a search for companions orbiting stars recently shownto host planets was performed, resulting in the addition of two further binaryplanet hosts (hd 20782 and hd 109749). the probable original properties of thethree binary planet hosts with white dwarfs companions were also investigated.using this updated sample of planets in binaries we performed a statisticalanalysis of the distributions of planet mass, period, and eccentricity,fraction of multiplanet systems, and stellar metallicity for planets orbitingcomponents of tight and wide binaries and single stars. the only highlysignificant difference revealed by our analysis concerns the mass distributionof short-period planets. massive planets in short period orbits are found inmost cases around the components of rather tight binaries. the properties ofexoplanets orbiting the components of wide binaries are compatible with thoseof planets orbiting single stars, except for a possible greater abundance ofhigh-eccentricity planets. the previously suggested lack of massive planetswith p&gt;100 days in binaries is not confirmed. we conclude that the presence ofa stellar companion with separation smaller than 100-300 au is able to modifythe formation and/or migration and/or the dynamical evolution history of giantplanets while wide companions play a more limited role
