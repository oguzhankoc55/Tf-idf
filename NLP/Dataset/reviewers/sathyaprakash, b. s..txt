0904.1715	template banks to search for compact binaries with spinning components  in gravitational wave data	gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are one of the mostpromising sources for detectors such as ligo, virgo and geo600. if thecomponents of the binary posess significant angular momentum (spin), as islikely to be the case if one component is a black hole, spin-induced precessionof a binary's orbital plane causes modulation of the gravitational-waveamplitude and phase. if the templates used in a matched-filter search do notaccurately model these effects then the sensitivity, and hence the detectionrate, will be reduced. we investigate the ability of several search pipelinesto detect gravitational waves from compact binaries with spin. we use thepost-newtonian approximation to model the inspiral phase of the signal andconstruct two new template banks using the phenomenological waveforms ofbuonanno, chen and vallisneri. we compare the performance of these templatebanks to that of banks constructed using the stationary phase approximation tothe non-spinning post-newtonian inspiral waveform currently used by ligo andvirgo in the search for compact binary coalescence. we find that, at the samefalse alarm rate, a search pipeline using phenomenological templates is no moreeffective than a pipeline which uses non-spinning templates. we recommend thecontinued use of the non-spinning stationary phase template bank until thefalse alarm rate associated with templates which include spin effects can besubstantially reduced.

0907.0700	comparison of post-newtonian templates for compact binary inspiral  signals in gravitational-wave detectors	the two-body dynamics in general relativity has been solved perturbativelyusing the post-newtonian (pn) approximation. the evolution of the orbital phaseand the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to a rather high order upto o(v^8), v being the characteristic velocity of the binary. the orbitalevolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due to the inherent freedom inthe choice of parameter used in the pn expansion as well as the method pursuedin solving the relevant differential equations. the goal of this paper is todetermine the (dis)agreement between different pn waveform families in thecontext of initial and advanced gravitational-wave detectors. the waveformsemployed in our analysis are those that are currently used by initialligo/virgo, that is the time-domain pn models taylort1, taylort2, taylort3,taylort4 and tayloret, the effective one-body (eob) model, and thefourier-domain representation taylorf2. we examine the overlaps of these modelswith one another and with the prototype effective one-body model (calibrated tonumerical relativity simulations, as currently used by initial ligo) for anumber of different binaries at 2pn, 3pn and 3.5pn orders to quantify theirdifferences and to help us decide whether there exist preferred families thatare the most appropriate as search templates. we conclude that as long as thetotal mass remains less than a certain upper limit m_crit, all templatefamilies at 3.5pn order (except taylort3 and tayloret) are equally good for thepurpose of detection. the value of m_crit is found to be ~ 12m_sun for initial,enhanced and advanced ligo. from a purely computational point of view werecommend that 3.5pn taylorf2 be used below mcrit and eob calibrated tonumerical relativity simulations be used for total binary mass m &gt; mcrit.

1001.3099	weak lensing effects in the measurement of the dark energy equation of  state with lisa	the laser interferometer space antenna's (lisa's) observation of supermassivebinary black holes (smbbh) could provide a new tool for precision cosmography.inclusion of sub-dominant signal harmonics in the inspiral signal allows forhigh-accuracy sky localization, dramatically improving the chances of findingthe host galaxy and obtaining its redshift. a smbbh merger can potentially havecomponent masses from a wide range ($10^5 - 10^8\,\ms$) over which parameteraccuracies vary considerably. we perform an in-depth study in order tounderstand (i) what fraction of possible smbbh mergers allow for skylocalization, depending on the parameters of the source, and (ii) howaccurately $w$ can be measured when the host galaxy can be identified. we alsoinvestigate how accuracies on all parameters improve when a knowledge of thesky position can be folded into the estimation of errors. we find that $w$ canbe measured to within a few percent in most cases, if the only error inmeasuring the luminosity distance is due to lisa's instrumental noise and theconfusion background from galactic binaries. however, weak lensing-inducederrors will severely degrade the accuracy with which $w$ can be obtained,emphasizing that methods to mitigate weak lensing effects would be required totake advantage of lisa's full potential.

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1003.2939	a tapering window for time-domain templates and simulated signals in the  detection of gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries	inspiral signals from binary black holes, in particular those with masses inthe range $10m_\odot \lsim m \lsim 1000 m_\odot,$ may last for only a fewcycles within a detector's most sensitive frequency band. the spectrum of asquare-windowed time-domain signal could contain unwanted power that can causeproblems in gravitational wave data analysis, particularly when the waveformsare of short duration. there may be leakage of power into frequency bins whereno such power is expected, causing an excess of false alarms. we present amethod of tapering the time-domain waveforms that significantly reducesunwanted leakage of power, leading to a spectrum that agrees very well withthat of a long duration signal. our tapered window also decreases the falsealarms caused by instrumental and environmental transients that are picked upby templates with spurious signal power. the suppression of background is animportant goal in noise-dominated searches and can lead to an improvement inthe detection efficiency of the search algorithms.

1005.0304	parametrized tests of post-newtonian theory using advanced ligo and  einstein telescope	general relativity has very specific predictions for the gravitationalwaveforms from inspiralling compact binaries obtained using the post-newtonian(pn) approximation. we investigate the extent to which the measurement of thepn coefficients, possible with the second generation gravitationalwavedetectors such as the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-waveobservatory (ligo) and the third generation gravitational-wave detectors suchas the einstein telescope (et), could be used to test post-newtonian theory andto put bounds on a subclass of parametrized-post-einstein theories which differfrom general relativity in a parametrized sense. we demonstrate thispossibility by employing the best inspiralling waveform model for nonspinningcompact binaries which is 3.5pn accurate in phase and 3pn in amplitude. withinthe class of theories considered, advanced ligo can test the theory at 1.5pnand thus the leading tail term. future observations of stellar mass black holebinaries by et can test the consistency between the various pn coefficients inthe gravitational-wave phasing over the mass range of 11-44 msun. the choice ofthe lower frequency cut off is important for testing post-newtonian theoryusing the et. the bias in the test arising from the assumption of nonspinningbinaries is indicated.

1309.4027	gravitational waves from known pulsars: results from the initial  detector era	we present the results of searches for gravitational waves from a largeselection of pulsars using data from the most recent science runs (s6, vsr2 andvsr4) of the initial generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectorsligo (laser interferometric gravitational-wave observatory) and virgo. we donot see evidence for gravitational wave emission from any of the targetedsources but produce upper limits on the emission amplitude. we highlight theresults from seven young pulsars with large spin-down luminosities. we reachwithin a factor of five of the canonical spin-down limit for all seven ofthese, whilst for the crab and vela pulsars we further surpass their spin-downlimits. we present new or updated limits for 172 other pulsars (including bothyoung and millisecond pulsars). now that the detectors are undergoing majorupgrades, and, for completeness, we bring together all of the most up-to-dateresults from all pulsars searched for during the operations of thefirst-generation ligo, virgo and geo600 detectors. this gives a total of 195pulsars including the most recent results described in this paper.

1309.6160	search for long-lived gravitational-wave transients coincident with long  gamma-ray bursts	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been linked to extreme core-collapsesupernovae from massive stars. gravitational waves (gw) offer a probe of thephysics behind long grbs. we investigate models of long-lived (~10-1000s) gwemission associated with the accretion disk of a collapsed star or with itsprotoneutron star remnant. using data from ligo's fifth science run, and grbtriggers from the swift experiment, we perform a search for unmodeledlong-lived gw transients. finding no evidence of gw emission, we place 90%confidence level upper limits on the gw fluence at earth from long grbs forthree waveforms inspired by a model of gws from accretion disk instabilities.these limits range from f&lt;3.5 ergs cm^-2 to $f&lt;1200 ergs cm^-2, depending onthe grb and on the model, allowing us to probe optimistic scenarios of gwproduction out to distances as far as ~33 mpc. advanced detectors are expectedto achieve strain sensitivities 10x better than initial ligo, potentiallyallowing us to probe the engines of the nearest long grbs.

1312.1862	host redshifts from gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron  star mergers	inspiralling compact binaries as standard sirens will soon become aninvaluable tool for cosmology when advanced interferometric gravitational-wavedetectors begin their observations in the coming years. however, a degeneracyin the information carried by gravitational waves between the total rest-framemass $m$ and the redshift $z$ of the source implies that neither can bedirectly extracted from the signal, but only the combination $m(1+z)$, theredshifted mass. recent work has shown that for binary neutron star systems, atidal correction to the gravitational-wave phase in the late-inspiral signalthat depends on the rest-frame source mass could be used to break themass-redshift degeneracy. we propose here to use the signature encoded in thepost-merger signal to deduce the redshift to the source. this will allow anaccurate extraction of the intrinsic rest-frame mass of the source, in turnpermitting the determination of source redshift and luminosity distance solelyfrom gravitational-wave observations. this will herald a new era in precisioncosmography and astrophysics. using numerical simulations of binary neutronstar mergers of very slightly different mass, we model gravitational-wavesignals at different redshifts and use bayesian parameter estimation todetermine the accuracy with which the redshift can be extracted for a source ofknown mass. we find that the einstein telescope can determine the sourceredshift to $sim 10$--$20%$ at redshifts of $z&lt;0.04$.

1406.3201	testing the no-hair theorem with black hole ringdowns using tiger	the einstein telescope (et), a proposed third-generation gravitational waveobservatory, would enable tests of the no-hair theorem by looking at thecharacteristic frequencies and damping times of black hole ringdown signals. inprevious work it was shown that with a single $500 - 1000\,m_\odot$ black holeat distance $\lesssim 6$ gpc (or redshift $z \lesssim 1$), deviations of a fewpercent in the frequencies and damping times of dominant and sub-dominant modeswould be within the range of detectability. given that such sources may berelatively rare, it is of interest to see how well the no-hair theorem can betested with events at much larger distances and with smaller signal-to-noiseratios, thus accessing a far bigger volume of space and a larger number ofsources. we employ a model selection scheme called tiger (test infrastructurefor general relativity), which was originally developed to test generalrelativity with weak binary coalescence signals that will be seen insecond-generation detectors such as advanced ligo and advanced virgo. tiger iswell-suited for the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from apopulation of sources can be combined so as to arrive at a stronger test. byperforming a range of simulations using the expected noise power spectraldensity of einstein telescope, we show that with tiger, similar deviations fromthe no-hair theorem as considered in previous work will be detectable withgreat confidence using $\mathcal{o}(10)$ sources distributed uniformly inco-moving volume out to 50 gpc ($z \lesssim 5$).

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1504.04766	the missing link: bayesian detection and measurement of  intermediate-mass black-hole binaries	we perform bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave signals from non-spinning,intermediate-mass black-hole binaries (imbhbs) with observed total mass,$m_{\mathrm{obs}}$, from $50\mathrm{m}_{\odot}$ to $500\mathrm{m}_{\odot}$ andmass ratio $1\mbox{--}4$ using advanced ligo and virgo detectors. we employinspiral-merger-ringdown waveform models based on the effective-one-bodyformalism and include subleading modes of radiation beyond the leading $(2,2)$mode. the presence of subleading modes increases signal power for inclinedbinaries and allows for improved accuracy and precision in measurements of themasses as well as breaking of extrinsic parameter degeneracies. for low totalmasses, $m_{\mathrm{obs}} \lesssim 50 \mathrm{m}_{\odot}$, the observed chirpmass $\mathcal{m}_{\rm obs} = m_{\mathrm{obs}}\,\eta^{3/5}$ ($\eta$ being thesymmetric mass ratio) is better measured. in contrast, as increasing powercomes from merger and ringdown, we find that the total mass $m_{\mathrm{obs}}$has better relative precision than $\mathcal{m}_{\rm obs}$. indeed, at high$m_{\mathrm{obs}}$ ($\geq 300 \mathrm{m}_{\odot}$), the signal resembles aburst and the measurement thus extracts the dominant frequency of the signalthat depends on $m_{\mathrm{obs}}$. depending on the binary's inclination, atsignal-to-noise ratio (snr) of $12$, uncertainties in $m_{\mathrm{obs}}$ can beas large as $\sim 20 \mbox{--}25\%$ while uncertainties in $\mathcal{m}_{\rmobs}$ are $\sim 50 \mbox{--}60\%$ in binaries with unequal masses (thosenumbers become $\sim 17\%$ versus $\sim22\%$ in more symmetric binaries).although large, those uncertainties will establish the existence of imbhs. ourresults show that gravitational-wave observations can offer a unique tool toobserve and understand the formation, evolution and demographics of imbhs,which are difficult to observe in the electromagnetic window.

astro-ph;9408089	gravitational instability in the strongly nonlinear regime: a study of  various approximations	we study the development of gravitational instability in the stronglynon-linear regime. for this purpose we use a number of statistical indicatorssuch as filamentary statistics, spectrum of overdense/underdense regions andthe void probability function, each of which probes a particular aspect ofgravitational clustering. we use these statistical indicators to discriminatebetween different approximations to gravitational instability which we testagainst n-body simulations. the approximations which we test are, the truncatedzel'dovich approximation (tz), the adhesion model (am), and the frozen flow(ff) and linear potential (lp) approximations. of these we find that ff and lpbreak down relatively early, soon after the non-linear length scale exceeds$r_*$ -- the mean distance between peaks of the gravitational potential. thereason for this break down is easy to understand, particles in ff areconstrained to follow the streamlines of the initial velocity field. shellcrossing is absent in this case and structure gradually freezes as particlesbegin to collect near minima of the gravitational potential. in lp particlesfollow the lines of force of the primordial potential, oscillating about itsminima at late times when the non-linear length scale $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}\simeqr_*$. unlike ff and lp the adhesion model (and to some extent tz) continues togive accurate results even at late times when $k_{\rm nl}^{-1} \ge r_*$. thisis because both am and tz use

astro-ph;9805285	morphology of clusters and superclusters in n-body simulations of  cosmological gravitational clustering	we analyse shapes of overdense regions (clusters and superclusters) incontrolled n-body simulations of gravitational clustering with power lawinitial spectra p(k) \propto k^n, n = -3, -2, -1, 0. at values of the densityjust above the percolation transition the number of distinct (isolated)clusters peaks and we use this `natural threshold' to study the shapes andmultiplicity function of clusters and superclusters. we find that the extent ofboth filamentarity and pancakeness increases as the simulation evolves, theformer being appreciably larger than the latter at virtually all epochs and forall spectra considered by us. our results also show that high density regionswithin very massive clusters/superclusters are likely to be noticeablyfilamentary or pancake/ribbon-like when compared to the less dense regionswithin these objects. we make a detailed study of two, moment-based `shapestatistics' proposed, respectively, by babul &amp; starkman (bs) and luo &amp; vishniac(lv) and find that both lv and bs have certain built-in limitations: lv isbiased towards oblate structures and tends to overemphasise this property;neither bs nor lv correctly describe the shape of strongly curved ortopologically nontrivial objects. for instance, a thin filamentary torus and aribbon are both described by bs and lv as being pancakes ! by contrastshapefinders, a new shape diagnostic not constructed from density moments butfrom minskowski functionals, does not suffer from these limitations and appearsto faithfully reproduce the shapes of both simple and topologically complexobjects.

astro-ph;9904406	evidence for filamentarity in the las campanas redshift survey	we apply shapefinders, statistical measures of `shape' constructed from twodimensional partial minkowski functionals, to study the degree of filamentarityin the las campanas redshift survey (lcrs). in two dimensions, three minkowskifunctionals characterise the morphology of an object, they are: its perimeter(l), area (s), and genus. out of l and s a single dimensionless shapefinderstatistic, f can be constructed (0 &lt;=f &lt;=1). f acquires extreme values on acircle (f = 0) and a filament (f = 1). using f, we quantify the extent offilamentarity in the lcrs by comparing our results with a poisson distributionwith similar geometrical properties and having the same selection function asthe survey. our results unambiguously demonstrate that the lcrs displays a highdegree of filamentarity both in the northern and southern galactic sections aresult that is in general agreement with the visual appearance of thecatalogue. it is well known that gravitational clustering from gaussian initialconditions gives rise to the development of non-gaussianity reflected in theformation of a network-like filamentary structure on supercluster scales.consequently the fact that the smoothed lcrs catalogue shows propertiesconsistent with those of a gaussian random field (colley 1997) whereas theunsmoothed catalogue demonstrates the presence of filamentarity lends strongsupport to the conjecture that the large scale clustering of galaxies is drivenby gravitational instability.

gr-qc;0008059	gravitational wave chirp search: economization of pn matched filter bank  via cardinal interpolation	the final inspiral phase in the evolution of a compact binary consisting ofblack holes and/or neutron stars is among the most probable events that anetwork of ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors is likelyto observe. gravitational radiation emitted during this phase will have to bedug out of noise by matched-filtering (correlating) the detector output with abank of several $10^5$ templates, making the computational resources requiredquite demanding, though not formidable. we propose an interpolation method forevaluating the correlation between template waveforms and the detector outputand show that the method is effective in substantially reducing the number oftemplates required. indeed, the number of templates needed could be a factor$\sim 4$ smaller than required by the usual approach, when the minimal overlapbetween the template bank and an arbitrary signal (the so-called {\it minimalmatch}) is 0.97. the method is amenable to easy implementation, and the variousdetector projects might benefit by adopting it to reduce the computationalcosts of inspiraling neutron star and black hole binary search.

gr-qc;0406038	improved gravitational waveforms from spinning black hole binaries	the standard post-newtonian approximation to gravitational waveforms, calledt-approximants, from non-spinning black hole binaries are known not to besufficiently accurate close to the last stable orbit of the system. a newapproximation, called p-approximants, is believed to improve the accuracy ofthe waveforms rendering them applicable up to the last stable orbit. in thisstudy we apply p-approximants to the case of a test-particle in equatorialorbit around a kerr black hole parameterized by a spin parameter q that takesvalues between -1 and 1. in order to assess the performance of the twoapproximants we measure their effectualness (i.e. larger overlaps with theexact signal), and faithfulness (i.e. smaller biases while measuring theparameters of the signal) with the exact (numerical) waveforms. we find that inthe case of prograde orbits, that is orbits whose angular momentum is in thesame sense as the spin angular momentum of the black hole, t-approximanttemplates obtain an effectualness of ~ 0.99 for spins q &lt; 0.75. for 0.75 &lt; q &lt;0.95, the effectualness drops to about 0.82. the p-approximants achieveeffectualness of &gt; 0.99 for all spins up to q = 0.95. the bias in theestimation of parameters is much lower in the case of p-approximants thant-approximants. we find that p-approximants are both effectual and faithful andshould be more effective than t-approximants as a detection template familywhen q&gt;0. for q&lt;0 both t- and p-approximants perform equally well so thateither of them could be used as a detection template family.

gr-qc;0411146	parameter estimation of inspiralling compact binaries using 3.5  post-newtonian gravitational wave phasing: the non-spinning case	(abridged) we revisit the problem of parameter estimation ofgravitational-wave chirp signals from inspiralling non-spinning compactbinaries in the light of the recent extension of the post-newtonian (pn)phasing formula to order $(v/c)^7$ beyond the leading newtonian order. we studyin detail the implications of higher post-newtonian orders from 1pn up to 3.5pnin steps of 0.5pn ($\sim v/c$), and examine their convergence. in both initialand advanced detectors the estimation of the chirp mass (${\cal m}$) andsymmetric mass ratio ($\eta$) improve at higher pn orders but oscillate withevery half-a-pn order. we compare parameter estimation in different detectorsand assess their relative performance in two different ways: at a {\it fixedsnr,} with the aim of understanding how the bandwidth improves parameterestimation, and for a {\it fixed source}, to gauge the importance ofsensitivity. errors in parameter estimation at a fixed snr are smaller forvirgo than for both initial and advanced ligo. however, for sources at a fixeddistance it is advanced ligo that achieves the lowest errors owing to itsgreater sensitivity. finally, we compute the amplitude corrections due to the`frequency-sweep' in the fourier domain representation of the waveform withinthe stationary phase approximation and discuss its implication on parameterestimation.

gr-qc;0412033	new class of post-newtonian approximants to the waveform templates of  inspiralling compact binaries: test-mass in the schwarzschild spacetime	(abridged): the standard adiabatic approximation to phasing of gravitationalwaves from inspiralling compact binaries uses the post-newtonian expansions ofthe binding energy and gravitational wave flux both truncated at the samerelative post-newtonian order. motivated by the eventual need to go beyond theadiabatic approximation we must view the problem as the dynamics of the binaryunder conservative post-newtonian forces and gravitational radiation damping.  from the viewpoint of the dynamics of the binary, the standard approximationat leading order is equivalent to retaining the 0pn and 2.5pn terms in theacceleration and neglecting the intervening 1pn and 2pn terms. a completemathematically consistent treatment of the acceleration at leading order shouldinclude all pn terms up to 2.5pn without any gaps. these define the 'standard'and 'complete' non-adiabatic approximants respectively. we propose a new andsimple complete adiabatic approximant constructed from the energy and fluxfunctions. at the leading order it uses the 2pn energy function rather than the0pn one in the standard approximation so that in spirit it corresponds to thedynamics where there are no missing post-newtonian terms in the acceleration.we compare the overlaps of the standard and complete adiabatic approximantswith the exact waveforms for a test-particle orbiting a schwarzschild blackhole. the complete adiabatic approximants lead to a remarkable improvement inthe effectualness at lower pn (&lt; 3pn) orders. however, standard adiabaticapproximants of order $\geq$ 3pn are nearly as good as the complete adiabaticapproximants for the construction of effectual templates. standard and completeapproximants beyond the adiabatic approximation are next studied using thelagrangian models of buonanno, chen and vallisneri.

gr-qc;0604037	a template bank to search for gravitational waves from inspiralling  compact binaries i: physical models	gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are searched using thematched filtering technique. as the model waveform depends on a number ofparameters, it is necessary to filter the data through a template bank coveringthe astrophysically interesting region of the parameter space. the choice oftemplates is defined by the maximum allowed drop in signal-to-noise ratio dueto the discreteness of the template bank. in this paper we describe thetemplate-bank algorithm that was used in the analysis of data from the laserinterferometer gravitational wave observatory (ligo) and geo 600 detectors tosearch for signals from binaries consisting of non-spinning compact objects.using monte-carlo simulations, we study the efficiency of the bank and showthat its performance is satisfactory for the design sensitivity curves ofground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors geo 600, initialligo, advanced ligo and virgo. the bank is efficient to search for variouscompact binaries such as binary primordial black holes, binary neutron stars,binary black holes, as well as a mixed binary consisting of a non-spinningblack hole and a neutron star.

gr-qc;9411043	filtering post-newtonian gravitational waves from coalescing binaries	gravitational waves from inspiralling binaries are expected to be detectedusing a data analysis technique known as {\it matched filtering.} thistechnique is applicable whenever the form of the signal is known accurately.though we know the form of the signal precisely, we will not know {\it apriori} its parameters. hence it is essential to filter the raw output througha host of search templates each corresponding to different values of theparameters. the number of search templates needed in detecting the newtonianwaveform characterized by three independent parameters is itself severalthousands. with the inclusion of post-newtonian corrections the inspiralwaveform will have four independent parameters and this, it was thought, wouldlead to an increase in the number of filters by several orders ofmagnitude---an unfavorable feature since it would drastically slow down dataanalysis. in this paper i show that by a judicious choice of signal parameterswe can work, even when the first post-newtonian corrections are included, withas many number of parameters as in the newtonian case. in other words idemonstrate that the effective dimensionality of the signal parameter spacedoes not change when first post-newtonian corrections are taken into account.
