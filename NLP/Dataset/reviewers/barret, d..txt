0902.1118	monte-carlo simulations of the background of the coded-mask camera for  x- and gamma-rays on-board the chinese-french grb mission svom	for several decades now, wide-field coded mask cameras have been used withsuccess to localise gamma-ray bursts (grbs). in these instruments, the eventcount rate is dominated by the photon background due to their large field ofview and large effective area. it is therefore essential to estimate theinstrument background expected in orbit during the early phases of theinstrument design in order to optimise the scientific performances of themission. we present here a detailed study of the instrument background andsensitivity of the coded-mask camera for x- and gamma-rays (cxg) to be used inthe detection and localisation of high-redshift grbs on-board the internationalgrb mission svom. to compute the background spectrum, a monte-carlo approachwas used to simulate the primary and secondary interactions between particlesfrom the main components of the space environment that svom will encounteralong its low earth orbit (leo) (with an altitude of 600 km and an inclinationof ~ 30 deg) and the body of the cxg. we consider the detailed mass model ofthe cxg in its latest design. according to our results, i) the design of thepassive shield of the camera ensures that in the 4-50 kev imaging band thecosmic x-gamma-ray background is dominant whilst the internal background shouldstart to become dominant above 70-90 kev; ii) the current camera design ensuresthat the cxg camera will be more sensitive to high-redshift grbs than the swiftburst alert telescope thanks to a low-energy threshold of 4 kev.

0906.4195	svom: a new mission for gamma-ray burst studies	we present the svom (space-based multi-band astronomical variable objectmonitor) mission, that is being developed in cooperation between the chinesenational space agency (cnsa), the chinese academy of science (cas) and thefrench space agency (cnes). its scientific objectives include the study of thegrb phenomenon, grb physics and progenitors, cosmology, and fundamentalphysics. svom is designed to detect all known types of gamma-ray bursts (grbs),to provide fast and reliable grb positions, to measure the broadband spectralcharacteristics and temporal properties of the grb prompt emission. this willbe obtained in first place thanks to a set of four space flown instruments. awide field (~2 sr) coded mask telescope (eclairs), operating in the 4-250 kevenergy range, will provide the triggers and localizations, while a gamma-raynon-imaging spectrometer (grm), sensitive in the 50 kev-5 mev domain, willextend the prompt emission energy coverage. after a satellite slew, in order toplace the grb direction within field of view of the two narrow fieldinstruments - a soft x-ray (xiao), and a visible telescope (vt) - the grbposition will be refined and the study of the early phases of the grb afterglowwill be possible. a set of three ground based dedicated instruments, tworobotic telescopes (gfts) and a wide angle optical monitor (gwac), willcomplement the space borne instruments. thanks to the low energy triggerthreshold (~4 kev) of the eclairs, svom is ideally suited for the detection ofsoft, hence potentially most distant, grbs. its observing strategy is optimizedto facilitate follow-up observations from the largest ground based facilities.

0908.1098	relativistic lines and reflection from the inner accretion disks around  neutron stars	a number of neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries have recently beendiscovered to show broad, asymmetric fe k emission lines in their x-rayspectra. these lines are generally thought to be the most prominent part of areflection spectrum, originating in the inner part of the accretion disk wherestrong relativistic effects can broaden emission lines. we present acomprehensive, systematic analysis of suzaku and xmm-newton spectra of 10neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries, all of which display broad fe k emissionlines. of the 10 sources, 4 are z sources, 4 are atolls and 2 are accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars (also atolls). the fe k lines are well fit by arelativistic line model for a schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range ofinner disk radii (6 - 15 gm/c^2) in most cases. this implies that the accretiondisk extends close to the neutron star surface over a range of luminosities.continuum modeling shows that for the majority of observations, a blackbodycomponent (plausibly associated with the boundary layer) dominates the x-rayemission from 8 - 20 kev. thus it appears likely that this spectral componentproduces the majority of the ionizing flux that illuminates the accretion disk.therefore, we also fit the spectra with a blurred reflection model, wherein ablackbody component illuminates the disk. this model fits well in most cases,supporting the idea that the boundary layer is illuminating a geometricallythin disk.

0708.3816	constraining the equation of state of supra-nuclear dense matter from  xmm-newton observations of neutron stars in globular clusters	we report on the detailed modelling of the x-ray spectra of three likelyneutron stars. the neutron stars, observed with xmm-newton are found in threequiescent x-ray binaries in the globular clusters: omega cen, m 13 and ngc2808. whether they are accreting at very low rates or radiating energy from anaccretion heated core, their x-ray spectra are expected to be those of ahydrogen atmosphere. we use and compare publicly available hydrogen atmospheremodels, with constant and varying surface gravities to constrain the masses andradii of the neutron stars. thanks to the high xmm-newton throughput, and theaccurate distances available for these clusters, using the latest scienceanalysis software release and calibration of the xmm-newton epic cameras, wederive the most stringent constraints on the masses and radii of the neutronstars obtained to date from these systems. a comparison of the models indicatethat previously used hydrogen atmosphere models (assuming constant surfacegravity) tend to underestimate the mass and overestimate the radius of neutronstars. our data constrain the allowed equations of state to those which concernnormal nucleonic matter and one possible strange quark matter model, thusconstraining radii to be from 8 km and masses up to 2.4 m$_\odot$.

1102.4336	the origin of variability of the intermediate-mass black-hole ulx system  hlx-1 in eso 243-49	the ultra-luminous intermediate-mass black-hole system hlx-1 in the eso243-49 galaxy exhibits variability with a possible recurrence time of a fewhundred days. finding the origin of this variability would constrain the stilllargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. since it exhibits anintensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole x-ray transients, wehave analyzed the variability of hlx-1 in the framework of the disk instabilitymodel that explains outbursts of such systems. we find that the long-termvariability of hlx-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outburstsare triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disc. possiblealternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk butwe argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due totidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-massblack hole. we consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation ofsuch a system and estimate the probability of its observation. we conclude,using a simplified dynamical model of the post-collapse cluster, that no morethan 1/100 to 1/10 of mbh &lt; 10^4 msun imbhs - formed by run-away stellarmergers in the dense collapsed cores of young clusters - could have a few times1 msun main-sequence star evolve to an agb on an orbit eccentric enough formass transfer at periapse, while avoiding collisional destruction or beingscattered into the imbh by 2-body encounters. the finite but low probability ofthis configuration is consistent with the uniqueness of hlx-1. we note,however, that the actual response of a standard accretion disk to bursts ofmass transfer may be too slow to explain the observations unless the orbit isclose to parabolic (and hence even rarer) and/or additional heating, presumablylinked to the highly time-dependent gravitational potential, are invoked.

1204.3461	investigating slim disk solutions for hlx-1 in eso 243-49	the hyper luminous x-ray source hlx-1 in the galaxy eso 243-49, currently thebest intermediate mass black hole candidate, displays spectral transitionssimilar to those observed in galactic black hole binaries, but with aluminosity 100-1000 times higher. we investigated the x-ray properties of thisunique source fitting multi-epoch data collected by swift, xmm-newton &amp; chandrawith a disk model computing spectra for a wide range of sub- andsuper-eddington accretion rates assuming a non-spinning black hole and aface-on disk (i = 0 deg). under these assumptions we find that the black holein hlx-1 is in the intermediate mass range (~2 x 10^4 m_odot) and the accretionflow is in the sub-eddington regime. the disk radiation efficiency is eta =0.11 +/-0.03. we also show that the source does follow the l_x ~ t^4 relationfor our mass estimate. at the outburst peaks, the source radiates near theeddington limit. the accretion rate then stays constant around 4 x 10^(-4)m_odot yr^(-1) for several days and then decreases exponentially. such"plateaus" in the accretion rate could be evidence that enhanced mass transferrate is the driving outburst mechanism in hlx-1. we also report on the newoutburst observed in august 2011 by the swift-x-ray telescope. the time of thisnew outburst further strengthens the ~1 year recurrence timescale.

1310.5776	constraints on the neutron star and inner accretion flow in serpens x-1  using nustar	we report on an observation of the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary serpensx-1, made with nustar. the extraordinary sensitivity afforded by nustarfacilitated the detection of a clear, robust, relativistic fe k emission linefrom the inner disk. a relativistic profile is required over a single gaussianline from any charge state of fe at the 5-sigma level of confidence, and anytwo gaussians of equal width at the same confidence. the comptonback-scattering "hump" peaking in the 10-20 kev band is detected for the firsttime in a neutron star x-ray binary. fits with relativistically-blurred diskreflection models suggest that the disk likely extends close to the innermoststable circular orbit (isco) or stellar surface. the best-fit blurredreflection models constrain the gravitational redshift from the stellar surfaceto be z &gt; 0.16. the data are broadly compatible with the disk extending to theisco; in that case, z &gt; 0.22 and r &lt; 12.6 km (assuming m = 1.4 msun and a=0,where a = cj/gm^2). if the star is as large or larger than its isco, or if theeffective reflecting disk leaks across the isco to the surface, the redshiftconstraints become measurements. we discuss our results in the context ofefforts to measure fundamental properties of neutron stars, and models foraccretion onto compact objects.

(2011) in which the regular outbursts could be related to thepassage at periastron of a star circling the intermediate mass black hole in aneccentric orbit, which triggers mass transfer into a quasi-permanent accretiondisk around the black hole. further, if there is indeed a delay in the x-rayemission we estimate the mass-transfer delivery radius to be ~1e11 cm.

1312.1697	the loft mission: new perspectives in the research field of (accreting)  compact objects	loft, the large observatory for x-ray timing, is one of five esa m3 candidatemissions. it will address the cosmic vision theme: "matter under extremeconditions". by coupling for the first time a huge collecting area for thedetection of x-ray photons with ccd-quality spectral resolution (15 timesbigger in area than any previously flown x-ray instrument and &gt;100 times biggerfor spectroscopy than any similar-resolution instrument), the instrumentson-board loft have been designed to (i) determine the properties of ultradensematter by reconstructing its equation of state through neutron star mass andradius measurements of unprecedented accuracy; (ii) measure general relativityeffects in the strong field regime in the stationary spacetimes of neutronstars and black holes of all masses down to a few gravitational radii. besidesthe above two themes, loft's observations will be devoted to "observatoryscience", providing new insights in a number of research fields in high energyastrophysics (e.g. gamma-ray bursts). the assessment study phase of loft, whichended in september 2013, demonstrated that the mission is low risk and therequired technology readiness level can be easily reached in time for a launchby the end of 2022.

1402.2992	broadband x-ray spectra of the ultraluminous x-ray source holmberg ix  x-1 observed with nustar, xmm-newton and suzaku	we present results from the coordinated broadband x-ray observations of theextreme ultraluminous x-ray source holmberg ix x-1 performed by nustar,xmm-newton and suzaku in late 2012. these observations provide the firsthigh-quality spectra of holmberg ix x-1 above 10 kev to date, extending thex-ray coverage of this remarkable source up to ~30 kev. broadband observationswere undertaken at two epochs, between which holmberg ix x-1 exhibited bothflux and strong spectral variability, increasing in luminosity from lx =(1.90+/-0.03)e40 erg/s to lx = (3.35+/-0.03)e40 erg/s. neither epoch exhibits aspectrum consistent with emission from the standard low/hard accretion stateseen in galactic black hole binaries, that would have been expected if holmbergix x-1 harbors a truly massive black hole accreting at substantiallysub-eddington accretion rates. the nustar data confirm that the curvatureobserved previously in the 3-10 kev bandpass does represent a true spectralcutoff. during each epoch, the spectrum appears to be dominated by twooptically thick thermal components, likely associated with an accretion disk.the spectrum also shows some evidence for a non-thermal tail at the highestenergies, which may further support this scenario. the available data allow foreither of the two thermal components to dominate the spectral evolution,although both scenarios require highly non-standard behavior for thermalaccretion disk emission.

1403.1769	patchy accretion disks in ultraluminous x-ray sources	the x-ray spectra of the most extreme ultra-luminous x-ray sources -- thosewith l &gt; 1 e+40 erg/s -- remain something of a mystery. spectral roll-over inthe 5-10 kev band was originally detected in in the deepest xmm-newtonobservations of the brightest sources; this is confirmed in subsequent nustarspectra. this emission can be modeled via comptonization, but with low electrontemperatures (kt_e ~ 2 kev) and high optical depths (tau ~ 10) that posenumerous difficulties. moreover, evidence of cooler thermal emission that canbe fit with thin disk models persists, even in fits to joint xmm-newton andnustar observations. using ngc 1313 x-1 as a test case, we show that a patchydisk with a multiple temperature profile may provide an excellent descriptionof such spectra. in principle, a number of patches within a cool disk mightemit over a range of temperatures, but the data only require a two-temperatureprofile plus standard comptonization, or three distinct blackbody components. amechanism such as the photon bubble instability may naturally give rise to apatchy disk profile, and could give rise to super-eddington luminosities. it ispossible, then, that a patchy disk (rather than a disk with a standardsingle-temperature profile) might be a hallmark of accretion disks close to orabove the eddington limit. we discuss further tests of this picture, andpotential implications for sources such as narrow-line seyfert-1 galaxies(nlsy1s) and other low-mass active galactic nuclei (agn).

1403.4978	asymmetries in core-collapse supernovae from maps of radioactive  $^{44}$ti in cassiopeiaa	asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapseexplosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. thespatial distribution of radioactive 44ti, synthesized in an exploding star nearthe boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and thatejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries.cassiopeiaa is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44ti emissionhas previously been detected but not imaged. asymmetries in the explosion havebeen indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44ti emission toestimated 56ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like featuresseen in the x-ray and optical ejecta. here we report spatial maps and spectralproperties of the 44ti in cassiopeia a. this may explain the unexpected lack ofcorrelation between the 44ti and iron x-ray emission, the latter being visibleonly in shock-heated material. the observed spatial distribution rules outsymmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well ashighly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor.instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development oflow-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.

1408.1819	implications of the delayed 2013 outburst of the eso 243-49 hlx-1	after showing four outbursts spaced by $\sim 1$ year from 2009 to 2012, thehyper luminous x-ray source eso 243-49 hlx-1, currently the best intermediatemass black hole (imbh) candidate, showed an outburst in 2013 delayed by morethan a month. in lasota et al. (2011), we proposed that the x-ray lightcurve isthe result of enhanced mass transfer episodes at periapsis from a donor starorbiting the imbh in a highly eccentric orbit. in this scenario, the delay canbe explained only if the orbital parameters can change suddenly from orbit toorbit. to investigate this, we ran newtonian smooth particle hydrodynamicalsimulations starting with an incoming donor approaching an imbh on a parabolicorbit. we survey a large parameter space by varying the star-to-bh mass ratio($10^{-5}-10^{-3}$) and the periapsis separation $r_p$ from 2.2 to $2.7~r_t$with $r_t$, the tidal radius. to model the donor, we choose several polytropes($\gamma = 5/2,~n=3/2$; $\gamma=3/2,~n=2$; $\gamma=5/3,~n=2$ &amp; $n=3$).  once the system is formed, the orbital period decreases until reaching aminimum. then, the period tends to increase over several periapsis passages dueto tidal effects and increasing mass transfer, leading ultimately to theejection of the donor. the development of stochastic fluctuations inside thedonor could lead to sudden changes in the orbital period from orbit to orbitwith the appropriate order of magnitude of what has been observed for hlx-1.given the constraints on the bh mass ($m_{\rm bh} &gt; 10^4~m_\odot$) and assumingthat hlx-1 is currently near a minimum in period of $\sim 1$ yr, the donor hasto be a white dwarf or a stripped giant core. we predict that if hlx-1 isindeed emerging from a minimum in orbital period, then the period wouldgenerally increase with each passage, although substantial stochasticfluctuations can be superposed on this trend.

1408.6526	the large observatory for x-ray timing	the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft) was studied within esa m3cosmic vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, loft will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. the science payload is based on a large area detector (lad, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 kev, 240 ev spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a widefield monitor (wfm, 2-50 kev, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 ev spectral resolution). the wfm isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. grb) localization. thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. in this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its phase a study.

1410.3590	an ultraluminous x-ray source powered by an accreting neutron star	ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) are off-nuclear point sources in nearbygalaxies whose x-ray luminosity exceeds the theoretical maximum for sphericalinfall (the eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. their luminosityranges from $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1} &lt; l_x$(0.5 - 10 kev) $&lt;10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$.since higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to theisotropic eddington limit theoretical models have focused on black hole ratherthan neutron star systems. the most challenging sources to explain are those atthe luminous end ($l_x$ &gt; $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which require black holemasses mbh &gt;50 solar masses and/or significant departures from the standardthin disk accretion that powers bright galactic x-ray binaries. here we reportbroadband x-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy m82, whichcontains two bright ulxs. the observations reveal pulsations of average period1.37 s with a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. the pulsations result from therotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from itsbinary orbit. the pulsed flux alone corresponds to $l_x$(3 - 30 kev) = $4.9\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the pulsating source is spatially coincident witha variable ulx which can reach $l_x$ (0.3 - 10 kev) = $1.8 \times 10^{40}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this association implies a luminosity ~100 times the eddington limitfor a 1.4 solar mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any knownaccreting pulsar. this finding implies that neutron stars may not be rare inthe ulx population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion ofmatter onto magnetized compact objects.

1411.1306	on the radio properties of the intermediate-mass black hole candidate  eso 243-49 hlx-1	we present follow-up radio observations of eso 243-49 hlx-1 from 2012 usingthe australia telescope compact array (atca) and the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla). we report the detection of radio emission at the location of hlx-1during its hard x-ray state using the atca. assuming that the `fundamentalplane' of accreting black holes is applicable, we provide an independentestimate of the black hole mass of $m_{\rm{bh}}\leq2.8^{+7.5}_{-2.1} \times10^{6}$ m$_{\odot}$ at 90% confidence. however, we argue that the detectedradio emission is likely to be doppler-boosted and our mass estimate is anupper limit. we discuss other possible origins of the radio emission such asbeing due to a radio nebula, star formation, or later interaction of the flareswith the large-scale environment. none of these were found adequate. the vlaobservations were carried out during the x-ray outburst. however, no new radioflare was detected, possibly due to a sparse time sampling. the deepest,combined vla data suggests a variable radio source and we briefly discuss theproperties of the previously detected flares and compare them with microquasarsand active galactic nuclei.

1411.5974	nustar and xmm-newton observations of the extreme ultraluminous x-ray  source ngc 5907 ulx1: a vanishing act	we present results obtained from two broadband x-ray observations of theextreme ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) ngc5907 ulx1, known to have a peakx-ray luminosity of ~5e40 erg/s. these xmm-newton and nustar observations,separated by only ~4 days, revealed an extreme level of short-term fluxvariability. in the first epoch, ngc5907 ulx1 was undetected by nustar, andonly weakly detected (if at all) with xmm-newton, while in the second ngc5907ulx1 was clearly detected at high luminosity by both missions. this implies anincrease in flux of ~2 orders of magnitude or more during this ~4 day window.we argue that this is likely due to a rapid rise in the mass accretion rate,rather than to a transition from an extremely obscured to an unobscured state.during the second epoch we observed the broadband 0.3-20.0 kev x-ray luminosityto be (1.55+/-0.06)e40 erg/s, similar to the majority of the archival x-rayobservations. the broadband x-ray spectrum obtained from the second epoch isinconsistent with the low/hard accretion state observed in galactic black holebinaries, but is well modeled with a simple accretion disk model incorporatingthe effects of photon advection. this strongly suggests that, when bright,ngc5907 ulx1 is a high-eddington accretor.

astro-ph;0005496	rxte studies of long-term x-ray spectral variations in 4u 1820-30	we present the results of detailed spectral studies of the ultra-compact lowmass x-ray binary (lmxb) 4u 1820-30 carried out with the rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) during 1996-7. 4u 1820-30 is an ``atoll'' source x-ray burster(xrb) located in the globular cluster ngc 6624. it is known to have an 11minute binary period and a ~176 day modulation in its 2--12 kev flux.observations were made with the pca and hexte instruments on rxte at roughlyone-month intervals to sample this long-term period and study flux-relatedspectral changes. there are clear correlations between our fitted spectralparameters and both the broad-band (2--50 kev) flux and the position in thecolor-color diagram, as described by the parameter s_a introduced by mendez etal. (1999). in addition, we find a strong correlation between the position inthe color-color diagram and the frequencies of the kilohertz quasi-periodicoscillations (khz qpos) reported by zhang et al. (1998). this lends furthersupport to the notion that evidence for the last stable orbit in the accretiondisk of 4u 1820-30 has been observed. for a model consisting of comptonizationof cool photons by hot electrons plus an additional blackbody component, wereport an abrupt change in the spectral parameters at the same accretion rateat which the khz qpos disappear. for a model consisting of a multicolor diskblackbody plus a cut-off power law, we find that the inner disk radius reachesa minimum at the same accretion rate at which the khz qpo frequency saturates,as expected if the disk reaches the last stable orbit. both models facetheoretical and observational problems when interpreted physically for thissystem.

astro-ph;0005497	rxte studies of x-ray spectral variations with accretion rate in 4u  1915-05	we present the results of detailed spectral studies of the ultra-compact lowmass x-ray binary (lmxb) 4u 1915-05 carried out with the rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) during 1996. 4u 1915-05 is an x-ray burster (xrb) known toexhibit a ~199-day modulation in its 2--12 kev flux. observations wereperformed with the pca and hexte instruments on rxte at roughly one-monthintervals to sample this long-term period and study accretion rate-relatedspectral changes. we obtain good fits with a model consisting of a blackbodyand an exponentially cut-off power law. the spectral parameters are stronglycorrelated with both the broad-band (2--50 kev) luminosity and the position inthe color-color diagram, with the source moving from a low hard state to a highsoft state as the accretion rate increases. the blackbody component appears todrive the spectral evolution. our results are consistent with a geometry inwhich the soft component arises from an optically thick boundary layer and thehard component from an extended comptonizing corona. comparing our results withthose of a similar study of the brighter source 4u 1820-30 (bloser et al.2000), we find that the two ultra-compact lmxbs occupy similar spectral stateseven though the transitions occur at very different total luminosities.

astro-ph;0111134	the x-ray spectra of black hole x-ray novae in quiescence as measured by  chandra	we present chandra observations of black hole x-ray novae v404 cyg, a0620-00,gro j1655-40 and xte j1550-564 in quiescence. their quiescent spectra can bewell fitted by a power-law model with slope $\alpha \sim 2$. while a coronal(raymond-smith) model is also a statistically acceptable representation of thespectra, the best fit temperatures of these models is $\sim 5$ times higherthan that seen in active stellar coronae. these four spectra of quiescent x-raynovae are all consistent with that expected for accretion via anadvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) and inconsistent with that expectedfrom a stellar corona. this evidence for continued accretion in quiescencefurther strengthens the case for the existence of event horizons in blackholes. both a0620-00 and gro j1655-40 were fainter than in previousobservations, while v404 cyg was more luminous and varied by a factor of 2 in afew ksec. a reanalysis of the x-ray data for xte j1550-564 shows that (likev404 cyg and a0620-00) its luminosity exceeds the maximum prediction of thecoronal model by a large factor. the 0.3-7 kev luminosity of the four sourcesstudied ranges from $\sim 10^{30}-10^{33}$ erg/s.

astro-ph;0209467	correlated timing and spectral behavior of 4u 1705-44	we follow the timing properties of the neutron star low-mass x-ray binarysystem 4u 1705-44 in different spectral states, as monitored by the rossi x-raytiming explorer over about a month. we fit the power density spectra usingmultiple lorentzians. we show that the characteristic frequencies of theselorentzians, when properly identified, fit within the correlations previouslyreported. the time evolution of these frequencies and their relation with theparameters of the energy spectra reported in barret &amp; olive (2002) are used toconstrain the accretion geometry changes. the spectral data were fitted by thesum of a blackbody and a comptonized component and were interpreted in theframework of a truncated accretion disk geometry, with a varying truncationradius. if one assumes that the characteristic frequencies of the lorentziansare some measure of this truncation radius, as in most theoretical models, thenthe timing data presented here strengthen the above interpretation. the soft tohard and hard to soft transitions are clearly associated with the disk recedingfrom and approaching the neutron star respectively. during the transitions,correlations are found between the lorentzian frequencies and the flux andtemperature of the blackbody, which is thus likely to be coming from the disk.on the other hand, in the hard state, the characteristic lorentziansfrequencies which are at the lowest, remained nearly constant despitesignificant evolution of the spectra parameters. the disk no longer contributesto the x-ray emission, and the blackbody is now likely to be emitted by theneutron star surface which is providing the seed photons for thecomptonization.

astro-ph;0209587	xmm-newton observations of two black hole x-ray transients in quiescence	we report on xmm-newton observations of gro j1655-40 and grs 1009-45, whichare two black hole x-ray transients currently in their quiescent phase. groj1655-40 was detected with a 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity of 5.9 10^{31} erg/s. thisluminosity is comparable to a previous chandra measurement, but ten times lowerthan the 1996 asca value, most likely obtained when the source was not yet in atrue quiescent state. unfortunately, xmm-newton failed to detect grs 1009-45. astringent upper limit of 8.9 10^{30} erg/s was derived by combining data fromthe epic-mos and pn cameras.  the x-ray spectrum of gro j1655-40 is very hard as it can be fitted with apower law model of photon index ~ 1.3 +/- 0.4. similarly hard spectra have beenobserved from other systems; these rule out coronal emission from the secondaryor disk flares as the origin of the observed x-rays. on the other hand, ourobservations are consistent with the predictions of the disc instability modelin the case that the accretion flow forms an advection dominated accretion flow(adaf) at distances less than a fraction ~ 0.1 - 0.3) of the circularizationradius. this distance corresponds to the greatest extent of the adaf that isthought to be possible.

astro-ph;0402294	discovery of x-ray absorption features from the dipping low-mass x-ray  binary xb 1916-053 with xmm-newton	we report the discovery of narrow fe xxv and fe xxvi k alpha x-ray absorptionlines at 6.65 and 6.95 kev in the persistent emission of the dipping low-massx-ray binary (lmxb) xb 1916-053 during an xmm-newton observation performed inseptember 2002. in addition, there is marginal evidence for absorption featuresat 1.48 kev, 2.67 kev, 7.82 kev and 8.29 kev consistent with mg xii, s xvi, nixxvii k alpha and fe xxvi k beta transitions, respectively. such absorptionlines from highly ionized ions are now observed in a number of high inclination(ie. close to edge-on) lmxbs, such as xb 1916-053, where the inclination isestimated to be between 60-80 degrees. this, together with the lack of anyorbital phase dependence of the features (except during dips), suggests thatthe highly ionized plasma responsible for the absorption lines is located in acylindrical geometry around the compact object. using the ratio of fe xxv andfe xxvi column densities, we estimate the photo-ionization parameter of theabsorbing material to be 10^{3.92} erg cm s^{-1}. only the fe xxv line isobserved during dipping intervals and the upper-limits to the fe xxvi columndensity are consistent with a decrease in the amount of ionization duringdipping intervals. this implies the presence of cooler material in the line ofsight during dipping. we also report the discovery of a 0.98 kev absorptionedge in the persistent emission spectrum. the edge energy decreases to 0.87 kevduring deep dipping intervals. the detected feature may result from edges ofmoderately ionized ne and/or fe with the average ionization level decreasingfrom persistent emission to deep dipping. this is again consistent with thepresence of cooler material in the line of sight during dipping.

astro-ph;9610110	evidence from quasi-periodic oscillations for a millisecond pulsar in  the low mass x-ray binary 4u 0614+091	we have detected quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) near 1 khz from the lowmass x-ray binary 4u 0614+091 in observations with xte. the observations spanseveral months and sample the source over a large range of x-ray luminosity. inevery interval qpos are present above 400 hz with fractional rms amplitudesfrom 3 to 12%. at high count rates, two high frequency qpos are detectedsimultaneously. the difference of their frequency centroids is consistent with323 hz in all observations. during one interval a third signal is detected at328 +/- 2 hz. this suggests the system has a stable `clock' which is mostlikely the neutron star with spin period 3.1 msec. thus, our observations andthose of another neutron star system by strohmayer et al. (1996) provide thefirst evidence for millisecond pulsars within low-mass x-ray binary systems andreveal the `missing-link' between millisecond radiopulsars and the late stagesof binary evolution in low mass x-ray binaries (alpar et al. 1982). we suggestthat the kinematics of the magnetospheric beat-frequency model (alpar andshaham 1985) applies to these qpos. in this interpretation the high frequencysignal is associated with the keplerian frequency of the inner accretion diskand the lower frequency `beat' signal arises from the differential rotationfrequency of the inner disk and the spinning neutron star. assuming the highfrequency qpo is a keplerian orbital frequency for the accretion disk, we finda maximum mass of 1.9 solar masses and a maximum radius of 17 km for theneutron star.

astro-ph;9712271	determination of the hot intracluster gas temperature from submillimeter  measurements	measurements of the sunyaev-zeldovich (hereafter sz) distorsion of the cosmicmicrowave background can give interesting physical informations on clusters ofgalaxies, provided that the electronic temperature of the gas is known.previous attempts to do so have used the electronic temperature determinationobtained from the x-ray spectra. however, if the intergalactic gas is nothomogeneous, the x-ray emission will trace the denser component, and thetemperature determination may not be relevant for the lower density gas whichis dominating the sz measurements. moreover, the x-ray brightness decreasesvery rapidly with the distance, which is not the case for the sz effect.distant clusters might be detected from sz measurements, whereas they areinaccessible to x-ray observations. for these reasons, we have investigated thepossibility to derive the electronic temperature of the gas from the szmeasurements in the submillimeter range (lambda ~ 300-600 micro-m). we showthat given the sensitivities of the future submillimeter space missions plancksurveyor and first, the electronic temperature of massive clusters(y_center=3*10^{-4}) can be determined with an accuracy ranging from 1 to 4 kevdepending on its distance and the data avalaible.

astro-ph;9802053	rxte observation of the x-ray burster 1e1724-3045. i : timing study of  the persistent x-ray emission with the pca	we report on the rxte/pca observation of the x-ray burster 1e1724-3045located in the globular cluster terzan 2. the persistent x-ray emission shows ahigh level of noise variability, the so-called high frequency noise (hfn) witha fractional root mean squared (rms) of about 25% in the 2e-3 - 40 hz range.the strong hfn together with the hardness of its x-ray spectrum suggest that1e1724-3045 is an ``atoll'' source which was in its ``island'' state during theobservation. the fourier power density spectra (pds) can be modeled in terms ofthe sum of two ``shot noise'' components for which the shots have a single-sideexponential shape. the characteristic shot decay timescales inferred from thebest fitting of the pds are ~680 and 16 msec respectively. the two componentscontribute similarly to the total rms (about 15%). the pds contains also athird component: a broad and asymmetric peaked noise feature centered at 0.8hz. this quasi periodic oscillation-like (qpo) feature contributes at the levelof ~ 10% to the total rms. the integrated rms of all three components shows apositive correlation with energy up to at least 40 kev. we also show that1e1724-3045 has striking timing similarities with the black hole candidate groj0422+32 (nova persei 1992). our observation demonstrates that a low frequencyqpo simultaneously with a high level of rms is not a timing signature unique toblack holes. this extends the growing list of similarities between atollsources and black hole systems.

astro-ph;9810463	an asca x-ray observation of 1e1724-3045 in the globular cluster terzan  2	the bright persistent x-ray source and type i x-ray burster 1e1724-3045located in the globular cluster terzan 2 was observed by asca for about 10 ksecon september 24-25th, 1995 while it was in its hard state, with a luminosity of\~6x10^36 erg/s in the 0.5-10 kev band (d=7.7 kpc). the asca spectrum is hard,and reveals the presence of a soft component below 2-3 kev. when combined withnon simultaneous rxte/hexte data, we show that the asca spectrum can beadequately fitted by a comptonization model for which the electron temperatureis ~30 kev, the optical depth is ~3 for a spherical scattering cloud. the softcomponent carries off about 13%, and 35% of the 0.1-200 kev luminosity for ablackbody and disk blackbody fit respectively. it is more likely to arise fromthe accretion disk, whereas the hard comptonized component is generated in ahot boundary layer interior to the disk. the column density measured towardsthe source (nh=10^22 cm^-2) is consistent with the value expected from theoptical reddening of the cluster. no emission lines were detected, and an upperlimit of 30 ev for the equivalent width of a 6.4 kev line (sigma=0.1 kev) hasbeen derived.

astro-ph;9811236	discovery of high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in 4u1915-05	the type i x-ray burster and dipper 4u1915-05 (also known as xb1916-053) wasmonitored by the rossi x-ray timing explorer between february and october,1996. the source was observed in various spectral states; the highestluminosity state (lx ~ 1.5 10^37 ergs/s, 10 kpc, 1-20 kev) is associated with asoft spectrum, whereas for the lower luminosity state (down to ~5 10^36 ergs/s)the spectrum is significantly harder. using the high time resolution dataprovided by the proportional counter array (pca), we have discoveredhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (hfqpos) in the persistent x-rayemission of 4u1915-05 while its luminosity was ~8 10^36 ergs/s. the qpofrequency ranges from 600 hz up to ~1000 hz, with typical full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) ~50-100 hz and root mean squared (rms) values 15%. in addition,by using the ``shift and add'' technique, we have detected a twin hfqpo (5.5sigma level) separated from the main peak by ~355 hz. 4u1915-05 is the eighthatoll source displaying simultaneous twin hfqpos. based on current knowledge ofhfqpo sources, our observations suggest that 4u1915-05 might contain a 2.8 (or5.6) millisecond rotating neutron star.

astro-ph;9811436	rxte broad band x-ray spectrum of the burster 1e1724-3045	the x-ray burster 1e1724-3045 located in the globular cluster terzan 2 isknown as one of the persistent (though variable) hard x-ray sources as shown bythe sigma observations of the galactic center region. 1e1724-3045 was observedwith the pca and hexte experiments onboard the rxte on november 1996 for about100 ksec. the broad band spectral capability and sensitivity of rxte enables usto study simultaneously the x-ray (2-20 kev) and hard x-ray components (e&gt;20kev) of this source. during the observation, this ``atoll'' source was in its``island'' state characterized by a hard comptomized spectrum with an electrontemperature kte~29 kev, an optical depth of 2.9 (spherical geometry) and atemperature for the ``seed'' photons of 1.2 kev. below 5 kev, there is a softexcess which we fit with a blackbody of ktbb=0.7 kev. the comptonizationtemperature is significantly lower those observed for black holes candidates intheir low luminosity states (kte &gt;~ 50 kev). finally, our observation allows usto associate the presence of an hard tail with a low luminosity x-ray state(1-20 kev luminosity of 10^37 erg/s at 7.7 kpc).

astro-ph;9911042	hard x-ray emission from low mass x-ray binaries	we report on rossi x-ray timing explorer observations of four type i x-raybursters; namely 1e1724-3045, gs1826-238, slx1735-269 and ks1731-260. the firstthree were in a low state (ls) whereas ks1731-260 was in a high state. the lssources have very similar power spectra, displaying high frequency noise up to\~200 hz. for ks1731-260, its power spectrum is dominated by noise atfrequencies below 20 hz. in addition a quasi-periodic oscillation at 1200 hz isdetected. the 1-200 kev ls spectra are all consistent with resulting fromthermal comptonization with an electron temperature (kte) around 25-30 kev. forks1731-260, the spectrum is also dominated by comptonization, but with ktearound 3 kev and no significant hard x-ray emission. with the exception ofgs1826-238, there is an underlying soft component. for all sources, we havedetected an iron line at 6.4 kev. a reflection component is present in thespectra of gs1826-238 and slx1735-269. we suggest a model in which the regionof main energy release, where hard x-rays are produced would be an opticallythin boundary layer merged with an advection dominated accretion flow (adaf).the soft component observed probably represents the unscattered emission fromthe accretion disk of variable inner radius. when the accretion rate increases,the inner disk radius shrinks, the strength of the reflected component andassociated iron line increase, and the comptonization region cools off inresponse to an increased cooling flux from the accretion disk and from thereprocessed/reflected component. finally, in the light of these observations,we discuss extensively the various criteria recently proposed to distinguishbetween non-quiescent accreting black holes and neutron stars.
