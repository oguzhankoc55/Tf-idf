1001.3415	a first direct measurement of the intergalactic medium temperature  around a quasar at z=6	the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (igm) provides an indirectprobe of both the hi and heii reionisation epochs. current constraints on theigm temperature from the lya forest are restricted to the redshift range2&lt;z&lt;4.5, limiting the ability to probe the thermal memory of hi reionisationtoward higher redshift. in this work, we present the first direct measurementof the igm temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the doppler widths oflya absorption lines in the proximity zone of sdss j0818+1722. we use a highresolution (r= 40000) keck/hires spectrum in combination with detailednumerical modelling to obtain the temperature at mean density,t_0=23600\pm^5000_6900k (\pm^9200_9300k) at 68 (95) per cent confidenceassuming a prior probability 13500k&lt;t_0&lt;38500 k following hi and heiireionisation. this enables us to place an upper limit on the redshift of hireionisation, z_h, within 33 comoving mpc of sdss j0818+1722. if the quasarreionises the heii in its vicinity, then in the limit of instantaneousreionisation we infer z_h&lt;9.0 (11.0) at 68 (95) per cent confidence assumingphotoheating is the dominant heat source and that hi reionisation is driven byionising sources with soft spectra, typical of population ii stars. if the hiand heii in the igm around sdss j0818+1722 are instead reionised simultaneouslyby a population of massive metal-free stars, characterised by very hardionising spectra, we obtain a tighter upper limit of z_h&lt;8.4 (9.4). initiatingreionisation at higher redshifts produces temperatures which are too low withrespect to our constraint unless the hi ionising sources or the quasar itselfhave spectra significantly harder than typically assumed.

1006.4119	keck esi observations of metal-poor damped lyman-{\alpha} systems	we present the first results from a survey of sdss quasars selected forstrong h i damped lyman-{\alpha} (dla) absorption with corresponding lowequivalent width absorption from strong low-ion transitions (e.g. c ii{\lambda}1334 and si ii {\lambda}1260). these metal-poor dla candidates wereselected from the sdss dr5 quasar spectroscopic database, and comprise a largenew sample for probing low metallicity galaxies. medium-resolution echellettespectra from the keck esi spectrograph for an initial sample of 35 systems wereobtained to explore the metal-poor tail of the dla distribution and toinvestigate the nucleosynthetic patterns at these metallicities. we haveestimated saturation corrections for the moderately under-resolved spectra, andsystems with very narrow doppler parameter (b \le 5 km s-1) will likely haveunderestimated abundances. for those systems with doppler parameters b &gt; 5 kms-1, we have measured low metallicity dla gas with [x/h] &lt; -2.4 for at leastone of c, o, si, or fe. assuming non-saturated components, we estimate thatseveral dla systems have [x/h] &lt; -2.8, including five dla systems with both lowequivalent widths and low metallicity in transitions of both c ii and o i. allof the measured dla metallicities, however, exceed or are consistent with ametallicity of at least 1/1000 of solar, regardless of the effects ofsaturation in our spectra. our results indicate that the metal-poor tail ofgalaxies at z \sim 3 drops exponentially at [x/h]&lt; -3. the observed ratio of[c/o] for values of [o/h] &lt; -2.5 exceeds values seen in moderate metallicitydla systems, and also exceeds theoretical nucleosynthesis predictions forhigher mass population iii stars.

1008.2622	detection of extended he ii reionization in the temperature evolution of  the intergalactic medium	we present new measurements of the temperature of the intergalactic medium(igm) derived from the lyman-alpha forest over 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.8. the small-scalestructure in the forest of 61 high-resolution qso spectra is quantified using anew statistic, the curvature, and the conversion to temperature calibratedusing a suite of hydrodynamic simulations. at each redshift we focus onobtaining the temperature at an optimal overdensity probed by the lyman-alphaforest, t(delta), where the temperature is nearly a one-to-one function of thecurvature regardless of the slope of the temperature-density relation. themedian 2-sigma statistical uncertainty in these measurements is 8 per cent,though there may be comparable systematic errors due to the unknown amount ofjeans smoothing in the igm. we use our t(delta) results to infer thetemperature at the mean density, t0. even for a maximally steeptemperature-density relation, t0 must increase from ~8000 k at z ~ 4.4 to&gt;~12000 k at z ~ 2.8. this increase is not consistent with the monotonicdecline in t0 expected in the absence of he ii reionization. we thereforeinterpret the observed rise in temperature as evidence of he ii reionizationbeginning at z &gt;~ 4.4. the evolution of t0 is consistent with an end to he iireionization at z ~ 3, as suggested by opacity measurements of the he iilyman-alpha forest, although the redshift at which t0 peaks will dependsomewhat on the evolution of the temperature-density relation. these newtemperature measurements suggest that the heat input due to the reionization ofhe ii dominates the thermal balance of the igm over an extended period withdelta_z &gt;~ 1.

1101.4399	high-redshift metals. ii. probing reionization galaxies with  low-ionization absorption lines at redshift six	we present a survey for low-ionization metal absorption line systems towards17 qsos at redshifts z_em=5.8-6.4. nine of our objects were observed at highresolution with either keck/hires or magellan/mike, and the remainder atmoderate resolution with keck/esi. the survey spans 5.3 &lt; z_abs &lt; 6.4 and has apathlength interval \delta x=39.5, or \delta z=8.0. in total we detect tensystems, five of which are new discoveries. the line-of-sight number density isconsistent with the combined number density at z~3 of dlas and sub-dlas, whichcomprise the main population of low-ionization systems at lower redshifts. thisapparent lack of evolution may occur because low ionization systems are hostedby lower-mass halos at higher redshifts, or because the mean cross section oflow-ionization gas at a given halo mass increases with redshift due to thehigher densities and lower ionizing background. the roughly constant numberdensity notably contrasts with the sharp decline at z &gt; 5.3 in the numberdensity of highly-ionized systems traced by c iv. the low-ionization systems atz~6 span a similar range of velocity widths as lower-redshift sub-dlas but havesignificantly weaker lines at a given width. this implies that themass-metallicity relation of the host galaxies evolves towards lowermetallicities at higher redshifts. these systems lack strong si iv and c iv,which are common among lower-redshift dlas and sub-dlas. this is consistent,however, with a similar decrease in the metallicity of the low- andhigh-ionization phases, and does not necessarily indicate a lack of nearby,highly-ionized gas. the high number density of low-ionization systems at z~6suggests that we may be detecting galaxies below the current limits ofi-dropout and ly-alpha emission galaxy surveys. these systems may therefore bethe first direct probes of the `typical' galaxies responsible for hydrogenreionization.

1105.4876	filamentary infall of cold gas and escape of lyman alpha and hydrogen  ionizing radiation from an interacting high-redshift galaxy	we present observations of a peculiar lyman alpha-emitting galaxy at redshift3.344, discovered in a deep, blind spectroscopic survey for faint lyman alphaemitters with the magellan ii telescope in the hubble ultra deep field (hudf).the galaxy exhibits complex lyman alpha emission, including an extended,asymmetric component that is partially suppressed by damped lyman alphaabsorption, and two spatially elongated, narrow emission features. archival hstacs imaging shows evidence for tidal disruption of the stellar component. thisv=27 galaxy appears to give us unprecedented insights into two fundamentalstages in the formation of structure at high redshift: the inflow of gas intoordinary galaxies, and the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalacticmedium. neutral hydrogen, falling in partly in form of a narrow filament,appears to emit fluorescent lyman alpha photons induced by the stellar ionizingflux escaping from the disturbed galaxy. the in-falling material may representprimary cold accretion or an interaction-triggered inflow. the rate of ionizingphotons required by the observed lyman alpha emission is consistent with therate of photons produced by the observed stellar population, with roughly 50percent of ionizing photons escaping from the immediate galaxy and encounteringthe in-falling gas. the observational properties of the galaxy lend support toa picture where galaxy interactions facilitate the escape of both lyman alphaand ionizing radiation. we argue that galaxies like the present object may becommon at high redshift. this galaxy may therefore be a late example of aninteracting population of dwarf galaxies contributing significantly to thereionization of the universe.

1110.0539	improved measurements of the intergalactic medium temperature around  quasars: possible evidence for the initial stages of he-ii reionisation at  z~6	we present measurements of the intergalactic medium (igm) temperature within~5 proper mpc of seven luminous quasars at z~6. the constraints are obtainedfrom the doppler widths of lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasarnear-zones and build upon our previous measurement for the z=6.02 quasar sdssj0818+1722. the expanded data set, combined with an improved treatment ofsystematic uncertainties, yields an average temperature at the mean density oflog (t_0/k) = 4.21 \pm 0.03 (\pm^0.06_0.07) at 68 (95) per cent confidence fora flat prior distribution over 3.2 &lt; log (t_0/k) &lt; 4.8. in comparison,temperatures measured from the general igm at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implyingan additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet presentin the general igm at slightly lower redshift. this heating is most likely dueto the recent reionisation of he-ii in vicinity of these quasars, which havehard, non-thermal ionising spectra. the elevated temperatures may thereforerepresent evidence for the earliest stages of he-ii reionisation in the mostbiased regions of the high-redshift universe. the temperature as a function ofdistance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(t_0/k)~4.2,with no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect. however, thelimited extent of the quasar near-zones prevents the detection of he-iiiregions larger than ~5 proper mpc. under the assumption the quasars havereionised the he-ii in their vicinity, we infer the data are consistent with anaverage optically bright phase of duration in excess of 10^6.5 yr. thesemeasurements represent the highest-redshift igm temperature constraints todate, and thus provide a valuable data set for confronting models of h-ireionisation.

1111.4843	iron and alpha-element production in the first one billion years after  the big bang	we present measurements of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in quasarabsorption systems existing when the universe was roughly one billion yearsold. we measure column densities in nine low-ionization systems at 4.7 &lt; z &lt;6.3 using keck, magellan, and vlt optical and near-infrared spectra withmoderate to high resolution. the column density ratios among c ii, o i, si ii,and fe ii are nearly identical to sub-dlas and metal-poor ([m/h] &lt; -1) dlas atlower redshifts, with no significant evolution over 2 &lt; z &lt; 6. the estimatedintrinsic scatter in the ratio of any two elements is also small, with atypical r.m.s. deviation of &lt;0.1 dex. these facts suggest that dust depletionand ionization effects are minimal in our z &gt; 4.7 systems, as in thelower-redshift dlas, and that the column density ratios are close to theintrinsic relative element abundances. the abundances in our z &gt; 4.7 systemsare therefore likely to represent the typical integrated yields from stellarpopulations within the first gigayear of cosmic history. due to the time limitimposed by the age of the universe at these redshifts, our measurements thusplace direct constraints on the metal production of massive stars, includingiron yields of prompt supernovae. the lack of redshift evolution furthersuggests that the metal inventories of most metal-poor absorption systems at z&gt; 2 are also dominated by massive stars, with minimal contributions fromdelayed type ia supernovae or agb winds. the relative abundances in our systemsbroadly agree with those in very metal-poor, non-carbon-enhanced galactic halostars. this is consistent with the picture in which present-day metal-poorstars were potentially formed as early as one billion years after the big bang.

1206.2680	extended and filamentary lyman alpha emission from the formation of a  protogalactic halo at z=2.63	we report the observation of a further asymmetric, extended lyman alphaemitting halo at z=2.63, from our ultra-deep, long-slit spectroscopic survey offaint high redshift emitters, undertaken with magellan ldss3 in the goods-sfield. the lya emission, detected over more than 30 kpc, is spatiallycoincident with a concentration of galaxies visible in deep broad-band imaging.while these faint galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts cannot withcertainty be associated with one another or with the lya emission, there are anumber of compelling reasons why they very probably form a milky way halo-massgroup at the lya redshift. a filamentary structure, possibly consisting of lyaemission at very high equivalent width, and evidence for disturbed stellarpopulations, suggest that the properties of the emitting region reflect ongoinggalaxy assembly, with recent galaxy mergers and star formation occurring in thegroup. hence, the lya provides unique insights into what is probably a key modeof galaxy formation at high redshifts. the lya emission may be powered bycooling radiation or spatially extended star formation in the halo, but isunlikely to be fluorescence driven by either an agn or one of the galaxies. thespatial profile of the emission is conspicuously different from that of typicallya emitters or lyman break galaxies, which is consistent with the picture thatextended emission of this kind represents a different stage in the galaxyformation process. faint, extended lya emitters such as these may be lower-massanalogues of the brighter lya blobs. our observations provide further,circumstantial evidence that galaxy mergers may promote the production and / orescape of ionizing radiation, and that the halos of interacting galaxies may besignificant sources for ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization.

1410.3784	properties of qso metal line absorption systems at high redshifts:  nature and evolution of the absorbers and new evidence on escape of ionizing  radiation from galaxies	using voigt-profile-fitting procedures on keck hires spectra of nine qsos weidentify 1099 civ absorber components clumped in 201 systems outside the lymanforest over 1.6 &lt; z &lt; 4.4. with associated siiv, cii, siii and nv whereavailable we investigate bulk statistical and ionization properties of thecomponents and systems and find no significant change in redshift for civ andsiiv while cii, siii and nv change substantially. the civ components exhibitstrong clustering but no clustering is detected for systems on scales from 150km/s out to 50000 km/s. we conclude the clustering is due entirely to thepeculiar velocities of gas present in the circumgalactic media of galaxies.using specific combinations of ionic ratios we compare our observations withmodel ionization predictions for absorbers exposed to the metagalactic ionizingradiation background augmented by proximity radiation from their associatedgalaxies and find the generally accepted means of radiative escape bytransparent channels from the internal star-forming sites is spectrally notviable for our stronger absorbers. we develop an active scenario based onrunaway stars with resulting changes in the efflux of radiation that naturallyenable the needed spectral convergence and in turn provide empirical indicatorsof morphological evolution in the associated galaxies. together with acoexisting population of relatively compact galaxies indicated by the weakerabsorbers in our sample the collective escape of radiation is sufficient tomaintain the igm ionized over the full range 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 4.4.

astro-ph;0004047	evidence for a black hole and accretion disk in the liner ngc 4203	we present spectroscopic observations from the hubble space telescope thatreveal for the first time the presence of a broad pedestal of balmer-lineemission in the liner galaxy ngc 4203. the emission-line profile is suggestiveof a relativistic accretion disk, and is reminiscent of double-peaked transientbalmer emission observed in a handful of other liners. the very broad lineemission thus constitutes clear qualitative evidence for a black hole, andspatially resolved narrow-line emission in ngc 4203 can be used to constrainits mass, with m_bh less than 6 x 10^6 solar masses at 99.7% confidence. thisvalue implies a ratio of black-hole mass to bulge mass of less thanapproximately 7 x 10^-4 in ngc 4203, which is less by a factor of ~3 - 9 thanthe mean ratio obtained for other galaxies. the availability of an independentconstraint on central black-hole mass makes ngc4203 an important testbed forprobing the physics of weak active galactic nuclei. assuming m_bh near thedetection limit, the ratio of observed luminosity to the eddington luminosityis approximately 10^-4. this value is consistent with advection-dominatedaccretion, and hence with scenarios in which an ion torus irradiates an outeraccretion disk that produces the observed double-peaked line emission.follow-up observations will make it possible to improve the black-hole massestimate and study variability in the nuclear emission.

astro-ph;0004401	double-peaked broad emission lines in ngc 4450 and other liners	spectra taken with hst reveal that ngc 4450 emits balmer emission lines withdisplaced double peaks and extremely high-velocity wings. this characteristicline profile, previously seen in a few nearby liners and in a small fraction ofbroad-line radio galaxies, can be interpreted as a kinematic signature of arelativistic accretion disk. we can reproduce the observed profile with a modelfor a disk with a radial range of 1000-2000 gravitational radii and inclined by27 degrees along the line of sight. the small-aperture hst data also allow usto detect, for the first time, the featureless continuum at optical wavelengthsin ngc 4450; the nonstellar nucleus is intrinsically very faint, with m_b =-11.2 mag for d = 16.8 mpc. we have examined the multiwavelength properties ofngc 4450 collectively with those of other low-luminosity active nuclei whichpossess double-peaked broad lines and find a number of common features. theseobjects are all classified spectroscopically as "type 1" liners or closelyrelated objects. the nuclear luminosities are low, both in absolute terms andrelative to the eddington rates. all of them have compact radio cores, whosestrength relative to the optical nuclear emission places them in the league ofradio-loud active nuclei. the broad-band spectral energy distributions of thesesources are most notable for their deficit of ultraviolet emission compared tothose observed in luminous seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars. the double-peakedbroad-line radio galaxies arp 102b and pictor a have very similar attributes.we discuss how these characteristics can be understood in the context ofadvection-dominated accretion onto massive black holes.

0808.0914	hubble space telescope spectroscopic observations of the narrow-line  region in nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we present stis observations of 14 nearby low-luminosity activegalactic nuclei, including 13 liners and 1 seyfert, taken at multiple parallelslit positions centered on the galaxy nuclei and covering the h-alpha spectralregion. for each galaxy, we measure the emission-line velocities, line widths,and strengths, to map out the inner narrow-line region structure. there is awide diversity among the velocity fields: in a few galaxies the gas is clearlyin disk-like rotation, while in other galaxies the gas kinematics appearchaotic or are dominated by radial flows with multiple velocity components. the[s ii] line ratio indicates a radial stratification in gas density, with asharp increase within the inner 10-20 pc, in the majority of the type 1objects. we examine how the [n ii] 6583 line width varies as a function ofaperture size over a range of spatial scales, extending from scales comparableto the black hole's sphere of influence to scales dominated by the hostgalaxy's bulge. for most galaxies in the sample, we find that the emission-linevelocity dispersion is largest within the black hole's gravitational sphere ofinfluence, and decreases with increasing aperture size toward values similar tothe bulge stellar velocity dispersion measured within ground-based apertures.future dynamical modeling in order to determine black hole masses for a fewobjects in this sample may be worthwhile, although disorganized motion willlimit the accuracy of the mass measurements.

astro-ph;0005553	a measurement of the temperature-density relation in the intergalactic  medium using a new lyman-alpha absorption line fitting method	the evolution of the temperature in the intergalactic medium is related tothe reionization of hydrogen and helium, and has important consequences for ourunderstanding of the lya forest and of galaxy formation in gravitational modelsof large-scale structure. we measure the temperature-density relation ofintergalactic gas from lya forest observations of eight quasar spectra withhigh resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, using a new line fitting techniqueto obtain a lower cutoff of the distribution of line widths from which thetemperature is derived. we carefully test the accuracy of this technique torecover the gas temperature with a hydrodynamic simulation. the temperature atredshift z=(3.9, 3.0, 2.4) is best determined at densities slightly above themean: t_star=(20200\pm2700, 20200\pm1300, 22600\pm1900)k (statistical errorbars) for gas density (in units of the mean density) delta_star=(1.42\pm0.08,1.37\pm0.11, 1.66\pm0.11). the power-law index of the temperature-densityrelation, defined by t=t_star(delta/delta_star)^{gamma-1}, is gamma-1=(0.43\pm0.45, 0.29\pm0.30, 0.52\pm0.14) for the same three redshifts. thetemperature at the fixed over-density delta=1.4 is t_1.4=(20100\pm2800,20300\pm1400, 20700\pm1900)k. these temperatures are higher than expected forphotoionized gas in ionization equilibrium with a cosmic background, and can beexplained by a gradual additional heating due to on-going heii reionization.the measurement of the temperature reduces one source of uncertainty in thelower limit to the baryon density implied by the observed mean flux decrement.we find that the temperature cannot be reliably measured for under-dense gas,because the velocities due to expansion always dominate the widths of thecorresponding weak lines.

astro-ph;0008011	the detection of oxygen in the low-density intergalactic medium	the abundances of metals in the intergalactic medium (igm) can be used toconstrain the amount of star formation at high redshift and the spectral shapeof the ionizing background radiation. for both purposes it is essential tomeasure the abundances in regions of low density, away from local sources ofmetals and ionizing photons. here we report the first detection of ovi in thelow-density igm at high redshift. we perform a pixel-by-pixel search for oviabsorption in eight high quality quasar spectra spanning the redshift range z =2.0-4.5. at 2 ~&lt; z ~&lt; 3, we clearly detect ovi in the form of a positivecorrelation between the hi ly-alpha optical depth and the optical depth in thecorresponding ovi pixel, down to an hi optical depth of 0.1. this is an orderof magnitude lower in hi optical depth than the best civ measurements can probeand constitutes the first clear detection of metals in underdense gas. thenon-detection of ovi at z &gt; 3 is consistent with the enhanced photoionizationfrom a hardening of the uv background below z ~ 3 but could also be caused bythe high level of contamination from ly series lines.

astro-ph;0010240	supermassive black holes in bulges	we present spatially extended gas kinematics at parsec-scale resolution forthe nuclear regions of four nearby disk galaxies, and model them as rotation ofa gas disk in the joint potential of the stellar bulge and a putative centralblack hole. the targets were selected from a larger set of long-slit spectraobtained with the hubble space telescope as part of the survey of nearby nucleiwith stis (sunns). they represents the 4 galaxies (of 24) that displaysymmetric gas velocity curves consistent with a rotating disk. we derive thestellar mass distribution from the stis acquisition images adopting the stellarmass-to-light ratio normalized so as to match ground-based velocity dispersionmeasurements over a large aperture. subsequently, we constrain the mass of aputative black hole by matching the gas rotation curve, following two distinctapproaches. in the most general case we explore all the possible diskorientations, alternatively we constrain the gas disk orientation from thedust-lane morphology at similar radii. in the latter case the kinematic dataindicate the presence of a central black hole for three of the four objects,with masses of 10^7 - 10^8 solar masses, representing up to 0.025 % of the hostbulge mass. for one object (ngc2787) the kinematic data alone provide clearevidence for the presence of a central black hole even without externalconstraints on the disk orientation. these results illustrate directly the needto determine black-hole masses by differing methods for a large number ofobjects, demonstrate that the variance in black hole/bulge mass is much largerthan previously claimed, and reinforce the recent finding that the black-holemass is tightly correlated with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;0102504	detection of nuclear x-ray sources in nearby galaxies with chandra	we report preliminary results from an arcsecond-resolution x-ray survey ofnearby galaxies using acis on board chandra. the total sample consists of 41low-luminosity agns, including seyferts, liners, and liner/h ii transitionobjects. in the initial subsample of 24 objects observed thus far, we detect in62% of the objects a compact, pointlike source astrometrically coincident witheither the optical or radio position of the nucleus. the high detection ratestrongly suggests that the majority of the objects do contain weakly active,agn-like cores, presumably powered by central massive black holes. the 2-10 kevluminosities of the nuclear sources range from 10^38 to 10^41 erg/s, with amedian value of 2x10^38 erg/s. our detection limit corresponds to 8x10^37 erg/sfor the typical sample distance of 12 mpc; this limit is two orders ofmagnitude fainter than the weakest sources of this kind previously studiedusing asca or bepposax. the new data extend toward lower luminosities the knownlinear correlation between hard x-ray and h-alpha luminosity for broad-lineagns. many narrow-line objects do contain x-ray cores, consistent with eitherweak agns or x-ray binary systems, but they have x-ray luminosities a factor of10 below the l_x-l(halpha) relation of the broad-line sources. theirdistributions of photon energies show no indication of exceptionally highabsorption. the optical line emission in these nuclei is likely powered, atleast in part, by stellar processes.

astro-ph;0206497	characterizing the warm-hot igm at high redshift: a high resolution  survey for o vi at z = 2.5	we describe a survey for ovi absorption in the spectra of 5 high redshiftquasars (2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.8). we identify 12 cosmological systems, and 6 systemsthat are either ejected from the background qso or affected by its localradiation field. almost all of the intergalactic ovi is associated with strongly-a absorption (n_hi &gt; 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from civ andoften lower ionization species. the absorbing regions are conservativelyconstrained to have l&lt;=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar &gt;= 2.5, with actual valuesprobably closer to l ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. they also have twodistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized civ and siiv at t ~ 30,000k, and a second which is seen only in ovi. the ovi temperature is difficult toconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, butit does appear that this gas is hotter than the civ/siiv phase and couldsupport collisional ovi production. the ovi is strongly clustered on velocityscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s. thepower-law slope of the correlation function resembles that of local galaxy andcluster surveys, with a comoving correlation length of 11h_{65}^-1 mpc. theaverage oxygen abundance of the ovi systems is [o/h]&gt;-1.5, about 10 timeshigher than the level observed in the general igm. two ovi productionmechanisms are considered: shock heating of gas falling onto existingstructure, and expulsion of material by galactic winds. simulations of infallmodels tend to overproduce ovi lines by a factor of ~10, though this may resultfrom numerical limitations. known galaxy populations such as the lyman breakobjects could produce the observed amount of ovi if they drive winds todistances of r ~ 50 kpc.

astro-ph;0210048	a search for "dwarf" seyfert nuclei. vi. properties of emission-line  nuclei in nearby galaxies	we use the database from paper iii to quantify the global and nuclearproperties of emission-line nuclei in the palomar spectroscopic survey ofnearby galaxies. we show that the host galaxies of seyferts, liners, andtransition objects share remarkably similar large-scale properties and localenvironments. the distinguishing traits emerge on nuclear scales. compared withliners, seyfert nuclei are an order of magnitude more luminous and exhibithigher electron densities and internal extinction. we suggest that seyfertgalaxies possess characteristically more gas-rich circumnuclear regions, andhence a more abundant fuel reservoir and plausibly higher accretion rates. thedifferences between the ionization state of the narrow emission-line regions ofseyferts and liners can be partly explained by the differences in their nebularproperties. transition-type objects are consistent with being composite(liner/\hii) systems. with very few exceptions, the stellar population withinthe central few hundred parsecs of the host galaxies is uniformly old, afinding that presents a serious challenge to starburst or post-starburst modelsfor these objects. seyferts and liners have virtually indistinguishablevelocity fields as inferred from their line widths and line asymmetries. allthree classes of objects obey a strong correlation between line width and lineluminosity. we argue that the angular momentum content of circumnuclear gas maybe an important factor in determining whether a nucleus becomes active.finally, we discuss some possible complications for the unification model ofseyfert galaxies posed by our observations.

astro-ph;0306469	metallicity of the intergalactic medium using pixel statistics. ii. the  distribution of metals as traced by c iv	(modified) we measure the distribution of carbon in the intergalactic mediumas a function of redshift z and overdensity delta. using a hydrodynamicalsimulation to link the h i absorption to the density and temperature of theabsorbing gas, and a model for the uv background radiation, we convert ratiosof c iv to h i pixel optical depths into carbon abundances. a careful analysisof 19 high-quality quasar absorption spectra reveals that the carbon abundanceis spatially highly inhomogeneous and is well-described by a lognormaldistribution for fixed delta and z. using data in the range log(delta) = -0.5 -1.8 and z = 1.8 - 4.1, and a renormalized version of the haardt &amp; madau (2001)model for the uv background radiation from galaxies and quasars, we measure amedian metallicity of [c/h] = -3.47 + 0.08(z-3) + 0.65[log(delta)-0.5] and alognormal scatter of sigma([c/h]) = 0.76 + 0.02(z-3) - 0.23[log(delta)-0.5].thus, we find significant trends with overdensity, but no evidence forevolution. these measurements imply that gas in this density range accounts fora cosmic carbon abundance of [c/h] = -2.80 +/- 0.13 (omega_c = 2e-7), with noevidence for evolution. the dominant source of systematic error is the spectralshape of the uv background, with harder spectra yielding higher carbonabundances. while the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the spectralhardness may exceed the quoted statistical errors for delta &lt; 10, we stressthat uv backgrounds that differ significantly from our fiducial model giveunphysical results. the measured lognormal scatter is strictly independent ofthe spectral shape, provided the background radiation is uniform. we alsopresent measurements of the c iii/c iv ratio (which rule out collisionalionization) and of the evolution of the effective lyman-alpha optical depth.

astro-ph;0310664	metallicity of the intergalactic medium using pixel statistics: iii.  silicon	(modified) we study the abundance of silicon in the intergalactic medium byanalyzing the statistics of siiv, civ, and hi pixel optical depths in a sampleof 19 high-quality quasar absorption spectra spanning redshifts z ~ 2 - 4,which we compare to realistic spectra drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation.we find that silicon is highly overabundant relative to carbon and that thescatter in si/c is much smaller than that in c/h, implying a common origin forsi and c. the inferred [si/c] depends upon the shape of the uv background (uvb)(harder backgrounds leading to higher [si/c]), ranging from [si/c] ~ 1.5 for aquasar-only uvb, to [si/c] ~ 0.25 for a uvb including both galaxies and anartificial softening. for our fiducial uvb, which includes both quasars andgalaxies, we find [si/c]=0.77 +/- 0.05, with a possible systematic error of ~0.1 dex. there is no evidence for evolution in [si/c] and the data areinconsistent with previous claims of a sharp change in the siiv/civ ratio (orthe uvb) at z ~ 3. comparisons with low-metallicity halo stars andnucleosynthetic yields suggest that either our fiducial uvb is too hard or thatsupermassive pop iii stars might have to be included. the inferred [si/c]corresponds to a contribution to the cosmic si abundance of [si/h] = -2.0, asignificant fraction of all si production expected by z ~ 3.

astro-ph;0312467	the distribution of metallicity in the igm at z~2.5: ovi and civ  absorption in the spectra of 7 qsos	we present a direct measurement of the metallicity distribution function forthe high redshift intergalactic medium. we determine the shape of this functionusing survival statistics, which account for both detections and non-detectionsof ovi and civ associated with hi absorption in quasar spectra. our ovi sampleprobes the metal content of ~50% of all baryons at z~2.5. we find a medianintergalactic abundance of [o,c/h]=-2.82; the differential abundancedistribution is approximately lognormal with mean &lt;[c,o/h]&gt;~-2.85 and\sigma=0.75 dex. some 60-70% the lya forest lines are enriched to observablelevels ([o,c/h]&gt;-3.5) while the remaining ~30% of the lines have even lowerabundances. thus we have not detected a universal metallicity floor as has beensuggested for some population iii enrichment scenaria. in fact, we argue thatthe bulk of the intergalactic metals formed later than the first stars that arethought to have triggered reionization. we do not observe a significant trendof decreasing metallicity toward the lower density igm, at least within regionsthat would be characterized as filaments in numerical simulations. however, an[o/h] enhancement may be present at somewhat high densities. we estimate thatroughly half of all baryons at these redshifts have been enriched to[o/h]&gt;=-3.5. we develop a simple model for the metallicity evolution of theigm, to estimate the chemical yield of galaxies formed prior to z~2.5. we findthat the typical galaxy recycled 0.1-0.4% of its mass back into the igm asheavy elements in the first 3 gyr after the big bang.

astro-ph;0505138	tightening constraints from the lyman alpha forest with the flux  probability distribution function	the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest of absorption lines in quasar spectrahas emerged as a potentially powerful technique to constrain the linear matterpower spectrum. in most previous work, the amplitude of the ionizing backgroundwas fixed by calibrating simulations to match the observed mean transmittedflux in the lyman-alpha forest. this procedure is undesirable in principle asit requires the estimation of the unabsorbed quasar continuum level, adifficult undertaking subject to various sources of systematic error and bias.we suggest an alternative approach based on measuring the one-point probabilitydistribution function (pdf) of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean,relative to the mean, i.e. the pdf of delta_f = (f - &lt;f&gt;)/&lt;f&gt;. this statistic,while sensitive to the amplitude of the ionizing background, has the virtuethat its measurement does not require an estimate of the unabsorbed continuumlevel. we present a measurement of the pdf of delta_f from seven keck hiresspectra, spanning a redshift range of z = 2.2 - 4.4. to illustrate that ourmethod is useful, we compare our measurements of the pdf of delta_f, andmeasurements of the flux power spectrum from croft et al. (2002) at z = 2.72,with cosmological simulations. from this comparison, we obtain constraints onthe mean transmission in the lyman-alpha forest, the slope of thetemperature-density relation, as well as the amplitude and slope of the masspower spectrum. our methodology will be useful for obtaining more preciseconstraints with larger data samples from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).

astro-ph;0509262	expansion and collapse in the cosmic web	we study the kinematics of the gaseous cosmic web at high redshift with lymanalpha forest absorption in multiple qso sightlines. using a simple analyticmodel and a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we constrain the underlyingthree-dimensional distribution of velocities from the observed line-of-sightdistribution of velocity shear across the plane of the sky. the distribution isfound to be in good agreement with the intergalactic medium (igm) undergoinglarge scale motions dominated by the hubble flow. modeling the lyman alphaclouds analytically and with a hydrodynamics simulation, the average expansionvelocity of the gaseous structures causing the lyman alpha forest in the lowerredshift (z = 2) sample appears about 20 percent lower than the local hubbleexpansion velocity. we interpret this as tentative evidence for some cloudsundergoing gravitational collapse. however, the distribution of velocities ishighly skewed, and the majority of clouds at redshifts from 2 to 3.8 expandtypically about 5 - 20 percent faster than the hubble flow. this behavior isexplained if most absorbers in the column density range typically detectableare expanding filaments that stretch and drain into more massive nodes. we findno evidence for the observed distribution of velocity shear being significantlyinfluenced by processes other than hubble expansion and gravitationalinstability, like galactic winds. to avoid overly disturbing the igm, winds maybe old and/or limp by the time we observe them in the lyman alpha forest, orthey may occupy only an insignificant volume fraction of the igm.

astro-ph;9704108	a search for "dwarf" seyfert nuclei. v. demographics of nuclear activity  in nearby galaxies	we use the sample of emission-line nuclei derived from a recently completedoptical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies to quantify the incidence oflocal (z = 0) nuclear activity. consistent with previous studies, we finddetectable amounts of ionized gas in the central few hundred parsecs of most(86%) galaxies. half of the objects can be classified as h ii or star-formingnuclei and the other half as some form of agn, of which we distinguish threeclasses --- seyfert nuclei, liners, and transition objects. the population ofagns consequently is very large; approximately 43% of the galaxies in oursurvey can be regarded as "active." most of the objects have much lowerluminosities than agns commonly studied; the median luminosity of the narrowh-alpha line, after correcting for extinction, is only 2 x 10^39 erg/s. oursample therefore occupies the extreme faint end of the agn luminosity function.we detect signatures of a broad-line region, as revealed by visible broadh-alpha emission, in $\sim$ 20% of the agn sample. seyfert nuclei, both type 1and type 2, reside in $\sim$ 10% of all galaxies. liners make up the bulk(1/2--3/4) of the agn population and a significant fraction (1/5--1/3) of allgalaxies. a nonnegligible subset of liners emit broad h-alpha emission,furnishing direct evidence that at least some liners are indeed relatedphysically to the agn phenomenon. the dominant ionization mechanism of thenuclear emission depends strongly on the morphological type and luminosity ofthe host galaxy. agns are found predominantly in luminous, early-type (e tosbc) galaxies, while h ii nuclei prefer less luminous, late-type (sbc andlater) systems. the various agn subclasses have broadly similar host galaxies.

astro-ph;9705021	the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster: ii. galaxy  evolution with redshift and environment	we measure the field galaxy luminosity function (lf) as a function of colorand redshift from z = 0 to z = 0.5 using galaxies from the norris survey of thecorona borealis supercluster. we find that our local r-band lf, when normalizedto counts in high galactic latitude fields, agrees well with the local lfmeasured in the las campanas redshift survey. our b-band local lf, however,does not match the b-band lf from the stromlo/apm survey, having anormalization 1.6 times higher. we see compelling evidence that b-band fieldgalaxy lf evolves with redshift. the evolution is strongest for the populationof star-forming galaxies with [oii]3727 rest-frame equivalent widths greaterthan 10a. the population of red, quiescent galaxies shows no sign of evolutionto z = 0.5. the evolution of the lf which we observe is consistent with thefindings of other faint galaxy redshift surveys. the fraction of galaxies with[oii] emission increases rapidly with redshift, but the fraction of galaxieswith strong hdelta 4101 absorption, a signature of a burst of star formation,does not. we thus conclude that the star formation in distant galaxies isprimarily long-lived.  we also compute the lfs of the corona borealis supercluster and the a2069supercluster. the shapes of the two supercluster lfs are broadly similar to theshape of the local lf. however, there are important differences. bothsupercluster lfs have an excess of very bright galaxies. in addition, there isa suggestion of an upturn in the lf for galaxies fainter than m(b) = -17 mag.

astro-ph;9708153	the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster: iii. structure  and mass of the supercluster	(abridged) we present a study of the structure and dynamics of the coronaborealis supercluster (z ~ 0.07) based on the redshifts for 528 galaxies in thesupercluster. the galaxy distribution within corona borealis is clumpy andappears overall to be far from relaxed. a background supercluster at z ~ 0.11makes a substantial contribution to the projected surface density of galaxiesin the corona borealis field. in order to estimate the mass of thesupercluster, we have assumed that the mass of the supercluster is proportionalto v^2r, where v and r are suitable scale velocity and radius, respectively,and we have used n-body simulations of both critical- and low-density universesto determine the applicability of standard mass estimators based on thisassumption. although superclusters are obviously not in equilibrium, oursimulations demonstrate that the virial mass estimator yields mass estimateswith an insignificant bias and a dispersion of only ~25% for objects withoverdensities &gt;~ 5. non-uniform spatial sampling can, however, cause systematicunderestimates by as much as 30%. all of our simulated superclusters turn outto be bound, and based on the overdensity of the corona borealis supercluster,we believe it is also very likely to be bound and may well have started tocollapse. the mass of corona borealis is at least 3 x 10^16 solar masses, whichyields a b(ab)-band mass-to-light ratio of 564h (m/l)_solar on scales of ~20h^-1 mpc. the background supercluster has a mass-to-light ratio of 726h(m/l)_solar. by comparing the supercluster mass-to-light ratios with thecritical mass-to-light ratio required to close the universe, we determine thatomega_0 &gt;~ 0.4 on supercluster scales.

astro-ph;9709203	temporal changes in quasar broad emission line profiles and the  gravitationally lensed nature of q1634+267a,b and q2345+007a,b	(abridged) steidel &amp; sargent (1991a) found that the spectra of the componentsof the close quasar pairs q1634+267a,b and q2345+007a,b were in each caseremarkably similar but that individual broad emission lines due to ly_alpha, siiv, c iv, and c iii] exhibited differences in profile or equivalent widthbetween the a and b components. if the a and b components of these objectsresult from gravitational lensing of a single qso, the difference in lighttravel time for the two images is roughly 1 year for both pairs. accordingly,the authors suggested that observations of the spectra of single qsos wouldreveal similar changes in emission line profiles and equivalent widths on atime scale of a year or less. in order to test steidel &amp; sargent's hypothesis,we obtained in 1992 high quality spectra of 30 quasars with z(em) ~ 1 selectedfrom the brighter qsos in the sample of steidel &amp; sargent (1991b), which thoseauthors had observed in 1989-90. we find that the spectra from the two epochsare remarkably similar for all qsos, except for overall changes in fluxes andminor differences in continuum shape which are probably artifacts introduced bythe observing procedures. however, there are also changes in the equivalentwidths or shapes of the stronger emission lines on rest-frame time scales of1-1.5 years in about two thirds of the qsos. these observations, therefore,support the notion that the spectra of the components in lensed qsos need notbe exactly identical. moreover, it should be expected that any differencesbetween the components in such systems should change with time.

astro-ph;9710266	the n/si abundance ratio in fifteen damped lyman-alpha galaxies:  implications for the origin of nitrogen	galactic chemical evolution model calculations indicate that there should beconsiderable scatter in the observed n/o ratios at a fixed metallicity (o/h)for galaxies with very low metallicities due to the delayed release of primaryn from intermediate mass stars relative to that of o from short-lived massivestars. moreover, the scatter should increase progressively toward decreasingmetallicity. such effects have not been convincingly demonstrated byobservations of h ii regions in nearby metal-poor galaxies, raising doubtsabout the time-delay model of primary n production. pettini et al and lipman etal realized the utility of high-redshift damped lyman-alpha galaxies forgaining further insights into the origin of n and discussed abundances in threedamped lyman-alpha galaxies. since abundance measurements for o are generallyunavailable for damped lyman-alpha galaxies, they used n/si or n/s in place ofn/o under the reasonable assumption that the abundance ratios o/si and o/s arethe same as solar in damped lyman-alpha galaxies. we discuss observations ofheavy element abundances in 15 high-redshift (z&gt;2) damped lyman-alpha galaxies,many of which have metallicities comparable to or lower than the lowestmetallicity galaxy known locally (i zw 18). we find that the n/si ratios indamped lyman-alpha galaxies exhibit a very large scatter (about 1 dex) at[si/h]~-2 and there is some indication that the scatter increases towarddecreasing metallicity. considerations of various sources of uncertaintiessuggest that they are not likely the main causes of the large scatter. theseresults thus provide strong support for the time-delay model of primary nproduction in intermediate mass stars if, indeed, o/si=solar in dampedlyman-alpha galaxies.

astro-ph;9801012	are agn broad emission lines formed by discrete clouds? --- analysis of  keck high resolution spectroscopy of ngc 4151	we search for a direct signature of discrete ''clouds'' in the broad lineregion (blr) of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151. for this purpose we apply crosscorrelation (cc) analysis to a high resolution keck spectrum of the galaxy. nosuch signature is found in the data. in order for cloud models to be compatiblewith this result, there must be at least $\sim3\times10^7$ emitting clouds inthe blr, where the limit is based on simulation of a homogeneous cloudpopulation. more realistic distributions increase the lower limit to above$10^8$. these numbers are an order of magnitude improvement on our previouslimit from mrk 335, where the improvement comes from higher s/n, broader lines,and refined simulations. combined with the predicted upper limit for the numberof emitting clouds in ngc 4151 ($10^6-10^7$), the derived lower limit puts astrong constraint on the cloud scenario in the blr of this object. similarconstraints can be paled on models where the emission originates in streams andsheets. thus, this investigation suggests that the bels in ngc 4151, and byextension in all agns, are not made of an ensemble of discrete independentemitters.

astro-ph;9802189	the metal contents of very low column density lyman-alpha clouds:  implications for the origin of heavy elements in the intergalactic medium	we investigate the metal contents of lyman-alpha clouds at 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.6 with10^13.5&lt;n(hi)&lt;10^14 cm-2 using high resolution, high s/n spectra of 9 quasarsobtained with the 10m keck i telescope. using an composite spectrum analysistechnique, we deduce a mean metallicity of [c/h]&lt;-3.5 for such clouds, which isa factor of more than 10 less than that inferred for lyman-alpha clouds withn(hi)&gt;10^14.5 cm-2. this result rules out the suggestion that a generation ofpopulation iii stars could have polluted the entire universe to a (nearly)uniform metallicity level of [c/h]=-2.5. cosmological simulations involving gashydrodynamics indicate that lyman-alpha absorption with n(hi)&gt;10^14.5 cm-2mostly occur in the filamentary gaseous regions surrounding and connectingcollapsed objects, while those with n(hi)&lt;10^14 cm-2 are preferentially foundin void regions further away from collapsed objects. these results, coupledwith the simulation results of ostriker and gnedin (1996) and gnedin andostriker (1997) for pop iii star formation and enrichment, strongly suggestthat most of the heavy elements in lyman-alpha clouds with n(hi)&gt;10^14.5 cm-2(i.e., gas in the filaments) were probably prodcued in situ by pop ii stars, inthe sense that they were either made by stars within the clouds or were ejectedfrom nearby star-forming galaxies. within this context, clouds with n(hi)&lt;10^14cm-2 (i.e., gas in void regions) may only have e experienced pollution from popiii stars.

astro-ph;9806143	first comparison of ionization and metallicity in two lines of sight  toward he 1104-1805 ab at z=1.66	using new hst/fos, ntt/emmi, and keck/hires spectra of thegravitationally-lensed double qso he 1104-1805 ab (z=2.31, \theta=3.2), andassuming uv photoionization by a metagalactic radiation field, we derivephysical conditions (ionization levels, metal abundances and cloud sizes alongthe lines of sight) in five civ+mgii absorption systems clustered around z=1.66along the two lines of sight. three of these systems are associated with adamped ly-alpha (dla) system with logn(hi)=20.85, which is observed in a. theother two systems are associated with a lyman-limit system with logn(hi)=17.57(b). the civ and mgii line profiles in a resemble those in the b spectra, andspan \delta v=360 km/s. assuming that the relative metal abundances in theseabsorption systems are the same as observed in the dla system, we find that theobserved n(civ)/n(mgii) ratios imply ionization parameters of log\gamma=-2.95to -2.35. consequently, these clouds should be small (0.5-1.6 kpc with ahydrogen density n_h&lt;=0.01 cm-3) and relatively highly ionized. the absorptionsystems to b are found to have a metallicity 0.63 times lower than themetallicity of the gas giving rise to the dla system, z(dla)= 0.1*z(solar). wedetect ovi at z=1.66253 in both qso spectra, but no associated nv. our modelcalculations lead us to conclude that the civ clouds should be surrounded bylarge (&gt;= 100 kpc) highly ionized low-density clouds (n_h\sim e-4 cm-3), inwhich ovi, but only weak civ absorption occurs. in this state, log\gamma&gt;=-1.2reproduces the observed ratio of n(ovi)/n(nv)&gt;60. these results are discussedin view of the disk/halo and hierarchical structure formation models.

astro-ph;9812027	glimpses of the interstellar medium at redshift 3.5	we have obtained high resolution (fwhm = 4.4 km/s) keck spectra of images aand c of the gravitationally lensed qso q1422+231. the images are separated by1.3" on the sky. in an absorption system at z = 3.538 gas column densityvariations by an order of magnitude and velocity shear on the order of 10 km/sare observed in the low ionization (siii, cii) lines. the transverse separationbetween the lines of sight in the absorbing cloud is estimated to be as smallas 26 parsec, corresponding to an effective angular resolution of 4milliarcseconds as seen from the earth. in contrast, the high ionization (civ)gas appears mostly featureless and thus must be considerably more extended. theabundances of the elements carbon, silicon and oxygen appear to be close to thesolar values. the observation provides the first spatially and kinematicallyresolved probe of the interstellar medium at high redshift on scales smallenough to be influenced by individual stars or star clusters. the massassociated with the low ionization "cloudlets" is likely to be less than about3000 m_solar and possibly less than 1 m_solar. the velocity shear seen acrossthe lines of sight is too large to be caused by galactic bulk motion, so thevelocity field of the low ionization gas must be strongly influenced by smallscale local gasdynamics. while it cannot presently be excluded that thedisturbances of the gas are due to high velocity outflows from the backgroundqso, the observed velocity and density structure of the z=3.538 system isconsistent with our line of sight running through an expanding shell of gas,possibly a supernova bubble or a stellar wind.

astro-ph;9911196	the observed probability distribution function, power spectrum, and  correlation function of the transmitted flux in the lyman-alpha forest	a sample of eight quasars observed at high resolution and signal-to-noise isused to determine the probability distribution function (pdf), the powerspectrum, and the correlation function of the transmitted flux in the \lyaforest, in three redshift bins centered at z=2.41, 3.00, and 3.89. all theresults are presented in tabular form, with full error covariance matrices toallow for comparisons with any numerical simulations and with other data sets.the observations are compared with a numerical simulation of the \lya forest ofa lambda-cdm model with omega=0.4, known to agree with other large-scalestructure observational constraints. there is excellent agreement for the pdf,if the mean transmitted flux is adjusted to match the observations. a smalldifference between the observed and predicted pdf is found at high fluxes andlow redshift, which may be due to the uncertain effects of fitting the spectralcontinuum. using the numerical simulation, we show how the flux power spectrumcan be used to recover the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations. fromour sample of eight quasars, we measure the amplitude of the mass powerspectrum to correspond to a linear variance per unit ln(k) of$\delta^2_\rho(k)=0.72\pm0.09$ at k=0.04(km/s)^{-1} and z=3, and the slope ofthe power spectrum near the same k to be $n_p=-2.55\pm0.10$ (statistical errorbars). the results are statistically consistent with croft et. al. (1999),although our value for the rms fluctuation is lower by a factor 0.75. for thelambda-cdm model we use, the implied primordial slope is $n=0.93\pm0.10$, andthe normalization is $\sigma_8=0.68+1.16(0.95-n)\pm0.04$.

0812.2856	high redshift metals i.: the decline of c iv at z &gt; 5.3	we present the results from our search for c iv in the intergalactic mediumat redshifts z=5.3-6.0. we have observed four z~6 qsos with keck/nirspec inechelle mode. the data are the most sensitive yet taken to search for c iv atthese redshifts, being 50% complete at column densities log(n_{civ})=13.4. wefind no c iv systems in any of the four sightlines. taking into account ourcompleteness, this translates into a decline in the number density of c ivabsorbers in the range 13.0 &lt; log(n_{civ}) &lt; 15.0 of at least a factor 4.4 (95%confidence) from z~2-4.5, where the number density is relatively constant. weuse our lack of detections to set limits on the slope and normalization of thecolumn density distribution at z=5.3-6.0. the rapid evolution of c iv at theseredshifts suggests that the decrease in the number density may largely be dueto ionization effects, in which case many of the metals in the z~4.5 igm couldalready be in place at z~5.3, but in a lower ionization state. the lack of weaksystems in our data, combined with the presence of strong c iv absorbers alongat least one other sightline, further suggests that there may be large-scalevariations in the enrichment and/or ionization state of the z~6 igm, or that civ absorbers at these redshifts are associated with rare, uv-brightstar-forming galaxies.
