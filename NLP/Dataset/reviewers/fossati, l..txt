0905.3153	improved fundamental parameters and lte abundances of the corot  solar-type pulsator hd49933	the knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is a key stone in several fieldsof stellar astrophysics, such as asteroseismology and stellar evolution.although the parameters can be derived both via spectroscopy and multicolorphotometry, the obtained results are sometimes affected by systematicuncertainties. in this paper we present a self-consistent spectral analysis ofthe solar-type star hd49933, which is a primary target for the corot satellite.we used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra to carry out aconsistent parameter estimation and abundance analysis of hd49933. the llmodelscode was employed for model atmosphere calculations, while synth3 and width9codes were used for line profile calculation and lte abundance analysis. inthis paper we provide a detailed description of the methodology adopted toderive the fundamental parameters and the abundances. although the obtainedparameters differ from the ones previously derived by other authors, we showthat only the set obtained in this work is able to fit the observed spectrumaccurately. in particular, the surface gravity was adjusted to fitpressure-sensitive spectral features. we confirm the importance of a consistentanalysis of relevant spectroscopic features, application of advanced modelatmospheres, and the use of up-to-date atomic line data for the determinationof stellar parameters. these results are crucial for further studies, e.g.detailed theoretical modelling of the observed pulsation frequencies.

0906.5269	the chemical abundance analysis of normal early a- and late b-type stars	modern spectroscopy of early-type stars often aims at studying complexphysical phenomena. comparatively less attention is paid to identifying andstudying the "normal" a- and b-type stars and testing how the basic atomicparameters and standard spectral analysis allow one to fit the observations. wewish to stablish whether the chemical composition of the solar photosphere canbe regarded as a reference for early a- and late b-type stars. we have obtainedoptical high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of three slowlyrotating early-type stars (hd 145788, 21 peg and pi cet) that show no obvioussign of chemical peculiarity, and performed a very accurate lte abundanceanalysis of up to 38 ions of 26 elements (for 21 peg), using a vast amount ofspectral lines visible in the spectral region covered by our spectra. weprovide an exhaustive description of the abundance characteristics of the threeanalysed stars with a critical review of the line parameters used to derive theabundances. we compiled a table of atomic data for more than 1100 measuredlines that may be used in the future as a reference. the abundances we obtainedfor he, c, al, s, v, cr, mn, fe, ni, sr, y, and zr are compatible with thesolar ones derived with recent 3d radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of thesolar photosphere. the abundances of the remaining studied elements show somedegree of discrepancy compared to the solar photosphere. those of n, na, mg,si, ca, ti, and nd may well be ascribed to non-lte effects; for p, cl, sc andco, non-lte effects are totally unknown; o, ne, ar, and ba show discrepanciesthat cannot be ascribed to non-lte effects. the discrepancies obtained for o(in two stars) and ne agree with very recent non-lte abundance analysis ofearly b-type stars in the solar neighbourhood.

1005.3656	metals in the exosphere of the highly irradiated planet wasp-12b	we present near-uv transmission spectroscopy of the highly irradiatedtransiting exoplanet wasp-12b, obtained with the cosmic origins spectrograph onthe hubble space telescope. the spectra cover three distinct wavelength ranges:nuva (2539-2580 {\aa}), nuvb (2655-2696 {\aa}), and nuvc (2770-2811 {\aa}).three independent methods all reveal enhanced transit depths attributable toabsorption by resonance lines of metals in the exosphere of wasp-12b. lightcurves of total counts in the nuva and nuvc wavelength ranges show a detectionat a 2.5{\sigma} level. we detect extra absorption in the mg ii{\lambda}{\lambda}2800 resonance line cores at the 2.8{\sigma} level. the nuva,nuvb, and nuvc light curves imply effective radii of 2.69+/-0.24 rj,2.18+/-0.18 rj, and 2.66+/-0.22 rj respectively, suggesting the planet issurrounded by an absorbing cloud which overfills the roche lobe. we detectenhanced transit depths at the wavelengths of resonance lines of neutralsodium, tin, and manganese, and at singly ionized ytterbium, scandium,manganese, aluminum, vanadium, and magnesium. we also find the statisticallyexpected number of anomalous transit depths at wavelengths not associated withany known resonance line. our data are limited by photon noise, but taken as awhole the results are strong evidence for an extended absorbing exospheresurrounding the planet. the nuva data exhibit an early ingress, contrary tomodel expectations; we speculate this could be due to the presence of a disk ofpreviously stripped material.

1007.3082	a detailed spectropolarimetric analysis of the planet hosting star  wasp-12	the knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is paramount in several fieldsof stellar astrophysics, particularly in the study of extrasolar planets, whereoften the star is the only visible component and therefore used to infer theplanet's fundamental parameters. another important aspect of the analysis ofplanetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star-planetinteraction. here we present a self-consistent abundance analysis of the planethosting star wasp-12 and a high-precision search for a structured stellarmagnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained withthe espadons spectropolarimeter. our results show that the star does not have astructured magnetic field, and that the obtained fundamental parameters are ingood agreement with what was previously published. in addition we deriveimproved constraints on the stellar age (1.0-2.65 gyr), mass (1.23-1.49 m/m0),and distance (295-465 pc). wasp-12 is an ideal object to look for pollutionsignatures in the stellar atmosphere. we analyse the wasp-12 abundances as afunction of the condensation temperature and compare them with those publishedby several other authors on planet hosting and non-planet hosting stars. wefind hints of atmospheric pollution in wasp-12's photosphere, but are unable toreach firm conclusions with our present data. we conclude that a differentialanalysis based on wasp-12 twins will probably clarify if an atmosphericpollution is present, the nature of this pollution and its implications in theplanet formation and evolution. we attempt also the direct detection of thecircumstellar disk through infrared excess, but without success.

1012.0149	a photometric long-term study of cp stars in open clusters	photometric variability of chemically peculiar (cp) stars of the upper mainsequence is closely connected to their local stellar magnetic field and theirrotational period. long term investigations, as presented here, help us toidentify possible stellar cycles (as in the sun). furthermore, these dataprovide a basis for detailed surface mapping techniques. photoelectricstroemgren uvby time series for 27 cp stars within the boundaries of openclusters are presented. in addition, hipparcos photometric data (from 1989 to1993) are used for our analysis. our observations cover a time period of aboutsix years (1986 to 1992) with typically fifteen measurements for each objects.these observations help us to determine the rotational periods of theseobjects. a standard reduction procedure was applied to the data. when possible,we merged our data sets with already published ones to obtain a moresignificant result. a detailed time series analysis was performed, involvingfive different methods to minimize spurious detections. we established, for thefirst time, variability for fourteen cp stars. for additional two stars, amerging of already published data sets, resulted in more precise periods,whereas for six objects, the published periods could be confirmed. last, butnot least, no significant variations were found for five stars. apart from sixstars, all targets seem to be members of their host open clusters.

1106.2935	the shocking transit of wasp-12b: modelling the observed early ingress  in the near ultraviolet	near ultraviolet observations of wasp-12b have revealed an early ingresscompared to the optical transit lightcurve. this has been interpreted as due tothe presence of a magnetospheric bow shock which forms when the relativevelocity of the planetary and stellar material is supersonic. we aim toreproduce this observed early ingress by modelling the stellar wind (or coronalplasma) in order to derive the speed and density of the material at theplanetary orbital radius. from this we determine the orientation of the shockand the density of compressed plasma behind it. with this model for the densitystructure surrounding the planet we perform monte carlo radiation transfersimulations of the near uv transits of wasp-12b with and without a bow shock.we find that we can reproduce the transit lightcurves with a wide range ofplasma temperatures, shock geometries and optical depths. our results supportthe hypothesis that a bow shock could explain the observed early ingress.

1106.4406	the accuracy of stellar atmospheric parameter determinations: a case  study with hd 32115 and hd 37594	we present detailed parameter determinations of two chemically normal latea-type stars, hd 32115 and hd 37594, to uncover the reasons behind largediscrepancies between two previous analyses of these stars performed with asemi-automatic procedure and a "classical" analysis. our study is based on highresolution, high signal-to-noise spectra obtained at the mcdonald observatory.our method is based on the simultaneous use of all available observables:multicolor photometry, pressure-sensitive magnesium lines, metallic lines andbalmer line profiles. our final set of fundamental parameters fits, within theerror bars, all available observables. it differs from the published resultsobtained with a semi-automatic procedure. a direct comparison between our newobservational material and the spectra previously used by other authors showsthat the quality of the data is not the origin of the discrepancies. as the twostars require a substantial macroturbulence velocity to fit the line profiles,we concluded that neglecting this additional broadening in the semi-automaticanalysis is one origin of discrepancy. the use of fei excitation equilibriumand of the fe ionisation equilibrium, to derive effective temperature andsurface gravity, respectively, neglecting all other indicators leads to asystematically erroneously high effective temperature. we deduce that theresults obtained using only one parameter indicator might be biased and thatthose results need to be cautiously taken when performing further detailedanalyses, such as modelling of the asteroseismic frequencies or characterisingtransiting exoplanets.

1109.5043	stellar magnetism through the polarized eyes of the fors1 instrument	during the last decade, the fors1 instrument of the eso very large telescopehas been used to obtain low resolution circular polarized spectra for about 500stars, with the aim of measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields.magnetic field estimates were obtained by different authors, using differentsoftware tools. several interesting detections were obtained at a 3 sigmalevel; some of them were eventually confirmed by follow-up investigations, someof them were not. this raises issues about the reliability of the stateduncertainties of some of the published field values. to investigate theseproblems, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure for magnetic fielddetermination, which includes self-consistent checks for field detectionreliability. we have applied our procedure to the full content of single star("fast mode") circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive,and explored the details and interagreement of various methods for datareduction. we have finally produced a catalogue of fors1 longitudinal fieldmeasurements which includes about 1000 entries. here we critically review thepreviously published fors1 measurements, and, based on our results, we suggestthat the incidence of the magnetic field in various classes of stars should berevised.

1110.6283	a photometric study of chemically peculiar stars with the stereo  satellites. i. magnetic chemically peculiar stars	about 10% of upper main sequence stars are characterised by the presence ofchemical peculiarities, often found together with a structured magnetic field.the atmospheres of most of those chemically peculiar stars present surfacespots, leading to photometric variability caused by rotational modulation. thestudy of the light curves of those stars therefore, permits a precisemeasurement of their rotational period, which is important to study stellarevolution and to plan further detailed observations. we analysed the lightcurves of 1028 chemically peculiar stars obtained with the stereo spacecraft.we present here the results obtained for the 337 magnetic chemically peculiarstars in our sample. thanks to the cadence and stability of the photometry,stereo data are perfectly suitable to study variability signals with aperiodicity typical of magnetic chemically peculiar stars. using a matchedfilter algorithm and then two different period searching algorithms, wecompiled a list of 82 magnetic chemically peculiar stars for which we measureda reliable rotational period; for 48 of them this is the first measurement oftheir rotational period. the remaining 255 stars are likely to be constant,although we cannot exclude the presence of long period variability. in somecases, the presence of blending or systematic effects prevented us fromdetecting any reliable variability and in those cases we classified the star asconstant. for each star we classified as variable, we determined temperature,luminosity, mass and fractional age, but the limited statistics, biased towardsthe shorter periods, prevented us from finding any evolutionary trend of therotational period. for a few stars, the comparison between their projectedrotational velocity and equatorial velocity let us believe that their realrotational period might be longer than that found here and previously obtained.

1112.3969	magnetic field measurements and their uncertainties: the fors1 legacy	during the last decade, the fors1 instrument of the eso vlt has beenextensively used to study stellar magnetism. a number of interestingdiscoveries of magnetic fields in several classes of stars have been announced,many of which obtained at a ~3 sigma level; some of the discoveries areconfirmed by measurements obtained with other instruments, some are not. herewe investigate the reasons for the discrepancies between the results obtainedwith fors1 and those obtained with other instruments.  using the eso fors pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure formagnetic field determination. we have applied this procedure to the fullcontent of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive. wehave devised and applied a number of consistency checks to our fielddeterminations, and we have compared our results to those previously publishedin the literature.  we find that for high signal-to-noise ratio measurements, photon noise doesnot account for the full error bars. we discuss how field measurements dependon the specific algorithm adopted for data reduction, and we show that verysmall instrument flexures, negligible in most of the instrument applications,may be responsible for some spurious field detections in the null profiles.finally, we find that we are unable to reproduce some results previouslypublished in the literature. consequently, we do not confirm some importantdiscoveries of magnetic fields obtained with fors1 and reported in previouspublications.  our revised field measurements show that there is no contradiction betweenthe results obtained with the low-resolution spectropolarimeter fors1 and thoseobtained with high-resolution spectropolarimeters. fors1 is an instrumentcapable of performing reliable magnetic field measurements, provided that thevarious source of uncertainties are properly taken into account.

1207.6210	the habitability and detection of earth-like planets orbiting cool white  dwarfs	since there are several ways planets can survive the giant phase of the hoststar, we examine the habitability and detection of planets orbiting whitedwarfs. as a white dwarf cools from 6000 k to 4000 k, a planet orbiting at 0.01au would remain in the continuous habitable zone (chz) for ~8 gyr. we show thatphotosynthetic processes can be sustained on such planets. the dna-weighted uvradiation dose for an earth-like planet in the chz is less than the maximaencountered on earth, hence non-magnetic white dwarfs are compatible with thepersistence of complex life. polarisation due to a terrestrial planet in thechz of a cool white dwarf is 10^2 (10^4) times larger than it would be in thehabitable zone of a typical m-dwarf (sun-like star). polarimetry is thus aviable way to detect close-in rocky planets around white dwarfs. multi-bandpolarimetry would also allow reveal the presence of a planet atmosphere,providing a first characterisation. planets in the chz of a 0.6 m_sun whitedwarf will be distorted by roche geometry, and a kepler-11d analogue wouldoverfill its roche lobe. with current facilities a super-earth-sizedatmosphereless planet is detectable with polarimetry around the brightest knowncool white dwarf. planned future facilities render smaller planets detectable,in particular by increasing the instrumental sensitivity in the blue.

1208.3650	on the incidence of weak magnetic fields in da white dwarfs	context: about 10% of white dwarfs have magnetic fields with strength in therange between about 10^5 and 3x10^8 g. it is not known whether the remainingwhite dwarfs are not magnetic, or if they have a magnetic field too weak to bedetected with the techniques adopted in the large surveys. aims. we describethe results of the first survey specifically devised to clarify the detectionfrequency of kg-level magnetic fields in cool da white dwarfs. methods: usingthe fors1 instrument of the eso vlt, we have obtained balmer line circularspectropolarimetric measurements of a small sample of cool (da6 - da8) whitedwarfs. using fors and uves archive data, we have also revised numerous whitedwarf field measurements previously published in the literature. results: wehave discovered an apparently constant longitudinal magnetic field of \sim9.5kg in the da6 white dwarf wd2105-820. this star is the first weak-field whitedwarf that has been observed sufficiently to roughly determine thecharacteristics of its field. the available data are consistent with a simpledipolar morphology with magnetic axis nearly parallel to the rotation axis, anda polar strength of \simeq 56 kg. our re-evaluation of the fors archive datafor white dwarfs indicates that longitudinal magnetic fields weaker than 10 kghad previously been correctly identified in at least three white dwarfs.conclusions: we find that the probability of detecting a field of kg strengthin a da white dwarf is of the order of 10% for each of the cool and hot dastars. if there is a lower cutoff to field strength in white dwarfs, or a fieldbelow which all white dwarfs are magnetic, the current precision ofmeasurements is not yet sufficient to reveal it.

1211.0146	galactic archaeology: mapping and dating stellar populations with  asteroseismology of red-giant stars	our understanding of how the galaxy was formed and evolves is severelyhampered by the lack of precise constraints on basic stellar properties such asdistances, masses, and ages. here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giantsrepresent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning alarge age range, which can be used to map and date the galactic disc in theregions probed by observations made by the corot and kepler space telescopes.when combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of suchevolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but alsoprovide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxiesfor the ages of the stars. as a first application we consider red giantsobserved by corot in two different parts of the milky way, and determineprecise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of thegalactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solarneighbourhood. we find significant differences in the mass distributions ofthese two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models ofthe milky way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in thedistribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. in the future, theavailability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will notonly improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints onage-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different galactocentric radiiand heights from the plane.

1211.1535	a photometric study of chemically peculiar stars with the stereo  satellites. ii. non-magnetic chemically peculiar stars	we have analysed the photometric data obtained with the stereo spacecraft for558 non-magnetic chemically peculiar (cp) stars to search for rotational andpulsational variability. applying the lomb-scargle and the phase dispersionminimisation methods, we have detected photometric variability for 44 objectsfrom which 35 were previously unknown. the new objects are all bright stars onthe ecliptic plane (magnitude range 4.7 &lt; v &lt; 11.7) and will therefore be ofgreat interest to studies of stellar structure and evolution. in particular,several show multiple signals consistent with hybrid delta scuti and gammadoradus pulsation, with different periodicities allowing very different regionsof the stellar interior to be studied. there are two subgroups of stars in oursample: the cool metallic line am (cp1) and the hot hgmn (cp3) stars. theseobjects fall well inside the classical instability strip where delta scuti,gamma doradus and slowly pulsating b-type stars are located. we also expect tofind periods correlated to the orbital period for cp1 objects as they aremostly members of binary systems. for cp3 stars, rotationally-inducedvariability is still a matter of debate. although surface spots were detected,they are believed to produce only marginal photometric amplitudes. so, periodsfrom several hours to a few days were expected for these two star groups. theremaining 514 stars are likely to be constant in the investigated range from0.1 to 10 days. in some cases, the presence of blending or systematic effectsprevented us from detecting any reliable variability and in those cases weclassified the star as constant. finally, we have calibrated the variable starsin terms of the effective temperature and luminosity in order to estimatemasses and ages. for this purpose we used specifically developed calibrationsfor cp stars and, when available, hipparcos parallaxes.

1212.2779	3d gas dynamic simulation of the interaction between the exoplanet  wasp-12b and its host star	hst transit observations in the near-uv performed in 2009 made wasp-12b oneof the most "mysterious" exoplanets; the system presents an early-ingress,which can be explained by the presence of optically thick matter located aheadof the planet at a distance of 4-5 planet radii. this work follows previousattempts to explain this asymmetry with an exospheric outflow or a bow shock,induced by a planetary magnetic field, and provides a numerical solution of theearly-ingress, though we did not perform any radiative transfer calculation. weperformed pure 3d gas dynamic simulations of the plasma interaction betweenwasp-12b and its host star, and describe the flow pattern in the system. inparticular, we show that the overfilling of the planet's roche lobe leads to anoticeable outflow from the upper atmosphere in the direction of the l1 and l2points. due to the conservation of the angular momentum, the flow to the l1point is deflected in the direction of the planet's orbital motion, while theflow towards l2 is deflected in the opposite direction, resulting in anon-axisymmetric envelope, surrounding the planet. the supersonic motion of theplanet inside the stellar wind leads to the formation of a bow shock with acomplex shape. the existence of the bow shock slows down the outflow throughthe l1 and l2 points, allowing us to consider a long-living flow structurewhich is in the steady-state.

1301.0991	gamma doradus pulsation in two pre-main sequence stars discovered by  corot	pulsations in pre-main sequence stars have been discovered several timeswithin the last years. but nearly all of these pulsators are of deltascuti-type. gamma doradus-type pulsation in young stars has been predicted bytheory, but lack observational evidence. we present the investigation ofvariability caused by rotation and (gammadoradus-type) pulsation in twopre-main sequence members of the young open cluster ngc2264 usinghigh-precision time series photometry from the corot satellite and dedicatedhigh-resolution spectroscopy. time series photometry of ngc2264vas20 and ngc2264vas87 was obtained by the corot satellite during the dedicated short runsra01 in march 2008. ngc2264vas87 was re-observed by corot during the short runsra05 in december 2011 and january 2012. frequency analysis was conducted usingperiod04 and sigspec. the spectral analysis was performed using equivalentwidths and spectral synthesis. the frequency analysis yielded 10 and 14intrinsic frequencies for ngc2264vas20 and ngc2264vas 87, respectively, in therange from 0 to 1.5c/d which are attributed to be caused by a combination ofrotation and pulsation. the effective temperatures were derived to be6380$\pm$150k for ngc2264vas20 and 6220$\pm$150k for ngc2264vas87. membershipof the two stars to the cluster is confirmed independently using x-ray fluxes,radial velocity measurements and proper motions available in the literature.the derived li abundances of log n(li)=3.34 and 3.54 for ngc2264vas20 andngc2264vas87, respectively, are in agreement with the li abundance for otherstars in ngc2264 of similar teff reported in the literature. we conclude thatthe two objects are members of ngc2264 and therefore are in their pre-mainsequence evolutionary stage. assuming that part of their variability is causedby pulsation, these two stars might be the first pre-main sequence gammadoradus candidates.

1301.1860	near-uv absorption, chromospheric activity, and star-planet interactions  in the wasp-12 system	we observed the extreme close-in hot jupiter system wasp-12 with hst. near-uvtransits up to three times deeper than the optical transit of wasp-12b revealextensive diffuse gas, extending well beyond the roche lobe. the distributionof absorbing gas varies between visits. the deepest nuv transits are atwavelength ranges with strong photospheric absorption, implying the absorbinggas may have temperature and composition similar to the stellar photosphere.our spectra reveal significantly enhanced absorption (greater than 3 \sigmabelow the median) at ~200 wavelengths on each of two hst visits; 65 of thesewavelengths are consistent between the two visits, using a strict criterion forvelocity matching which excludes matches with velocity shifts exceeding ~20km/s. excess transit depths are robustly detected throughout the inner wings ofthe mgii resonance lines independently on both hst visits. we detectedabsorption in feii 2586a, the heaviest species yet detected in an exoplanettransit. the mgii line cores have zero flux, emission cores exhibited by everyother observed star of similar age and spectral type are conspicuously absent.wasp-12 probably produces normal mgii profiles, but the inner portions of thesestrong resonance lines are likely affected by extrinsic absorption. therequired mg+ column is an order of magnitude greater than expected from theism, though we cannot completely dismiss that possibility. a more plausiblesource of absorption is gas lost by wasp-12b. we show that planetary mass losscan produce the required column. our visit 2 nuv light curves show evidence fora stellar flare. we show that some of the possible transit detections inresonance lines of rare elements may be due instead to non-resonant transitionsin common species. we present optical observations and update the transitephemeris.

1302.0879	detection of a magnetic field in three old and inactive solar-like  planet-hosting stars	our understanding of magnetic fields in late-type stars is strongly driven bywhat we know of the solar magnetic field. for this reason, it is crucial tounderstand how typical the solar dynamo is. to do this we need to compare thesolar magnetic field with that of other stars as similar to the sun aspossible, both in stellar parameters and age, hence activity. we present herethe detection of a magnetic field in three planet-hosting solar-like starshaving a mass, age, and activity level comparable to that of the sun. we usedthe harpspol spectropolarimeter to obtain high-resolution high-qualitycircularly polarised spectra of hd 70642, hd 117207, and hd 154088, using theleast-squares deconvolution technique to detect the magnetic field. from thestokes i spectra, we calculated the logr activity index for each star. wecompared the position of the stars in the hertzsprung-russell diagram toevolutionary tracks, to estimate their mass and age. we used the lithiumabundance, derived from the stokes i spectra, to further constrain the ages. weobtained a definite magnetic field detection for both hd 70642 and hd 154088,while for hd 117207 we obtained a marginal detection. due to the lowersignal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we were unable to detect themagnetic field in the second set of observations available for hd 117207 and hd154088. on the basis of effective temperature, mass, age, and activity levelthe three stars can be considered solar analogs. hd 70642, hd 117207, and hd154088 are ideal targets for a comparative study between the solar magneticfield and that of solar analogs.

1302.3369	regular frequency patterns in the young delta scuti star hd 261711  observed by the corot and most satellites	we concentrate on an asteroseismological study of hd 261711, a rather hotdelta scuti type pulsating member of the young open cluster ngc 2264 located atthe blue border of the instability region. hd 261711 was discovered to be apre-main sequence delta scuti star using the time series photometry obtained bythe most satellite in 2006. high-precision, time-series photometry of hd 261711was obtained by the most and corot satellites in 4 separate new observing runsthat are put into context with the star's fundamental atmospheric parametersobtained from spectroscopy. with the new most data set from 2011/12 and the twocorot light curves from 2008 and 2011/12, the delta scuti variability wasconfirmed and regular groups of frequencies were discovered. the two pulsationfrequencies identified in the data from the first most observing run in 2006are confirmed and 23 new delta scuti-type frequencies were discovered using thecorot data. weighted average frequencies for each group are related to l=0 andl=1 p-modes. evidence for amplitude modulation of the frequencies in two groupsis seen. the effective temperature was derived to be 8600$\pm$200 k, log g is4.1$\pm$0.2, and the projected rotational velocity is 53$\pm$1km/s. using ourteff value and the radius of 1.8$\pm$0.5 rsun derived from sed fitting, we geta log l/lsun of 1.20$\pm$0.14 which agrees well to the seismologicallydetermined values of 1.65 rsun and, hence, a log l/lsun of 1.13. the radialvelocity of 14$\pm$2 km/s we derived for hd 261711, confirms the star'smembership to ngc 2264. our asteroseismic models suggest that hd 261711 is adelta scuti-type star close to the zero-age main sequence (zams) with a mass of1.8 to 1.9msun. hd 261711 is either a young zams star or a late pms star justbefore the onset of hydrogen-core burning.

1303.3375	absorbing gas around the wasp-12 planetary system	near-uv observations of the planet host star wasp-12 uncovered the apparentabsence of the normally conspicuous core emission of the mg2 h&amp;k resonancelines. this anomaly could be due either to (1) a lack of stellar activity,which would be unprecedented for a solar-like star of the imputed age ofwasp-12; or (2) extrinsic absorption, from the intervening interstellar medium(ism) or from material within the wasp-12 system itself, presumably ablatedfrom the extreme hot jupiter wasp-12b. hires archival spectra of the ca2 h&amp;klines of wasp-12 show broad depressions in the line cores, deeper than those ofother inactive and similarly distant stars and similar to wasp-12's mg2 h&amp;kline profiles. we took high resolution espadons and fies spectra of threeearly-type stars within 20' of wasp-12 and at similar distances, which show theism column is insufficient to produce the broad ca2 depression observed inwasp-12. the ebhis h1 column density map supports and strengthens thisconclusion. extrinsic absorption by material local to the wasp-12 system istherefore the most likely cause of the line core anomalies. gas escaping fromthe heavily irradiated planet could form a stable and thick circumstellardisk/cloud. the anomalously low stellar activity index (logr'hk) of wasp-12 isevidently a direct consequence of the extra core absorption, so similar hkindex deficiencies might signal the presence of translucent circumstellar gasaround other stars hosting evaporating planets.

1308.6574	a hot jupiter transiting a mid-k dwarf found in the pre-omegacam transit  survey	we describe the pre-omegatrans project, a deep survey for transitingextra-solar planets in the carina region of the galactic disk. in 2006-2008 weobserved a single dense stellar field with a very high cadence of ~2min usingthe eso wide field imager at the la silla observatory. using the astronomicalwide-field system for europe and the munich difference imaging analysispipeline, a module that has been developed for this project, we created thelight curves of 16000 stars with more than 4000 data points which we searchedfor periodic transit signals using a box-fitting least-squares detectionalgorithm. all light curves are publicly available. in the course of thepre-omegatrans project we identified two planet candidates - pots-1b andpots-c2b - which we present in this work. with extensive follow-up observationswe were able to confirm one of them, pots-1b, a hot jupiter transiting a mid-kdwarf. the planet has a mass of 2.31+-0.77m_jup and a radius of 0.94+-0.04r_jupand a period of p=3.16d. the host star pots-1 has a radius of 0.59+-0.02r_sunand a mass of 0.70+-0.05m_sun. due to its low apparent brightness of i=16.1magthe follow-up and confirmation of pots-1b was particularly challenging andcostly.

1311.4370	a search for pulsations in the hgmn star hd 45975 with corot photometry  and ground-based spectroscopy	the existence of pulsations in hgmn stars is still being debated. to providethe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class ofchemically peculiar objects, the bright star hd 45975 was monitored for nearlytwo months by the corot satellite. independent analyses of the light curveprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d anda peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. multisite, ground-based spectroscopicobservations overlapping the corot observations show the star to be along-period, single-lined binary. furthermore, with the notable exception ofmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line momentsof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., mn and y). incontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. as foundin other hgmn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bumpmoving redwards across the line profiles. we argue that the photometric andspectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms ofrotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. in this framework, theexistence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppmlevel is unlikely in hd 45975. this provides strong constraints on theexcitation/damping of pulsation modes in this hgmn star.

1401.4903	elemental abundance analysis of the early type members of the open  cluster m6: preliminary results	differences in chemical composition among main sequence stars within a givencluster are probably due to differences in their masses and other effects suchas radiative diffusion, magnetic field, rotation, mixing mechanisms, mass loss,accretion and multiplicity. the early type main-sequence members of openclusters of different ages allow to study the competition between radiativediffusion and mixing mechanisms. we have analysed low and high resolutionspectra covering the spectral range 4500 - 5840 angs. of late b, a, and f typemembers of the open cluster m6 (age about 100 myr). the spectra were obtainedusing the flames/giraffe spectrograph mounted at ut2, the 8 meter class vlttelescope. the effective temperatures, surface gravities and microturbulentvelocities of the stars were derived using both photometric and spectralmethods. we have also performed a chemical abundance analysis using syntheticspectra. the abundances of the elements were determined for c, o, mg, si, ca,sc, ti, cr, mn, fe, ni, y, ba. the star-to-star variations in elementalabundances among the members of the open cluster m6 were discussed.

1401.5494	two spotted and magnetic early b-type stars in the young open cluster  ngc2264 discovered by most and espadons	star clusters are known as superb tools for understanding stellar evolution.in a quest for understanding the physical origin of magnetism and chemicalpeculiarity in about 7% of the massive main-sequence stars, we analysed two ofthe ten brightest members of the ~10 myr old galactic open cluster ngc 2264,the early b-dwarfs hd47887 and hd47777. we find accurate rotation periods of1.95 and 2.64 days, respectively, from most photometry. we obtained espadonsspectropolarimetric observations, through which we determined stellarparameters, detailed chemical surface abundances, projected rotationalvelocities, and the inclination angles of the rotation axis. because we foundonly small (&lt;5 km/s) radial velocity variations, most likely caused by spots,we can rule out that hd47887 and hd47777 are close binaries. finally, using theleast-squares deconvolution technique, we found that both stars possess alarge-scale magnetic field with an average longitudinal field strength of about400 g. from a simultaneous fit of the stellar parameters we determine theevolutionary masses of hd47887 and hd47777 to be 9.4+/-0.7 m0 and 7.6+/-0.5 m0.interestingly, hd47777 shows a remarkable helium underabundance, typical ofhelium-weak chemically peculiar stars, while the abundances of hd47887 arenormal, which might imply that diffusion is operating in the lower mass starbut not in the slightly more massive one. furthermore, we argue that the ratherslow rotation, as well as the lack of nitrogen enrichment in both stars, can beconsistent with both the fossil and the binary hypothesis for the origin of themagnetic field. however, the presence of two magnetic and apparently singlestars near the top of the cluster mass-function may speak in favour of thelatter.

1402.5416	wts-2 b: a hot jupiter orbiting near its tidal destruction radius around  a k-dwarf	we report the discovery of wts-2 b, an unusually close-in 1.02-day hotjupiter (mp=1.12mj, rp=1.363rj) orbiting a k2v star, which has a possiblegravitationally-bound m-dwarf companion at 0.6 arcsec separation contributing~20 percent of the total flux in the observed j-band light curve. the planet isonly 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyedby roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ~40 myr,assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of q'*=10^6. q'* is a key factor indetermining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbitalevolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorlyconstrained by observations. we calculate that the orbital decay of wts-2 bwould correspond to a shift in its transit arrival time of t_shift~17 secondsafter 15 years assuming q'*=10^6. a shift less than this would place a directobservational constraint on the lower limit of q'* in this system. we alsoreport a correction to the previously published expected t_shift for wasp-18 b,finding that t_shift=356 seconds after 10 years for q'*=10^6, which is muchlarger than the estimated 28 seconds quoted in wasp-18 b discovery paper. weattempted to constrain q'* via a study of the entire population of knowntransiting hot jupiters, but our results were inconclusive, requiring a moredetailed treatment of transit survey sensitivities at long periods. we concludethat the most informative and straight-forward constraints on q'* will beobtained by direct observational measurements of the shift in transit arrivaltimes in individual hot jupiter systems. we show that this is achievable acrossthe mass spectrum of exoplanet host stars within a decade, and will directlyprobe the effects of stellar interior structure on tidal dissipation.

1403.0491	b fields in ob stars (bob): the discovery of a magnetic field in a  multiple system in the trifid nebula, one of the youngest star forming  regions	recent magnetic field surveys in o- and b-type stars revealed that about 10%of the core-hydrogen-burning massive stars host large-scale magnetic fields.the physical origin of these fields is highly debated. to identify and modelthe physical processes responsible for the generation of magnetic fields inmassive stars, it is important to establish whether magnetic massive stars arefound in very young star-forming regions or whether they are formed in closeinteracting binary systems.  in the framework of our eso large program, we carried out low-resolutionspectropolarimetric observations with fors2 in 2013 april of the three mostmassive central stars in the trifid nebula, hd164492a, hd164492c, andhd164492d. these observations indicated a strong longitudinal magnetic field ofabout 500-600g in the poorly studied component hd164492c. to confirm thisdetection, we used harps in spectropolarimetric mode on two consecutive nightsin 2013 june.  our harps observations confirmed the longitudinal magnetic field inhd164492c. furthermore, the harps observations revealed that hd164492c cannotbe considered as a single star as it possesses one or two companions. thespectral appearance indicates that the primary is most likely of spectral typeb1-b1.5v. since in both observing nights most spectral lines appear blended, itis currently unclear which components are magnetic. long-term monitoring usinghigh-resolution spectropolarimetry is necessary to separate the contribution ofeach component to the magnetic signal. given the location of the systemhd164492c in one of the youngest star formation regions, this system can beconsidered as a rosetta stone for our understanding of the origin of magneticfields in massive stars.

1406.3936	investigating the possible connection between lambda bootis stars and  intermediate population ii type stars	the lambda bootis (lb) stars are located at the upper main sequence of theh-r diagram and exhibit a peculiar abundance pattern. the light elements (c, n,o, and s) present solar abundances whereas all other elements are moderately tostrongly underabundant. it has not yet been determined whether that abundancepattern is intrinsic, or is restricted to the stellar surface. if we follow thehypothesis that the lb stars are intrinsically metal-weak, then there should bea connection with the intermediate population ii and f-weak objects. such apossible affinity has not been previously investigated. we present detailedelemental abundances, including those of the light elements carbon and oxygen,for 38 bright intermediate population ii and f-weak objects. in addition, weinvestigate the kinematic characteristics of the groups. from photometric,spectroscopic, and kinematic data, there is no distinction between theintermediate population ii and f-weak type stars. we therefore conclude thatthe two groups are identical. however, it is possible to distinguish the lbstars from the intermediate population ii stars on the basis of elementalabundances, though not in terms of their kinematics. the lb stars seem to bedistinct from the intermediate population ii group. further asteroseismologicinvestigations and analyses of spectroscopic binary systems are needed tostrengthen this conclusion.

0803.3540	the effect of rotation on the abundances of the chemical elements of the  a-type stars in the praesepe cluster	we study how chemical abundances of late b-, a- and early f-type stars evolvewith time, and we search for correlations between the abundance of chemicalelements and other stellar parameters, such as effective temperature and vsini.we have observed a large number of b-, a- and f-type stars belonging to openclusters of different ages. in this paper we concentrate on the praesepecluster (log t = 8.85), for which we have obtained high resolution, highsignal-to-noise ratio spectra of sixteen normal a- and f-type stars and one amstar, using the sophie spectrograph of the observatoire de haute-provence. forall the observed stars, we have derived fundamental parameters and chemicalabundances. in addition, we discuss another eight am stars belonging to thesame cluster, for which the abundance analysis had been presented in a previouspaper. we find a strong correlation between peculiarity of am stars and vsini.the abundance of the elements underabundant in am stars increases with vsini,while it decreases for the overabundant elements. chemical abundances ofvarious elements appear correlated with the iron abundance.

1410.3499	the spectroscopic hertzsprung-russell diagram of galactic massive stars	the distribution of stars in the hertzsprung-russell diagram narrates theirevolutionary history and directly assesses their properties. placing stars inthis diagram however requires the knowledge of their distances and interstellarextinctions, which are often poorly known for galactic stars. the spectroscopichertzsprung-russell diagram (shrd) tells similar evolutionary tales, but isindependent of distance and extinction measurements. based on spectroscopicallyderived effective temperatures and gravities of almost 600 stars, we derive forthe first time the observational distribution of galactic massive stars in theshrd. while biases and statistical limitations in the data prevent detailedquantitative conclusions at this time, we see several clear qualitative trends.by comparing the observational shrd with different state-of-the-art stellarevolutionary predictions, we conclude that convective core overshooting may bemass-dependent and, at high mass ($\geq 15\,m_\odot$), stronger than previouslythought. furthermore, we find evidence for an empirical upper limit in the shrdfor stars with $t_{\rm{eff}}$ between 10000 and 32000 k and, a strikingly largenumber of objects below this line. this over-density may be due to inflationexpanding envelopes in massive main-sequence stars near the eddington limit.

1410.4380	an in-depth spectroscopic analysis of rr lyr variations over the  pulsation cycle	the stellar parameters of rr lyrae stars vary considerably over a pulsationcycle, and their determination is crucial for stellar modelling. we present adetailed spectroscopic analysis of the pulsating star rr lyr, the prototype ofits class, over a complete pulsation cycle, based on high-resolution spectracollected at the 2.7-m telescope of mcdonald observatory. we used simultaneousphotometry to determine the accurate pulsation phase of each spectrum anddetermined the effective temperature, the shape of the depth-dependentmicroturbulent velocity, and the abundance of several elements, for each phase.the surface gravity was fixed to 2.4. element abundances resulting from ouranalysis are stable over the pulsation cycle. however, a variation inionisation equilibrium is observed around minimum radius. we attribute thismostly to a dynamical acceleration contributing to the surface gravity.variable turbulent convection on time scales longer than the pulsation cyclehas been proposed as a cause for the blazhko effect. we test this hypothesis tosome extent by using the derived variable depth-dependent microturbulentvelocity profiles to estimate their effect on the stellar magnitude. theseeffects turn out to be wavelength-dependent and much smaller than the observedlight variations over the blazhko cycle: if variations in the turbulent motionsare entirely responsible for the blazhko effect, they must surpass the scalescovered by the microturbulent velocity. this work demonstrates the possibilityof a self-consistent spectroscopic analysis over an entire pulsation cycleusing static atmosphere models, provided one takes into account certainfeatures of a rapidly pulsating atmosphere.

1411.5586	on the consistency of magnetic field measurements of ap stars: lessons  learned from the fors1 archive	context. the eso archive of fors1 spectropolarimetric observations may beused to create a homogeneous database of magnetic field measurements. however,no systematic comparison of fors field measurements to those obtained withother instruments has been undertaken so far. aims. we exploit the fors archiveof circular spectropolarimetric data to examine in a general way how reliableand accurate field detections obtained with fors are. methods. we examine theobservations of ap and bp stars, on the grounds that almost all of theunambiguous detections of magnetic fields in the fors1 archive are in thesekinds of stars. we assess the overall quality of the fors1 magnetic data byexamining the consistency of field detections with what is known from previousmeasurements obtained with other instruments, and we look at patterns ofinternal consistency. results. fors1 magnetic measurements are fully consistentwith those made with other instruments, and the internal consistency of thedata is excellent. however, it is important to recognise that each choice ofgrism and wavelength window constitutes a distinct instrumental measuringsystem, and that simultaneous field measurements in different instrumentalsystems may produce field strength values that differ up to 20 %, or more.furthermore, we found that field measurements using hydrogen lines only yieldresults that meaningfully reflect the field strength as sampled specifically bylines of hydrogen for stars with effective temperatures above about 9000 k.conclusions. in general the magnetic field measurements of ap and bp starsobtained with fors1 are of excellent quality, accuracy and precision, and fors1provides an extremely useful example that offers valuable lessons for fieldmeasurements with other low- resolution cassegrain spectropolarimeters.

1502.00779	a comprehensive and critical re-analysis of fors spectropolarimetric  observations: the case of hd92207	stellar spectropolarimetry has become extremely popular during the lastdecade, and has led to major advances in our understanding of stellar magneticfields and of their impact on stellar structure and evolution. many importantdiscoveries have been obtained thanks to observations performed with the forslow-resolution spectropolarimeters of the eso very large telescope. we firstreview and summarise the major results of a homogeneous re-reduction andanalysis of all single-slit fors1 spectropolarimetric observations. this workrevealed a non-negligible dependence of the results upon the adopted reductionand analysis procedure, as well as the presence of instabilities, revealingthat photon noise is not the only source of uncertainty. as a consequence ofour new analysis and assessment of the uncertainties, we are not able toconfirm a large number of magnetic field detections presented in the past for avariety of stars. we further summarise the results of fors2 spectropolarimetricobservations of the a0 supergiant hd92207 which allowed us to explore furtherthe nature of the instabilities, roughly constraining their maximum impact onthe derived stokes profiles and magnetic field values. we finally present newresults obtained with a further independent pipeline on the fors2 data ofhd92207, confirming our previous analysis, and discuss simple quality-checkcontrols which can be performed on the data in order to distinguish betweengenuine and spurious signals. all together, our results reveal that the forsspectropolarimeters are indeed reliable instruments, when their capabilitiesare not pushed beyond the limits of a cassegrain mounted low-resolutionspectrograph.

1503.06955	stellar wind induced soft x-ray emission from close-in exoplanets	in this paper, we estimate the x-ray emission from close-in exoplanets. weshow that the solar/stellar wind charge exchange mechanism (swcx) whichproduces soft x-ray emission is very effective for hot jupiters. in thismechanism, x-ray photons are emitted as a result of the charge exchange betweenheavy ions in the solar wind and the atmospheric neutral particles. in thesolar system, comets produce x-rays mostly through the swcx mechanism, but ithas also been shown to operate in the heliosphere, in the terrestrialmagnetosheath, and on mars, venus and moon. since the number of emitted photonsis proportional to the solar wind mass flux, this mechanism is not veryeffective for the solar system giants. here we present a simple estimate of thex-ray emission intensity that can be produced by close-in extrasolar giantplanets due to charge exchange with the heavy ions of the stellar wind. usingthe example of hd~209458b, we show that this mechanism alone can be responsiblefor an x-ray emission of $\approx 10^{22}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, which is $10^6$ timesstronger than the emission from the jovian aurora. we discuss also thepossibility to observe the predicted soft x-ray flux of hot jupiters and showthat despite high emission intensities they are unobservable with currentfacilities.

1505.02447	b fields in ob stars (bob): fors2 spectropolarimetric follow-up of the  two rare rigidly rotating magnetosphere stars hd23478 and hd345439	massive b-type stars with strong magnetic fields and fast rotation are veryrare and provide a mystery for theories of both star formation and magneticfield evolution. only two such stars, called sigma ori e analogs, werepreviously known. recently, a team involved in apogee, one of the sloan digitalsky survey iii programs, announced the discovery of two additional rigidlyrotating magnetosphere stars, hd23478 and hd345439. the presence of magneticfields in these newly discovered sigma ori e analogs was not investigated inthe past.  in the framework of our eso large programme, and one normal eso programme, wecarried out low-resolution fors2 spectropolarimetric observations of hd23478and hd345439.  from the measurements using hydrogen lines, we discover a rather stronglongitudinal magnetic field of the order of up to 1.5kg in hd23478, and up to1.3kg using the entire spectrum. the analysis of hd345439 using four subsequentspectropolarimetric subexposures does not reveal the presence of a magneticfield at a significance level of 3sigma. on the other hand, the inspection ofindividual subexposures indicates that hd345439 may host a strong magneticfield, rapidly varying over 88 minutes. a hint at the fast rotation of hd345439is also given by the behaviour of several metallic and he i lines in thelow-resolution fors2 spectra, showing profile variations already on such ashort time scale.

1507.03591	b fields in ob stars (bob): detection of a strong magnetic field in the  o9.7 v star hd54879	the number of magnetic stars detected among massive stars is small;nevertheless, the role played by the magnetic field in stellar evolution cannotbe disregarded. links between line profile variability, enhancements/depletionsof surface chemical abundances, and magnetic fields have been identified forlow-mass b-stars, but for the o-type domain this is almost unexplored. based onfors2 and harps spectropolarimetric data, we present the first detection of amagnetic field in hd54879, a single slowly rotating o9.7 v star. using twoindependent and different techniques we obtained the firm detection of asurface average longitudinal magnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about600 g, in modulus. a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the star with thestellar atmosphere code fastwind results in an effective temperature and asurface gravity of 33000$\pm1000$ k and 4.0$\pm0.1$ dex. the abundances ofcarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium are found to be slightly lowerthan solar, but compatible within the errors. we investigate line-profilevariability in hd54879 by complementing our spectra with spectroscopic datafrom other recent ob-star surveys. the photospheric lines remain constant inshape between 2009 and 2014, although h$\alpha$ shows a variable emission. theh$\alpha$ emission is too strong for a standard o9.7 v and is probably linkedto the magnetic field and the presence of circumstellar material. its normalchemical composition and the absence of photospheric line profile variationsmake hd54879 the most strongly magnetic, non-variable single o-star detected todate.

1508.00750	b fields in ob stars (bob): low-resolution fors2 spectropolarimetry of  the first sample of 50 massive stars	within the context of the collaboration "b fields in ob stars (bob)", we usedthe fors2 low-resolution spectropolarimeter to search for a magnetic field in50 massive stars, including two reference magnetic massive stars. because ofthe many controversies of magnetic field detections obtained with the forsinstruments, we derived the magnetic field values with two completelyindependent reduction and analysis pipelines. we compare and discuss theresults obtained from the two pipelines. we obtained a general good agreement,indicating that most of the discrepancies on magnetic field detections reportedin the literature are caused by the interpretation of the significance of theresults (i.e., 3-4 sigma detections considered as genuine, or not), instead ofby significant differences in the derived magnetic field values. by combiningour results with past fors1 measurements of hd46328, we improve the estimate ofthe stellar rotation period, obtaining p = 2.17950+/-0.00009 days. forhd125823, our fors2 measurements do not fit the available magnetic field model,based on magnetic field values obtained 30 years ago. we repeatedly detect amagnetic field for the o9.7v star hd54879, the hd164492c massive binary, andthe he-rich star cpd -57 3509. we obtain a magnetic field detection rate of6+/-4%, while by considering only the apparently slow rotators we derive adetection rate of 8+/-5%, both comparable with what was previously reported byother similar surveys. we are left with the intriguing result that, althoughthe large majority of magnetic massive stars is rotating slowly, our detectionrate is not a strong function of the stellar rotational velocity.

1508.03839	the fors1 catalogue of stellar magnetic field measurements	the fors1 instrument on the eso very large telescope was used to obtainlow-resolution circular polarised spectra of nearly a thousand different stars,with the aim of measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields. a catalogueof fors1 magnetic measurements would provide a valuable resource with which tobetter understand the strengths and limitations of this instrument and ofsimilar low-dispersion, cassegrain spectropolarimeters. however, fors1 datareduction has been carried out by a number of different groups using a varietyof reduction and analysis techniques. our understanding of the instrument andour data reduction techniques have both improved over time. a full re-analysisof fors1 archive data using a consistent and fully documented algorithm wouldoptimise the accuracy and usefulness of a catalogue of field measurements.based on the eso fors pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedurefor magnetic field determinations, which includes self-consistent checks forfield detection reliability. we have applied our procedure to the full contentof circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive. we haveproduced a catalogue of spectro-polarimetric observations and magnetic fieldmeasurements for about 1400 observations of about 850 different objects. thespectral type of each object has been accurately classified. we have also beenable to test different methods for data reduction is a systematic way. theresulting catalogue has been used to produce an estimator for an upper limit tothe uncertainty in a field strength measurement of an early type star as afunction of the signal-to-noise ratio of the observation. while fors1 is notnecessarily an optimal instrument for the discovery of weak magnetic fields, itis very useful for the systematic study of larger fields, such as those foundin ap/bp stars and in white dwarfs.

1509.05805	blue supergiants as descendants of magnetic main sequence stars	about 10$\%$ of the massive main sequence stars have recently been found tohost a strong, large scale magnetic field. both, the origin and theevolutionary consequences of these fields are largely unknown. we argue thatthese fields may be sufficiently strong in the deep interior of the stars tosuppress convection near the outer edge of their convective core. we performedparametrised stellar evolution calculations and assumed a reduced size of theconvective core for stars in the mass range 16 m$_{\odot}$ to 28 m$_{\odot}$from the zero age main sequence until core carbon depletion. we find that suchmodels avoid the coolest part of the main sequence band, which is usuallyfilled by evolutionary models that include convective core overshooting.furthermore, our `magnetic' models populate the blue supergiant region duringcore helium burning, i.e., the post-main sequence gap left by ordinary singlestar models, and some of them end their life in a position near that of theprogenitor of supernova 1987a in the hr diagram. further effects include astrongly reduced luminosity during the red supergiant stage, and downward shiftof the limiting initial mass for white dwarf and neutron star formation.

1510.04691	a bimodal correlation between host star chromospheric emission and the  surface gravity of hot jupiters	the chromospheric activity index logr'hk of stars hosting transiting hotjupiters appears to be correlated with the planets' surface gravity. one of thepossible explanations is based on the presence of condensations of planetaryevaporated material located in a circumstellar cloud that absorbs the caii h&amp;kand mgii h&amp;k resonance line emission flux, used to measure chromosphericactivity. a larger column density in the condensations, or equivalently astronger absorption in the chromospheric lines, is obtained when theevaporation rate of the planet is larger, which occurs for a lower gravity ofthe planet. we analyze here a sample of stars hosting transiting hot jupiterstuned in order to minimize systematic effects (e.g., interstellar mediumabsorption). using a mixture model, we find that the data are best fit by atwo-linear-regression model. we interpret this result in terms of thevaughan-preston gap. we use a monte carlo approach to best take into accountthe uncertainties, finding that the two intercepts fit the observed peaks ofthe distribution of logr'hk for main-sequence solar-like stars. we also findthat the intercepts are correlated with the slopes, as predicted by the modelbased on the condensations of planetary evaporated material. our findings bringfurther support to this model, although we cannot firmly exclude differentexplanations. a precise determination of the slopes of the two linearcomponents would allow one to estimate the average effective stellar fluxpowering planetary evaporation, which can then be used for theoreticalpopulation and evolution studies of close-in planets.

1511.06134	accuracy of atmospheric parameters of fgk dwarfs determined by spectrum  fitting	we performed extensive tests of the accuracy of atmospheric parameterdetermination for fgk stars based on the spectrum fitting procedurespectroscopy made easy (sme). our stellar sample consists of 13 objects,including the sun, in the temperature range 5000--6600~k and metallicity range-1.4 -- +0.4. the analysed stars have the advantage of having parametersderived by interferometry. for each star we use spectra obtained with differentspectrographs and different signal-to-noise ratios (s/n). for the fitting weadopted three different sets of constraints and test how the derived parametersdepend upon the spectral regions (masks) used in sme. we developed andimplemented in sme a new method for estimating uncertainties in the resultingparameters based on fitting residuals, partial derivatives, and datauncertainties. for stars in the 5700--6600 k range the best agreement with theeffective temperatures derived by interferometry is achieved when spectrumfitting includes the h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ lines, while for cooler stars thechoice of the mask does not affect the results. the derived atmosphericparameters do not strongly depend on spectral resolution and s/n of theobservations, while the uncertainties in temperature and surface gravityincrease with increasing effective temperature, with minima at 50~k in teff and0.1~dex in log g, for spectra with s/n=150--200. a nlte analysis of thetii/tiii and fei/feii ionisation equilibria and abundances determined from theatomic ci (nlte) and molecular ch species supports the parameters we derivedwith sme by fitting the observed spectra including the hydrogen lines.

1512.00552	far-uv spectroscopy of the planet-hosting star wasp-13: high-energy  irradiance, distance, age, planetary mass-loss rate, and circumstellar  environment	several transiting hot jupiters orbit relatively inactive main-sequencestars. for some of those, the logr'hk activity parameter lies below the basallevel (-5.1). two explanations have been proposed so far: (i) the planetaffects the stellar dynamo, (ii) the logr'hk measurements are biased byextrinsic absorption, either by the interstellar medium (ism) or by materiallocal to the system. we present here hubble space telescope/cos far-uv spectraof wasp-13, which hosts an inflated hot jupiter and has a measured logr'hkvalue (-5.26), well below the basal level. from the star's spectral energydistribution we obtain an extinction e(b-v) = 0.045+/-0.025 mag and a distanced = 232+/-8 pc. we detect at &gt;4 sigma lines belonging to three differentionization states of carbon (c1, c2, and c4) and the si4 doublet at ~3 sigma.using far-uv spectra of nearby early g-type stars of known age, we derive ac4/c1 flux ratio-age relation, from which we estimate wasp-13's age to be5.1+/-2.0 gyr. we rescale the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match theflux of the c4 1548 doublet. by integrating the rescaled solar spectrum, weobtain an xuv flux at 1 au of 5.4 erg s^-1 cm^-2. we use a detailed model ofthe planet's upper atmosphere, deriving a mass-loss rate of 1.5x10^11 g s^-1.despite the low logr'hk value, the star shows a far-uv spectrum typical ofmiddle-aged solar-type stars, pointing toward the presence of significantextrinsic absorption. the analysis of a high-resolution spectrum of the ca2h&amp;klines indicates that the ism absorption could be the origin of the low logr'hkvalue. nevertheless, the large uncertainty in the ca2 ism abundance does notallow us to firmly exclude the presence of circumstellar gas.

0706.0330	searching for links between magnetic fields and stellar evolution. ii.  the evolution of magnetic fields as revealed by observations of ap stars in  open clusters and associations	the evolution of magnetic fields in ap stars during the main sequence phaseis presently mostly unconstrained by observation because of the difficulty ofassigning accurate ages to known field ap stars.  we are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster ap starswith the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages.in this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as itcurrently stands.  we select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably(1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic ap stars. for the stars inthis subsample we determine the fundamental parameters t_eff, log(l/l_o), andm/m_o. with these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age andfractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). for thispurpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for ap stars.  magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of ap stars from the zams to thetams. statistically for the stars with m &gt; 3 m_o the fields decline withadvancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together withincreased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a timescale of about 3 10^7 yr. in contrast, lower mass stars show no compellingevidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.  study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtainingconstraints on evolution of ap stars through the main sequence. enlarging thesample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise rms fields,will help to clarify the results obtained so far. further field observationsare in progress.
