0902.3016	21-cm absorbers at intermediate redshifts	damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) seen in the spectra of high-z qsos allow usto probe the physical conditions in protogalaxies. our understanding ofphysical conditions in dlas at high-z is primarily based on the absorptionlines of h_2 molecules and fine-structure transitions. another important way ofprobing the thermal state of interstellar medium in these systems is bystudying the 21-cm absorption in the spectra of background quasars. here wereport the main results of our gmrt survey to search for 21-cm absorption in arepresentative and unbiased sample of 35 dla candidates at 1.10&lt;z&lt;1.45. oursample of dla candidates is drawn from the strong mgii systems in sdss dr5 andhas resulted in discovery of 9 new 21-cm absorbers. prior to our survey onlyone 21-cm absorber was known in the redshift range: 0.7&lt;z&lt;2. this survey hasallowed us to investigate the dependence of detectability of 21-cm absorptionon the properties of uv absorption lines detected in sdss spectra and estimatethe number per unit redshift of 21-cm absorbers. our gmrt survey provides arepresentative sample of systems that can be used in combination with variousfollow-up observations: (1) for investigating the physical conditions in theabsorbing gas using spin temperature measurements, (2) for investigating theeffect of metallicity and dust content on the detectability of 21-cmabsorption, (3) for studying the morphology of the absorbing gas and (4) forprobing the time evolution of various fundamental constants. results from thefirst phase of our survey are presented in gupta et al. (2007). detaileddescription of the entire sample and results from the survey are presented ingupta et al. (2009).

0904.2878	a complete sample of 21-cm absorbers at z~1.3: giant metrewave radio  telescope survey using mgii systems	we present the results of a systematic giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt)survey of 21-cm absorption in a representative and unbiased sample of 35 strongmgii systems in the redshift range: zabs~1.10-1.45, 33 of which have w_r&gt;1 \aa.the survey using ~400hrs of telescope time has resulted in 9 new 21-cmdetections and stringent 21-cm optical depth upper limits (median 3-sigmaoptical depth per 10 km/s of 0.017) for the remaining 26 systems. this is byfar the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey ofintervening absorbers. prior to our survey no intervening 21-cm system wasknown in the above redshift range and only one system was known in the redshiftrange 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5. we discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cmabsorption and various properties of uv absorption lines. we show that if mgiisystems are selected with the following criteria, mgii doublet ratio &lt;1.3 andw_r(mgi)/w_r(mgii)&gt;0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90% canbe achieved. we estimate n_{21}, the number per unit redshift of 21-cmabsorbers with w_r(mg(ii)&gt;w_o and integrated optical depth tau_{21}&gt;tau_o andshow that n_{21} decreases with increasing redshift. in particular, for w_o=1.0\aa and tau_o&gt;0.3 km\s, n_{21} falls by a factor 4 from &lt;z&gt;=0.5 to &lt;z&gt;=1.3. theevolution seems to be stronger for stronger mgii systems. using a subsample ofsystems for which high frequency vlba images are available, we show that theeffect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and ismost probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor inmgii systems. we find no correlation between the velocity spread of the 21-cmabsorption feature and w_r(mgii) at z~1.3.

0906.1585	diffuse molecular gas at high redshift: detection of co molecules and  the 2175 {\aa} dust feature at z=1.64	we present the detection of carbon monoxide molecules (co) at z=1.6408towards the quasar sdssj160457.50+220300.5 using the vlt ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph. co absorption is detected in at least two components inthe first six a-x bands and one d-x(5-0) inter-band system. this is the seconddetection of this kind along a quasar line of sight. the co absorption profilesare well modelled assuming a rotational excitation of co in the range 6&lt;tex&lt;16k, which is consistent with or higher than the temperature of the cmb radiationat this redshift. we derive a total co column density of n(co)=4e14 cm^-2. themeasured column densities of si, mgi, znii, feii and siii indicate a dustdepletion pattern typical of cold gas in the galactic disc. the backgroundquasar spectrum is significantly reddened (u-k~4.5 mag) and presents apronounced 2175 a dust absorption feature at the redshift of the co absorber.using a control sample of ~500 quasars we find the chance probability for thisfeature to be spurious is ~0.3%. we show that the sed of the quasar is wellfitted with a qso composite spectrum reddened with a lmc supershell extinctionlaw at the redshift of the absorber. it is noticeable that this quasar isabsent from the colour-selected sdss quasar sample. this demonstrates ourcurrent view of the universe may be biased against dusty sightlines. thesedirect observations of carbonaceous molecules and dust open up the possibilityof studying physical conditions and chemistry of diffuse molecular gas in highredshift galaxies.

0907.1057	physical conditions in high-redshift grb-dla absorbers observed with  vlt/uves: implications for molecular hydrogen searches	we aim to understand the nature of the absorbing neutral gas in the galaxieshosting high-redshift long-duration grbs and to determine their physicalconditions. we report the detection of a significant number of previouslyunidentified allowed transition lines of fe+, involving the fine structure ofthe ground term and that of other excited levels, from the zabs=3.969, logn(h0)=22.10 dla system located in the host galaxy of grb 050730. thetime-dependent evolution of the observed fe+ energy-level populations ismodelled by assuming the excitation mechanism is fluorescence followingexcitation by ultraviolet photons. this uv pumping model successfullyreproduces the observations, yielding a burst/cloud distance (defined to thenear-side of the cloud) of d=440\pm 30 pc and a linear cloud size ofl=520{+240}{-190} pc. we discuss these results in the context of no detectionsof h2 and ci lines in a sample of seven z&gt;1.8 grb host galaxies observed withvlt/uves. we show that the lack of h2 can be explained by the lowmetallicities, [x/h]&lt;-1, low depletion factors and, at most, moderate particledensities of the systems. this points to a picture where grb-dlas typicallyexhibiting very high h0 column densities are diffuse metal-poor atomic cloudswith high kinetic temperatures, tkin&gt;~1000 k, and large physical extents,l&gt;~100 pc. the properties of grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolutiontowards bright grb afterglows differ markedly from the high metal and dustcontents of grb-dlas observed at lower resolution. this difference likelyresults from the effect of a bias, against systems of high metallicity and/orclose to the grb, due to dust obscuration in the magnitude-limited grbafterglow samples observed with high-resolution spectrographs.

0908.1574	evolution of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas from sloan  digital sky survey ii - data release 7	we present the results of a search for damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems inthe sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss), data release 7. we use a fullyautomatic procedure to identify dlas and derive their column densities. theprocedure is checked against the results of previous searches for dlas in sdss.we discuss the agreements and differences and show the robustness of ourprocedure. for each system, we obtain an accurate measurement of the absorber'sredshift, the hi column density and the equivalent width of associated metalabsorption lines, without any human intervention. we find 1426 absorbers with2.15 &lt; z &lt; 5.2 with log n(hi)&gt;=20, out of which 937 systems have log n(hi)&gt;=20.3. this is the largest dla sample ever built, made available to thescientific community through the electronic version of this paper. in thecourse of the survey, we discovered the intervening dla with highest hi columndensity known to date with log n(hi)=22.0+/-0.1. this single system provides astrong constraint on the high-end of the n(hi) frequency distribution nowmeasured with high accuracy. we show that the presence of a dla at the blue endof a qso spectrum can lead to important systematic errors and propose a methodto avoid them. this has important consequences for the measurement of thecosmological mass density of neutral gas at z~2.2 and therefore on ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution over the past 10 billion years.

0908.3893	uncovering strong mgii absorbing galaxies: imaging below the lyman limit	the nature of the galaxies that give rise to absorption lines, such as dampedlyman-alpha systems (dlas) or strong mgii lines, in quasar spectra is difficultto investigate in emission. taking advantage of the total absorption of the qsolight bluewards of the lyman limit of two dlas at z&gt;3.4, we look for thecontinuum emission from intervening galaxies at z~2 that are identified viastrong metal absorption lines. the mgii absorbers have equivalent width largeenough to be potential dla systems. deep images are obtained with the focalreducer and spectrograph (fors1) on the very large telescope for the fieldstowards sdss j110855+120953 and sdss j140850+020522. these quasars have mgiiabsorption lines at z=1.87 (w_r(mgii)=2.46 a) and z=1.98 (w_r(mgii)=1.89 a),respectively, and each qso has two intervening higher redshift dlas at z&gt;3. theu and r bands of fors1 lie blue and redwards of the lyman limit of thebackground dlas, allowing us to search for emission from the foregroundgalaxies directly along the lines of sight to the qsos. no galaxies are foundclose to the sight line of the qso to a point source limit of u_ab=28.0. inboth fields, the closest objects lie at an impact parameter of 5 arcseccorresponding to 40 kpc in projection at z=2, and have typical colours of starforming galaxies at that redshift. however, the currently available data do notallow us to confirm if the galaxies lie at the same redshifts as the absorptionsystems. a more extended structure is visible in the sdss j14085+020522 fieldat an impact parameter of 0.8 arcsec or 7 kpc. if these objects are at z~2their luminosities are 0.03-0.04 l* in both fields. the star formation ratesestimated from the uv flux are 0.5-0.6 m_sun yr^-1.

0909.0464	optical identification of xmm sources in the cfhtls	we present optical spectroscopic identifications of x-ray sources in ~3square degrees of the xmm-large scale structure survey (xmm-lss), also coveredby the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls), obtained with theaaomega instrument at the anglo australian telescope. in a flux limited sampleof 829 point like sources in the optical band with g' &lt;~22 mag and the 0.5-2kev flux &gt; 1x10^{-15}erg/cm^2/s, we observed 695 objects and obtained reliablespectroscopic identification for 489 sources, ~59% of the overall sample. wetherefore increase the number of identifications in this field by a factorclose to five. galactic stellar sources represent about 15% of the total(74/489). about 55% (267/489) are broad-line active galactic nuclei (agns)spanning redshifts between 0.15 and 3.87 with a median value of 1.68. theoptical-to-x-ray spectral index of the broad-line agns is 1.47, typical ofoptically-selected type i quasars and is found to correlate with the rest framex-ray and optical monochromatic luminosities at 2 kev and 2500 angstromsrespectively. consistent with previous studies, we find alpha_ox not to becorrelated with z. in addition, 32 and 116 x-ray sources are, respectivelyabsorption and emission-line galaxies at z&lt;0.76. from a line ratio diagnosticdiagram it is found that in about 50% of these emission line galaxies, theemission lines are powered significantly by the agn. thirty of the xmm sourcesare detected at one or more radio frequencies. in addition, 24 sources haveambiguous identification: in 8 cases, two xmm sources have a single opticalsource within 6 arcsecs of each of them, whereas, 2 and 14 xmm sources have,respectively, 3 and 2 possible optical sources within 6 arcsecs of each ofthem.

0910.3770	qso selection and photometric redshifts with neural networks	baryonic acoustic oscillations (bao) and their effects on the matter powerspectrum can be studied by using the lyman-alpha absorption signature of thematter density field along quasar (qso) lines of sight. a measurementsufficiently accurate to provide useful cosmological constraints requires theobservation of ~100000 quasars in the redshift range 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5 over ~8000 deg2.such a survey is planned by the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)project of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii).in practice, one needs astellar rejection of more than two orders of magnitude with a selectionefficiency for quasars better than 50% up to magnitudes as large as g ~ 22. toobtain an appropriate target list and estimate quasar redshifts, we havedeveloped an artificial neural networks (nn) with a multilayer perceptronarchitecture. the input variables are photometric measurements, i.e. the objectmagnitudes and their errors in the five bands (ugriz) of the sdss photometry.for target selection, we achieve a non-quasar point-like object rejection of99.6% and 98.5% for a quasar efficiency of, respectively, 50% and 85%. thephotometric redshift precision is of the order of 0.1 over the region relevantfor bao studies.

1002.2107	hd molecules at high redshift: the absorption system at z=2.3377 towards  q 1232+082	we present a detailed analysis of the h_2 and hd absorption lines detected inthe damped lyman-alpha (dla) system at z_abs=2.3377 towards the quasarq1232+082. we show that this intervening cloud has a covering factor smallerthan unity and covers only part of the qso broad emission line region. the zeroflux level has to be corrected at the position of the saturated h_2 andoptically thin hd lines by about 10%. we accurately determine the dopplerparameter for hd and ci lines (b = 1.86+/-0.20 km/s). we find a ration(hd)/n(h_2)=(7.1 +3.7 -2.2)x10^-5 that is significantly higher than what isobserved in molecular clouds of the galaxy. chemical models suggest that in thephysical conditions prevailing in the central part of molecular clouds,deuterium and hydrogen are mostly in their molecular forms. assuming this istrue, we derive d/h = (3.6 +1.9 -1.1)x10^-5. this implies that thecorresponding baryon density of the universe is \omega_b h^2 = (0.0182 +0.0047-0.0042). this value coincides within 1\sigma with that derived fromobservations of the cmbr as well as from observations of the d/h atomic ratioin low-metallicity qso absorption line systems. the observation of hd at highredshift is therefore a promising independent method to constrain \omega_b.this observation indicates as well a low astration factor of deuterium. thiscan be interpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gasonto the associated galaxy.

1002.4620	detection of 21-cm, h2 and deuterium absorption at z&gt;3 along the  line-of-sight to j1337+3152	we report the detection of 21-cm and h2 absorption lines in the same dlasystem (log n(hi)=21.36+-0.10) at zabs=3.17447 towards sdssj133724+315254(z=3.174). we estimate the spin temperature of the gas to be, ts~600 k,intermediate between the expected values for cold and warm neutral media. thissuggests that the hi absorption originates from a mixture of different phases.the total molecular fraction is low, f=10^-7, and h2 rotational levelpopulations are not in equilibrium. the average abundance of the alpha-elementsis, [s/h]=-1.45. n and fe are found underabundant with respect toalpha-elements by ~1.0 dex and ~0.5 dex respectively. using photoionizationmodels we conclude that the gas is located more than 270 kpc away from the qso.while the position of 21-cm absorption line coincides with the h2 velocityprofile, their centroid are shifted by 2.7+-1.0 km/s from each other. however,the position of the strongest metal absorption component matches the positionof the 21-cm absorption line within 0.5 km/s. from this, we constrain thevariation of the combination of fundamental constants x=alpha^2 gp/mu, deltax/x=-(1.7+-1.7)x10^-6. this system is unique as we can at the same time have anindependent constrain on mu using h2 lines. however only werner band absorptionlines are seen and the range of sensitivity coefficients is too narrow toprovide a stringent constraint: delta mu/mu &lt;= 4.0x10^-4. the vlt/uves spectrumreveals another dla at zabs=3.16768 with log n(hi)=20.41+-0.15 and lowmetallicity, [si/h]=-2.68+-0.11. we derive log n(di)/n(hi)=-(4.93+-0.15) inthis system. this is a factor of two smaller than the value expected from thebest fitted value of omega_b from the wmap 5 yr data. this confirms thepresence of astration of deuterium even at very low metallicity.

0707.4479	excitation mechanisms in newly discovered h2-bearing damped lyman-alpha  clouds: systems with low molecular fractions	we probe the physical conditions in high-redshift damped ly-alpha systemsusing the observed molecular fraction and the rotational excitation ofmolecular hydrogen. we report two new detections of h2 at z = 2.402 and 1.989toward, respectively, he 0027-1836 and he 2318-1107. we also present a detailedanalysis of our recent h2 detection toward q2343+125. all three systems havelow molecular fractions, log f &lt; -4, with f = 2n(h2)/(2n(h2) + n(hi)). only onesuch h2 system was known previously. the depletion patterns for si, s, ti, cr,mn, fe and ni in the three systems are found to be very similar to what isobserved in diffuse gas of the galactic halo. h2 absorption from rotationallevels up to j = 5 is observed in a single component toward he 0027-1836. weshow that the width (doppler parameter) of the h2 lines increases withincreasing j and that the kinetic energy derived from the doppler parameter islinearly dependent on the relative energy of the rotational levels. theexcitation temperature is found to be 90 k for j = 0 to j = 2 and ~500 k forhigher j levels. single isothermal pdr models fail to reproduce the observedrotational excitations. a two-component model is needed: one component of lowdensity (~50 cm-3) with weak illumination (chi = 1) to explain the j &lt;= 2rotational levels and another of high density (~500 cm-3) with strongillumination (chi = 30) for j &gt;= 3 levels. however, the juxtaposition of thesetwo pdr components may be ad-hoc and the multicomponent structure could resulteither from turbulent dissipation or c-shocks.

1005.3028	the vlt lbg redshift survey i: clustering and dynamics of ~1000 galaxies  at z~3	we present the initial imaging and spectroscopic data acquired as part of thevlt vimos lyman-break galaxy survey. ubr (or ubvi) imaging covers five 36'x36'fields centred on bright z&gt;3 qsos, allowing ~21,000 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 galaxy candidatesto be selected using the lyman-break technique. we performed spectroscopicfollow-up using vimos, measuring redshifts for 1020 z&gt;2 lbgs and 10 z&gt;2 qsosfrom a total of 19 vimos pointings. from the galaxy spectra, we observe a625+-510 km/s velocity offset between the ism absorption and ly-alpha emissionline redshifts. using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we haveanalysed the galaxy clustering at z~3. in the photometric case, the angularcorrelation function, w(theta), is well fit by a double power-law withclustering scale-length, r_0 = 3.19+0.32-0.54 mpc/h for r &lt; 1 mpc/h and r_0 =4.59+0.31-0.33 mpc/h at larger scales. using the redshift sample we estimatethe semi-projected correlation function, w_p(sigma) and find r_0 =3.67+0.23-0.24 mpc/h for the vlt sample and r_0 = 3.98+0.14-0.15 mpc/h for acombined vlt+keck sample. from the z-space correlation functions and assumingthe above xi(r) models, we find that the combined vlt and keck surveys requirea galaxy velocity dispersion, &lt;w_z^2&gt;^1/2 ~ 700 km/s, higher than the ~400 km/sfound by previous authors. we also measure a value for the gravitational growthrate parameter of beta(z=3) = 0.48+-0.17, implying a low value for the bias ofb = 2.06+1.1-0.5. this value is consistent with the galaxy clustering amplitudewhich gives b = 2.22+-0.16, assuming the standard cosmology, implying that theevolution of the gravitational growth rate is also consistent with einsteingravity. we have compared our lbg clustering amplitudes with lower redshiftmeasurements and find that the clustering strength is not inconsistent withthat of low-redshift l* spirals for simple 'long-lived' galaxy models.

1006.4385	vlt lbg redshift survey ii: interactions between galaxies and the igm at  z ~3	we have measured redshifts for 243 z ~3 quasars in nine vlt vimos lbgredshift survey areas, each of which is centred on a known bright quasar. usingspectra of these quasars, we measure the cross-correlation between neutralhydrogen gas causing the lya forest and 1020 lyman-break galaxies at z ~3. wefind an increase in neutral hydrogen absorption within 5 h^-1 mpc of a galaxyin agreement with the results of adelberger et al. (2003, 2005). the lya-lbgcross-correlation can be described by a power-law on scales larger than 3 h^-1mpc. when galaxy velocity dispersions are taken into account our results atsmaller scales (&lt;2 h^-1 mpc) are also in good agreement with the results ofadelberger et al. (2005). there is little immediate indication of a region witha transmission spike above the mean igm value which might indicate the presenceof star-formation feedback. to measure the galaxy velocity dispersions, whichinclude both intrinsic lbg velocity dispersion and redshift errors, we haveused the lbg-lbg redshift space distortion measurements of bielby et al.(2010). we find that the redshift-space transmission spike implied in theresults of adelberger et al. (2003) is too narrow to be physical in thepresence of the likely lbg velocity dispersion and is likely to be astatistical fluke. nevertheless, neither our nor previous data can rule out thepresence of a narrow, real-space transmission spike, given the evidence of theincreased lya absorption surrounding lbgs which can mask the spike's presencewhen convolved with a realistic lbg velocity dispersion. finally, we identify176 civ systems in the quasar spectra and find an lbg-civ correlation strengthon scales of 10 h^-1 mpc consistent with the relation measured at ~mpc scales.

1009.1395	the lyman-alpha emission of high-z damped lyman-alpha systems	using a spectral stacking technique we searched for the average \lya emissionfrom high-z damped \lya (dla) galaxies detected in the sloan digital sky surveyqso spectra. we used a sample of 341 dlas of mean redshift &lt;z&gt;= 2.86 and logn(hi) &gt; 20.62 to place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 3.0 \times 10^{-18} ergs^{-1} cm^{-2} on the \lya flux emitted within $\sim$1.5 arcsec (or 12 kpc)from the qso line of sight. this corresponds to an average \lya luminosity of &lt;2 \times 10^{41} erg s^{-1} or 0.03 $l_\star$(\lya). this limit is deeper thanthe limit of most surveys for faint \lya emitters. the lack of \lya emission indlas is consistent with the in situ star formation, for a given n(hi), beingless efficient than what is seen in local galaxies. thus, the overall dlapopulation seems to originate from the low luminosity end of the high redshift\lya emitting galaxies and/or to be located far away from the star formingregions. the latter may well be true since we detect strong ovi absorption inthe stacked spectrum, indicating that dlas are associated with a highly ionizedphase possibly the relics of galactic winds and/or originating from coldaccretion flows. we find the contribution of dla galaxies to the global starformation rate density to be comparatively lower than that of lyman breakgalaxies.

1012.2391	variability selected high-redshift quasars on sdss stripe 82	the sdss-iii boss quasar survey will attempt to observe z&gt;2.15 quasars at adensity of at least 15 per square degree to yield the first measurement of thebaryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-alpha forest. to help reaching thisgoal, we have developed a method to identify quasars based on their variabilityin the u g r i z optical bands. the method has been applied to the selection ofquasar targets in the sdss region known as stripe 82 (the southern equatorialstripe), where numerous photometric observations are available over a 10-yearbaseline. this area was observed by boss during september and october 2010.only 8% of the objects selected via variability are not quasars, while 90% ofthe previously identified high-redshift quasar population is recovered. themethod allows for a significant increase in the z&gt;2.15 quasar density overprevious strategies based on optical (ugriz) colors, achieving a density of24.0 deg^{-2} on average down to g~22 over the 220 deg^2 area of stripe 82. weapplied this method to simulated data from the palomar transient factory andfrom pan-starrs, and showed that even with data that have sparser time samplingthan what is available in stripe 82, including variability in future quasarselection strategies would lead to increased target selection efficiency in thez&gt;2.15 redshift range. we also found that broad absorption line quasars arepreferentially present in a variability than in a color selection.

1012.2425	x-ray and optical properties of broad absorption line quasars in the  canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey	we study the x-ray and optical properties of 16 broad absorption line (bal)quasars detected in about 3 degree square region common to the wide synoptic(w-1) component of the canada-france-hawaiitelescope legacy survey (cfhtls) andthe xmm large scale structure survey (xmm-lss). the bal fraction is found to be10% in full sample, 7% for the optical colour selected qsos and as high as 33%if we consider qsos selected from their ir colours. the x-ray detected non-baland bal quasars have a mean observed x-ray-to-optical spectral slope of -1.47+/- 0.13 and -1.66 +/- 0.17 respectively. we also find that the bal qsos havealpha_ox systematically smaller than what is expected from the relationshipbetween optical luminosity and alpha_ox as derived from our sample. based onthis, we show, as already reported in the literature for quasars with highoptical luminosities, our new sample of bal qsos have x-ray luminosity a factorof three smaller than what has been found for non-bal qsos with similar opticalluminosities. comparison of hardness ratio of the bal and non-bal qsos suggestsa possible soft x-ray weakness of bal qsos. combining our sample, of relativelyfainter qsos, with others from the literature we show that larger balnicityindex (bi) and maximum velocity (v_max) of the c iv absorption are correlatedwith steeper x-ray to optical spectral index. we argue that this is most likelya consequence of the existence of a lower envelope in the distribution of bi(or v_max) values versus optical luminosity. our results thus show that thepreviously known x-ray weakness of bal qsos extends to lower opticalluminosities as well.

1104.2024	a principal component analysis of quasar uv spectra at z~3	from a principal component analysis (pca) of 78 z~3 high quality quasarspectra in the sdss-dr7, we derive the principal components characterizing theqso continuum over the full wavelength range available. the shape of the meancontinuum, is similar to that measured at low-z (z~1), but the equivalent widthof the emission lines are larger at low redshift. we calculate the correlationbetween fluxes at different wavelengths and find that the emission line fluxesin the red part of the spectrum are correlated with that in the blue part. weconstruct a projection matrix to predict the continuum in the lyman-$\alpha$forest from the red part of the spectrum. we apply this matrix to quasars inthe sdss-dr7 to derive the evolution with redshift of the mean flux in thelyman-$\alpha$ forest due to the absorption by the intergalactic neutralhydrogen. a change in the evolution of the mean flux is apparent around z~3 inthe sense of a steeper decrease of the mean flux at higher redshifts. the sameevolution is found when the continuum is estimated from the extrapolation of apower-law continuum fitted in the red part of the quasar spectrum if acorrection, derived from simple simulations, is applied. our findings areconsistent with previous determinations using high spectral resolution data. weprovide the pca eigenvectors over the wavelength range 1020-2000 \aa\ and thedistribution of their weights that can be used to simulate qso mock spectra.

1106.1706	the bigboss experiment	bigboss is a stage iv ground-based dark energy experiment to study baryonacoustic oscillations (bao) and the growth of structure with a wide-area galaxyand quasar redshift survey over 14,000 square degrees. it has beenconditionally accepted by noao in response to a call for major newinstrumentation and a high-impact science program for the 4-m mayall telescopeat kitt peak. the bigboss instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fedspectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelengthrange from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution r = 3000-4800.  using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopictargets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. inparticular, targets include luminous red galaxies (lrgs) up to z = 1.0,extending the boss lrg survey in both redshift and survey area. to probe theuniverse out to even higher redshift, bigboss will target bright [oii] emissionline galaxies (elgs) up to z = 1.7. in total, 20 million galaxy redshifts areobtained to measure the bao feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smallerscales, and detect redshift space distortions. bigboss will provide additionalconstraints on early dark energy and on the curvature of the universe bymeasuring the ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5quasars.  bigboss galaxy bao measurements combined with an analysis of the broadbandpower, including the ly-alpha forest in bigboss quasar spectra, achieves a fomof 395 with planck plus stage iii priors. this fom is based on conservativeassumptions for the analysis of broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could growto over 600 if current work allows us to push the analysis to higher wavenumbers (kmax = 0.3). bigboss will also place constraints on theories ofmodified gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses to0.024 ev accuracy.

1107.4808	partial coverage of the broad line region of q1232+082 by an intervening  h2-bearing cloud	we present a detailed analysis of the partial coverage of the q1232+082 (z_em=2.57) broad line region by an intervening h_2-bearing cloud at z_abs=2.3377.using curve of growth analysis and line profile fitting, we demonstrate thatthe h_2-bearing component of the cloud covers the qso intrinsic continuumsource completely but only part of the broad line region (blr). we find thatonly 48\pm6 % of the c iv blr emission is covered by the c i absorbing gas. weobserve residual light (~6 %) as well in the bottom of the o i {\lambda}1302absorption from the cloud, redshifted on top of the qso lyman-{\alpha} emissionline. therefore the extent of the neutral phase of the absorbing cloud is notlarge enough to cover all of the background source. the most likely explanationfor this partial coverage is the small size of the intervening cloud, which iscomparable to the blr size. we estimate the number densities in the cloud:n_h2~110 cm^{-3} for the h_2-bearing core and n_h ~30 cm^{-3} for the neutralenvelope. given the column densities, n(h2)=(3.71\pm0.97)\times10^19 cm^{-2}and n(h i)=(7.94\pm1.6)\times10^20 cm^{-2}, we derive the linear size of theh_2-bearing core and the neutral envelope along the line of sight to bel_h2~0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.05} pc and l_hi~8.2^{+6.5}_{-4.1} pc, respectively. weestimate the size of the c iv blr by two ways (i) extrapolating size-luminosityrelations derived from reverberation observations and (ii) assuming that theh_2-bearing core and the blr are spherical in shape and the results are ~0.26and ~0.18 pc, respectively. the large size we derive for the extent of theneutral phase of the absorbing cloud together with a covering factor of ~0.94of the lyman-{\alpha} emission means that the lyman-{\alpha} blr is probablyfully covered but that the lyman-{\alpha} emission extends well beyond thelimits of the blr.

1112.1438	search for cold gas in z&gt;2 damped lyman-alpha systems: 21-cm and h_2  absorption	(abridged) we present the results of a systematic gbt and gmrt survey for21-cm absorption in a sample of 10 dlas at 2&lt;z_abs&lt;3.4. analysis of l-band vlbaimages of the background qsos are also presented. we detect 21-cm absorption inonly one dla (at z_abs = 3.1745 towards j1337+3152). combining our data withthe data from the literature (a sample of 28 dlas) and assuming the measuredcore fraction at milliarcsecond scale to represent the gas covering factor, wefind that the hi gas in dlas at z&gt; 2 is predominantly constituted by wnm. thedetection rate of 21-cm absorption seems to be higher for systems with highern(hi) or metallicity. however, no clear correlation is found between theintegrated 21-cm optical depth (or spin temperature) and either n(hi),metallicity or velocity spread of the low ionization species. there are 13 dlasin our sample for which high resolution optical spectra covering the expectedwavelength range of h_2 absorption are available. we report the detection ofh_2 molecules in the z_abs = 3.3871 21-cm absorber towards j0203+1134 (pks0201+113). in 8 cases, neither h_2 nor 21-cm absorption are detected. the lackof 21-cm and h_2 absorption in these systems can be explained if most of the hiin these dlas originate from low density high temperature gas. in one case wehave a dla with 21-cm absorption not showing h_2 absorption. in two cases, bothspecies are detected but do not originate from the same velocity component. inthe remaining 2 cases 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence ofh_2 with evidence for the presence of cold gas. all this is consistent with theidea that the h_2 components seen in dlas are compact (with sizes of &lt; 15 pc)and contain only a small fraction (i.e typically &lt;10%) of the total n(hi)measured in the dlas.

1202.0280	discovery of a compact gas-rich dla galaxy at z = 2.2: evidences for a  starburst-driven outflow	we present the detection of ly-alpha, [oiii] and h-alpha emission associatedwith an extremely strong dla system (n(hi) = 10^22.10 cm^-2) at z=2.207 towardsthe quasar sdss j113520-001053. this is the largest hi column density evermeasured along a qso line of sight, though typical of what is seen in grb-dlas.this absorption system also classifies as ultrastrong mgii system withw2796_r=3.6 a. the mean metallicity of the gas ([zn/h]=-1.1) and dust depletionfactors ([zn/fe]=0.72, [zn/cr]=0.49) are consistent with (and only marginallylarger than) the mean values found in the general qso-dla population. the[oiii]-ha emitting region has a very small impact parameter with respect to theqso line of sight, b=0.1", and is unresolved. from the ha line, we measuresfr=25 msun/yr. the ly-a line is double-peaked and is spatially extended. morestrikingly, the blue and red ly-a peaks arise from distinct regions extendedover a few kpc on either side of the star-forming region. we propose that thisis the consequence of ly-a transfer in outflowing gas. the presence ofstarburst-driven outflows is also in agreement with the large sfr together witha small size and low mass of the galaxy (mvir~10^10 msun). from the stellar uvcontinuum luminosity of the galaxy, we estimate an age of at most a few 10^7yr, again consistent with a recent starburst scenario. we interpret the data asthe observation of a young, gas rich, compact starburst galaxy, from whichmaterial is expelled through collimated winds powered by the vigorous starformation activity. we substantiate this picture by modelling the radiativetransfer of ly-a photons in the galactic counterpart. though our model (aspherical galaxy with bipolar outflowing jets) is a simplistic representationof the true gas distribution and velocity field, the agreement between theobserved and simulated properties is particularly good.

1203.5306	the clustering of intermediate redshift quasars as measured by the  baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	we measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range2.2&lt;z&lt;2.8 using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we use ahomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopicredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements atthese redshifts to date. the sample covers 3,600 square degrees, correspondingto a comoving volume of 9.7(gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology,and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. afteraccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlationfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm0.5)mpc/h over the range 3&lt;s&lt;25mpc/h. the projected correlation function, whichintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)mpc/h over the range4&lt;r&lt;16mpc/h. there is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependenceto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range inour sample. our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previousmeasurements at similar redshifts. our measurement of the quasar clusteringamplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. we compare thedata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matterhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristicmass of &lt;m&gt;~10^{12}msun/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 percent.

1205.3777	deuterium at high-redshift: primordial abundance in the zabs = 2.621  damped ly-alpha system towards ctq247	the detection of neutral deuterium in the low-metallicity dampedlyman-{\alpha} system at zabs = 2.621 towards the quasar ctq247 is reported.using a high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution (r = 60000) spectrumfrom the very large telescope ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph, weprecisely measure the deuterium-to-oxygen ratio log n(di)/n(oi) = 0.74+/-0.04,as well as the overall oxygen abundance, log n(oi)/n(hi)=-5.29+/-0.10 (orequivalently [o/h]=-1.99+/-0.10 with respect to the solar value). assuminguniform metallicity throughout the system, our measurement translates to (d/h)= (2.8+0.8 -0.6)x10^-5. this ratio is consistent within errors (&lt;0.4sigma) withthe primordial ratio, (d/h)p = (2.59+/-0.15)x10^-5, predicted by standardbig-bang nucleosynthesis using the wmap7 value of the cosmological density ofbaryons (100 omega_b h^2 = 2.249+/-0.056). the di absorption lines are observedto be broader than the oi absorption lines. from a consistent fit of theprofiles we derive the turbulent broadening to be 5.2 km/s and the temperatureof the gas to be t = 8800+/-1500 k, corresponding to a warm neutral medium.

1205.4029	search for cold gas in strong mgii absorbers at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5: nature and  evolution of 21-cm absorbers	we report 4 new detections of 21-cm absorption from a systematic search of21-cm absorption in a sample of 17 strong (wr(mgii 2796)&gt;1a) intervening mgiiabsorbers at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5. we also present 20-cm milliarcsecond scale maps of 40quasars having 42 intervening strong mgii absorbers for which we have searchedfor 21-cm absorption. combining 21-cm absorption measurements for 50 strongmgii systems from our surveys with the measurements from literature, we obtaina sample of 85 strong mgii absorbers at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 and 1.1&lt;z&lt;1.5. we presentdetailed analysis of this sample, taking into account the effect of the varying21-cm optical depth sensitivity and covering factor associated with thedifferent quasar sight lines. we find that the 21-cm detection rate is highertowards the quasars with flat or inverted spectral index at cm wavelengths.about 70% of 21-cm detections are towards the quasars with linear size, ls&lt;100pc. the 21-cm absorption lines having velocity widths, deltav&gt;100 km/s aremainly seen towards the quasars with extended radio morphology at arcsecondscales. however, we do not find any correlation between the integrated 21-cmoptical depth or deltav with the ls measured from the milliarcsecond scaleimages. all this can be understood if the absorbing gas is patchy with atypical correlation length of ~30-100 pc. we show that within the measurementuncertainty, the 21-cm detection rate in strong mgii systems is constant over0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5, i.e., over ~30% of the total age of universe. we show that thedetection rate can be underestimated by up to a factor 2 if 21-cm opticaldepths are not corrected for the partial coverage estimated usingmilliarcsecond scale maps. since stellar feedback processes are expected todiminish the filling factor of cold neutral medium over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1, this lack ofevolution in the 21-cm detection rate in strong mgii absorbers is intriguing.[abridged]

1305.1884	the uves large program for testing fundamental physics: i bounds on a  change in alpha towards quasar he 2217-2818	absorption line systems detected in quasar spectra can be used to compare thevalue of the fine-structure constant, {\alpha}, measured today on earth withits value in distant galaxies. in recent years, some evidence has emerged ofsmall temporal and also spatial variations of {\alpha} on cosmological scaleswhich may reach a fractional level of ~ 10 ppm (parts per million). to testthese claims we are conducting a large program with the vlt uves . we areobtaining high-resolution (r ~ 60000 and high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 100)uves spectra calibrated specifically for this purpose. here we analyse thefirst complete quasar spectrum from this program, that of he 2217-2818. weapply the many multiplet method to measure {\alpha} in 5 absorption systemstowards this quasar: zabs = 0.7866, 0.9424, 1.5558, 1.6279 and 1.6919. the mostprecise result is obtained for the absorber at zabs = 1.6919 where 3 fe iitransitions and al ii {\lambda}1670 have high s/n and provide a wide range ofsensitivities to {\alpha}. the absorption profile is complex, with several verynarrow features, and requires 32 velocity components to be fitted to the data.our final result for the relative variation in {\alpha} in this system isdelta{\alpha}/{\alpha} = +1.3 +/- 2.4stat +/- 1.0sys ppm. this is one of thetightest current bounds on {\alpha} variation from an individual absorber. theabsorbers towards quasar he 2217-2818 reveal no evidence for variation in{\alpha} at the 3 ppm precision level (1{\sigma} confidence). if the recentlyreported 10 ppm dipolar variation of {\alpha} across the sky were correct, theexpectation at this sky position is (3.2-5.4) +/-1.7 ppm depending on dipolemodel used . our constraint of delta{\alpha}/{\alpha}=+1.3+/-2.4stat +/-1.0sysppm is not inconsistent with this expectation.

1307.5864	the uves large program for testing fundamental physics ii: constraints  on a change in {\mu} towards quasar he 0027-1836	we present an accurate analysis of the h2 absorption lines from the zabs ~2.4018 damped ly{\alpha} system towards he 0027-1836 observed with the verylarge telescope ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph (vlt/uves) as apart of the european southern observatory large programme "the uves largeprogramme for testing fundamental physics" to constrain the variation ofproton-to-electron mass ratio, {\mu} = mp/me. we perform cross-correlationanalysis between 19 individual exposures taken over three years and thecombined spectrum to check the wavelength calibration stability. we notice thepresence of a possible wavelength dependent velocity drift especially in thedata taken in 2012. we use available asteroids spectra taken with uves close toour observations to confirm and quantify this effect. we consider single andtwo component voigt profiles to model the observed h2 absorption profiles. weuse both linear regression analysis and voigt profile fitting where{\delta}{\mu}/{\mu} is explicitly considered as an additional fittingparameter. the two component model is marginally favored by the statisticalindicators and we get {\delta}{\mu}/{\mu} = (-2.5 +/- 8.1(stat) +/- 6.2(sys))ppm. when we apply the correction to the wavelength dependent velocity drift wefind {\delta}{\mu}/{\mu} = (-7.6 +/- 8.1(stat) +/- 6.3(sys)) ppm. it will beimportant to check the extent to which the velocity drift we notice in thisstudy is present in uves data used for previous {\delta}{\mu}/{\mu}measurements.

1308.0600	an investigation of the line of sight towards qso pks 0237-233	we present a detailed analysis of absorption systems along the line of sighttowards qso pks 0237-233 using a high resolution spectrum of signal-to-noiseratio (snr) ~ 60-80 obtained with the ultraviolet and visual echellespectrograph mounted on the very large telescope. this line of sight is knownto show a remarkable overdensity of civ systems that has been interpreted asrevealing the presence of a supercluster of galaxies. a detailed analysis ofeach of these absorption systems is presented. in particular, for the z_abs =1.6359 (with two components of logn(hi) = 18.45, 19.05) and z_abs = 1.6720(logn(h i) = 19.78) sub-damped ly-alpha systems (sub-dlas), we measure accurateabundances (resp. [o/h] = -1.63(0.07) and [zn/h] = - 0.57(0.05) relative tosolar). while the depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains in bothsub-dlas is not noteworthy, photoionization models show that ionization effectsare important in a part of the absorbing gas of the sub-dla at z_abs = 1.6359(hi is 95 percent ionized) and in part of the gas of the sub-dla at z_abs =1.6359. the civ clustering properties along the line of sight is studied inorder to investigate the nature of the observed overdensity. we conclude thatdespite the unusually high number of civ systems detected along the line ofsight, there is no compelling evidence for the presence of a single unusualoverdensity and that the situation is consistent with chance coincidence.

1309.5364	broad absorption line variability on multi-year timescales in a large  quasar sample	we present a detailed investigation of the variability of 428 c iv and 235 siiv broad absorption line (bal) troughs identified in multi-epoch observationsof 291 quasars by the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii/iii. these observationsprimarily sample rest-frame timescales of 1-3 yr over which significantrearrangement of the bal wind is expected. we derive a number of observationalresults on, e.g., the frequency of bal variability, the velocity range overwhich bal variability occurs, the primary observed form of bal-troughvariability, the dependence of bal variability upon timescale, the frequency ofbal strengthening vs. weakening, correlations between bal variability andbal-trough profiles, relations between c iv and si iv bal variability,coordinated multi-trough variability, and bal variations as a function ofquasar properties. we assess implications of these observational results forquasar winds. our results support models where most bal absorption is formedwithin an order-of-magnitude of the wind-launching radius, although asignificant minority of bal troughs may arise on larger scales. we estimate anaverage lifetime for a bal trough along our line-of-sight of a few thousandyears. bal disappearance and emergence events appear to be extremes of generalbal variability, rather than being qualitatively distinct phenomena. we derivethe parameters of a random-walk model for bal ew variability, finding that thismodel can acceptably describe some key aspects of ew variability. thecoordinated trough variability of bal quasars with multiple troughs suggeststhat changes in "shielding gas" may play a significant role in driving generalbal variability.

0801.4335	recovering the topology of the igm at z~2	we investigate how well the 3d density field of neutral hydrogen in theintergalactic medium (igm) can be reconstructed using the lyman-alphaabsorptions observed along lines of sight to quasars separated by arcmindistances in projection on the sky. we use cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations to compare the topologies of different fields: dark matter, gas andneutral hydrogen optical depth and to investigate how well the topology of theigm can be recovered from the wiener interpolation method implemented by pichonet al. (2001). the global statistical and topological properties of therecovered field are analyzed quantitatively through the power-spectrum, theprobability distribution function (pdf), the euler characteristics, itsassociated critical point counts and the filling factor of underdense regions.the local geometrical properties of the field are analysed using the localskeleton by defining the concept of inter-skeleton distance. at scales largerthan ~1.4 &lt;d_los&gt;, where &lt;d_los&gt; is the mean separation between lines of sight,the reconstruction accurately recovers the topological features of the largescale density distribution of the gas, in particular the filamentarystructures. at scales larger than the intrinsic smoothing length of theinversion procedure, the power spectrum of the recovered hi density fieldmatches well that of the original one and the low order moments of the pdf arewell recovered as well as the shape of the euler characteristic. the integralerrors on the pdf and the critical point counts are indeed small, less than 20%for &lt;d_los&gt;~2.5 arcmin. the small deviations between the reconstruction and theexact solution mainly reflect departures from the log-normal behaviour that areascribed to highly non-linear objects in overdense regions.

1310.5765	scaling the smoothness of the igm	we use, for the first time, the detrend fluctuation analysis (dfa) to studythe correlation properties of the transmitted flux fluctuations, in thelyman-$\alpha$ (ly$\alpha$) forest along the lines of sight (los) to qsos, atdifferent space scales. we consider in our analysis the transmitted flux in theintergalactic medium over the redshift range 2 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4.5 from asample of 45 high-quality medium resolution (r $\sim$ 4300) quasar spectraobtained with echelle spectrograph and imager (esi) mounted on the keck ii 10-mtelescope, and from a sample of 19 high-quality high resolution (r $\sim$50000) quasar spectra obtained with ultra-violet and visible echellespectrograh (uves) mounted on the eso kueyen 8.2 m telescope. the result of thedfa method applied to both datasets, shows that there exists a difference inthe correlation properties between the short and long-range regimes: the slopesof the transmitted flux fluctuation function are different on small and largescales. the scaling exponents, $\alpha_{1}$ = 1.635$\pm$ 0.115 and $\alpha_{2}$= 0.758$\pm$ 0.085 for the esi/keck sample and $\alpha_{1}$ = 1.763 $\pm 0.128$and $\alpha_{2}$ = 0.798 $\pm 0.084$ for the uves/vlt sample for the short andlong range regime respectively. the transition between the two regims isobserved at about $\sim 1.4 h^{-1} mpc$ (comoving). the fact that $\alpha_{1}$is always larger than $\alpha_{2}$ for each spectrum supports the common viewthat the universe is smoother on large scales than on small scales. the nondetection of considerable variations in the scaling exponents from los to losconfirms that anisotropies cannot be ubiquitous, at least on these scales.

1310.6280	fundamental constants and high resolution spectroscopy	absorption-line systems detected in high resolution quasar spectra can beused to compare the value of dimensionless fundamental constants such as thefine-structure constant, alpha, and the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu =m_p/m_e, as measured in remote regions of the universe to their value today onearth. in recent years, some evidence has emerged of small temporal and alsospatial variations in alpha on cosmological scales which may reach a fractionallevel of 10 ppm . we are conducting a large programme of observations with vltuves to explore these variations. we here provide a general overview of thelarge programme and report on the first results for these two constants,discussed in detail in molaro et al. and rahmani et al. a stringent bound fordelta(alpha)/alpha is obtained for the absorber at_abs = 1.6919 towards he2217-2818. the absorption profile is complex with several very narrow features,and is modeled with 32 velocity components. the relative variation in alpha inthis system is +1.3+-2.4_{stat}+-1.0_{sys} ppm if al ii lambda 1670aa and threefe ii transitions are used, and +1.1+-2.6_{stat} ppm in a lightly differentanalysis with only fe ii transitions used. the expectation at this sky positionof the recently-reported dipolar variation of alpha is (3.2--5.4)+-1.7 ppmdepending on dipole model. this constraint of delta(alpha)/alpha at face valueis not supporting this expectation but is not inconsistent with it at the 3sigma level. for the proton-to-electron mass ratio the analysis of the h_2absorption lines of the z_{abs}~2.4018 damped ly alpha system towards he 0027-1836 provides delta(mu)/mu = (-7.6 +- 8.1_{stat} +- 6.3_{sys}) ppm which isalso consistent with a null variation.

1402.2672	molecular hydrogen absorption systems in sloan digital sky survey	we present a systematic search for molecular hydrogen absorption systems athigh redshift in quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) iidata release 7 and sdss-iii data release 9. we have selected candidates using amodified profile fitting technique taking into account that the ly$\alpha$forest can effectively mimic h$_2$ absorption systems at the resolution of sdssdata. to estimate the confidence level of the detections, we use two methods: amonte-carlo sampling and an analysis of control samples. the analysis ofcontrol samples allows us to define regions of the spectral quality parameterspace where h$_2$ absorption systems can be confidently identified. we findthat h$_2$ absorption systems with column densities $\log {\rm n_{h_2}} &gt; 19$can be detected in only less than 3% of sdss quasar spectra. we estimate theupper limit on the detection rate of saturated h$_2$ absorption systems ($\log{\rm n_{h_2}} &gt; 19$) in damped ly-$\alpha$ (dla) systems to be about 7%. weprovide a sample of 23 confident h$_2$ absorption system candidates that wouldbe interesting to follow up with high resolution spectrographs. there is a1$\sigma$ $r-i$ color excess and non-significant $a_{\rm v}$ extinction excessin quasar spectra with an h$_2$ candidate compared to standard dla-bearingquasar spectra. the equivalent widths (ews) of c ii, si ii and al iii (but notfe ii) absorptions associated with h$_2$ candidate dlas are larger compared tostandard dlas. this is probably related to a larger spread in velocity of theabsorption lines in the h$_2$ bearing sample.

1409.2462	the impact of star formation and gamma-ray burst rates at high redshift  on cosmic chemical evolution and reionization	recent observations in the total luminosity density have led to significantprogress in establishing the star formation rate (sfr) at high redshift.concurrently observed gamma-ray burst rates have also been used to extract thesfr at high redshift. the sfr in turn can be used to make a host of predictionsconcerning the ionization history of the universe, the chemical abundances, andsupernova rates. we compare the predictions made using a hierarchical model ofcosmic chemical evolution based on three recently proposed sfrs: two based onextracting the sfr from the observed gamma-ray burst rate at high redshift, andone based on the observed galaxy luminosity function at high redshift. usingthe wmap/planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we findthat only the sfr inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift sufficesto allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation whichextends from z = 0 to redshifts &gt; 10. for the case of the more conservative sfrbased on the observed galaxy luminosity function, the reionization history ofthe universe requires a bimodal imf which includes at least a coeval high (orintermediate) mass mode of star formation at high redshift (z&gt; 10). therefore,we also consider here a more general bimodal case which includes anearly-forming high mass mode as a fourth model to test the chemical history ofthe universe. we compute the abundances of several trace elements, as well asthe expected supernova rates, the stellar mass density and the specific sfr,ssfr, as a function of redshift  for each of the four models considered. we conclude that observationalconstraints on the global metallicity and optical depth at high redshift favorunseen faint but active star forming galaxies as pointed out in many recentstudies.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1501.07165	neutral chlorine and molecular hydrogen at high redshift	chlorine and molecular hydrogen are known to be tightly linked together inthe cold phase of the local interstellar medium through rapid chemicalreactions. we present here the first systematic study of this relation at highredshifts using h$_2$-bearing damped ly$\alpha$ systems (dlas) detected alongquasar lines of sight. using high-resolution spectroscopic data from vlt/uvesand keck/hires, we report the detection of cl$\,$i in 9 dlas (including 5 newdetections) out of 18 high-$z$ dlas with $n($h$_2) \ge 10^{17.3}\,$cm$^{-2}$(including a new h$_2$ detection at $z=3.09145$ towards j$\,$2100$-$0641) andpresent upper limits for the remaining 9 systems. we find a $\sim$5$\,\sigma$correlation between $n$(cl$\,$i) and $n$(h$_2$) with only $\sim$0.2$\,$dexdispersion over the range 18.1$\,&lt;\,$log$\,n$(h$_2$)$\,&lt;\,$20.1, thus probingcolumn densities 10 times lower those seen towards nearby stars, roughlyfollowing the relation $n$(cl$\,$i$) \approx 1.5\times10^{-6} \times n($h$_2)$.this relation between column densities is surprisingly the same at low and highredshift suggesting that the physical and chemical conditions are similar for agiven h$_2$ (or cl$\,$i) column density. in turn, the $n({cl$\,$i})/n({\rmh_2})$ ratio is found to be uncorrelated with the overall metallicity in thedla. our results confirm that neutral chlorine is an excellent tracer ofmolecule-rich gas and show that the molecular fraction or/and metallicity inthe h$_2$-bearing component of dla could possibly be much higher than theline-of-sight average values usually measured in dlas.

1501.07210	partial covering of emission regions of q 0528-250 by intervening h$_2$  clouds	we present an analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption system at z$_{\rmabs}$ = 2.811 in the spectrum of the blazar q0528-250. we demonstrate that themolecular cloud does not cover the background source completely. the partialcoverage reveals itself as a residual flux in the bottom of saturated h_2absorption lines. this amounts to about (2.22$\pm$0.54)% of the continuum anddoes not depend on the wavelength. this value is small and it explains why thiseffect has not been detected in previous studies of this quasar spectrum.however, it is robustly detected and significantly higher than the zero fluxlevel in the bottom of saturated lines of the ly-alpha forest,(-0.21$\pm$0.22)%. the presence of the residual flux could be caused byunresolved quasar multicomponents, by light scattered by dust, and/or byjet-cloud interaction. the h$_2$ absorption system is very well described by atwo-component model without inclusion of additional components when we takepartial coverage into account. the derived total column densities in the h$_2$absorption components a and b are logn(h$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$] = 18.10$\pm$0.02 and17.82$\pm$0.02, respectively. hd molecules are present only in component b.given the column density, logn(hd)= 13.33$\pm$0.02, we findn(hd)/2n(h$_2$)=(1.48$\pm$0.10)x10$^{-5}$, significantly lower than previousestimations. we argue that it is crucial to take into account partial coverageeffects for any analysis of h$_2$ bearing absorption systems, in particularwhen studying the physical state of high-redshift interstellar medium.

1505.04997	the elusive hi-&gt; h2 transition in high-z damped lyman-alpha systems	we study the h2 molecular content in high redshift damped lyman-alpha systems(dlas) as a function of the hi column density. we find a significant increaseof the h2 molecular content around log n(hi) (cm^-2)~21.5-22, a regime unprobeduntil now in intervening dlas, beyond which the majority of systems have logn(h2) &gt; 17. this is in contrast with lines of sight towards nearby stars, wheresuch h2 column densities are always detected as soon as log n(hi)&gt;20.7. thiscan qualitatively be explained by the lower average metallicity and possiblyhigher surrounding uv radiation in dlas. however, unlike in the milky way, theoverall molecular fractions remain modest, showing that even at a large n(hi)only a small fraction of overall hi is actually associated with theself-shielded h2 gas. damped lyman-alpha systems with very high-n(hi) probablyarise along quasar lines of sight passing closer to the centre of the hostgalaxy where the gas pressure is higher. we show that the colour changesinduced on the background quasar by continuum (dust) and line absorption (hilyman and h2 lyman &amp; werner bands) in dlas with log n(hi)~22 and metallicity~1/10 solar is significant, but not responsible for the long-discussed lack ofsuch systems in optically selected samples. instead, these systems are likelyto be found towards intrinsically fainter quasars that dominate the quasarluminosity function. colour biasing should in turn be severe at highermetallicities.

1509.05607	the extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: variability  selection and quasar luminosity function	the sdss-iv/eboss has an extensive quasar program that combines severalselection methods. among these, the photometric variability technique provideshighly uniform samples, unaffected by the redshift bias of traditionaloptical-color selections, when $z= 2.7 - 3.5$ quasars cross the stellar locusor when host galaxy light affects quasar colors at $z &lt; 0.9$. here, we presentthe variability selection of quasars in eboss, focusing on a specific programthat led to a sample of 13,876 quasars to $g_{\rm dered}=22.5$ over a 94.5deg$^2$ region in stripe 82, an areal density 1.5 times higher than over therest of the eboss footprint. we use these variability-selected data to providea new measurement of the quasar luminosity function (qlf) in the redshift range$0.68&lt;z&lt;4.0$. our sample is denser, reaches deeper than those used in previousstudies of the qlf, and is among the largest ones. at the faint end, our qlfextends to $m_g(z\!=\!2)=-21.80$ at low redshift and to $m_g(z\!=\!2)=-26.20$at $z\sim 4$. we fit the qlf using two independent double-power-law models withten free parameters each. the first model is a pure luminosity-functionevolution (ple) with bright-end and faint-end slopes allowed to be different oneither side of $z=2.2$. the other is a simple ple at $z&lt;2.2$, combined with amodel that comprises both luminosity and density evolution (lede) at $z&gt;2.2$.both models are constrained to be continuous at $z=2.2$. they present aflattening of the bright-end slope at large redshift. the lede model indicatesa reduction of the break density with increasing redshift, but the evolution ofthe break magnitude depends on the parameterization. the models are inexcellent accord, predicting quasar counts that agree within 0.3\% (resp.,1.1\%) to $g&lt;22.5$ (resp., $g&lt;23$). the models are also in good agreement overthe entire redshift range with models from previous studies.

astro-ph;0205524	a collimated flow driven by radiative pressure from the nucleus of  quasar q~1511+091	high velocity outflows from quasars are revealed by the absorption signaturesthey produce in the spectrum of the quasar. clues on the nature and origin ofthese flows are important for our understanding of the dynamics of gas in thecentral regions of the active galactic nucleus (agns) but also of the metalenrichment of the intergalactic space. line radiation pressure has often beensuggested to be an important process in driving these outflows, however noconvincing evidence has been given so far. here we report observation of ahighly structured flow, toward q~1511+091, where the velocity separationsbetween distinct components are similar to o vi, n v and c iv doubletsplittings with some of the profiles matching perfectly. this strongly favorsthe idea that the absorbing clumps originate at similar physical location andare driven by radiative acceleration due to resonance lines. the complexabsorption can be understood if the flow is highly collimated so that thedifferent optically thick clouds are aligned and cover the same region of thebackground source. one component shows saturated h i lyman series linestogether with absorptions from excited levels from c ii and si ii but coversonly 40% of the source of continuum. the fact that clouds cover only part ofthe small continuum source implies that the flow is located very close to it.

astro-ph;0411410	the eclairs micro-satellite for multi-wavelength studies of gamma-ray  burst prompt emission	the cosmological revolution of 1997 has established that (at least longduration) gamma-ray bursts (grb) are among the most energetic events in theuniverse and occur at cosmological distances. the eclairs micro-satellite, tobe launched in 2009, will provide multi-wavelength observations forastrophysical studies of grb and for their possible use as cosmological probes.it is expected to be the only space borne grb trigger available for groundbased robotic telescopes operational at that time. this paper presents theeclairs project and its status. an x/gamma-ray camera onboard eclairs with awide field of view of 2 sr, will detect ~100 grb/yr in the 4-50 kev energyrange, localize the grb with a precision of ~10 arcmin on the sky, and transmitthis information to the ground in near real-time, as a grb trigger for groundbased optical telescopes. inspired by the integral imager ibis, it is based ona cdte detection plane covering 1000 cm^2, placed 35 cm below a coded mask. anoptical camera, sensitive to magnitude-15 stars, covering up to 1/4th of thex/gamma-ray camera's field of view, will observe the prompt emission and apossible precursor of ~10 grb/yr in the visible-band. used in a continuousacquisition mode at a rate of ~5 images/s dumped into an on-board memory, a grbevent sent by the x/gamma-ray camera triggers a seek-back in memory for the grboptical precursor. the full x/gamma-ray and visible-band data of a grb are sentto ground when a high data-rate telemetry ground receiver is reachable.

astro-ph;0502284	the density structure around quasars from optical depth statistics	we present a method for studying the proximity effect and the densitystructure around redshift z=2-3 quasars. it is based on the probabilitydistribution of lyman-alpha pixel optical depths and its evolution withredshift.  we validate the method using mock spectra obtained from hydrodynamicalsimulations, and then apply it to a sample of 12 bright quasars at redshifts2-3 observed with uves at the vlt-ut2 kueyen eso telescope. these quasars donot show signatures of associated absorption and have a mean monochromaticluminosity of 5.4 10^{31} h^{-2} erg/s/hz at the lyman limit. the observeddistribution of optical depth within 10 mpc/h from the qso is statisticallydifferent from that measured in the general intergalactic medium at the sameredshift. such a change will result from the combined effects of the increasein photoionisation rate above the mean uv-background due to the extra ionizingphotons from the quasar radiation (proximity effect), and the higher density ofthe igm if the quasars reside in overdense regions (as expected from biasedgalaxy formation). the first factor decreases the optical depth whereas thesecond one increases the optical depth, but our measurement cannot distinguisha high background from a low overdensity. an overdensity of the order of a fewis required if we use the amplitude of the uv-background inferred from the meanlyman-$\alpha$ opacity. if no overdensity is present, then we require theuv-background to be higher, and consistent with the existing measurements basedon standard analysis of the proximity effect.

astro-ph;0504402	the mass-metallicity relation for high-redshift damped ly-alpha galaxies	we used our database of eso vlt-uves spectra of quasars to build up a sampleof 67 damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems with redshifts 1.7&lt;zabs&lt;3.7. for eachsystem, we measured average metallicities relative to solar, [x/h] (with eitherx=zn, s or si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, w1. wefind that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected atthe 5sigma significance level. the existence of such a correlation, over morethan two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be theconsequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxiesresponsible for dla absorption lines. the best-fit linear relation is[x/h]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log w1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with w1 expressed in km/s. whilethe slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same withinuncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation withdecreasing redshift. this suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend tobecome more metal-rich with time. moreover, the slope of this relation isconsistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.the dla systems having the lowest metallicities among the dla population wouldtherefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. inturn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the dla galaxypopulation. this may explain the recent result that the few dla systems withdetected ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.

astro-ph;0606185	velocity-metallicity correlation for high-z dla galaxies: evidence for a  mass-metallicity relation?	we used our database of vlt-uves quasar spectra to build up a sample of 70damped lyman-alpha (dla) or strong sub-dla systems with total neutral hydrogencolumn densities of log n(hi)&gt;20 and redshifts in the range 1.7&lt;z_abs&lt;4.3. foreach of the systems, we measured in an homogeneous manner the metallicitiesrelative to solar, [x/h] (with x=zn, or s or si), and the velocity widths oflow-ionization line profiles, delta v. we provide for the first time evidencefor a correlation between dla metallicity and line profile velocity width,which is detected at the 6.1sigma significance level. this confirms the trendpreviously observed in a much smaller sample by wolfe &amp; prochaska (1998). thebest-fit linear relation is [x/h]=1.55(\pm 0.12) log delta v -4.33(\pm 0.23)with delta v expressed in km/s. the slope of the dla velocity-metallicityrelation is the same within uncertainties between the higher (z_abs&gt;2.43) andthe lower (z_abs&lt;2.43) redshift halves of our sample. however, the twopopulations of systems are statistically different. there is a strong redshiftevolution in the sense that the mean metallicity and mean velocity widthincrease with decreasing redshift. we argue that the existence of a dlavelocity-metallicity correlation, over more than a factor of 100 spread inmetallicity, is probably the consequence of an underlying mass-metallicityrelation for the galaxies responsible for dla absorption lines. assuming asimple linear scaling of the galaxy luminosity with the mass of the dark-matterhalo, we find that the slope of the dla velocity-metallicity relation isconsistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation derived for localgalaxies.

astro-ph;0611690	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of grb060418: conclusive  evidence for uv pumping from the time evolution of feii and niii excited- and  metastable-level populations	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of grb060418, obtainedwith vlt/uves. these observations were triggered using the vlt rapid responsemode (rrm), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena,without any human intervention. this resulted in the first uves exposure ofgrb060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial swift satellitetrigger. a sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25,41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7km/s, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-15. this time-series clearly showsevidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving feiifine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both feii and niii, at thehost-galaxy redshift z=1.490. this is the first report of absorption linesarising from metastable levels of feii and niii along any grb sightline. wemodel the observed evolution of the level populations with three differentexcitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, andfluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. our data allow us toreject the collisional and ir excitation scenarios with high confidence. the uvpumping model, in which the grb afterglow uv photons excite a cloud of atomswith a column density n, distance d, and doppler broadening parameter b,provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log n(feii)=14.75+0.06-0.04,log n(niii)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see appendix a), and b=25+/-3km/s. the success of our uv pumping modeling implies that no significant amountof feii or niii is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratumin appendix a), most likely because it is ionized by the grb x-ray/uv flash.because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than feii and niii, thisminimum distance also applies to any hi present.

astro-ph;0611836	detecting cold gas at intermediate redshifts: gmrt survey using mg ii  systems	intervening hi 21-cm absorption systems at z &gt; 1.0 are very rare and only 4confirmed detections have been reported in the literature. despite theirscarcity, they provide interesting and unique insights into the physicalconditions in the interstellar medium of high-z galaxies. moreover, they canprovide independent constraints on the variation of fundamental constants. wereport 3 new detections based on our ongoing giant metrewave radio telescope(gmrt) survey for 21-cm absorbers at 1.10&lt; z_abs&lt; 1.45 from candidate dampedlyman_alpha systems. the 21-cm lines are narrow for the z_abs = 1.3710 systemtowards sdss j0108-0037 and z_abs = 1.1726 system toward sdss j2358-1020. basedon line full-width at half maximum, the kinetic temperatures are &lt;= 5200 k and&lt;=800 k, respectively. the 21-cm absorption profile of the third system, z_abs=1.1908 system towards sdss j0804+3012, is shallow, broad and complex,extending up to 100 km/s. the centroids of the 21-cm lines are found to beshifted with respect to the corresponding centroids of the metal lines derivedfrom sdss spectra. this may mean that the 21-cm absorption is not associatedwith the strongest metal line component.

astro-ph;0703218	physical conditions in the neutral interstellar medium at z=2.43 toward  q2348-011	we obtained a high-resolution vlt-uves spectrum of the quasar q2348-011 overa wavelength range that covers most of the prominent metal and molecularabsorption lines from the log n(hi)=20.50+-0.10 damped lyman-alpha system atzabs=2.43. from the column density ratios and the relative populations of h2rotational and ci fine-structure levels, we derive the physical conditions(relative abundances, dust-depletion, particle density, kinetic temperature andionizing flux) and discuss physical conditions in the neutral phase. molecularhydrogen is detected in seven components in the first four rotational levels (j= 0-3) of the vibrational ground state. absorption lines of h2 j = 4 (resp. j =5) are also detected in six (resp. two) of these components. this leads to atotal molecular fraction of log f = -1.69+0.37-0.58. we confirm the earlierfindings that there is a correlation between n(feii)/n(sii) and n(siii)/n(sii)indicative of a dust-depletion pattern. surprisingly, however, the depletion ofmetals onto dust in the h2 components is not large in this system: [fe/s] =-0.8 to -0.1. the gas in h2-bearing components is found to be cold but stillhotter than similar gas in our galaxy (t &gt; 130 k, instead of typically 80 k).and dense (n=100-200 cm^-3). there is an anti-correlation between the logarithmof the photo-absorption rate, and log n(h2)/n(ci) derived for each h2component. we show that this is mostly due to shielding effects and impliesthat the photo- absorption rate is a good indicator of the physical conditionsin the gas. we find that the gas is immersed in a intense uv field, about oneorder of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity. the results suggest thatthe gas in h2-bearing dlas is clumpy, and star-formation occurs in theassociated object.

astro-ph;9709131	evolution of the lyman-alpha forest from high to low redshift	we study the evolution with redshift, from z=5 to z=0, of the lyman-alphaforest in a cdm model using numerical simulations including collisionlessparticles only. the baryonic component is assumed to follow the dark matterdistribution. we distinguish between two populations of particles: populationp{s} traces the filamentary structures of the dark matter, evolves slowly withredshift and, for n(hi)&gt;10^14 cm^-2, dominates the number density of lines atz&lt;3; most of population p{u} is located in underdense regions and for the samecolumn densities, disappears rapidly at high redshift. we generate syntheticspectra from the simulation and show that the redshift evolution of thelyman-alpha forest (decrement, n(hi) distribution) is well reproduced over thewhole redshift range for omega_b*h^2=0.0125 and j_-21=0.1 at z=3 where j_-21 isthe uv background flux intensity in units of 10^-21 erg cm^-2 s^-1 hz^-1 sr^-1.the total number of lines with n(hi)&gt;10^12 cm^-2 remains approximately constantfrom z=4 to z=1. at z=0, the number density of lines per unit redshift with logn(hi)&gt;12, 13, 14 is of the order of 400, 100, and 20 respectively. therefore,at low redshift, if most of the strong (w_r&gt;0.3 \aa) lines are expected to beassociated with galaxies, the bulk of the lyman-alpha forest however shouldhave lower equivalent width and should not be tightly correlated with galaxies.

astro-ph;9802013	star-formation at z=4.7 in the environment of the qso br1202-07	we present here the spectrum of the galaxy companion to the z=4.7 quasarbr1202-0725, in the optical range 6000-9000 a, corresponding to 1050-1580 arest-frame. we detect a strong lya emission line at z=4.702, with an integratedflux of 2x10^{-16} ergs/cm^2/s, and a uv continuum longward of the lya emissionat a flux level of 3x10^{-19}ergs/cm^2/s/a. we fail to detect any civ[1550]emission with a 3 sigma upper limit of 3x10^{-17} ergs/cm^2/s $. we show thatthe ratio between lya and continuum intensity and the absence of a strong civemission imply that the uv continuum radiation is the result of an intensestar-formation activity rather than of a reprocessing of the qso flux. thetotal estimated sfr of this z=4.7 star-forming region is about 15-54 msun/yr,depending on the imf and the metallicity. the present data suggest that the lyaemission has a velocity and spatial structure, with possible velocitydifferences of about 500 km/s on scales of few kpc. these velocity patterns maybe a signature of collapsing or merging phenomena in the qso and itsenvironment, as expected from current models of galaxy formation at high z.

astro-ph;9804036	molecules in the $z_{\rm abs}$~=~2.8112 damped system toward  pks~0528--250	we present a detailed analysis of a high resolution spectrum of the dampedly$\alpha$ system at $z_{\rm abs}$~=~2.8112toward pks~0528-250. the absorptionredshift is slightly larger than the emission redshift of the quasar. weestimate the column density of h$_2$ molecules$n$(h$_2$)~$\sim$~6$\times$10$^{16}$~cm$^{-2}$ and the fractional abundance ofh$_2$, $f$~=~5.4$\times$10$^{-5}$. the excitation temperature derived fordifferent transitions suggests that the kinetic temperature of the cloud is$\sim$200~k and the density $n$~$\sim$~1000~cm$^{-3}$. the cloud therefore hasa dimension of $\sim$1~pc along the line of sight. since it obscures thebroad-line emission region, its transverse dimension should be larger than10~pc.\par we obtain upper limits on the column densities of c~{\sc i}($&lt;$~10$^{12.7}$~cm$^{-2}$) and co ($&lt;$~10$^{13.2}$~cm$^{-2}$;$n$(co)/$n$(h~{\sc i})~$&lt;$~7$\times$10$^{-9}$).we suggest that the ratio$n$(h$_2$)/$n$(c~{\sc i}) is a useful indicator of the physical conditions inthe absorber. simple photo-ionization models assuming solar relative abundancesshow that radiation fields with spectra similar to typical agns or starburstsare unable to reproduce all the constraints and in particular the surprisinglysmall $n$(c~{\sc i})/ $n$(h$_2$) and $n$(mg~{\sc i})/$n$(h$_2$) ratios. in viewof the models we explored, the most likely ionizing spectrum is a composite ofa uv- "big bump" possibly produced by a local starburst and a power-lawspectrum from the qso that provides the x-rays. dust is needed to explain theproduction of molecules in the cloud. the amount of dust is broadly consistentwith the [cr/zn] abundance determination.

astro-ph;9806202	on the kinematics of damped lyman-alpha systems	we report on high spectral resolution observations of five damped ly-alphaabsorbers. line velocity profiles and heavy element abundances are discussed.nitrogen is found to have abundances less than silicon in the systems toward q0347-383, q 0913+072, and q 1213+093. the absorber toward q 0913+072 is themost metal-deficient damped system known, with [fe/h] &lt; -3.2. the simplekinematical structure of the metal absorptions makes this system ideal todiscuss the [o/si] and [n/o] ratios. we find [o/h] ~ -2.7 and -2.7 &lt; [si/h] &lt;-2.2. by combining these data with information gathered in the literature, westudy the kinematics of the low and high ionization phases in a sample of 26damped ly-alpha systems in the redshift range 1.17-4.38. we note a strongcorrelation between the velocity broadenings of the siii,1808 and feii,1608lines whatever the line optical depth, implying that the physical conditionsare quite homogeneous in the sample. statistically this shows that largevariations of abundance ratios and thus large variations of depletion into dustgrains are unlikely. the velocity broadening of the absorption lines, delta v,is correlated with the asymmetry of the lines for delta v &lt; 150 km/s. thebroader the line the more asymmetric it is, as expected in case rotationdominates the line broadening. however this correlation does not hold forlarger delta v suggesting that evidence for rotational motions is restricted tovelocity broadenings delta v &lt; 150 km/s. the systems with delta v &gt; 200 km/sare peculiar with kinematics consistent with random motions. they showsub-systems as those expected if the objects are in the process of merging(abridged).

0809.3785	hd molecules at high redshift: a low astration factor of deuterium in a  solar-metallicity dla system at z=2.418	we present the detection of deuterated molecular hydrogen (hd) in the remoteuniverse in a damped lyman-alpha cloud at zabs=2.418 toward the quasar sdssj143912.04+111740.5. this is a unique system in which h2 and co molecules arealso detected. the chemical enrichment of this gas derived from znii and sii isas high as in the sun. we measure n(hd)/2 n(h2)=1.5+0.6-0.4 x 10^-5, which issignificantly higher than the same ratio measured in the galaxy and close tothe primordial d/h ratio estimated from the wmap constraint on the baryonicmatter density omega_b. this indicates a low astration factor of deuterium thatcontrasts with the unusually high chemical enrichment of the gas. this can beinterpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gas onto theassociated galaxy. detection of hd molecules at high-z also opens thepossibility to obtain an independent constraint on the cosmological-timevariability of mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio.

0810.2518	obscured and powerful agn and starburst activities at z~3.5	we report the discovery of two sources at z=3.867 and z=3.427 that exhibitpowerful starburst and agn activities. they benefit from data from radio to xrays from the cfhtls-d1/swire/xmds surveys. follow-up optical and near-infraredspectroscopy, and millimeter iram/mambo observations are also available. weperformed an analysis of their spectral energy distributions to understand theorigin of their emission and constrain their luminosities. a comparison withother composite systems at similar redshifts from the literature is alsopresented. the agn and starburst bolometric luminosities are ~10^13 lsun. theagn emission dominates at x ray, optical, mid-infrared wavelengths, andprobably in the radio. the starburst emission dominates in the far-infrared.the estimated star formation rates range from 500 to 3000msun/yr. the agnnear-infrared and x ray emissions are heavily obscured in both sources with anestimated dust extinction av&gt;4, and compton-thick gas column densities. the twosources are the most obscured and most luminous agns detected at millimeterwavelengths currently known. the sources presented in this work are heavilyobscured qsos, but their properties are not fully explained by the standard agnunification model. in one source, the ultraviolet and optical spectra suggestthe presence of outflowing gas and shocks, and both sources show emission fromhot dust, most likely in the vicinity of the nucleus. evidence of moderateagn-driven radio activity is found in both sources. the two sources lie on thelocal m_bh-m_bulge relation. to remain on this relation, their star formationrate has to decrease. our results support evolutionary models that invoke radiofeedback as star formation quenching mechanism, and suggest that such amechanism might play a major role also in powerful agns.
