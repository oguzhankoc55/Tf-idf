0910.3611	x-ray emitting ghz-peaked spectrum galaxies: testing a  dynamical-radiative model with broad-band spectra	in a dynamical-radiative model we recently developed to describe the physicsof compact, ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) sources, the relativistic jets propagateacross the inner, kpc-sized region of the host galaxy, while the electronpopulation of the expanding lobes evolves and emits synchrotron andinverse-compton (ic) radiation. interstellar-medium gas clouds engulfed by theexpanding lobes, and photoionized by the active nucleus, are responsible forthe radio spectral turnover through free-free absorption (ffa) of thesynchrotron photons. the model provides a description of the evolution of thespectral energy distribution (sed) of gps sources with their expansion,predicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the x-ray to thegamma-ray frequency domain. here, we test this model with the broad-band sedsof a sample of eleven x-ray emitting gps galaxies with compact-symmetric-object(cso) morphology, and show that: (i) the shape of the radio continuum atfrequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for bythe ffa mechanism; (ii) the observed x-ray spectra can be interpreted asnon-thermal radiation produced via ic scattering of the local radiation fieldsoff the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal,accretion-disk dominated scenario. we also show that the relation between thehydrogen column densities derived from the x-ray (n_h) and radio (n_hi) data ofthe sources is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, if confirmed byfuture observations, would provide further support to our scenario ofhigh-energy emitting lobes.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0704.1603	measuring energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using compton  scattering in pogolite	linear polarization in x- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of manyastrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. however, very few x-ray polarizationmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilstseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.in this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarizationfrom cosmic sources is possible using the compton technique, in particular withthe proposed pogolite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 kev range. we usegeant4 simulations of a pogolite model and input photon spectra based on cygnusx-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mcrab). effective observing times of 6and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long durationflight respectively. both smooth and sharp energy variations of thepolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signalsusing chi-square statistics. we can reject constant polarization, with energy,for the cygnus x-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component isassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made forweaker polarization. for the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can berejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%polarization.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1004.2352	gamma-ray spectral evolution of ngc1275 observed with fermi-lat	we report on a detailed investigation of the high-energy gamma-ray emissionfrom ngc\,1275, a well-known radio galaxy hosted by a giant elliptical locatedat the center of the nearby perseus cluster. with the increased photonstatistics, the center of the gamma-ray emitting region is now measured to beseparated by only 0.46' from the nucleus of ngc1275, well within the 95%confidence error circle with radius ~1.5'. early fermi-lat observationsrevealed a significant decade-timescale brightening of ngc1275 at gev photonenergies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by theupper limit from previous egret observations. with the accumulation of one-yearof fermi-lat all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectralvariations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. theaverage &gt;100 mev gamma-ray spectrum of ngc1275 shows a possible deviation froma simple power-law shape, indicating a spectral cut-off around an observedphoton energy of e = 42.2+-19.6 gev, with an average flux of f = (2.31+-0.13) x10^{-7} ph/cm^2/s and a power-law photon index, gamma = 2.13+-0.02. the largestgamma-ray flaring event was observed in april--may 2009 and was accompanied bysignificant spectral variability above e &gt; 1-2 gev. the gamma-ray activity ofngc1275 during this flare can be described by a hysteresis behavior in the fluxversus photon index plane. the highest energy photon associated with thegamma-ray source was detected at the very end of the observation, with theobserved energy of e = 67.4gev and an angular separation of about 2.4' from thenucleus. in this paper we present the details of the fermi-lat data analysis,and briefly discuss the implications of the observed gamma-ray spectralevolution of ngc1275 in the context of gamma-ray blazar sources in general.

1107.3370	broad line radio galaxies observed with fermi-lat: the origin of the gev  gamma-ray emission	we report on a detailed investigation of the gamma-ray emission from 18 broadline radio galaxies (blrgs) based on two years of fermi large area telescope(lat) data. we confirm the previously reported detections of 3c 120 and 3c 111in the gev photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristicsof the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible fluxvariability in both sources. no statistically significant gamma-ray detectionof the other blrgs was however found in the considered dataset. though thesample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3c 111 and 3c 120from the blrgs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strongnuclear radio flux. this finding, together with the indications of thegamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicatethat the gev emission of blrgs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiationof relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. in this paper wealso analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate seyfert 1 galaxies,which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of blrgs, and found none weredetected in gamma-rays. a simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for thebroad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 activegalaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to theaccreting matter is &gt; 1 percent on average for blrgs, whilst &lt;0.1 percent forseyfert 1 galaxies.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1207.0616	gamma-ray observations of the orion molecular clouds with the fermi  large area telescope	we report on the gamma-ray observations of giant molecular clouds orion a andb with the large area telescope (lat) on-board the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope. the gamma-ray emission in the energy band between \sim100 mev and\sim100 gev is predicted to trace the gas mass distribution in the cloudsthrough nuclear interactions between the galactic cosmic rays (crs) andinterstellar gas. the gamma-ray production cross-section for the nuclearinteraction is known to \sim10% precision which makes the lat a powerful toolto measure the gas mass column density distribution of molecular clouds for aknown cr intensity. we present here such distributions for orion a and b, andcorrelate them with those of the velocity integrated co intensity (wco) at a1{\deg} \times1{\deg} pixel level. the correlation is found to be linear over awco range of ~10 fold when divided in 3 regions, suggesting penetration ofnuclear crs to most of the cloud volumes. the wco-to-mass conversion factor,xco, is found to be \sim2.3\times10^20 cm-2(k km s-1)-1 for the high-longitudepart of orion a (l &gt; 212{\deg}), \sim1.7 times higher than \sim1.3 \times 10^20found for the rest of orion a and b. we interpret the apparent high xco in thehigh-longitude region of orion a in the light of recent works proposing anon-linear relation between h2 and co densities in the diffuse molecular gas.wco decreases faster than the h2 column density in the region making the gas"darker" to wco.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

0704.3743	the suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud active galaxy  centaurus a: constraints on abundances of the accreting material	a suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud agn centaurus a in 2005has yielded a broadband spectrum spanning 0.3 to 250 kev. the net exposuretimes after screening were: 70 ks per x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) camera,60.8 ks for the hard x-ray detector (hxd) pin, and 17.1 ks for the hxd-gso. thehard x-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of1.5 and 7 * 10^{23} cm^{-2} respectively. the spectrum is consistent withprevious suggestions that the power-law components are x-ray emission from thesub-pc vlbi jet and from bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistentwith a partial covering interpretation. the soft band is dominated by thermalemission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature vapecmodel, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclearemission, jet emission, and emission from x-ray binaries and other pointsources. narrow fluorescent emission lines from fe, si, s, ar, ca and ni aredetected. the fe k alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on thedistance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. fe, ca, and s k-shellabsorption edges are detected. elemental abundances are constrained viaabsorption edge depths and strengths of the fluorescent and diffuse plasmaemission lines. the high metallicity ([fe/h]=+0.1) of the circumnuclearmaterial suggests that it could not have originated in the relativelymetal-poor outer halo unless enrichment by local star formation has occurred.relative abundances are consistent with enrichment from type ii and iasupernovae.

1210.4237	giant lobes of centaurus a radio galaxy observed with the suzaku x-ray  satellite	[abridged] we report on suzaku observations of selected regions within thesouthern giant lobe of the radio galaxy centaurus a. we focus on distinct x-rayfeatures likely associated with fine radio structure of the lobe. we find thatthe spectral properties of the detected x-ray features are equally consistentwith thermal emission from hot gas, or with a power-law radiation continuum.however, the plasma parameters implied by these different models favor asynchrotron origin for the analyzed x-ray spots, indicating that a veryefficient acceleration of electrons is taking place within the giant structureof centaurus a, albeit only in isolated and compact regions. we also present adetailed analysis of the diffuse x-ray emission, resulting in a tentativedetection of a soft excess component best fitted by a thermal model with atemperature of 0.5 kev. the exact origin of the observed excess remainsuncertain, although energetic considerations point to thermal gas filling thebulk of the volume of the lobe and mixed with the non-thermal plasma. thecorresponding pressure of the thermal gas in such a case appears to be inalmost exact equipartition with the pressure provided by the radio-emittingelectrons and the magnetic field. although tentative, our findings potentiallyimply that the structure of the extended lobes in active galaxies is likely tobe highly inhomogeneous, with magnetic reconnection processes continuouslyconverting magnetic energy to internal energy of the plasma particles, leadingto spatial and temporal variations in the plasma parameters around theequilibrium condition.

1211.6782	fermi-lat and suzaku observations of the radio galaxy centaurus b	centaurus b is a nearby radio galaxy positioned in the southern hemisphereclose to the galactic plane. here we present a detailed analysis of about 43months of accumulated fermi-lat data of the gamma-ray counterpart of the sourceinitially reported in the 2nd fermi-lat catalog, and of newly acquired suzakux-ray data. we confirm its detection at gev photon energies, and analyze theextension and variability of the gamma-ray source in the lat dataset, in whichit appears as a steady gamma-ray emitter. the x-ray core of centaurus b isdetected as a bright source of a continuum radiation. we do not detect howeverany diffuse x-ray emission from the known radio lobes, with the provided upperlimit only marginally consistent with the previously claimed asca flux. twoscenarios that connect the x-ray and gamma-ray properties are considered. inthe first one, we assume that the diffuse non-thermal x-ray emission componentis not significantly below the derived suzaku upper limit. in this case,modeling the inverse-compton emission shows that the observed gamma-ray flux ofthe source may in principle be produced within the lobes. this associationwould imply that efficient in-situ acceleration of the radiating electrons isoccurring and that the lobes are dominated by the pressure from therelativistic particles. in the second scenario, with the diffuse x-ray emissionwell below the suzaku upper limits, the lobes in the system are insteaddominated by the magnetic pressure. in this case, the observed gamma-ray fluxis not likely to be produced within the lobes, but instead within the nuclearparts of the jet. by means of synchrotron self-compton modeling we show thatthis possibility could be consistent with the broad-band data collected for theunresolved core of centaurus b, including the newly derived suzaku spectrum.

0712.1220	on the evolution of and high-energy emission from ghz-peaked-spectrum  sources	here we discuss evolution and broad-band emission of compact (&lt; kpc) lobes inyoung radio sources. we propose a simple dynamical description for theseobjects, consisting of a relativistic jet propagating into a uniform gaseousmedium in the central parts of an elliptical host. in the framework of theproposed model, we follow the evolution of ultrarelativistic electrons injectedfrom a terminal hotspot of a jet to expanding lobes, taking into account theiradiabatic energy losses as well as radiative cooling. this allows us to discussthe broad-band lobe emission of young radio sources. in particular, we arguethat the observed spectral turnover in the radio synchrotron spectra of theseobjects cannot originate from the synchrotron self-absorption process but ismost likely due to free-free absorption effects connected with neutral cloudsof interstellar medium engulfed by the expanding lobes and photoionized byactive centers. we also find a relatively strong and complex high-energyemission component produced by inverse-compton up-scattering of varioussurrounding photon fields by the lobes' electrons. we argue that such highenergy radiation is strong enough to account for several observed properties ofghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) radio galaxies at uv and x-ray frequencies. inaddition, this emission is expected to extend up to gev (or possibly even tev)photon energies and can thus be probed by several modern gamma-ray instruments.in particular, we suggest that gps radio galaxies should constitute arelatively numerous class of extragalactic sources detected by glast.

0705.0234	low energy cut-offs and hard x-ray spectra in high-z radio-loud quasars:  the suzaku view of rbs315	we present the results from the suzaku observation of the powerful radio-loudquasar rbs315 (z=2.69), for which a previous xmm-newton observation showed anextremely flat x-ray continuum up to 10 kev (photon index gamma=1.26) andindications of strong intrinsic absorption (n_h~10^22 cm^{-2} assuming neutralgas). the instrument for hard x-rays hxd/pin allows us a detection of thesource up to 50 kev. the broad-band continuum (0.5-50 kev) can be well modeledwith a power-law with slope gamma=1.5 (definitively softer than the continuummeasured by xmm-newton) above 1 kev with strong deficit of soft photons. thelow-energy cut-off can be well fitted either with intrinsic absorption (withcolumn density n_h~10^22 cm^{-2} in the quasar rest frame) or with a break inthe continuum, with an extremely hard (gamma =0.7) power-law below 1 kev. weconstruct the spectral energy distribution of the source, using also optical-uvmeasurements obtained through a quasi-simultaneous uvot/swift observation. theshape of the sed is similar to that of other flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs) with similar power, making this source an excellent candidate for thedetection in gamma-rays by glast. we model the sed with the synchrotron-inversecompton model usually applied to fsrqs, showing that the deficit of softphotons can be naturally interpreted as due to an intrinsic curvature of thespectrum near the low energy end of the ic component rather than to intrinsicabsorption, although the latter possibility cannot be ruled out. we proposethat in at least a fraction of the radio-loud qsos at high redshift the cut-offin the soft x-ray band can be explained in a similar way. further studies arerequired to distinguish between the two alternatives.

1412.3903	six years of fermi-lat and multi-wavelength monitoring of the broad-line  radio galaxy 3c 120: jet dissipation at sub-parsec scales from the central  engine	we present multi-wavelength monitoring results for the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c 120 in the mev/gev, sub-millimeter, and 43 ghz bands over six years.over the past two years, fermi-lat sporadically detected 3c 120 with highsignificance and the 230 ghz data also suggest an enhanced activity of thesource. after the mev/gev detection from 3c 120 in mjd 56240-56300, 43 ghz vlbamonitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejectionof a superluminal knot. since we observed the gamma-ray and vlba phenomena intemporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they arephysically connected. this assumption was further supported by the subsequentobservation that the 43 ghz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flareoccurred around mjd 56560. we can then infer that the mev/gev emission tookplace inside an unresolved 43 ghz core of 3c 120 and that the jet dissipationoccurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole, if we take thedistance of the 43 ghz core from the central black hole as ~ 0.5 pc, aspreviously estimated from the time lag between x-ray dips and knot ejections(marscher et al. 2002; chatterjee et al. 2009). based on our constraints on therelative locations of the emission regions and energetic arguments, we concludethat the gamma rays are more favorably produced via the synchrotronself-compton process, rather than inverse compton scattering of externalphotons coming from the broad line region or hot dusty torus. we also derivedthe electron distribution and magnetic field by modeling the simultaneousbroadband spectrum.

1501.06054	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the fermi large  area telescope	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei (agns) detected by the fermi-lat(3lac) is presented. it is based on the third fermi-lat catalog (3fgl) ofsources detected between 100 mev and 300 gev with a test statistic (ts) greaterthan 25, between 2008 august 4 and 2012 july 31. the 3lac includes 1591 agnslocated at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;10{\deg}), a 71% increase over thesecond catalog based on 2 years of data. there are 28 duplicate associations,thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3fgl catalog areagns. most of them (98%) are blazars. about half of the newly detected blazarsare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficientquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. based on theirgamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split betweenflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) and bl~lacs. the most abundant detectedbl~lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (hsp) type. about 50% of the bl~lacshave no measured redshifts. a few new rare outliers (hsp-fsrqs andhigh-luminosity hsp bl~lacs) are reported. the general properties of the 3lacsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. the fraction of 3lacblazars in the total population of blazars listed in bzcat remainsnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the bzcat-blazar radio, optical andx-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazarscould eventually shine in gamma rays at lat-detection levels. the energy-fluxdistributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement withextrapolation from earlier catalogs.

0806.1260	chandra reveals twin x-ray jets in the powerful fr-ii radio galaxy 3c353	we report x-ray imaging of the powerful fr-ii radio galaxy 3c353 using thechandra x-ray observatory. 3c353's two 4"-wide and 2'-long jets allow us tostudy in detail the internal structure of the large-scale relativistic outflowsat both radio and x-ray photon energies with the sub-arcsecond spatialresolution. in a 90 ks chandra observation, we have detected x-ray emissionfrom most radio structures in 3c353, including the nucleus, the jet and thecounterjet, the terminal jet regions (hotspots), and one radio lobe. we showthat the detection of the x-ray emission associated with the radio knots andcounterknots puts several crucial constraints on the x-ray emission mechanismsin powerful large-scale jets of quasars and fr-ii sources. in particular, weshow that this detection is inconsistent with the inverse-compton modelproposed in the literature, and instead implies a synchrotron origin of thex-ray jet photons. we also find that the width of the x-ray counterjet ispossibly narrower than that measured in radio bands, that the radio-to-x-rayflux ratio decreases systematically downstream along the jets, and that thereare substantial (kpc-scale) offsets between the positions of the x-ray andradio intensity maxima within each knot, whose magnitudes increase away fromthe nucleus. we discuss all these findings in the wider context of the physicsof extragalactic jets, proposing some particular though not definitivesolutions or interpretations for each problem.

astro-ph;0006195	rapid synchrotron flares from bl lacertae detected by asca and rxte	we report the variable x-ray emission from bl lacertae detected in the ascatoo observation conducted during the egret and rxte pointings, coincident withthe 1997 july outburst. the source showed a historically high state of x-ray,optical, and gamma-ray emission, with its 2-10 kev flux peaking at ~3.3 e-11erg/cm2/s. this is more than 3 times higher than the value measured by asca in1995. we detected two rapid flares which occured only in the soft x-ray band,while the hard x-ray flux also increased, but decayed with a much longer timescale. together with the requirement of a very steep and varying power lawdominating the soft x-ray band in addition to the hard power law, we suggestthat both the high energy end of the synchrotron spectrum and the hard inversecompton spectrum were visible in this source during the outburst. we discussthe possible origins of the observed variability time scales, and interpret theshort time scales of the soft x-ray variability as reflecting the size of theemission region.

astro-ph;0008505	complex spectral variability from intensive multi-wavelength monitoring  of mrk421 in 1998	we conducted a multi-frequency campaign for the tev blazar mrk~421 in 1998april. the campaign started from a pronounced high amplitude flare recorded bysax and whipple; asca observation started three days later. in the x-ray data,we detected multiple flares, occuring on time scales of about one day. ascadata clearly reveal spectral variability. the comparison of the data from asca,euve and rxte indicates that the variability amplitudes in the low energysynchrotron component are larger at higher photon energies. in tev gamma-rays,large intra-day variations -- which were correlated with the x-ray flux -- wereobserved when results from three cherenkov telescopes are combined. the rmsvariability of tev gamma--rays was similar to that observed in hard x-rays,above 10 kev. the x-ray light curve reveals flares which are almost symmetricfor most of cases, implying the dominant time scale is the light crossing timethrough the emitting region. the structure function analysis based on thecontinuous x-ray light curve of seven days indicates that the characteristictime scale is ~0.5 day. the analysis of asca light curves in various energybands appears to show both soft (positive) and hard (negative) lags. these maynot be real, as systematic effects could also produce these lags, which are allmuch smaller than an orbit. if the lags of both signs are real, these implythat the particle acceleration and x-ray cooling time scales are similar.

astro-ph;0105029	five-year monitorings of tev blazars with asca and rxte	we study the temporal/spectral variability of two extragalactic tev sources,mrk 421 and mrk 501, based on 5-year observations with the asca and rxtesatellites. we found that the peak of the synchrotron emission exists just inthe x-ray band and its position shifted from lower to higher energy when thesource became brighter. relationship between the peak energy and peakluminosity showed quite different behavior in the two sources; mrk 421 showedvery little change in the peak position (0.5-2 kev), while mrk 501 revealed thelargest shift ever observed in blazars (1-100 kev). we analyze these x-ray datawith the flux changes in tev band, which are obtained from 35 trulysimultateneous observations. very different spectral evolution of both objectsindicates some differences in the electron acceleration mechanism at workduring the flares. we argue that the flux variability of mrk 421 is associatedwith an increase in the number of electrons, while the flare of mrk 501 ismostly due to the large changes in maximum energy of electrons. we also discussthe characteristic temporal variability of tev sources, and implications forthe x-ray emitting site in the relativistic jet.

astro-ph;0308201	chandra discovery of an x-ray jet and lobes in 3c 15	we report the chandra detection of an x-ray jet in 3c 15. the peak of thex-ray emission in the jet is 4.1'' (a projected distance of 5.1 kpc) from thenucleus, and coincident with a component previously identified in the radio andoptical jets. we examine four models for the x-ray jet emission: (i) weaksynchrotron cooling in equip., (ii) moderate synchrotron cooling in equip.,(iii) weak synchrotron plus ssc cooling, and (iv) moderate synchrotron plus ssccooling. we argue that case (ii) can most reasonably explain the overallemission from knot c. case (iii) is also possible, but requires a largedeparture from equipartition and for the jet power to be comparable to that ofthe brightest quasars. diffuse x-ray emission has also been detected,distributed widely over the full extent (63kpc x 25kpc) of the radio lobes. wecompare the total energy contained in the lobes with the jet power estimatedfrom knot c, and discuss the energetic link between the jet and the lobes. weargue that the fueling time (t_fuel) and the source age (t_src) are comparablefor case (ii), whereas t_fuel &lt;&lt; t_src is likely for case (iii). the latter mayimply that the jet has a very small filling factor, ~10^{-3}. we consider thepressure balance between the thermal galaxy halo and non-thermal relativisticelectrons in the radio lobes. finally, we show that the x-ray emission from thenucleus is not adequately fitted by a simple absorbed power-law model, butneeds an additional power-law with heavy absorption intrinsic to the source.such a high column density is consistent with the presence of a dense, dustytorus which obscures the quasar nucleus.

astro-ph;9811014	a study of high energy emission from the tev blazar mrk 501 during  multiwavelength observations in 1996	we present the results of a multiwavelength campaign for mrk 501 performed inmarch 1996 with asca, egret, whipple, and optical telescopes. in the x-rayband, a spectral break was observed around 2 kev. we report here for the firsttime the detection of high-energy gamma-ray flux from mrk 501 with egret with3.5 sigma significance (e&gt;100 mev). higher flux was also observed in april/may1996, with 4.0 sigma significance for e&gt;100 mev, and 5.2 sigma significance fore&gt;500 mev. the gamma-ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of thegamma-ray blazars. we find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistentwith that calculated from a one-zone ssc model in a homogeneous region. in thecontext of this model, we investigate the values of the magnetic field strengthand the beaming factor allowed by the observational results. we compare themarch 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in april 1997.between these two epochs, the tev flux increase is well correlated with thatobserved in kev range. the kev and tev amplitudes during the april 1997 flareare accurately reproduced, assuming that the population of synchrotron photonsin 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons, havingmaximum energies of g_max = 6.0e6. however, the tev spectrum observed duringmarch 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models. we find that thiscannot be explained by either higher order comptonization or the contributionof the `seed' ir photons from the host galaxy for the first-order externalradiation comptonization.

astro-ph;9908090	variability pattern and the spectral evolution of the bl lacertae object  pks 2155-304	the tev blazar pks 2155-304 was monitored with the x-ray satellite asca in1994 may, as part of a multiwavelength campaign from the radio to x-ray bands.at the beginning of the two-day continuous observation, we detected a largeflare, where the 2-10 kev flux changed by a factor of 2 on a time scale of 3 x10^4 sec. during the flare, the increase in the hard x-ray flux clearlypreceded that observed in the soft x-rays, the spectral evolution tracking a`clockwise loop' in the flux versus photon index plane. ascribing theenergy-dependent variability to differential synchrotron cooling ofrelativistic electrons, we estimate the magnetic field b in the emissionregion. we tested two different methods of comparing the time series in variousx-ray bands: (i) fitting the light curves to a gaussian and searching for thetime shift of the peak of the flare, and (ii) calculating the discretecorrelation function. both methods yielded a consistent solution of b ~ 0.1 g.we also found that the flare amplitude becomes larger as the photon energyincreases, while the duration of the flare stays roughly constant through theasca energy band (0.7-7.5 kev). in the framework of the time dependentsynchrotron self-compton model in a homogeneous region, we consider a flarewhere the maximum lorentz factor (gmax) of the injected electrons increasesuniformly throughout the emission volume. the temporal evolution of spectra aswell as the light curves were reproduced with the physical parametersself-consistently determined from seven observables. we obtain b ~ 0.1-0.2 gand a region size r ~ 10^-2 pc, for relativistic beaming with a doppler factorof d ~ 20-30. we discuss the significance of light travel time effects.

0811.2964	modelling the broad-band spectra of x-ray emitting gps galaxies	the study of the broad-band emission of ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) radiogalaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the physical processes taking placein the central, kpc-sized region of their active hosts, where the jetspropagate and the lobes expand, interacting with the surrounding interstellarmedium (ism). we recently developed a new dynamical-radiative model to describethe evolution of the gps phenomenon (stawarz et al. 2008): as the relativisticjets propagate through the ism, gradually engulfing narrow-line emitting gasclouds along their way, the electron population of the expanding lobes evolves,emitting synchrotron light, as well as inverse-compton radiation viaup-scattering of the photon fields from the host galaxy and its active nucleus.the model, which successfully reproduces the key features of the gps radiosources as a class, provides a description of the evolution of their spectralenergy distribution (sed) with the lobes' expansion, predicting significant andcomplex x-ray to gamma-ray emission. we apply here the model to the broad-bandsed's of a sample of known, x-ray emitting gps galaxies, and show that: (i) thefree-free absorption mechanism enables us to reproduce the radio continuum atfrequencies below the turnover; (ii) the lobes' non-thermal, inverse-comptonemission can account for the observed x-ray spectra, providing a viablealternative to the thermal, accretion-dominated scenario. we also show that, inour sample, the relationship between the x-ray and radio hydrogen columndensitities, n_h and n_hi, is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, ifconfirmed, would support the scenario of high-energy emitting lobes.
