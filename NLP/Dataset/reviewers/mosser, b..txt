0907.0608	solar-like oscillations with low amplitude in the corot target hd 181906	context: the f8 star hd 181906 (effective temperature ~6300k) was observedfor 156 days by the corot satellite during the first long run in the centredirection. analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acousticoscillations. however, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means thesignal-to-noise (s/n) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low s/nleads to complications in the analysis. aims: to extract global variables ofthe star as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the powerspectrum of the lightcurve. methods: the power spectrum of the lightcurve, awavelet transform and spot fitting have been used to obtain the averagerotation rate of the star and its inclination angle. then, the autocorrelationof the power spectrum and the power spectrum of the power spectrum were used toproperly determine the large separation. finally, estimations of the modeparameters have been done by maximizing the likelihood of a global fit, whereseveral modes were fit simultaneously. results: we have been able to infer themean surface rotation rate of the star (~4 microhz) with indications of thepresence of surface differential rotation, the large separation of the p modes(~87 microhz), and therefore also the ridges corresponding to overtones of theacoustic modes.

0909.0782	on detecting the large separation in the autocorrelation of stellar  oscillation times series	the observations carried out by the space missions corot and kepler provide alarge set of asteroseismic data. their analysis requires an efficient procedurefirst to determine if the star is reliably showing solar-like oscillations,second to measure the so-called large separation, third to estimate theasteroseismic information that can be retrieved from the fourier spectrum. wedevelop in this paper a procedure, based on the autocorrelation of the seismicfourier spectrum. we have searched for criteria able to predict the output thatone can expect from the analysis by autocorrelation of a seismic time series.first, the autocorrelation is properly scaled for taking into account thecontribution of white noise. then, we use the null hypothesis h0 test to assessthe reliability of the autocorrelation analysis. calculations based on solarand corot times series are performed in order to quantify the performance as afunction of the amplitude of the autocorrelation signal. we propose anautomated determination of the large separation, whose reliability isquantified by the h0 test. we apply this method to analyze a large set of redgiants observed by corot. we estimate the expected performance for photometrictime series of the kepler mission. finally, we demonstrate that the methodmakes it possible to distinguish l=0 from l=1 modes. the envelopeautocorrelation function has proven to be very powerful for the determinationof the large separation in noisy asteroseismic data, since it enables us toquantify the precision of the performance of different measurements: mean largeseparation, variation of the large separation with frequency, small separationand degree identification.

0910.4037	the corot target hd 49933: 2- comparison of theoretical mode amplitudes  with observations	from the seismic data obtained by corot for the star hd 49933 it is possible,as for the sun, to constrain models of the excitation of acoustic modes byturbulent convection. we compare a stochastic excitation model described inpaper i (arxiv:0910.4027) with the asteroseismology data for hd 49933, a starthat is rather metal poor and significantly hotter than the sun. using the modelinewidths measured by corot for hd 49933 and the theoretical mode excitationrates computed in paper i, we derive the expected surface velocity amplitudesof the acoustic modes detected in hd 49933. using a calibrated quasi-adiabaticapproximation relating the mode amplitudes in intensity to those in velocity,we derive the expected values of the mode amplitude in intensity. our amplitudecalculations are within 1-sigma error bars of the mode surface velocityspectrum derived with the harps spectrograph. the same is found with the modeamplitudes in intensity derived for hd 49933 from the corot data. on the otherhand, at high frequency, our calculations significantly depart from the corotand harps measurements. we show that assuming a solar metal abundance ratherthan the actual metal abundance of the star would result in a largerdiscrepancy with the seismic data. furthermore, calculations that assume the``new'' solar chemical mixture are in better agreement with the seismic datathan those that assume the ``old'' solar chemical mixture. these resultsvalidate, in the case of a star significantly hotter than the sun and alpha cena, the main assumptions in the model of stochastic excitation. however, thediscrepancies seen at high frequency highlight some deficiencies of themodelling, whose origin remains to be understood.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1002.3461	survival of a convective core in low-mass solar-like pulsator hd 203608	a 5-night asteroseismic observation of the f8v star hd 203608 was conductedin august 2006 with harps, followed by an analysis of the data, and apreliminary modeling of the star (mosser et al. 2008). the stellar parameterswere significantly constrained, but the behavior of one of the seismic indexes(the small spacing d01) could not be fitted with the observed one, even withthe best considered models. we study the possibility of improving the agreementbetween models and observations by changing the physical properties of theinner parts of the star (to which d01 is sensitive). we show that, in spite ofits low mass, it is possible to produce models of hd 203608 with a convectivecore. no such model was considered in the preliminary modeling. in practice, weobtain these models here by assuming some extra mixing at the edge of the earlyconvective core. we optimize the model parameters using the levenberg-marquardtalgorithm. the agreement between the new best model with a convective core andthe observations is much better than for the models without. all theobservational parameters are fitted within 1-sigma observational error bars.this is the first observational evidence of a convective core in an old andlow-mass star such as hd 203608. in standard models of low-mass stars, the corewithdraws shortly after the zams. the survival of the core until the presentage of hd 203608 provides very strong constraints on the size of the mixed zoneassociated to the convective core. using overshooting as a proxy to model theprocesses of transport at the edge of the core, we find that to reproduce bothglobal and seismic observations, we must have alpha_ov = 0.17 +/- 0.03 hp forhd 203608. we revisit the process of the extension of the core lifetime due toovershooting in the particular case of hd 203608.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

1003.4368	seismic and spectroscopic characterization of the solar-like pulsating  corot target hd 49385	the star hd 49385 is the first g-type solar-like pulsator observed in theseismology field of the space telescope corot. the satellite collected 137 daysof high-precision photometric data on this star, confirming that it presentssolar-like oscillations. hd 49385 was also observed in spectroscopy with thenarval spectrograph in january 2009. our goal is to characterize hd 49385 usingboth spectroscopic and seismic data. the fundamental stellar parameters of hd49385 are derived with the semi-automatic software vwa, and the projectedrotational velocity is estimated by fitting synthetic profiles to isolatedlines in the observed spectrum. a maximum likelihood estimation is used todetermine the parameters of the observed p modes. we perform a global fit, inwhich modes are fitted simultaneously over nine radial orders, with degreesranging from l=0 to l=3 (36 individual modes). precise estimates of theatmospheric parameters (teff, [m/h], log g) and of the vsini of hd 49385 areobtained. the seismic analysis of the star leads to a clear identification ofthe modes for degrees l=0,1,2. around the maximum of the signal (nu=1013microhz), some peaks are found significant and compatible with the expectedcharacteristics of l=3 modes. our fit yields robust estimates of thefrequencies, linewidths and amplitudes of the modes. we find amplitudes ofabout 5.6 +/- 0.8 ppm for radial modes at the maximum of the signal. thelifetimes of the modes range from one day (at high frequency) to a bit morethan two days (at low frequency). significant peaks are found outside theidentified ridges and are fitted. they are attributed to mixed modes.

1003.5178	inpainting: a powerful interpolation technique for helio- and  asteroseismic data	in helio- and asteroseismology, it is important to have continuous,uninterrupted, data sets. however, seismic observations usually contain gapsand we need to take them into account. in particular, if the gaps are notrandomly distributed, they will produce a peak and a series of harmonics in theperiodogram that will destroy the stellar information. an interpolation of thedata can be good solution for this problem. in this paper we have studied aninterpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. to checkthe algorithm, we used both virgo and corot satellite data to which we applieda realistic artificial window of a real corot observing run to introduce gaps.next we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. therefore,we were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between thepower spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. ingeneral, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is verysimilar to the original, unperturbed one. seismic inferences obtained afterinterpolating the data are the same as in the original case.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1104.0630	the underlying physical meaning of the $\nu_{\rm max}-\nu_{\rm c}$  relation	asteroseismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations are enjoying agrowing interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with thecorot and kepler missions. in this framework, scaling laws betweenasteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools tostudy a rich variety of stars. however, the physical underlying mechanisms ofthose scaling laws are still poorly known. our objective is to provide atheoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in thepower spectrum ($\nu_{\rm max}$) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-offfrequency ($\nu_{\rm c}$). using the soho golf observations together withtheoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height inoscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called \emph{plateau} of thedamping rates. the physical origin of the plateau can be traced to thedestabilizing effect of the lagrangian perturbation of entropy in theupper-most layers which becomes important when the modal period and the localthermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. based on this analysis, we thenfind a linear relation between $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\nu_{\rm c}$, with acoefficient that depends on the ratio of the mach number of the excitingturbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1109.0869	verification of the kepler input catalog from asteroseismology of  solar-type stars	we calculate precise stellar radii and surface gravities from theasteroseismic analysis of over 500 solar-type pulsating stars observed by thekepler space telescope. these physical stellar properties are compared withthose given in the kepler input catalog (kic), determined from ground-basedmulti-color photometry. for the stars in our sample, we find general agreementbut we detect an average overestimation bias of 0.23 dex in the kicdetermination of log (g) for stars with log (g)_kic &gt; 4.0 dex, and a resultantunderestimation bias of up to 50% in the kic radii estimates for stars withr_kic &lt; 2 r sun. part of the difference may arise from selection bias in theasteroseismic sample; nevertheless, this result implies there may be fewerstars characterized in the kic with r ~ 1 r sun than is suggested by thephysical properties in the kic. furthermore, if the radius estimates are takenfrom the kic for these affected stars and then used to calculate the size oftransiting planets, a similar underestimation bias may be applied to theplanetary radii.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1109.3460	testing scaling relations for solar-like oscillations from the main  sequence to red giants using kepler data	we have analyzed solar-like oscillations in ~1700 stars observed by thekepler mission, spanning from the main-sequence to the red clump. usingevolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequencyof maximum power (nu_max), the large frequency separation (delta_nu) andoscillation amplitudes. we show that the difference of the delta_nu-nu_maxrelation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by differentdistributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with whatis expected from scaling relations. for oscillation amplitudes, we show thatneither (l/m)^s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by kjeldsen &amp; bedding(2011) are accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scalingrelation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculateamplitudes from the main-sequence to red-giants to a precision of ~25%. theresiduals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that anadditional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observedamplitudes. we investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellaractivity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is mostpronounced for subgiant stars. finally, we test the location of the cool edgeof the instability strip in the hertzsprung-russell diagram using solar-likeoscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with adomain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.

1110.0980	characterization of the power excess of solar-like oscillations in red  giants with kepler	we aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in kepler redgiants, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing theseparameters. from these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties ofred giant oscillations. various different methods were compared in order tovalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. for consistency, asingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevantglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of thebackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of thepower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility ofnon-radial modes. a method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillationspectrum. the comparison of the different methods has shown the important roleof the way the background is modelled. the convergence reached by thecollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning theoscillation power excess. we obtain several scaling relations, and identify theinfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. the effect of heliumburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strongmass-radius relation for clump stars. we find that none of the amplitudescaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observedmode amplitudes of red giant stars. in parallel, the degree-dependent modevisibility exhibits important variations. both effects seem related to thesignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. a familyof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties areanalyzed.

1206.3312	seismic evidence for a rapidly rotating core in a lower-giant-branch  star observed with kepler	rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and theevolution of stars. however, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport instars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account instellar models. to achieve a better understanding of these processes, wedesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,which until very recently were restricted to the sun. in this paper, we reportthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in thecore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giantkic7341231, which was observed during one year with the kepler spacecraft. byperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show thatits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able todetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. we then find astellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismicproperties of the star. we use this model to perform inversions of the internalrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of thestar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. this will shednew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. inparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angularmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, whichcould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed overthe last decades.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1211.0146	galactic archaeology: mapping and dating stellar populations with  asteroseismology of red-giant stars	our understanding of how the galaxy was formed and evolves is severelyhampered by the lack of precise constraints on basic stellar properties such asdistances, masses, and ages. here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giantsrepresent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning alarge age range, which can be used to map and date the galactic disc in theregions probed by observations made by the corot and kepler space telescopes.when combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of suchevolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but alsoprovide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxiesfor the ages of the stars. as a first application we consider red giantsobserved by corot in two different parts of the milky way, and determineprecise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of thegalactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solarneighbourhood. we find significant differences in the mass distributions ofthese two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models ofthe milky way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in thedistribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. in the future, theavailability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will notonly improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints onage-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different galactocentric radiiand heights from the plane.

1211.0153	constraining the core-rotation rate in red-giant stars from kepler space  photometry	rotation plays a key role in stellar structure and its evolution. throughtransport processes which induce rotational mixing of chemical species and theredistribution of angular momentum, internal stellar rotation influences theevolutionary tracks in the hertzsprung-russell diagram. in turn, evolutioninfluences the rotational properties. therefore, information on the rotationalproperties of the deep interior would help to better understand the stellarevolution. however, as the internal rotational profile cannot be measureddirectly, it remains a major unknown leaving this important aspect of modelsunconstrained. we can test for nonrigid rotation inside the stars withasteroseismology. through the effect of rotational splitting of non-radialoscillation modes, we investigate the internal rotation profile indirectly. redgiants have very slow rotation rates leading to a rotational splitting on thelevel of a few tenth of a \mu hz. only from more than 1.5 years of consecutivedata from the nasa kepler space telescope, these tiny variations could beresolved. a qualitative comparison to theoretical models allowed constrainingthe core-to-surface rotation rate for some of these evolved stars. in thispaper, we report on the first results of a large sample study of splitting ofindividual dipole modes.

1211.1271	seismic diagnostics for transport of angular momentum in stars 1.  rotational splittings from the pms to the rgb	rotational splittings are currently measured for several main sequence starsand a large number of red giants with the space mission kepler. this willprovide stringent constraints on rotation profiles. our aim is to obtainseismic constraints on the internal transport and surface loss of angularmomentum of oscillating solar-like stars. to this end, we study the evolutionof rotational splittings from the pre-main sequence to the red-giant branch forstochastically excited oscillation modes. we modified the evolutionary codecesam2k to take rotationally induced transport in radiative zones into account.linear rotational splittings were computed for a sequence of $1.3 m_{\odot}$models. rotation profiles were derived from our evolutionary models andeigenfunctions from linear adiabatic oscillation calculations. we find thattransport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high acore rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent seismicobservations. we discuss several uncertainties in the physical description ofstars that could have an impact on the rotation profiles. for instance, we findthat the goldreich-schubert-fricke instability does not extract enough angularmomentum from the core to account for the discrepancy. in contrast, an increaseof the horizontal turbulent viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able tosignificantly decrease the central rotation rate on the red-giant branch. ourresults indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the horizontalturbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value or else a mechanismnot included in current stellar models of low mass stars is needed to slow downthe rotation in the radiative core of red-giant stars.

1211.1546	seismic diagnostics for transport of angular momentum in stars 2.  interpreting observed rotational splittings of slowly-rotating red giant  stars	asteroseismology with the space-borne missions corot and kepler provides apowerful mean of testing the modeling of transport processes in stars.rotational splittings are currently measured for a large number of red giantstars and can provide stringent constraints on the rotation profiles. the aimof this paper is to obtain a theoretical framework for understanding theproperties of the observed rotational splittings of red giant stars with slowlyrotating cores. this allows us to establish appropriate seismic diagnostics forrotation of these evolved stars. rotational splittings for stochasticallyexcited dipolar modes are computed adopting a first-order perturbative approachfor two $1.3 m_\odot$ benchmark models assuming slowly rotating cores. for redgiant stars with slowly rotating cores, we show that the variation of therotational splittings of $\ell=1$ modes with frequency depends only on thelarge frequency separation, the g-mode period spacing, and the ratio of theaverage envelope to core rotation rates (${\cal r}$). this leds us to propose away to infer directly ${\cal r}$ from the observations. this method isvalidated using the kepler red giant star kic 5356201. finally, we provide atheoretical support for the use of a lorentzian profile to measure the observedsplittings for red giant stars.

1212.1687	asymptotic and measured large frequency separations	with the space-borne missions corot and kepler, a large amount ofasteroseismic data is now available. so-called global oscillation parametersare inferred to characterize the large sets of stars, to perform ensembleasteroseismology, and to derive scaling relations. the mean large separation issuch a key parameter. it is therefore crucial to measure it with the highestaccuracy. as the conditions of measurement of the large separation do notcoincide with its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressionsused for analysing the observed oscillation spectra. then, we examine theconsequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of themean large separation. the analysis is focused on radial modes. we use seriesof radial-mode frequencies to compare the asymptotic and observational valuesof the large separation. we propose a simple formulation to correct theobserved value of the large separation and then derive its asymptoticcounterpart. we prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structurediscontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars tored giants. our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as inthe theoretical development. high-quality solar-like oscillation spectraderived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better describedwith the second-order asymptotic expansion. the second-order term isresponsible for the curvature observed in the \'echelle diagrams used foranalysing the oscillation spectra and this curvature is responsible for thedifference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation.taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations providingmore accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius.

1302.0858	asteroseismic classification of stellar populations among 13000 red  giants observed by kepler	of the more than 150000 targets followed by the kepler mission, about 10%were selected as red giants. due to their high scientific value, in particularfor galaxy population studies and stellar structure and evolution, their keplerlight curves were made public in late 2011. more than 13000 (over 85%) of thesestars show intrinsic flux variability caused by solar-like oscillations makingthem ideal for large scale asteroseismic investigations. we automaticallyextracted individual frequencies and measured the period spacings of the dipolemodes in nearly every red giant. these measurements naturally classify thestars into various populations, such as the red giant branch, the low-mass(m/msol &lt; 1.8) helium-core-burning red clump, and the higher-mass (m/msol &gt;1.8) secondary clump. the period spacings also reveal that a large fraction ofthe stars show rotationally induced frequency splittings. this sample of starswill undoubtedly provide an extremely valuable source for studying the stellarpopulation in the direction of the kepler field, in particular when combinedwith complementary spectroscopic surveys.

1305.6586	asteroseismic surface gravity for evolved stars	context: asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance indetermining spectroscopic stellar parameters. the independent log(g) value fromasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis toreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. since 2012, a combined analysisof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing fora large survey with sdss/apogee and kepler. therefore, knowledge of anypotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is nowbecoming important. aims: the seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is thefrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). here, we investigate theinfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)values. the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive radial orders (dnu) is often used as an additional constraint forthe determination of log(g). additionally, we checked the influence of smallcorrections applied to dnu on the derived values of log(g). methods we usemethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and dnutogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derivelog(g). results: we find that different approaches to derive oscillationparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases forred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. these biases are well within the quoteduncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). corrections suggested in the literature tothe dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). however somewhatunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the orderof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar referencevalues are used.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

1309.1488	stellar granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity. ii.  theoretical scaling relations compared with observations	a large set of stars observed by corot and kepler shows clear evidence forthe presence of a stellar background, which is interpreted to arise fromsurface convection, i.e., granulation. these observations show that thecharacteristic time-scale (tau_eff) and the root-mean-square (rms) brightnessfluctuations (sigma) associated with the granulation scale as a function of thepeak frequency (nu_max) of the solar-like oscillations. we aim at providing atheoretical background to the observed scaling relations based on a modeldeveloped in the companion paper. we computed for each 3d model the theoreticalpower density spectrum (pds) associated with the granulation as seen indisk-integrated intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. for each pdswe derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with thetheoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the keplermeasurements. we derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. inaddition, we show that these quantities also scale as a function of theturbulent mach number (ma) estimated at the photosphere. the theoreticalscaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well on a globalscale. our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observedvariations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. it also highlights the importantrole of ma in controlling the properties of the stellar granulation. however,the observations made with kepler on a wide variety of stars cannot confirm thedependence of our scaling relations on ma. measurements of the granulationbackground and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statisticallysufficient number of cool dwarf stars will be required for confirming thedependence of the theoretical scaling relations with ma.

1310.0839	period-luminosity relations in evolved red giants explained by  solar-like oscillations	solar-like oscillations in red giants have been investigated with corot andkepler, while pulsations in more evolved m giants have been studied withground-based microlensing surveys. after 3.1 years of observation with kepler,it is now possible to make a link between these different observations ofsemi-regular variables. we aim to identify period-luminosity sequences inevolved red giants identified as semi-regular variables. then, we investigatethe consequences of the comparison of ground-based and space-borneobservations. we have first measured global oscillation parameters of evolvedred giants observed with kepler with the envelope autocorrelation functionmethod. we then used an extended form of the universal red giant oscillationpattern, extrapolated to very low frequency, to fully identify theiroscillations. from the link between red giant oscillations observed by keplerand period-luminosity sequences, we have identified these relations in evolvedred giants as radial and non-radial solar-like oscillations. we were able toexpand scaling relations at very low frequency. this helped us to identify thedifferent sequences of period-luminosity relations, and allowed us to propose acalibration of the k magnitude with the observed frequency large separation.interpreting period-luminosity relations in red giants in terms of solar-likeoscillations allows us to investigate, with a firm physical basis, the timeseries obtained from ground-based microlensing surveys. this can be done withan analytical expression that describes the low-frequency oscillation spectra.the different behavior of oscillations at low frequency, with frequencyseparations scaling only approximately with the square root of the mean stellardensity, can be used to address precisely the physics of the semi-regularvariables.

1311.6990	study of kic 8561221 observed by kepler: an early red giant showing  depressed dipolar modes	the continuous high-precision photometric observations provided by the corotand kepler space missions have allowed us to better understand the structureand dynamics of red giants using asteroseismic techniques. a small fraction ofthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. the reductionin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximumpower. in this work we want to characterize kic 8561221 in order to confirmthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and todiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipolemode amplitudes. we used kepler short- and long-cadence data combined withspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of kic8561221. we then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to thereduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or theeffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. we also performed adetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. we have been able tocharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes abovenu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. we have inferred a surfacerotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation inthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. as expected, theinternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 timesfaster than the surface. with our grid of standard models we are able toproperly fit the observed frequencies. our model calculation of mode inertiaand damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. a fast rotatingcore is also ruled out as a possible explanation. finally, we do not have anyobservational evidence of the presence of a strong deep magnetic field insidethe star.

1312.4500	pulsating red giant stars in eccentric binary systems discovered from  kepler space-based photometry	the unparalleled photometric data obtained by nasa's kepler space telescopeled to an improved understanding of red giant stars and binary stars.seismology allows us to constrain the properties of red giants. in addition toeclipsing binaries, eccentric non-eclipsing binaries, exhibiting ellipsoidalmodulations, have been detected with kepler. we aim to study the properties ofeccentric binary systems containing a red giant star and derive the parametersof the primary giant component. we apply asteroseismic techniques to determinemasses and radii of the primary component of each system. for a selectedtarget, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques are applied toextract the parameters of the system. the effects of stellar on the binarysystem are studied. the paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radiiwere constrained. the orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to440days. from radial velocity measurements we find eccentricities between e=0.2to 0.76. as a case study we present a detailed analysis of kic5006817. fromseismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least165 d, roughly twice the orbital period. the stellar core rotates 13 timesfaster than the surface. from the spectrum and radial velocities we expect thatthe doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300ppm in thelight curve. through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondarycomponent to be 0.29$\pm$0.03\,$m_\odot$. for kic5006817 we excludepseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. the comparison ofthe results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possiblealignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2$\sigma$ level. red gianteccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hotsubdwarf b stars.

1408.0817	the connection between stellar granulation and oscillation as seen by  the kepler mission	the long and almost continuous observations by kepler show clear evidence ofa granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, which isinterpreted as the surface manifestation of convection. it has been shown thatits characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peakfrequency (\nu_{max}) of the solar-like oscillations. various attempts havebeen made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations, andto compare them to theoretical predictions. we use a probabilistic method tocompare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. we fit thepower density spectra of a large set of kepler targets, determine thegranulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relationsbetween them. we establish that a depression in power at about \nu_{max}/2,known from the sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statisticallysignificant in red giants and that a super-lorentzian function with twocomponents is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broadervicinity of the pulsation power excess. we also establish that the specificchoice of the background model can affect the determination of \nu_{max},introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the randomuncertainties. we find the characteristic background frequency and amplitude totightly scale with \nu_{max} for a wide variety of stars, and quantify a massdependency of the latter. to enable comparison with theoretical predictions, wecomputed effective timescales and intensity fluctuations and found them toapproximately scale as \tau_{eff} \propto g^{-0.85}\,t^{-0.4} and a_{gran}\propto (g^2m)^{-1/4}, respectively. similarly, the bolometric pulsationamplitude scales approximately as a_{puls} \propto (g^2m)^{-1/3}, whichimplicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of a_{puls}.

1505.05447	angular momentum redistribution by mixed modes in evolved low-mass  stars. i. theoretical formalism	seismic observations by the space-borne mission \emph{kepler} have shown thatthe core of red giant stars slows down while evolving, requiring an efficientphysical mechanism to extract angular momentum from the inner layers. currentstellar evolution codes fail to reproduce the observed rotation rates byseveral orders of magnitude, and predict a drastic spin-up of red giant coresinstead. new efficient mechanisms of angular momentum transport are thusrequired.  in this framework, our aim is to investigate the possibility that mixed modesextract angular momentum from the inner radiative regions of evolved low-massstars. to this end, we consider the transformed eulerian mean (tem) formalism,introduced by andrews \&amp; mcintyre (1978), that allows us to consider thecombined effect of both the wave momentum flux in the mean angular momentumequation and the wave heat flux in the mean entropy equation as well as theirinterplay with the meridional circulation.  in radiative layers of evolved low-mass stars, the quasi-adiabaticapproximation, the limit of slow rotation, and the asymptotic regime can beapplied for mixed modes and enable us to establish a prescription for the wavefluxes in the mean equations. the formalism is finally applied to a $1.3m_\odot$ benchmark model, representative of observed corot and \emph{kepler}oscillating evolved stars.  we show that the influence of the wave heat flux on the mean angular momentumis not negligible and that the overall effect of mixed modes is to extractangular momentum from the innermost region of the star. a quantitative andaccurate estimate requires realistic values of mode amplitudes. this isprovided in a companion paper.

1505.05452	angular momentum redistribution by mixed modes in evolved low-mass  stars. ii. spin-down of the core of red giants induced by mixed modes	the detection of mixed modes in subgiants and red giants by the corot and\emph{kepler} space-borne missions allows us to investigate the internalstructure of evolved low-mass stars. in particular, the measurement of the meancore rotation rate as a function of the evolution places stringent constraintson the physical mechanisms responsible for the angular momentum redistributionin stars. it showed that the current stellar evolution codes including themodelling of rotation fail to reproduce the observations. an additionalphysical process that efficiently extracts angular momentum from the core isthus necessary.  our aim is to assess the ability of mixed modes to do this. to this end, wedeveloped a formalism that provides a modelling of the wave fluxes in both themean angular momentum and the mean energy equations in a companion paper. inthis article, mode amplitudes are modelled based on recent asteroseismicobservations, and a quantitative estimate of the angular momentum transfer isobtained. this is performed for a benchmark model of 1.3 $m_{\odot}$ at threeevolutionary stages, representative of the evolved pulsating stars observed bycorot and kepler.  we show that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the innermost regionsof subgiants and red giants. however, this transport of angular momentum fromthe core is unlikely to counterbalance the effect of the core contraction insubgiants and early red giants. in contrast, for more evolved red giants, mixedmodes are found efficient enough to balance and exceed the effect of the corecontraction, in particular in the hydrogen-burning shell. our results thusindicate that mixed modes are a promising candidate to explain the observedspin-down of the core of evolved red giants, but that an other mechanism is tobe invoked for subgiants and early red giants.

1505.07280	helium signature in red giant oscillation patterns observed by kepler	the space-borne missions corot and kepler have provided a large amount ofprecise photometric data. among the stars observed, red giants show a richoscillation pattern that allows their precise characterization. long-durationobservations allow for investigating the fine structure of this oscillationpattern. a common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giantstars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotictheory. this pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern,describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. we aim to investigate thedeviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them interms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium. we also show howthis seismic signature depends on stellar evolution. we measured thefrequencies of radial modes with a maximum likelihood estimator method, then weidentified a modulation corresponding to the departure from the universaloscillation pattern. we identify the modulation component of the radial modefrequency spacings in more than five hundred red giants. the variation in themodulation that we observe at different evolutionary states brings newconstraints on the interior models for these stars. we also derive an updatedform of the universal pattern that accounts for the modulation and provideshighly precise radial frequencies.

1506.02704	seismic evidence for a weak radial differential rotation in  intermediate-mass core helium burning stars	the detection of mixed modes that are split by rotation in kepler red giantshas made it possible to probe the internal rotation profiles of these stars,which brings new constraints on the transport of angular momentum in stars.mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates in the central regions ofintermediate-mass core helium burning stars (secondary clump stars). our aimwas to exploit&amp; the rotational splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amountof radial differential rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars usingkepler data, in order to place constraints on angular momentum transport inintermediate-mass stars. we selected a subsample of kepler secondary clumpstars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. by applying athorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings of bothgravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and p-dominated modes(trapped in the envelope) can be measured. we then used these splittings toestimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques andby applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (goupil et al.2013). we obtained evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six ofthe seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating$1.8\pm0.3$ to $3.2\pm1.0$ times faster than the envelope. the last target wasfound to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. this demonstrates that anefficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the mainsequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during theshort-lived subgiant phase, or once he-burning has started in the core. ineither case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transportmechanisms that are at work.

1506.08931	oscillating red giants observed during campaign 1 of the kepler k2  mission: new prospects for galactic archaeology	nasa's re-purposed kepler mission -- dubbed k2 -- has brought new scientificopportunities that were not anticipated for the original kepler mission. onescience goal that makes optimal use of k2's capabilities, in particular its360-degree ecliptic field of view, is galactic archaeology -- the study of theevolution of the galaxy from the fossil stellar record. the thrust of thisresearch is to exploit high-precision, time-resolved photometry from k2 inorder to detect oscillations in red giant stars. this asteroseismic informationcan provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass and age of vastnumbers of stars across the galaxy. here we present the initial analysis of asubset of red giants, observed towards the north galactic gap, during themission's first full science campaign. we investigate the feasibility of usingk2 data for detecting oscillations in red giants that span a range in apparentmagnitude and evolutionary state (hence intrinsic luminosity). we demonstratethat oscillations are detectable for essentially all cool giants within the$\log g$ range $\sim 1.9-3.2$. our detection is complete down to$\mathit{kp}\sim 14.5$, which results in a seismic sample with little or nodetection bias. this sample is ideally suited to stellar population studiesthat seek to investigate potential shortcomings of contemporary galaxy models.

1509.06193	period spacings in red giants i. disentangling rotation and revealing  core structure discontinuities	asteroseismology allows us to probe the physical conditions inside the coreof red giant stars. this relies on the properties of the global oscillationswith a mixed character that are highly sensitive to the physical properties ofthe core. however, overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacingsresult in complex structures in the mixed-mode pattern, which severelycomplicates its identification and the measurement of the asymptotic periodspacing. this work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings from themixed-mode spacings, in order to open the way to a fully automated analysis oflarge data sets. an analytical development of the mixed-mode asymptoticexpansion is used to derive the period spacing between two consecutive mixedmodes. the \'echelle diagrams constructed with the appropriately stretchedperiods are used to exhibit the structure of the gravity modes and of therotational splittings. we propose a new view on the mixed-mode oscillationpattern based on corrected periods, called stretched periods, that mimic theevenly spaced gravity-mode pattern. this provides a direct understanding of alloscillation components, even in the case of rapid rotation. the measurement ofthe asymptotic period spacing and the signature of the structural glitches onmixed modes are then made easy. this work opens the possibility to derive allseismic global parameters in an automated way, including the identification ofthe different rotational multiplets and the measurement of the rotationalsplitting, even when this splitting is significantly larger than the periodspacing. revealing buoyancy glitches provides a detailed view on the radiativecore.

1510.00300	surface-effect corrections for solar-like oscillations using 3d  hydrodynamical simulations	the space-borne missions have provided us with a wealth of high-qualityobservational data that allows for seismic inferences of stellar interiors.this requires the computation of precise and accurate theoretical frequencies,but imperfect modeling of the uppermost stellar layers introduces systematicerrors. to overcome this problem, an empirical correction has been introducedby kjeldsen et al. (2008, apj, 683, l175) and is now commonly used for seismicinferences. nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing forthe quantification of the surface-effect corrections. we used a grid of thesesimulations computed with the co$^5$bold code to model the outer layers ofsolar-like stars. upper layers of the corresponding 1d standard models werethen replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3d models.the frequency differences between these patched models and the 1d standardmodels were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us toconstrain the kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a lorentzian formulation.we find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly onboth the effective temperature and the surface gravity. we further provide thevariation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections usingtheir power law as well as a lorentzian formulation. scaling relations betweenthese parameters and the elevation (related to the mach number) is alsoprovided. the lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the wholefrequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequencyshifts in the frequency range above $\nu_{\rm max}$.

1511.06160	internal rotation of the red-giant star kic 4448777 by means of  asteroseismic inversion	in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the earlyred-giant star kic 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of thedipole mixed modes obtained from {\it kepler} observations. in order toovercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods toextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. we find not onlythat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversionresults generated for other red giants (deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but wealso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core witha spatial resolution of $\delta r=0.001r$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharpdiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (deheuvels et al. 2014). theresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity ofabout $\langle\omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nhz and provide evidence for anangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part ofthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize therotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. theangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burningshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reachingan average value in the convective envelope of$\langle\omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nhz. hence, the core in kic~4448777 isrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficientto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the densecore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiativeregion and in the convective envelope.
