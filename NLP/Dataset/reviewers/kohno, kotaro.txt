0706.1353	new 60-cm radio survey telescope with the sideband-separating sis  receiver for the 200 ghz band	we have upgraded the 60-cm radio survey telescope located in nobeyama, japan.we developed a new waveguide-type sideband-separating sis mixer for thetelescope, which enables the simultaneous detection of distinct molecularemission lines both in the upper and lower sidebands. over the rf frequencyrange of 205-240 ghz, the single-sideband receiver noise temperatures of thenew mixer are 40-100 k for the 4.0-8.0 ghz if frequency band. the imagerejection ratios are greater than 10 db over the same range. for the dual ifsignals obtained by the receiver, we have developed two sets of acousto-opticalspectrometers and a telescope control system. using the new telescope system,we successfully detected the 12co (j=2-1) and 13co (j=2-1) emission linessimultaneously toward orion kl in 2005 march. using the waveguide-typesideband-separating sis mixer for the 200 ghz band, we have initiated the firstsimultaneous 12co (j=2-1) and 13co (j=2-1) survey of the galactic plane as wellas large-scale mapping observations of nearby molecular clouds.

0901.3388	a search for molecular gas toward a bzk-selected star-forming galaxy at  z = 2.044	we present a search for co(3-2) emission in sdf-26821, a bzk-selectedstar-forming galaxy (sbzk) at z = 2.044, using the 45-m telescope of thenobeyama radio observatory and the nobeyama millimeter array. we do not detectsignificant emission and derive 2 \sigma limits: the co luminosity of l'co &lt;3.1 x 10^10 k km s^{-1} pc^{-2}, the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to columinosity of l_fir/l'co &gt; 57 lsun (k km s^{-1} pc^{-2})^{-1}, and themolecular gas mass of m_h2 &lt; 2.5 x 10^10 msun, assuming a velocity width of 200km s^{-1} and a co-to-h2 conversion factor of alpha_co=0.8 msun (k km s^{-1}pc^{-2})^{-1}. the ratio of l_fir/l'co, a measure of star formation efficiency(sfe), is comparable to or higher than the two z ~ 1.5 sbzks detected inco(2-1) previously, suggesting that sbzks can have a wide range of sfes.comparisons of far-infrared luminosity, gas mass, and stellar mass among thesbzks suggest that sdf-26821 is at an earlier stage of forming stars with asimilar sfe and/or more efficiently forming stars than the two z ~ 1.5 sbzks.the higher sfes and specific star formation rates of the sbzks compared tolocal spirals are indicative of the difference in star formation modes betweenthese systems, suggesting that sbzks are not just scaled-up versions of localspirals.

0904.3121	determining star formation timescale and pattern speed in nearby spiral  galaxies	we present a revised method for simultaneous determination of the patternspeed and star formation timescale of spiral galaxies, its application, andresults for co and ha images of nearby spiral galaxies. out of 13 galaxies, wewere able to derive the 2 parameters for 5 galaxies. we categorize them as "c"galaxies, and find (1) the corotation radius is close to the edge of the codata, and is about half of the optical radius for 3 galaxies. (2) the starformation timescale is roughly consistent with the free-fall time of typicalmolecular clouds, which indicates that the gravitational instability is thedominant mechanism triggering star formation in spiral arms. (3) the timescaleis found to be almost independent of surface density of molecular gas,metallicity, or spiral arm strengths. the number of "c" galaxies and thequality of co data, however, are not enough to confirm these relationships. wealso find that 2 other galaxies show no offsets between co and ha, althoughtheir arms are clearly traced, and categorize them as "n" galaxies. thepresence of a bar could account for this feature, since these 2 galaxies areboth barred. with one galaxy excluded from our analysis due to its poorrotation curve, offsets of the remaining 5 galaxies are found to be ambiguous.we categorize them as "a" galaxies. the possible reasons for this ambiguity are(1) the density wave is weaker, and/or (2) observational resolution andsensitivity are not enough to detect the spiral arms and their offsets clearly.the former is supported by our finding that the arm strengths of "a" galaxiesare slightly weaker than that of "c" galaxies.

0905.0890	spatial correlation between submillimetre and lyman-alpha galaxies in  the ssa 22 protocluster	lyman-alpha emitters are thought to be young, low-mass galaxies with ages of~10^8 yr. an overdensity of them in one region of the sky (the ssa 22 field)traces out a filamentary structure in the early universe at a redshift of z =3.1 (equivalent to 15 per cent of the age of the universe) and is believed tomark a forming protocluster. galaxies that are bright at (sub)millimetrewavelengths are undergoing violent episodes of star formation, and there isevidence that they are preferentially associated with high-redshift radiogalaxies, so the question of whether they are also associated with the mostsignificant large-scale structure growing at high redshift (as outlined bylyman-alpha emitters) naturally arises. here we report an imaging survey of1,100-um emission in the ssa 22 region. we find an enhancement of submillimetregalaxies near the core of the protocluster, and a large-scale correlationbetween the submillimetre galaxies and the low-mass lyman-alpha emitters,suggesting synchronous formation of the two very different types ofstar-forming galaxy within the same structure at high redshift. these resultsare in general agreement with our understanding of the formation of cosmicstructure.

1001.1764	an investigation of the dust content in the galaxy pair ngc 1512/1510  from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths	we combine new aste/aztec 1.1 mm maps of the galaxy pair ngc 1512/1510 witharchival spitzer irac and mips images covering the wavelength range 3.6--160 umfrom the sings project to derive accurate dust masses in each galaxy, and insub--galactic regions in ngc 1512. the two galaxies form a pair consisting of alarge, high--metallicity spiral (ngc 1512) and a low metallicity, blue compactdwarf (ngc 1510). the derived total dust masses are (2.4+/-0.6) 10^7 msun and(1.7+/-3.6) 10^5 msun for ngc 1512 and ngc 1510, respectively. the derivedratio of dust mass to h i gas mass for the galaxy pair (0.0034) is much lowerthan expected, while regions within ngc 1512, specifically the central regionand the arms, do not show such unusually low ratios; furthermore, thedust--to--gas ratio is within expectations for ngc 1510. these results suggestthat a fraction of the h i included in the determination of the m_d/m_hi ratioof the ngc 1512/1510 pair is not associated with the star forming disks/regionsof either galaxy. we also perform simple two--temperature (warm + cold)modified--blackbody fits to the far--infrared/mm data. the warm dusttemperature of the low--metallicity ngc 1510 (~36 k) is substantially higherthan that of the high--metallicity ngc 1512 (~24 k). in both galaxies, asubstantial fraction (&gt;93%) of the total dust mass is in a cool dust component,with temperatures 14--16 k for ngc 1512 and 15--24 k for ngc 1510. in contrast,the warm dust in the arms and central regions of ngc 1512 represents a muchlarger fraction of the total dust content, in agreement with the fact that allthree regions have higher specific star formation rates than the average in thegalaxy.

1002.1853	dense and warm molecular gas and warm dust in nearby galaxies	we performed 12co(1-0), 13co(1-0), and hcn(1-0) single-dish observations(beam size ~14"-18") toward nearby starburst and non-starburst galaxies usingthe nobeyama 45 m telescope. the 13co(1-0) and hcn(1-0) emissions were detectedfrom all the seven starburst galaxies, with the intensities of both lines beingsimilar (i.e., the ratios are around unity). on the other hand, for case of thenon-starburst galaxies, the 13co(1-0) emission was detected from all threegalaxies, while the hcn(1-0) emission was weakly or not detected in pastobservations. this result indicates that the hcn/13co intensity ratios aresignificantly larger (~1.15+-0.32) in the starburst galaxy samples than thenon-starburst galaxy samples (&lt;0.31+-0.14). the large-velocity-gradient modelsuggests that the molecular gas in the starburst galaxies have warmer anddenser conditions than that in the non-starburst galaxies, and thephoton-dominated-region model suggests that the denser molecular gas isirradiated by stronger interstellar radiation field in the starburst galaxiesthan that in the non-starburst galaxies. in addition, hcn/13co in our samplegalaxies exhibit strong correlations with the iras 25 micron flux ratios. it isa well established fact that there exists a strong correlation between densemolecular gas and star formation activities, but our results suggest thatmolecular gas temperature is also an important parameter.

1106.2930	nuclear radio continuum emission of low-luminosity active galactic  nucleus ngc 4258	the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (llagn) ngc 4258 has a weakradio continuum emission at the galactic center. quasi-simultaneousmulti-frequency observations using the very large array (vla) from 5 ghz (6 cm)to 22 ghz (1.3 cm) showed inverted spectra in all epochs, which wereintra-month variable, as well as complicated spectral features that cannot berepresented by a simple power law, indicating multiple blobs in nuclear jets.using the nobeyama millimeter array (nma), we discovered a large amplitudevariable emission at 100 ghz (3 mm), which had higher flux densities at mostepochs than those of the vla observations. a james clerk maxwell telescope(jcmt) observation at 347 ghz (850 micron) served an upper limit of dustcontamination. the inverted radio spectrum of the nucleus ngc 4258 issuggestive of an analogy to our galactic center sgr a*, but with three ordersof magnitude higher radio luminosity. in addition to the llagn m 81, we discussthe nucleus of ngc 4258 as another up-scaled version of sgr a*.

1106.4115	nro m33 all disk survey of giant molecular clouds (nro magic): i. hi to  h_2 transition	we present the results of the nobeyama radio observatory (nro) m33 all disk(30'x30' or 7.3 kpc x 7.3 kpc) survey of giant molecular clouds (nro magic)based on 12co (1-0) observations using the nro 45-m telescope. the spatialresolution of the resultant map is 19".3, corresponding to 81 pc, which issufficient to identify each giant molecular cloud (gmc) in the disk. we foundclumpy structures with a typical spatial scale of ~100 pc, corresponding togmcs, and no diffuse, smoothly distributed component of molecular gas at thissensitivity. closer inspection of the co and hi maps suggests that not every coemission is associated with local hi peaks, particularly in the inner portionof the disk (r &lt; 2 kpc), although most of co emission is located at the localhi peaks in the outer radii. we found that most uncovered gmcs are accompaniedby massive star-forming regions, although the star formation rates (sfrs) varywidely from cloud to cloud. the azimuthally averaged h{\sc i} gas surfacedensity exhibits a flat radial distribution. however, the co radialdistribution shows a significant enhancement within the central 1-2 kpc region,which is very similar to that of the sfr. we obtained a map of the molecularfraction, f_mol = sigma_h_2/(sigma_hi+sigma_h_2, at a 100-pc resolution. thisis the first f_mol map covering an entire galaxy with a gmc-scale resolution.we find that f_mol tends to be high near the center. the correlation betweenf_mol and gas surface density shows two distinct sequences. the presence of twocorrelation sequences can be explained by differences in metallicity, i.e.,higher (~ 2-fold) metallicity in the central region (r&lt; 1.5 kpc) than in theouter parts. alternatively, differences in scale height can also account forthe two sequences, i.e., increased scale height toward the outer disk.

0704.2818	compact starburst in the central regions of seyfert galaxies	we have conducted a high-resolution ``3d'' imaging survey of the co(1--0),hcn(1--0), and hco$^+$(1--0) lines toward the central a few kpc regions of theseyfert and starburst galaxies in the local universe using the nobeyamamillimeter array. we detected luminous hcn(1--0) emissions toward aconsiderable fraction of these seyfert galaxies (10 of 12 in our sub-sample),which indicated that some of these seyfert galaxies, such as ngc 3079, ngc3227, ngc 4051, ngc 6764, and ngc 7479, are indeed accompanied with compactnuclear starburst, given the tight correlation between the hcn(1--0) luminosityand the star formation rate among star-forming galaxies. however, we suggestthat the elevated hcn(1--0) emission from some of these seyfert galaxies,including ngc 1068, ngc 1097, ngc 5033, and ngc 5194, does not signify thepresence of massive starbursts there. this is because these seyfert nuclei showabnormally high hcn(1--0)/hco$^+$(1--0) ratios (2--3), which were neverobserved in the starburst nuclei in our sample. this could be attributed to theoverabundance of hcn molecules in the x-ray dominated regions (xdrs) at thecenters of these seyfert galaxies.

1201.0336	probing circumnuclear environments with the hcn(j = 3-2) and hco+(j =  3-2) lines: case of ngc 1097	we present the first interferometric hcn(j = 3-2) and hco+(j = 3-2) maps inthe circumnuclear region of ngc 1097, obtained with the submillimeter array.the goal is to study the characteristics of the dense gas associated with thestarburst ring/seyfert nucleus. with these transitions, we suppress the diffuselow density emission in the nuclear region. we detect and resolve theindividual compact giant molecular cloud associations (gmas) in the 1.4 kpccircumnuclear starburst ring and within the 350 pc nuclear region. the nucleusis brighter than the ring in both lines, and contributes to ~20% and ~30% tothe total detected hco+(j = 3-2) and hcn(j = 3-2) flux, within the central 1.4kpc. the intensity ratios of hcn(j = 3-2)/hco+(j = 3-2) are roughly unity inthe gmas of the starburst ring. however, this ratio is up to ~2 in the nuclearregion. from the hcn(j = 3-2)/hcn(j = 1-0) ratio of &lt;0.2 in the nucleus, weinfer that the nuclear hcn(j = 3-2) emission might be optically thin. thehco+(j = 3-2) and hcn(j = 3-2) show correlations with 12co(j = 3-2) and the24{\mu}m emission. the tight correlations of hcn(j = 3-2), hco+(j = 3-2) and24{\mu}m emission in the starburst ring suggest that the dense molecular gasand the dust are from the same origins of star forming regions. on the otherhand, the hcn(j = 3-2) emission of the nucleus is significantly enhanced,indicating mechanisms other than star formation, such as agn activities. aself-consistent check of the fractional abundance enhanced by x-ray ionizationchemistry of the nucleus is possible with our observations.

1204.3414	first detection of a sub-kpc scale molecular outflow in the starburst  galaxy ngc 3628	we successfully detected a molecular outflow with a scale of 370-450 pc inthe central region of the starburst galaxy ngc 3628 through deep co(1-0)observations by using the nobeyama millimeter array (nma). the mass of theoutflowing molecular gas is ~2.8x10^7 m_sun, and the outflow velocity is~90(+/-10) km s^{-1}. the expansion timescale of the outflow is 3.3-6.8 myr,and the molecular gas mass flow rate is 4.1-8.5 m_sun yr^{-1}. it requiresmechanical energy of (1.8-2.8)x10^{54} erg to create this sub-kpc scalemolecular outflow. in order to understand the evolution of the molecularoutflow, we compare the physical properties between the molecular outflowobserved from our nma co(1-0) data and the plasma gas from the soft x-rayemission of the chandra x-ray observatory (cxo) archival data. we found thatthe distribution between the molecular outflow and the strong plasma outflowseems to be in a similar region. in this region, the ram pressure and thethermal pressure of the plasma outflow are 10^{-(8-10)} dyne cm^{-2}, and thethermal pressure of molecular outflow is 10^{-(11-13)} dyne cm^{-2}. thisimplies the molecular outflow is still expanding outward. the molecular gasconsumption timescale is estimated as 17-27 myr, and the total starbursttimescale is 20-34 myr. the evolutionary parameter is 0.11-0.25, suggestingthat the starburst activity in ngc 3628 is still in a young stage.

0704.3654	a search for co(j=3-2) emission from the host galaxy of grb 980425 with  the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment	we report on a deep search for co(j=3-2) line emission from the host galaxyof grb 980425 with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). weobserved five points of the galaxy covering the entire region. after combiningall of the spectra, we obtained a global spectrum with the rms noise level of3.3 mk in t_mb scale at a velocity resolution of 10 km s^-1. no significantemission was detected, though we find a marginal emission feature in thevelocity range corresponding to the redshift of the galaxy. we derive 3 sigmaupper limits on the global properties: the velocity-integrated co(3-2)intensity of i_co(3-2) &lt; 0.26 k km s^-1 by adopting a velocity width of 67 kms^-1; the h_2 column density of n(h_2) &lt; 3 x 10^20 cm^-2; the molecular gasmass of m(h_2) &lt; 3 x 10^8 m_sun, by assuming a co line luminosity to h_2molecular gas mass conversion factor of x_co = 5.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1; and the star formation rate of sfr &lt; 0.1 m_sun yr^-1, based on theschmidt law. the sfr is consistent with the previous results of h_alpha andmid-ir observations, thereby suggesting that there is no significant obscuredstar formation in the host galaxy of grb 980425. this result implies that thereis a variety of grb hosts with regard to the presence of obscured starformation.

1210.3801	gmc evolutions in the nearby spiral galaxy m33	we present a giant molecular cloud (gmc) catalog toward m33, containing 71gmcs in total, based on wide field and high sensitivity co(j=3-2) observationswith a spatial resolution of 100 pc using the aste 10 m telescope. employingarchival optical data, we identify 75 young stellar groups (ysgs) from theexcess of the surface stellar density, and estimate their ages by comparingwith stellar evolution models. a spatial comparison among the gmcs, ysgs, andhii regions enable us to classify gmcs into four categories: type a showing nosign of massive star formation (sf), type b being associated only with hiiregions, type c with both hii regions and &lt;10 myr-old ysgs and type-d with bothhii regions and 10--30 myr ysgs. out of 65 gmcs (discarding those at the edgesof the observed fields), 1 (1%), 13 (20%), 29 (45%), and 22 (34%) are types a,b, c, and d, respectively. we interpret these categories as stages in a gmcevolutionary sequence. assuming that the timescale for each evolutionary stageis proportional to the number of gmcs, the lifetime of a gmc with a mass &gt;10^5mo is estimated to be 20--40 myr. in addition, we find that the dense gasfraction as traced by the co(j=3-2)/co(j=1-0) ratio is enhanced around sfregions. this confirms a scenario where dense gas is preferentially formedaround previously generated stars, and will be the fuel for the next stellargeneration. in this way, massive sf gradually propagates in a gmc until gas isexhausted.

1210.6285	nro m33 all-disk survey of giant molecular clouds (nro magic): ii. dense  gas formation within giant molecular clouds in m33	we report the results of our observations of the 12co (j=1-0) and 12co(j=3-2) line emission of 74 major giant molecular clouds (gmcs) within thegalactocentric distance of 5.1 kpc in the local group galaxy m33. theobservations have been conducted as part of the nobeyama radio observatory m33all-disk survey of giant molecular clouds project (nro magic). the spatialresolutions are 80 pc for 12co (j=1-0) and 100 pc for 12co (j=3-2). we detect12co (j=3-2) emission of 65 gmcs successfully. furthermore, we find that thecorrelation between the surface density of the star formation rate, which isderived from a linear combination of halpha and 24um emissions, and the 12co(j=3-2) integrated intensity still holds at this scale. this result show thatthe star-forming activity is closely associated with warm and dense gases thatare traced with the 12co (j=3-2) line, even in the scale of gmcs. we also findthat the gmcs with a high star-forming activity tend to show a high integratedintensity ratio (r3-2/1-0). moreover, we also observe a mass-dependent trend ofr3-2/1-0 for the gmcs with a low star-forming activity. from these results, wespeculate that the r3-2/1-0 values of the gmcs with a low star-forming activitymainly depend on the dense gas fraction and not on the temperature, andtherefore, the dense gas fraction increases with the mass of gmcs, at least inthe gmcs with a low star-forming activity.

1301.4757	nuclear radio jet from a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in ngc  4258	the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (llagn) ngc 4258 has a weakradio continuum component at the galactic center. we investigate its radiospectral properties on the basis of our new observations using the nobeyamamillimeter array at 100 ghz and archival data from the very large array (vla)at 1.7-43 ghz and the james clerk maxwell telescope at 347 ghz. the ngc 4258nuclear component exhibits (1) an intra-month variable and complicated spectralfeature at 5-22 ghz and (2) a slightly inverted spectrum at 5-100 ghz (aspectral index of ~0.3) in time-averaged flux densities, which are alsoapparent in the closest llagn m81. these similarities between ngc 4258 and m81in radio spectral natures in addition to previously known core shift in theirau-scale jet structures produce evidence that the same mechanism drives theirnuclei. we interpret the observed spectral property as the superposition ofemission spectra originating at different locations with frequency-dependentopacity along the nuclear jet. quantitative differences between ngc 4258 andm81 in terms of jet/counter jet ratio, radio loudness, and degree of core shiftcan be consistently understood by fairly relativistic speeds (bulk lorentzfactors of &gt;~ 3) of jet and their quite different inclinations. the pictureestablished from the two closest llagns is useful for understanding thephysical origin of unresolved and flat/inverted spectrum radio cores that areprevalently found in llagns, including sgr a*, with starved supermassive blackholes in the present-day universe.

1301.6171	submm/mm galaxy counterpart identification using a characteristic  density distribution	we present a new submm/mm galaxy counterpart identification technique whichbuilds on the use of spitzer irac colors as discriminators between likelycounterparts and the general irac galaxy population. using 102 radio- andsma-confirmed counterparts to aztec sources across three fields (goods-n,goods-s, and cosmos), we develop a non-parametric irac color-colorcharacteristic density distribution (cdd), which, when combined with positionaluncertainty information via likelihood ratios, allows us to rank all potentialirac counterparts around smgs and calculate the significance of each rankingvia the reliability factor. we report all robust and tentative radiocounterparts to smgs, the first such list available for aztec/cosmos, as wellas the highest ranked irac counterparts for all aztec smgs in these fields asdetermined by our technique. we demonstrate that the technique is free of radiobias and thus applicable regardless of radio detections. for observations madewith a moderate beamsize (~18"), this technique identifies ~85 per cent of smgcounterparts. for much larger beamsizes (&gt;30"), we report identification ratesof 33-49 per cent. using simulations, we demonstrate that this technique is animprovement over using positional information alone for observations withfacilities such as aztec on the lmt and scuba-2 on jcmt.

(2004) (agn) and efstathiou et al. (2000) (starburst)templates, we find that while star formation dominates the ir emission, withsfrs ~100-1000 m_sun/yr, the x-ray emission for most sources is almostexclusively from obscured agns, with column densities in excess of 10^23 cm^-2.only for ~6 percent of our sources do we find an x-ray-derived sfr consistentwith nir-to-radio sed derived sfrs. inclusion of the x-ray luminosities as aprior to the nir-to-radio sed effectively sets the agn luminosity and sfr,preventing significant contribution from the agn template. our sed modelingfurther shows that the agn and starburst templates typically lack the required1.1 mm emission necessary to match observations, arguing for an extended, cooldust component. the cross correlation function between the full samples ofx-ray sources and smgs in these fields does not indicate a strong correlationbetween the two populations at large scales, suggesting that smgs and agns donot necessarily trace the same underlying large scale structure. combined withthe remaining x-ray-dim smgs, this suggests that sub-mm bright sources mayevolve along multiple tracks, with x-ray-detected smgs representingtransitionary objects between periods of high star formation and agn activitywhile x-ray-faint smgs represent a brief starburst phase of more normalgalaxies.

(2011); thetotal intensity ratio of the [ci] to co emission ranges from 0.05 to 0.2. theoptical depth of the [ci] emission is found to be 0.1 -- 0.75, suggestingoptically thin emission. the column density of the [ci] emission is estimatedto be (1.0 -- 19) x 10^17 cm^-2. these results are consistent with the resultsof the previous [ci] observations with a low-angular resolution of 2.2 arcmin(e.g. ikeda et al. 1999). in the nearly edge-on pdrs and their candidates ofthe orion bar, dlsf, m 43 shell, and region d, the distributions of the [ci]emission coincide with those of the co emission, inconsistent with theprediction by the plane-parallel pdr model (hollenbach &amp; tielens 1999). inaddition, the [ci] distribution in the orion a cloud is found to be moresimilar to those of the ^{13}co (1--0), c^{18}o (1--0), and h^{13}co^+ (1--0)lines than that of the co (1--0) line, suggesting that the [ci] emission is notlimited to the cloud surface, but is tracing the dense, inner parts of thecloud.

1403.0040	evidence for a gas-rich major merger in a proto-cluster at z=2.5	gas-rich major mergers in high-redshift proto-clusters are important events,perhaps leading to the creation of the slowly rotating remnants seen in thecores of clusters in the present day. here, we present a deep jansky very largearray observation of co j = 1-0 emission line in a proto-cluster at z = 2.5,uss1558-003. the target field is an extremely dense region, where 20 h-alphaemitters (haes) are clustering. we have successfully detected the co emissionline from three haes and discovered a close pair of red and blue co-emittinghaes. given their close proximity (~30 kpc), small velocity offset (~300 km/s),and similar stellar masses, they could be in the early phase of a gas-richmajor merger. for the red hae, we derive a total infrared luminosity ofl(ir)=5.1e12 lsun using mips 24 um and radio continuum images. the l(ir)/l'(co)ratio is significantly enhanced compared to local spirals and high-redshiftdisks with a similar co luminosity, which is indicative of a starburst mode. wefind the gas depletion timescale is shorter than that of normal star-forminggalaxies regardless of adopted co-h2 conversion factors. the identification ofsuch a rare event suggests that gas-rich major mergers frequently take place inproto-clusters at z &gt; 2 and may involve the formation processes of slowrotators seen in local massive clusters.

1405.1629	enhancement of co(3-2)/co(1-0) ratios and star formation efficiencies in  supergiant hii regions	we present evidence that super giant hii regions (ghrs) and other diskregions of the nearby spiral galaxy, m33, occupy distinct locations in thecorrelation between molecular gas, $\sigma_{\rm h_2}$, and the star formationrate surface density, $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$. this result is based on wide fieldand high sensitivity co(3-2) observations at 100 pc resolution. star formationefficiencies (sfe), defined as $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$/$\sigma_{\rm h_2}$, in ghrsare found to be about 1 dex higher than in other disk regions. theco(3-2)/co(1-0) integrated intensity ratio is also higher than the average overthe disk. such high sfe and co(3-2)/co(1-0) can reach the values found instarburst galaxies, which suggests that ghrs may be the elements building up alarger scale starburst region. three possible contributions to high sfes in ghrare investigated: (1) the $i_{co}$-$n({\rm h_2})$ conversion factor, (2) thedense gas fraction traced by co(3-2)/co(1-0), and (3) the initial mass function(imf). we conclude that these starburst-like properties in ghrs can beinterpreted by a combination of both a top-heavy imf and a high dense gasfraction, but not by changes in the $i_{co}$-$n({\rm h_2})$ conversion factor.

1406.0782	distributions of molecules in the circumnuclear disk and surrounding  starburst ring in the seyfert galaxy ngc 1068 observed with alma	sensitive observations with alma allow astronomers to observe the detaileddistributions of molecules with relatively weak intensity in nearby galaxies.in particular, we report distributions of several molecular transitionsincluding shock and dust related species ($^{13}$co $j$ = 1--0, c$^{18}$o $j$ =1--0, $^{13}$cn $n$ = 1--0, cs $j$ = 2--1, so $j_n$ = 3$_2$--2$_1$, hnco$j_{ka,kc}$ = 5$_{0,5}$--4$_{0,4}$, hc$_3$n $j$ = 11--10, 12--11, ch$_3$oh$j_k$ = 2$_k$--1$_k$, and ch$_3$cn $j_k$ = 6$_k$--5$_k$) in the nearby seyfert2 galaxy ngc 1068 observed with the alma early science program. the central$\sim$1 arcmin ($\sim$4.3 kpc) of this galaxy was observed in the 100 ghzregion covering $\sim$96--100 ghz and $\sim$108--111 ghz with an angularresolution of $\sim4"\times2"$ (290 pc$\times$140 pc) to study the effects ofan active galactic nucleus and its surrounding starburst ring on molecularabundances. here, we present images and report a classification of moleculardistributions into three main categories: (1) molecules concentrated in thecircumnuclear disk (cnd) (so $j_n$ = 3$_2$--2$_1$, hc$_3$n $j$ = 11--10,12--11, and ch$_3$cn $j_k$ = 6$_k$--5$_k$), (2) molecules distributed both inthe cnd and the starburst ring (cs $j$ = 2--1 and ch$_3$oh $j_k$ =2$_k$--1$_k$), (3) molecules distributed mainly in the starburst ring($^{13}$co $j$ = 1--0 and c$^{18}$o $j$ = 1--0). since most of the moleculessuch as hc$_3$n observed in the cnd are easily dissociated by uv photons andx-rays, our results indicate that these molecules must be effectively shielded.in the starburst ring, the relative intensity of methanol at each clumpy regionis not consistent with those of $^{13}$co, c$^{18}$o, and cs. this differenceis probably caused by the unique formation and destruction mechanisms ofch$_3$oh.

1410.5912	a multi-transition study of molecules toward ngc 1068 based on  high-resolution imaging observations with alma	we present 0.8-mm band molecular images and spectra obtained with the atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) toward one of the nearest galaxieswith an active galactic nucleus (agn), ngc 1068. distributions of co isotopicspecies ($^{13}$co and c$^{18}$o) $\it{j}$ = 3--2, cn $\it{n}$ = 3--2 and cs$\it{j}$ = 7--6 are observed toward the circumnuclear disk (cnd) and a part ofthe starburst ring with an angular resolution of $\sim$1.$^{\prime\prime}$3$\times$ 1.$^{\prime\prime}$2. the physical properties of these molecules andshock-related molecules such as hnco, ch$_{3}$cn, so, and ch$_{3}$oh detectedin the 3-mm band were estimated using rotation diagrams under the assumption oflocal thermodynamic equilibrium. the rotational temperatures of the co isotopicspecies and the shock-related molecules in the cnd are, respectively, 14--22 kand upper limits of 20--40 k. although the column densities of the co isotopicspecies in the cnd are only from one-fifth to one-third of that in thestarburst ring, those of the shock-related molecules are enhanced by a factorof 3--10 in the cnd. we also discuss the chemistry of each species, and comparethe fractional abundances in the cnd and starburst ring with those of galacticsources such as cold cores, hot cores, and shocked molecular clouds in order tostudy the overall characteristics. we find that the abundances of shock-relatedmolecules are more similar to abundances in hot cores and/or shocked cloudsthan to cold cores. the cnd hosts relatively complex molecules, which are oftenassociated with shocked molecular clouds or hot cores. because a high x-rayflux can dissociate these molecules, they must also reside in regions shieldedfrom x-rays.

1411.5038	compact starbursts in z~3-6 submillimeter galaxies revealed by alma	we report the source size distribution, as measured by alma millimetriccontinuum imaging, of a sample of 13 aztec-selected submillimeter galaxies(smgs) at z_photo ~ 3-6. their infrared luminosities and star-formation rates(sfr) are l_ir ~ 2-6 x 10^12 l_sun and ~ 200-600 m_sun yr-1, respectively. thesize of z ~ 3-6 smgs ranges from 0".10 to 0".38 with a median of0".20+0".03-0".05 (fwhm), corresponding to a median circularized effectiveradius (rc,e) of 0.67+0.13-0.14 kpc, comparable to the typical size of thestellar component measured in compact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 (cqgs) --- r~ 1 kpc. the median surface sfr density of our z ~ 3-6 smgs is 100+42-26 m_sunyr-1 kpc-2, comparable to that seen in local merger-driven (u)lirgsrather thanin extended disk galaxies at low and high redshifts. the discovery of compactstarbursts in z &gt;~ 3 smgs strongly supports a massive galaxy formation scenariowherein z ~ 3-6 smgs evolve into the compact stellar components of z ~ 2 cqgs.these cqgs are then thought to evolve into the most massive ellipticals in thelocal universe, mostly via dry mergers. our results thus suggest that z &gt;~ 3smgs are the likely progenitors of massive local ellipticals, via cqgs, meaningthat we can now trace the evolutionary path of the most massive galaxies over aperiod encompassing ~ 90% of the age of the universe.

1412.3899	ground-based pa$\alpha$ narrow-band imaging of local luminous infrared  galaxies i: star formation rates and surface densities	luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) are enshrouded by a large amount of dust,produced by their active star formation, and it is difficult to measure theiractivity in the optical wavelength. we have carried out pa$\alpha$ narrow-bandimaging observations of 38 nearby star-forming galaxies including 33 lirgslisted in $iras$ rbgs catalog with the atacama near infrared camera (anir) onthe university of tokyo atacama observatory (tao) 1.0 m telescope (minitao).star formation rates (sfrs) estimated from the pa$\alpha$ fluxes, corrected fordust extinction using the balmer decrement method (typically $a_v$ $\sim$ 4.3mag), show a good correlation with those from the bolometric infraredluminosity of $iras$ data within a scatter of 0.27 dex. this suggests that thecorrection of dust extinction for pa$\alpha$ flux is sufficient in our sample.we measure the physical sizes and the surface density of infrared luminosities($\sigma_{l(\mathrm{ir})}$) and $sfr$ ($\sigma_{sfr}$) of star-forming regionfor individual galaxies, and find that most of the galaxies follow a sequenceof local ultra luminous or luminous infrared galaxies (u/lirgs) on the$l(\mathrm{ir})$-$\sigma_{l(\mathrm{ir})}$ and $sfr$-$\sigma_{sfr}$ plane. weconfirm that a transition of the sequence from normal galaxies to u/lirgs isseen at $l(\mathrm{ir})=8\times10^{10}$ $l_{\odot}$. also, we find that thereis a large scatter in physical size, different from those of normal galaxies orulirgs. considering the fact that most of u/lirgs are merging or interactinggalaxies, this scatter may be caused by strong external factors or differencesof their merging stage.

1502.00638	anir : atacama near-infrared camera for the 1.0-m minitao telescope	we have developed a near-infrared camera called anir (atacama near-infraredcamera) for the university of tokyo atacama observatory 1.0m telescope(minitao) installed at the summit of cerro chajnantor (5640 m above sea level)in northern chile. the camera provides a field of view of 5'.1 $\times$ 5'.1with a spatial resolution of 0".298 /pixel in the wavelength range of 0.95 to2.4 $\mu$m. taking advantage of the dry site, the camera is capable of hydrogenpaschen-$\alpha$ (pa$\alpha$, $\lambda=$1.8751 $\mu$m in air) narrow-bandimaging observations, at which wavelength ground-based observations have beenquite difficult due to deep atmospheric absorption mainly from water vapor. wehave been successfully obtaining pa$\alpha$ images of galactic objects andnearby galaxies since the first-light observation in 2009 with anir. thethroughputs at the narrow-band filters ($n1875$, $n191$) including theatmospheric absorption show larger dispersion (~10%) than those at broad-bandfilters (a few %), indicating that they are affected by temporal fluctuationsin precipitable water vapor (pwv) above the site. we evaluate the pwv contentvia the atmospheric transmittance at the narrow-band filters, and derive thatthe median and the dispersion of the distribution of the pwv are 0.40+/-0.30 mmfor $n1875$ and 0.37+/-0.21 mm for $n191$, which are remarkably smaller(49+/-38% for $n1875$ and 59+/-26% for $n191$) than radiometry measurements atthe base of cerro chajnantor (5100 m alt.). the decrease in pwv can beexplained by the altitude of the site when we assume that the verticaldistribution of the water vapor is approximated at an exponential profile withscale heights within 0.3-1.9 km (previously observed values at night). we thusconclude that minitao/anir at the summit of cerro chajnantor indeed provides usan excellent capability for a "ground-based" pa$\alpha$ observation.

0805.3648	interferometric 12co(j=2-1) image of the nuclear region of seyfert 1  galaxy ngc 1097	we have mapped the central region of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 1097 in12co(j=2-1) with the submillieter array (sma). the 12co(j=2-1) map shows acentral concentration and a surrounding ring, which coincide respectively withthe seyfert nucleus and a starburst ring. the line intensity peaks at thenucleus, whereas in a previously published 12co(j=1-0) map the intensity peaksat the starburst ring. the molecular ring has an azimuthally averaged12co(j=2-1)/(j=1-0) intensity ratio (r21) of about unity, which is similar tothose in nearby active star forming galaxies, suggesting that most of themolecular mass in the ring is involved in fueling the starburst. the moleculargas can last for only about 1.2\times10^8 years without further replenishmentassuming a constant star formation rate and a perfect conversion of gas tostars. the velocity map shows that the central molecular gas is rotating withthe molecular ring in the same direction, while its velocity gradient is muchsteeper than that of the ring. this velocity gradient of the central gas issimilar to what is usually observed in some seyfert 2 galaxies. to view theactive nucleus directly in the optical, the central molecular gas structure caneither be a low-inclined disk or torus but not too low to be less massive thanthe mass of the host galaxy itself, be a highly-inclined thin disk or clumpyand thick torus, or be an inner part of the galactic disk. the r21 value of~1.9 of the central molecular gas component, which is significantly higher thanthe value found at the molecular gas ring, indicates that the activity of theseyfert nucleus may have a significant influence on the conditions of themolecular gas in the central component.

astro-ph;0101555	impact of future submillimeter and millimeter large facilities on the  studies of galaxy formation and evolution	we investigate what we can learn about galaxy formation and evolution fromthe data which will be obtained by the forthcoming largesubmillimeter/millimeter facilities, mainly by the atacama submillimetertelescope experiment (aste) and the atacama large millimeter array/largemillimeter and submillimeter array (alma/lmsa). we first calculate the sourcecounts from 350 um to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy number countmodel of takeuchi et al. (2001). based on the number counts, we evaluate thesource confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wavebands as afunction of the characteristic beam size. at submillimeter wavelengths, sourceconfusion with the 10-15-m class facilities becomes severe at 0.1 to 1 mjylevel, and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. however, we showthat very a large-area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mjycan provide a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z = 1-2. wealso find that the 5\sigma-confusion limit of the lmsa is fainter than 1 \mujy. the source counts at such faint flux levels give important information ofthe epoch of galaxy formation. we then show that multiband photometry from theinfrared (by astro-f) to the millimeter can be utilized as a redshiftestimator. in addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8-ghz source countswith our model counts to examine the contribution of star forming galaxies tothe faint radio galaxies.

(370 pc), and located on the root of optical spiral armsin a hst image. the gas arms are associated with the spiral dust lanes, and arelinked to the central double peaks. the non-circular motions along themolecular arms indicate the fact that the gas is driven by the density wave,rather than the stochastic processes. we calculated the gas cloud orbits in astellar spiral potential, and explained the observed co spiral arms andnon-circular motions. we suggest that the central gas condensation arises fromspiral-driven gas transfer. we estimated and compared the effect of twopossible mechanisms of angular-momentum transfer: galactic shock, andgravitational torques. we discuss that the galactic shock is dominant.

(2) theinfrared l-band spectrum shows a clear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission feature at 3.3 micron, which is usually found in star-forminggalaxies. the estimated star-formation luminosity from the observed pahemission can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosity. (3)millimeter interferometric observations of the nucleus reveal a high hcn (1-0)to hco+ (1-0) luminosity ratio of 1.8, as has been previously found in pureagns. (4) the measurements of hcn (1-0) luminosity using a single-dishmillimeter telescope show that the hcn (1-0) to infrared luminosity ratio isslightly larger than the average, but within the scattered range, for otherinfrared luminous galaxies. all of these results can be explained by thescenario in which, in addition to energetically-insignificant, weakly-obscuredstar-formation at the surface of the nucleus, a powerful x-ray emitting agndeeply buried in dust and high density molecular gas is present.

astro-ph;0602227	millimeter interferometric investigations of the energy sources of three  ultraluminous infrared galaxies, ugc 5101, mrk 273, and iras 17208-0014,  based on hcn to hco+ ratios	we present interferometric observations of three ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs; ugc 5101, mrk 273, and iras 17208-0014) in the 3-mmwavelength range, using the nobeyama millimeter array. both the hcn (j=1-0) andhco+ (j=1-0) molecular lines were observed simultaneously. hcn emission wasclearly detected at the nuclear positions of these ulirgs, and hco+ emissionwas detected at the nuclear positions of ugc 5101 and iras 17208-0014. the hcnto hco+ brightness-temperature ratios toward the nuclei of the three ulirgswere derived and compared with those of lower luminosity galaxies known to bedominated by active galactic nuclei (agns) or starbursts. in ugc 5101 and mrk273, where there is evidence for obscured agns from previous observations atother wavelengths, we found high hcn/hco+ ratios (&gt;1.8) that are in the rangefound for agn-dominated galaxies. in iras 17208-0014, where the presence of apowerful obscured agn has been unclear, the ratio (1.7) is in between theobserved values for starburst- and agn-dominated galaxies. the high hcn/hco+brightness-temperature ratios in ugc 5101 and mrk 273 could be the consequenceof an hcn abundance enhancement, which is expected from chemical effects of thecentral x-ray emitting agn on the surrounding dense molecular gas. our proposedmillimeter interferometric method based on hcn/hco+ ratios may be an effectivetool for unveiling elusive buried agns at the cores of ulirgs, especiallybecause of the negligible dust extinction at these wavelengths.

astro-ph;0608100	aste observations of warm gas in low-mass protostellar envelopes:  different kinematics between submillimeter and millimeter lines	with the aste telescope, we have made observations of three low-massprotostellar envelopes around l483, b335, and l723 in the submillimeter cs($j$=7--6) and hcn ($j$=4--3) lines. we detected both the cs and hcn linestoward all the targets, and the typical cs intensity ($\sim$ 1.0 k in t$_{b}$)is twice higher than that of the hcn line. mapping observations of l483 inthese lines have shown that the submillimeter emissions in the low-massprotostellar envelope are resolved, exhibit a western extension from thecentral protostar, and that the deconvolved size is $\sim$ 5500 au $\times$3700 au (p.a. = 78$^{\circ}$) in the hcn emission. the extent of thesubmillimeter emissions in l483 implies the presence of higher-temperature($\gtrsim$ 40 k) gas at 4000 au away from the central protostar, which suggeststhat we need to take 2-dimensional radiative transfer models with a flatteneddisklike envelope and bipolar cavity into account to explain the temperaturestructure inside the low-mass protostellar envelope. the position-velocitydiagrams of these submillimeter lines in l483 and b335 exhibit differentvelocity gradients from those found in the previous millimeter observations. inparticular, along the axis of the associated molecular outflow the sense of thevelocity gradient traced by the submillimeter lines is opposite to that of themillimeter observations or the associated molecular outflow, both in l483 andb335. we suggest that expanding gas motions at the surface of the flatteneddisklike envelope around the protostar, which is irradiated from the centralstar directly, are the origin of the observed submillimeter velocity structure.

astro-ph;0701759	aste co(3-2) observations of the barred spiral galaxy m 83: i.  correlation between co(3-2)/co(1-0) ratios and star formation efficiencies	we present co(j=3-2) emission observations with the atacama submillimetertelescope experiment (aste) toward the 5' x 5' (or 6.6 x 6.6 kpc at thedistance d = 4.5 mpc) region of the nearby barred spiral galaxy m 83. wesuccessfully resolved the major structures, i.e., the nuclear starburst region,bar, and inner spiral arms in co(j=3-2) emission at a resolution of 22'' (or480 pc), showing a good spatial coincidence between co(j=3-2) and 6 cmcontinuum emissions. we found a global co(j=3-2) luminosity l'_co(3-2) of 5.1 x10^8 k km s^-1 pc^2 within the observed region. we also found l'_co(3-2) in thedisk region (0.5 &lt; r &lt; 3.5 kpc) of 4.2 x 10^8 k km s^-1 pc^2, indicating thatco(j=3-2) emission in the disk region significantly contributes to the globall'_co(3-2). from a comparison of a co(j=3-2) data with co(j=1-0) intensitiesmeasured with nobeyama 45-m telescope, we found that the radial profile ofco(j=3-2)/co(j=1-0) integrated intensity ratio r_3-2/1-0 is almost unity in thecentral region (r &lt; 0.25 kpc), whereas it drops to a constant value, 0.6--0.7,in the disk region. the radial profile of star formation efficiencies (sfes),determined from 6 cm radio continuum and co(j=1-0) emission, shows the sametrend as that of r_3-2/1-0. at the bar-end (r ~ 2.4 kpc), the amounts ofmolecular gas and the massive stars are enhanced when compared with other diskregions, whereas there is no excess of r_3-2/1-0 and sfe in that region. thismeans that a simple summation of the star forming regions at the bar-end andthe disk cannot reproduce the nuclear starburst of m 83, implying that thespatial variation of the dense gas fraction traced by r_3-2/1-0 governs thespatial variation of sfe in m 83.

astro-ph;0702191	a revised estimate of the co (j=1-0) emission from the host galaxy of  grb 030329 using the nobeyama millimeter array	a sensitive observation of the co (j=1-0) molecular line emission in the hostgalaxy of grb 030329 (z =0.1685) has been performed using the nobeyamamillimeter array in order to detect molecular gas and hidden star formation. nosign of co emission was detected, which invalidates our previous report on thepresence of molecular gas. the 3sigma upperlimit on the co line luminosity(l'_co) of the host galaxy is 6.9 x 10^8 k km s^-1 pc^2. the lowerlimit of thehost galaxy's metallicity is estimated to be 12+log(o/h) ~ 7.9, which yields aco line luminosity to h_2 conversion factor of alpha_co = 40 msun (k km s^-1pc^2)^-1. assuming this alpha_co factor, the 3sigma upperlimit on the moleculargas mass of the host galaxy is 2.8 x 10^10 msun. based on the schmidt law, the3sigma upperlimit of the total star formation rate (sfr) of the host galaxy isestimated to be 38 msun yr^-1. these results independently confirm theinferences of previous observations in the optical, submillimeter, and x-rayband, which regard this host galaxy as a compact dwarf galaxy, and not amassive, aggressively star forming galaxy.

astro-ph;9808229	dense molecular gas associated with the circumnuclear star forming ring  in the barred spiral galaxy ngc 6951	we present high resolution (3" - 5") observations of co(1-0) and hcn(1-0)emission from the circumnuclear star forming ring in the barred spiral galaxyngc 6951, a host of a type-2 seyfert, using the nobeyama millimeter array and45 m telescope. we find that most of the hcn emission is associated with thecircumnuclear ring, where vigorous star formation occurs. the hcn to cointegrated intensity ratio is also enhanced in the star forming ring; the peakvalue of hcn/co ratio is 0.18, which is comparable to the ratio in thestarbursts ngc 253 and m82. the formation mechanism of dense molecular gas hasbeen investigated. we find that the shocks along the orbit crowding do notpromote the formation of the dense molecular gas effectively but enhance thepresence of low density gmcs. instead, gravitational instabilities of the gascan account for the dense molecular gas formation. the hcn/co ratio toward theseyfert nucleus of ngc 6951 is a rather normal value (0.086), in contrast withother seyferts ngc 1068 and m51 where extremely high hcn/co value of ~ 0.5 havebeen reported.

astro-ph;9909422	aperture synthesis images of dense molecular gas in nearby galaxies with  the nobeyama millimeter array	in order to study the distribution of dense molecular gas and its relation tothe central activities (starburst and agn) in galaxies, we have conducted animaging survey of hcn(1-0) and hco+(1-0) emissions from nearby spiral galaxieswith the nobeyama millimeter array. in starburst galaxies, we find that thereis good spatial coincidence between dense molecular gas and star-formingregions. the ratios of hcn to co integrated intensities on the brightnesstemperature scale, r(hcn/co), are as high as 0.1 to 0.2 in the starburstregions, and quickly decrease outside of these regions. in contrast, we find aremarkable decrease of the hcn emission in the post-starburst nuclei, despitethe strong co concentrations there. the r(hcn/co) values in the central a few100 pc regions of these quiescent galaxies are very low, 0.02 to 0.04. a roughcorrelation between r(hcn/co) and ha/co ratios, which is an indicator of starformation efficiency, is found at a few 100 pc scale. the fraction of densemolecular gas in the total molecular gas, measured from r(hcn/co), may be animportant parameter that controls star formation. in some seyfert galaxies wefind extremely high r(hcn/co) exceeding 0.3. these very high ratios are neverobserved even in strong starburst regions, implying a physical link betweenextremely high r(hcn/co) and seyfert activity.

0811.1431	nobeyama millimeter array observations of the nuclear starburst of m83:  a gma scale correlation between dense gas fraction and star formation  efficiency	we present aperture synthesis high-resolution (~ 7" x 3") observations inco(j=1-0) line, hcn(j=1-0) line, and 95 ghz continuum emission toward thecentral (~ 1.5 kpc) region of the nearby barred spiral galaxy m 83 with thenobeyama millimeter array. our high-resolution co(j=1-0) mosaic map depicts thepresence of molecular ridges along the leading sides of the stellar bar andnuclear twin peak structure. on the other hand, we found the distribution ofthe hcn(j=1-0) line emission which traces dense molecular gas (nh2 &gt; a few x10^4 cm^-3) shows nuclear single peak structure and coincides well with that ofthe 95 ghz continuum emission which traces massive starburst. the peaks of thehcn(j=1-0) line and the 95 ghz continuum emission are not spatially coincidentwith the optical starburst regions traced by the hst v-band image. thissuggests the existence of deeply buried ongoing starburst due to strongextinction (a_v ~ 5 mag) near the peaks of the hcn(j=1-0) line and the 95 ghzcontinuum emission. we found that the hcn(j=1-0)/co(j=1-0) intensity ratior_hcn/co correlates well with extinction-corrected sfe in the central region ofm 83 at a resolution of 7.5" (~ 160 pc). this suggests that sfe is controlledby dense gas fraction traced by r_hcn/co even on a giant molecular cloudassociation (gma) scale. moreover, the correlation between r_hcn/co and the sfein the central region of m 83 seems to be almost coincident with that of thegao &amp; solomon (2004a) sample. this suggests that the correlation betweenr_hcn/co and the sfe on a gma (~ 160 pc) scale found in m 83 is the origin ofthe global correlation on a few kpc scale shown by gao &amp; solomon (2004a).

0812.2828	molecular superbubbles and outflows from starburst galaxy ngc 2146	we present results from a deep (1 sigma = 5.7 mjy beam^{-1} per 20.8 kms^{-1} velocity channel) ^{12}co(1-0) interferometric observation of thecentral 60" region of the nearby edge-on starburst galaxy ngc 2146 observedwith the nobeyama millimeter array (nma). two diffuse expanding molecularsuperbubbles and one molecular outflow are successfully detected. one molecularsuperbubble, with a size of ~1 kpc and an expansion velocity of ~50 km s^{-1},is located below the galactic disk; a second molecular superbubble, this timewith a size of ~700 pc and an expansion velocity of ~35 km s^{-1}, is also seenin the position-velocity diagram; the molecular outflow is located above thegalactic disk with an extent ~2 kpc, expanding with a velocity of up to ~200 kms^{-1}. the molecular outflow has an arc-like structure, and is located at thefront edge of the soft x-ray outflow. in addition, the kinetic energy (~3e55erg) and the pressure (~1 e-12 \pm 1 dyne cm ^{-2}) of the molecular outflow iscomparable to or smaller than that of the hot thermal plasma, suggesting thatthe hot plasma pushes the molecular gas out from the galactic disk. inside the~1 kpc size molecular superbubble, diffuse soft x-ray emission seems to exist.but since the superbubble lies behind the inclined galactic disk, it is largelyabsorbed by the molecular gas.
