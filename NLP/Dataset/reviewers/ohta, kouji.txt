0908.1646	lyman break galaxies at z~5: rest-frame uv spectra. iii	we present results of optical spectroscopic observations of candidates oflyman break galaxies (lbgs) at $z \sim 5$ in the region including the goods-nand the j0053+1234 region by using gmos-n and gmos-s, respectively. among 25candidates, five objects are identified to be at $z \sim 5$ (two of them werealready identified by an earlier study) and one object very close to thecolor-selection window turned out to be a foreground galaxy. with thisspectroscopically identified sample and those from previous studies, we derivedthe lower limits on the number density of bright ($m_{uv}&lt;-22.0$ mag) lbgs at$z \sim 5$. these lower limits are comparable to or slightly smaller than thenumber densities of uv luminosity functions (uvlfs) that show the smallernumber density among $z \sim 5$ uvlfs in literature. however, by consideringthat there remain many lbg candidates without spectroscopic observations, thenumber density of bright lbgs is expected to increase by a factor of two ormore. the evidence for the deficiency of uv luminous lbgs with large ly$\alpha$equivalent widths was reinforced. we discuss possible causes for the deficiencyand prefer the interpretation of dust absorption.

0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

1005.4727	moircs deep survey. vi. near-infrared spectroscopy of k-selected  star-forming galaxies at z~2	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy for 37 bzk-color-selectedstar-forming galaxies with moircs on subaru. the sample is drawn from theks-band selected catalog of the moircs deep survey (mods) in the goods-nregion. about half of our samples are selected from the mips 24um-sourcecatalog. ha emission lines are detected from 23 galaxies, of which the medianredshift is 2.12. we derived the star formation rates (sfrs) fromextinction-corrected ha luminosities. the extinction correction is estimatedfrom the sed fitting of multi-band photometric data covering uv to nirwavelengths. the balmer decrement of the stacked emission lines shows that theamount of extinction for the ionized gas is larger than that for the stellarcontinuum. from a comparison of the extinction corrected ha luminosity andother sfr indicators we found that the relation between the dust properties ofstellar continuum and ionized gas is different depending on the intrinsic sfr.the comparison between the ha sfr and stellar mass estimated from sed fittingshows no correlation between them. some galaxies with stellar mass smaller than~10^10 msun show sfrs higher than ~100 msun/yr. the specific sfrs (ssfrs) ofthese galaxies are remarkably high. the average stellar-population age of thesehigh-ssfr galaxies is younger than 100 myr, which is consistent with theimplied high ssfr. the large sfr implies the possibility that the high ssfrgalaxies significantly contribute to the cosmic sfr density of the universe atz~2. the total sfr density estimated from the ha emission line galaxies is0.089-0.136 msun/yr/mpc^3, which is consistent with the total sfr densities inthe literature. the metallicity of the high-ssfr galaxies is larger than thatexpected from the mass-metallicity relation of uv-selected galaxies at z~2 byerb et al.

1105.2598	intrinsic shape of star-forming bzk galaxies at z~2 in goods-n	we study structure of star-forming galaxies at z~2 in goods-n field selectedas sbzk galaxies down to k_{ab} &lt;24.0 mag. among 1029 sbzk galaxies, 551galaxies (54%) show a single component in acs/f850lp image obtained with thehubble space telescope; the rest show multiple components. we fit thesingle-component sbzk galaxies with the single s\'ersic profile using theacs/f850lp image and find that a majority of them (64%) show s\'ersic index ofn=0.5-2.5, indicating that they have a disk-like structure. the resultingeffective radii typically range from 1.0 to 3.0 kpc in the rest-frame uvwavelength. after correcting the effective radii to those in the rest-frameoptical wavelength, we find that the single-component sbzk galaxies locate inthe region where the local and z~1 disk galaxies distribute in the stellarmass-size diagram, suggesting comparable surface stellar mass density betweenthe sbzk and z~0-1 disk galaxies. all these properties suggest that thesingle-component sbzk galaxies are progenitors of the present-day diskgalaxies. however, by studying their intrinsic shape through comparison betweenthe observed distribution of apparent axial ratios and the distribution fortriaxial models with axes (a&gt;b&gt;c), we find that the mean b/a ratio is0.61^{+0.05}_{-0.08} and disk thickness c/a is 0.28^{+0.03}_{-0.04}. thisindicates that the single-component sbzk galaxies at z~2 have a bar-like oroval shape rather than a round disk shape. the shape seems to resemble to abar/oval structure that form through bar instability; if it is the case, theintrinsic shape may give us a clue to understand dynamical evolution ofbaryonic matter in a dark matter halo.

1106.1939	co observations of the host galaxy of grb000418 at z = 1.1	we performed co(j=2-1) observations of the host galaxy of grb000418 atz=1.1181 with the plateau de bure interferometer. previous studies show thatthe host galaxy has properties similar to those of an ultraluminous infraredgalaxy (ulirg). the star-formation rate (sfr) of the host galaxy as derivedfrom submillimeter and radio continuum emission is a few 100 m_sun/yr, which isan order of magnitude greater than the sfr derived from optical line emission.the large discrepancy between the sfrs derived from different observingwavelengths indicates the presence of a bulk of dust-obscured star formationand molecular gas that is enough to sustain the intense star formation. wefailed to detect co emission and derived 2sigma upper limits on the velocityintegrated co(2-1) luminosity of l'co &lt; 6.9 x 10^9 k km/s/pc^2 and themolecular gas mass of m(h2) &lt; 5.5 x 10^9 m_sun by adopting a velocity width of300 km/s and a co-to-h2 conversion factor of alpha_co = 0.8 m_sun/(kkm/s/pc^2), which are standard values for ulirgs. the lower limit on the ratioof far-infrared luminosity to co luminosity, a measure of the star-formationefficiency, is higher compared to that of other gamma-ray burst hosts and othergalaxy populations, which is consistent with active star formation taking placein this galaxy.

(2)107p/wilson-harrington is not a tumbler. the sidereal rotation period is 0.2979day. the shape is nearly spherical but slightly hexagonal with a short axismode (sam) of l1:l2:l3 = 1.5:1.5:1.0. the pole orientation is around {\lambda}= 330{\deg}, {\beta} = -27{\deg}. in addition, the model includes thepossibility of binary hosting. for both models, the sense of rotation isretrograde. furthermore, multiband photometry indicates that the taxonomy classof 107p/wilson-harrington is c-type. no clear rotational color variations areconfirmed on the surface.

1112.3704	nir spectroscopy of star-forming galaxies at z~1.4 with subaru/fmos: the  mass-metallicity relation	we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of star-forming galaxiesat z~1.4 with fmos on the subaru telescope. we observed k-band selectedgalaxies in the sxds/uds fields with k&lt;23.9 mag, 1.2&lt;z_ph&lt;1.6, m*&gt;10^{9.5}msun, and expected f(halpha)&gt;10^{-16} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. 71 objects in thesample have significant detections of halpha. for these objects, excludingpossible agns identified from the bpt diagram, gas-phase metallicities areobtained from [nii]/halpha line ratio. the sample is split into three stellarmass bins, and the spectra are stacked in each stellar mass bin. themass-metallicity relation obtained at z~1.4 is located between those at z~0.8and z~2.2. we constrain an intrinsic scatter to be ~0.1 dex or larger in themass-metallicity relation at z~1.4; the scatter may be larger at higherredshifts. we found trends that the deviation from the mass-metallicityrelation depends on the sfr and the half light radius: galaxies with higher sfrand larger half light radii show lower metallicities at a given stellar mass.one possible scenario for the trends is the infall of pristine gas accretedfrom igm or through merger events. our data points show larger scatter than thefundamental metallicity relation (fmr) at z~0.1 and the average metallicitiesslightly deviate from the fmr. the compilation of the mass-metallicityrelations at z~3 to z~0.1 shows that they evolve smoothly from z~3 to z~0without changing the shape so much except for the massive part at z~0.

1201.4947	constraints on obscured star formation in host galaxies of gamma-ray  bursts	we present the results of the 16-cm-waveband continuum observations of fourhost galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) 990705, 021211, 041006, and 051022using the australia telescope compact array. radio emission was not detected inany of the host galaxies. the 2sigma upper limits on star-formation ratesderived from the radio observations of the host galaxies are 23, 45, 27, and 26msun/yr, respectively, which are less than about 10 times those derived fromuv/optical observations, suggesting that they have no significant dust-obscuredstar formation. grbs 021211 and 051022 are known as the so-called "dark grbs"and our results imply that dark grbs do not always occur in galaxies enshroudedby dust. because large dust extinction was not observed in the afterglow ofgrb021211, our result {\bf suggests the possibility} that the cause of the darkgrb is the intrinsic faintness of the optical afterglow. on the other hand, byconsidering the high column density observed in the afterglow of grb051022, thelikely cause of the dark grb is the dust extinction in the line of sight of thegrb.

0704.3654	a search for co(j=3-2) emission from the host galaxy of grb 980425 with  the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment	we report on a deep search for co(j=3-2) line emission from the host galaxyof grb 980425 with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). weobserved five points of the galaxy covering the entire region. after combiningall of the spectra, we obtained a global spectrum with the rms noise level of3.3 mk in t_mb scale at a velocity resolution of 10 km s^-1. no significantemission was detected, though we find a marginal emission feature in thevelocity range corresponding to the redshift of the galaxy. we derive 3 sigmaupper limits on the global properties: the velocity-integrated co(3-2)intensity of i_co(3-2) &lt; 0.26 k km s^-1 by adopting a velocity width of 67 kms^-1; the h_2 column density of n(h_2) &lt; 3 x 10^20 cm^-2; the molecular gasmass of m(h_2) &lt; 3 x 10^8 m_sun, by assuming a co line luminosity to h_2molecular gas mass conversion factor of x_co = 5.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1; and the star formation rate of sfr &lt; 0.1 m_sun yr^-1, based on theschmidt law. the sfr is consistent with the previous results of h_alpha andmid-ir observations, thereby suggesting that there is no significant obscuredstar formation in the host galaxy of grb 980425. this result implies that thereis a variety of grb hosts with regard to the presence of obscured starformation.

1210.2750	intrinsic shape of star-forming bzk galaxies ii: rest-frame uv and  optical structures in goods-south and sxds	(abridge) we study statistical intrinsic shape of star-forming bzk galaxies(sbzk galaxies) at z~2 in both rest-frame uv and rest-frame opticalwavelengths. the sbzk galaxies are selected down to k(ab)=24.0 mag in thegoods-south and sxds fields, where high-resolution images from hubble spacetelescope are publicly available. 57% (583) of all 1028 galaxies in goods-sshow a single component in the acs/f850lp image. as wfc3/f160w images coveronly some part of goods-s and sxds, 724/1028 and 2500/29835 sbzk galaxies inthe goods-s and sxds have the wfc3 coverage. 86% (626) and 82% (2044) of thesbzk galaxies in wfc3/f160w images appear as a single component in the goods-sand sxds, respectively. larger fraction of single-component objects in f850lpimages represents multiple star-forming regions in galaxies, while they are notso obvious in the f160w image which appears smoother. most of thesingle-component sbzk galaxies show s\'ersic indices of n=0.5-2.5, in agreementwith those of local disk galaxies. their effective radii are 1.0-3.0 kpc and1.5-4.0 kpc in f850lp and f160w images, respectively, regardless of theobserved fields. stellar surface mass density of the sbzk galaxies is alsocomparable to that of the local disk galaxies. however, the intrinsic shape ofsbzk galaxies is not a round disk as seen in the local disk galaxies. bycomparing apparent axial ratio (b/a) distributions of the sbzk galaxies withthose by assuming tri-axial model with axes a&gt;b&gt;c, we found their intrinsicface-on b/a ratios peak at b/a=0.70 and b/a=0.77-0.79 in the rest-frame uv andoptical, respectively and are statistically more bar-like than that of thelocal disk galaxies. the intrinsic edge-on c/a ratios in both rest-frame uv andoptical wavelengths peak at 0.26, which is slightly larger than that of thelocal disk galaxies.

1307.0514	the cosmic bpt diagram: confronting theory with observations	we compare a large sample of galaxies between 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 with theoreticalpredictions for how the optical diagnostic line ratios in galaxy ensembleschange as a function of cosmic time. we show that star forming galaxies at highredshift (z&gt;1.5) are consistent with a model in which the ism conditions aremore extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of localgalaxies. we speculate that global spectra of our high redshift galaxies may bedominated by hii regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-formingcomplexes in the antennae and m82. the transition to local-type conditionsoccurs between 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5. we conclude that classification schemes developed forlocal samples should not be applied at high redshift (z &gt; 1.5). we use ourtheoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line thatutilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [oiii]/h-beta and[nii]/h-alpha. our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies fromagn between z=0 to z~3.5. we anticipate that our redshift-dependent opticalclassification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infraredmulti-object spectrographs. we apply our classification line to a sample ofgravitationally lensed galaxies at z~2.5. although limited by small numbers, weshow that our classification line is consistent with the position of agn thathave been independently confirmed via other methods.

1312.3934	probing intergalactic neutral hydrogen by the lyman alpha red damping  wing of gamma-ray burst 130606a afterglow spectrum at z = 5.913	the unprecedentedly bright optical afterglow of grb 130606a located by swiftat a redshift close to the reionization era (z = 5.913) provides a newopportunity to probe the ionization status of intergalactic medium (igm). herewe present an analysis of the red ly alpha damping wing of the afterglowspectrum taken by subaru/focas during 10.4-13.2 hr after the burst. we findthat the minimal model including only the baseline power-law and hi absorptionin the host galaxy does not give a good fit, leaving residuals showing concavecurvature in 8400-8900 a with an amplitude of about 0.6% of the flux. such acurvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either byextinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature ofafterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observedspectrum. the red damping wing by intervening hi gas outside the host canreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance. we find that adamped ly alpha system is not favored as the origin of this intervening hiabsorption, from the observed ly beta and metal absorption features. thereforeabsorption by diffuse igm remains as a plausible explanation. a fit by a simpleuniform igm model requires hi neutral fraction of f_hi ~ 0.1-0.5 depending onthe distance to the grb host, implying high f_hi igm associated with theobserved dark gunn-peterson (gp) troughs. this gives a new evidence that thereionization is not yet complete at z ~ 6.

1405.6198	field: an automated emission-line detection software for subaru/fmos  near-infrared spectroscopy	we describe the development of automated emission line detection software forthe fiber multi-object spectrograph (fmos), which is a near-infraredspectrograph fed by $400$ fibers from the $0.2$ deg$^2$ prime focus field ofview of the subaru telescope. the software, field (fmos software forimage-based emission line detection), is developed and tested mainly for thefastsound survey, which is targeting h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at $z \sim1.3$ to measure the redshift space distortion as a test of general relativitybeyond $z \sim 1$. the basic algorithm is to calculate the line signal-to-noiseratio ($s/n$) along the wavelength direction, given by a 2-d convolution of thespectral image and a detection kernel representing a typical emission lineprofile. a unique feature of fmos is its use of oh airglow suppression masks,requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around the maskregions. bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic-rays areefficiently removed by using the information obtained from the fmos analysispipeline. we limit the range of acceptable line-shape parameters for thedetected candidates to further improve the reliability of line detection. thefinal performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the fastsounddata; the false detection rate of spurious objects is examined by usinginverted frames obtained by exchanging object and sky frames. the falsedetection rate is $&lt; 1$\% at $s/n &gt; 5$, allowing an efficient and objectiveemission line search for fmos data at the line flux level of $\gtrsim 1.0\times 10^{-16}$[erg/cm$^2$/s].

1406.3261	multi-band, multi-epoch observations of the transiting warm jupiter  wasp-80b	wasp-80b is a warm jupiter transiting a bright late-k/early-m dwarf,providing a good opportunity to extend the atmospheric study of hot jupiterstoward the lower temperature regime. we report multi-band, multi-epoch transitobservations of wasp-80b by using three ground-based telescopes covering fromoptical (g', rc, and ic bands) to near-infrared (nir; j, h, and ks bands)wavelengths. we observe 5 primary transits, each of which in 3 or 4 differentbands simultaneously, obtaining 17 independent transit light curves. combiningthem with results from previous works, we find that the observed transmissionspectrum is largely consistent with both a solar abundance and thick cloudatmospheric models at 1.7$\sigma$ discrepancy level. on the other hand, we finda marginal spectral rise in optical region compared to the nir region at2.9$\sigma$ level, which possibly indicates the existence of haze in theatmosphere. we simulate theoretical transmission spectra for a solar abundancebut hazy atmosphere, finding that a model with equilibrium temperature of 600 kcan explain the observed data well, having a discrepancy level of 1.0$\sigma$.we also search for transit timing variations, but find no timing excess largerthan 50 s from a linear ephemeris. in addition, we conduct 43 day longphotometric monitoring of the host star in the optical bands, finding nosignificant variation in the stellar brightness. combined with the fact that nospot-crossing event is observed in the five transits, our results confirmprevious findings that the host star appears quiet for spot activities, despitethe indications of strong chromospheric activities.

1407.0392	constraint on the gas-to-dust ratio in massive star-forming galaxies at  z~1.4	we carried out 12co(j=2-1) observations toward three star-forming galaxies onthe main sequence at z~1.4 with the nobeyama 45m radio telescope. thesegalaxies are detected with spitzer/mips in 24 um, herschel/spire in 250 um and350 um, and their gas metallicity, derived from optical emission line ratiosbased on near infrared spectroscopic observations, is close to the solarmetallicity. although weak signal-like features of co were seen, we could notdetect significant co emission. the dust mass and the upper limits on themolecular gas mass are (3.4-6.7) x 10^{8} msun and (9.7-14) x 10^{10} msun,respectively. the upper limits on the gas-to-dust ratios at z~1.4 are 150-410which are comparable to the gas-to-dust ratios in local galaxies with similargas metallicity. a line stacking analysis enables us to detect a significant coemission and to derive an average molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^{11} msun andgas-to-dust ratio of 250. this gas-to-dust ratio is also near that in localgalaxies with solar metallicity. these results suggest that the gas-to-dustratio in star-forming galaxies with solar metallicity does not evolvesignificantly up to z~1.4. by comparing to a theoretical calculation, a rapidincrease of the dust mass in an earlier epoch of galaxy evolution is suggested.

1410.7147	the gas inflow and outflow rate in star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.4$	we try to constrain the gas inflow and outflow rate of star-forming galaxiesat $z\sim1.4$ by employing a simple analytic model for the chemical evolutionof galaxies. the sample is constructed based on a large near-infrared (nir)spectroscopic sample observed with subaru/fmos. the gas-phase metallicity ismeasured from the [\ion{n}{2}]$\lambda$6584/h$\alpha$ emission line ratio andthe gas mass is derived from the extinction corrected h$\alpha$ luminosity byassuming the kennicutt-schmidt law. we constrain the inflow and outflow ratefrom the least-$\chi^{2}$ fittings of the observed gas mass fraction, stellarmass, and metallicity with the analytic model. the joint $\chi^{2}$ fittingshows the best-fit inflow rate is $\sim1.8$ and the outflow rate is $\sim0.6$in unit of star-formation rate (sfr). by applying the same analysis to theprevious studies at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2.2$, it is shown that the both inflowrate and outflow rate decrease with decreasing redshift, which implies thehigher activity of gas flow process at higher redshift. the decreasing trend ofthe inflow rate from $z\sim2.2$ to $z\sim0$ agrees with that seen in theprevious observational works with different methods, though the absolute valueis generally larger than the previous works. the outflow rate and its evolutionfrom $z\sim2.2$ to $z\sim0$ obtained in this work agree well with theindependent estimations in the previous observational works.

1411.3357	the redshift and metallicity of the host galaxy of dark grb 080325 at  z=1.78	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of the host galaxy of dark grb 080325using subaru/moircs. the obtained spectrum provides a clear detection ofh$\alpha$ emission and marginal [nii]$\lambda$6584. the host is a massive(m$_{*}\sim10^{11}$m$_{\odot}$), dusty ($a_{v}\sim 1.2$) star-forming galaxy atz=1.78. the star formation rate calculated from the h$\alpha$ luminosity(35.6-47.0 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is typical among grb host galaxies (andstar-forming galaxies generally) at z $&gt;$1; however, the specific starformation rate is lower than normal star-forming galaxies at redshift $\sim$1.6, in contrast to the high specific star formation rates measured for many ofother grb hosts. the metallicity of the host is estimated to be12+log(o/h)$_{\rm kk04}$$=$8.88. we emphasize that this is one of the mostmassive distant host galaxies for which metallcity is measured withemission-line diagnostics. the metallicity is fairly high among grb hosts.however, this is still lower than the metallicity of normal star-forminggalaxies of the same mass at z$\sim$1.6. the metallicity offset from normalstar-forming galaxies is close to a typical value of other grb hosts andindicates that grb host galaxies are uniformly biased toward low metalicityover a wide range of redshift and stellar mass. the low-metallicity nature ofthe grb 080325 host is likely not attributable to the fundamental metallicityrelation of star-forming galaxies beacuse it is a metal-poor outlier from therelation and has a low ssfr. thus we conclude that metallicity is important tothe mechanism that produced this grb.

1501.00500	when did round disk galaxies form?	when and how galaxy morphology such as disk and bulge seen in the present-dayuniverse emerged is still not clear. in the universe at $z\gtrsim 2$, galaxieswith various morphology are seen, and star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ show anintrinsic shape of bar-like structure. then, when did round disk structureform? here we take a simple and straightforward approach to see the epoch whena round disk galaxy population emerged by constraining the intrinsic shapestatistically based on apparent axial ratio distribution of galaxies. wederived the distributions of the apparent axial ratios in the rest-frameoptical light ($\sim 5000$ \aa) of star-forming main sequence galaxies at$2.5&gt;z&gt;1.4$, $1.4&gt;z&gt;0.85$, and $0.85&gt;z&gt;0.5$, and found that the apparent axialratios of them show peaky distributions at $z\gtrsim0.85$, while a rather flatdistribution at the lower redshift. by using a tri-axial model ($a&gt;b&gt;c$) forthe intrinsic shape, we found the best-fit models give the peaks of the $b/a$distribution of $0.81\pm0.04$, $0.84\pm0.04$, and $0.92\pm0.05$ at $2.5&gt;z&gt;1.4$,$1.4&gt;z&gt;0.85$, and $0.85&gt;z&gt;0.5$, respectively. the last value is close to thelocal value of 0.95. thickness ($c/a$) is $\sim0.25$ at all the redshifts andis close to the local value (0.21). the results indicate the shape of thestar-forming galaxies in the main sequence changes gradually, and the rounddisk is established at around $z\sim0.9$. establishment of the round disk maybe due to a cease of violent interaction of galaxies or a growth of a bulgeand/or a super-massive black hole resides at the center of a galaxy whichdissolves the bar structure.

1505.05487	the subaru-xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) viii.: multi-wavelength  identification, optical/nir spectroscopic properties, and photometric  redshifts of x-ray sources	we report the multi-wavelength identification of the x-ray sources found inthe subaru-xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) using deep imaging data covering thewavelength range between the far-uv to the mid-ir. we select a primarycounterpart of each x-ray source by applying the likelihood ratio method tor-band, 3.6micron, near-uv, and 24micron source catalogs as well as matchingcatalogs of agn candidates selected in 1.4ghz radio and i'-band variabilitysurveys. once candidates of galactic stars, ultra-luminous x-ray sources in anearby galaxy, and clusters of galaxies are removed there are 896 agncandidates in the sample. we conduct spectroscopic observations of the primarycounterparts with multi-object spectrographs in the optical and nir; 65\% ofthe x-ray agn candidates are spectroscopically-identified. for the remainingx-ray agn candidates, we evaluate their photometric redshift with photometricdata in 15 bands. utilising the multi-wavelength photometric data of the largesample of x-ray selected agns, we evaluate the stellar masses, m*, of the hostgalaxies of the narrow-line agns. the distribution of the stellar mass isremarkably constant from z=0.1 to 4.0. the relation between m* and 2--10 kevluminosity can be explained with strong cosmological evolution of therelationship between the black hole mass and m*. we also evaluate the scatterof the uv-mir spectral energy distribution (sed) of the x-ray agns as afunction of x-ray luminosity and absorption to the nucleus. the scatter iscompared with galaxies which have redshift and stellar mass distributionmatched with the x-ray agn. the uv-nir seds of obscured x-ray agns are similarto those of the galaxies in the matched sample. in the nir-mir range, themedian seds of x-ray agns are redder, but the scatter of the seds of the x-rayagn broadly overlaps that of the galaxies in the matched sample.

1512.08797	monitoring observations of the jupiter-family comet 17p/holmes during  2014 perihelion passage	we performed a monitoring observation of a jupiter-family comet, 17p/holmes,during its 2014 perihelion passage to investigate its secular change inactivity. the comet has drawn the attention of astronomers since its historicoutburst in 2007, and this occasion was its first perihelion passage sincethen. we analyzed the obtained data using aperture photometry package andderived the afrho parameter, a proxy for the dust production rate. we foundthat afrho showed asymmetric properties with respect to the perihelion passage:it increased moderately from 100 cm at the heliocentric distance r_h=2.6-3.1 auto a maximal value of 185 cm at r_h = 2.2 au (near the perihelion) during theinbound orbit, while dropping rapidly to 35 cm at r_h = 3.2 au during theoutbound orbit. we applied a model for characterizing dust production rates asa function of r_h and found that the fractional active area of the cometarynucleus had dropped from 20%-40% in 2008-2011 (around the aphelion) to0.1%-0.3% in 2014-2015 (around the perihelion). this result suggests that adust mantle would have developed rapidly in only one orbital revolution aroundthe sun. although a minor eruption was observed on ut 2015 january 26 at r_h =3.0 au, the areas excavated by the 2007 outburst would be covered with a layerof dust (&lt;~ 10 cm depth) which would be enough to insulate the subsurface iceand to keep the nucleus in a state of low activity.

astro-ph;0004221	color gradients in early-type galaxies in clusters at the redshift from  0.37 to 0.56	color gradients in elliptical galaxies in distant clusters ($z=0.37-0.56$)are examined by using the archival deep imaging data of wide field planetarycamera 2 (wfpc2) on-board the hubble space telescope (hst). obtained colorgradients are compared with the two model gradients to examine the origin ofthe color gradients. in one model, a color gradient is assumed to be caused bya metallicity gradient of stellar populations, while in the other one, it iscaused by an age gradient. both of these model color gradients reproduce theaverage color gradient seen in nearby ellipticals, but predict significantlydifferent gradients at a redshift larger than $\sim$0.3. comparison between theobserved gradients and the model gradients reveals that the metallicitygradient is much more favorable as the primary origin of color gradients inelliptical galaxies in clusters. the same conclusion has been obtained forfield ellipticals by using those at the redshift from 0.1 to 1.0 in the hubbledeep field-north by tamura et al. (2000). thus, it is also suggested that theprimary origin of the color gradients in elliptical galaxies does not depend ongalaxy environment.

astro-ph;0210055	a search for lyman alpha emitters at redshift 3.7	we present the results of a survey for emission-line objects based on opticalintermediate-band ($\lambda_{\rm c}$ = 5736 \aa ~ and $\delta\lambda$ = 280\aa) and broad-band ($b$, $v$, $r$, and $i^\prime$) observations of thesubaru/xmm-newton deep field on the 8.2 m subaru telescope with the subaruprime focus camera, suprime-cam. all the data were obtained during theguaranteed time observations of the suprime-cam instrument. theintermediate-band image covered a sky area with 10\minpoint62 $\times12\minpoint40 \approx 132$ arcmin$^2$ in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field(ouchi et al.).  using this image, we have found 23 emission-line sources whose observedemission-line equivalent widths are greater than 250 \aa. their opticalmulticolor properties indicate that six emission-line sources are ly$\alpha$emitters at $z \approx$ 3.7 ($\delta z \approx 0.22$). they are either intensestarburst galaxies or active galactic nuclei like quasars at $z \approx$ 3.7.two more emission-line sources may also be ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx$3.7 although their multicolor properties are marginal. among the remaining 15emission-line objects, eight objects appear strong emission-line galaxies atlower redshift; e.g., [o {\sc ii}] $\lambda$3727 emitters at $z \approx 0.54$,h$\beta$ at $z \approx 0.18$, or [o {\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 emitters at $z\approx 0.15$. the remaining seven objects are unclassified because they aretoo faint to be detected in broad-band images. we discuss observationalproperties of these strong emission-line sources. in particular, our data allowus to estimate the star formation density at $z \approx 3.7$ for the firsttime.

astro-ph;0304404	color gradients in early-type galaxies in abell 2199	we performed b and r band surface photometry for e/s0 galaxies in a nearbyrich cluster abell 2199 to investigate their b-r color gradients(d(b-r)/dlogr). our aims are to study statistical properties of the colorgradients and, by comparing them with those in less dense environments, toexamine environmental dependence of color gradients in elliptical galaxies. westudied the distribution of the b-r color gradients in the cluster ellipticalsand found that the mean value of the color gradients is -0.09 +- 0.04 mag/dex,which can be converted to a metallicity gradient (dlogz/dlogr) of ~ -0.3 +- 0.1assuming an old stellar population. we further studied the relations betweenthe b-r color gradients and global properties of the galaxies. our data suggestthat for the galaxies brighter than l*, more luminous and larger galaxies tendto have steeper color gradients. the typical value of the color gradients seemsto be consistent with a recent monolithic collapse model and the correlationcould also appear if elliptical galaxies formed through the monolithiccollapse. on the contrary, it is found based on data from the literature thatany such trend is clearly weaker for ellipticals in less dense environments,while the distribution of the color gradients is quite similar to that found inthe rich cluster. based on the results from our data and the published data, wediscuss formation process of elliptical galaxy and its environmentaldependence.

astro-ph;0307164	optical identification of the asca medium sensitivity survey in the  northern sky: nature of hard x-ray-selected luminous active galactic nuclei	we present the results of optical spectroscopic identifications of a brightsubsample of 2-10kev hard x-ray selected sources from the asca mediumsensitivity survey in the northern sky. the flux limit of the subsample is3*10^-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 2-10kev band. all but one of the 87 hard x-rayselected sources are optically identified, with agns, 7 clusters of galaxies,and 1 galactic star. it is the largest complete sample of hard x-ray selectedagns at the bright flux limit. amounts of absorption to their nuclei areestimated to be hydrogen column densities (n_h) of up to ~3*10^23 cm^-2 fromtheir x-ray spectra. optical properties of x-ray absorbed agns with n_h &gt;1*10^22 cm^-2 indicate the effects of dust absorption: at redshifts, z&lt;0.6,agns without broad h\beta emission lines have significantly larger n_h valuethan agns with broad h\beta emission lines. at z&gt;0.6, the x-ray absorbed agnshave a large hard x-ray to optical flux ratio (log f2-10kev/fr &gt; +1). however,three x-ray absorbed z&gt;0.6 agns show strong broad lines. in combination withhard x-ray selected agn samples from the asca large sky survey, the asca deepsurvey in the lockman hole and chandra deep field north, the luminositydistributions of absorbed and less-absorbed agns are compared.

astro-ph;0308140	cosmological evolution of the hard x-ray agn luminosity function and the  origin of the hard x-ray background	we investigate the cosmological evolution of the hard x-ray luminosityfunction (hxlf) of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the 2-10 kev luminosityrange of 10^{41.5} - 10^{46.5} erg s^-1 as a function of redshift up to 3. froma combination of surveys conducted at photon energies above 2 kev with heao1,asca, and chandra, we construct a highly complete (&gt;96%) sample consisting of247 agns over the wide flux range of 10^{-10} - 3.8*10^{-15} erg cm^-2 s^-1(2-10 kev). for our purpose, we develop an extensive method of calculating theintrinsic (before-absorption) hxlf and the absorption (n_h) function. thisutilizes the maximum likelihood method fully correcting for observationalbiases with consideration of the x-ray spectrum of each source. we find that(i) the fraction of x-ray absorbed agns decreases with the intrinsic luminosityand (ii) the evolution of the hxlf of all agns (including both type-i andtype-ii agns) is best described with a luminosity dependent density evolution(ldde) where the cutoff redshift increases with the luminosity. our resultsdirectly constrain the evolution of agns that produce a major part of the hardx-ray background, thus solving its origin quantitatively. a combination of thehxlf and the nh function enables us to construct a purely "observation based"population synthesis model. we present basic consequences of this model, anddiscuss the contribution of compton-thick agns to the rest of the hard x-raybackground.

astro-ph;0402520	near-infrared colors of hard x-ray selected active galactic nuclei	we present results of near-infrared photometry (j, h, k_s) for a sample ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) obtained from hard x-ray surveys with asca. thesample covers the agns at z=0.1-1 with l(2-10kev)=10^42-10^46 erg/s with veryhigh completeness. the fraction of red (j-k_s&gt;2 mag) agns in our sample is2(+-1)%, which is comparable to that for optically- or uv-selectedquasi-stellar objects (qsos, i.e. luminous agns). the number of red agns foundin our sample is also consistent with that expected from the surface density ofred agns found in 2mass by cutri et al. (2001). we find that theanomalously-small dust-to-gas ratios in circumnuclear gas, which is seen insome agns with seyfert-class luminosity, also occur in the qsos (agns withluminosity of l(2-10kev) &gt; 10^44.5 erg/s). for all the qsos with an x-rayabsorption of n_h &gt; 10^22 /cm2 in our sample, the values of a_v/n_h are smallerthan the galactic value by a factor of 5 to 100. since a fraction of thispopulation among the qsos in our sample is about 30%, such fraction ofoptical/uv-selected type 1 qsos known to date may show type 2 nature in x-ray.

astro-ph;0404227	lyman break galaxies at $z\sim5$: rest-frame uv spectra	we report initial results for spectroscopic observations of candidates oflyman break galaxies (lbgs) at $z\sim5$ in a region centered on the hubble deepfield-north by using the faint object camera and spectrograph attached to thesubaru telescope. eight objects with $i_c\leq25.0$ mag, including one agn, areconfirmed to be at $4.5&lt;z&lt;5.2$. the rest-frame uv spectra of seven lbgscommonly show no or weak lyalpha emission line (rest-frame equivalent width of0-10\aa) and relatively strong low-ionization interstellar metal absorptionlines of siii $\lambda$1260, oi+siii $\lambda$1303, and cii $\lambda$1334 (meanrest-frame equivalent widths of them are $-1.2 \sim -5.1 $\aa). theseproperties are significantly different from those of the mean rest-frame uvspectrum of lbgs at $z\sim3$, but are quite similar to those of subgroups oflbgs at $z\sim3$ with no or weak lyalpha emission. the weakness of lyalphaemission and strong low-ionization interstellar metal absorption lines mayindicate that these lbgs at $z\sim5$ are chemically evolved to some degree andhave a dusty environment. since the fraction of such lbgs at $z\sim5$ in oursample is larger than that at $z\sim3$, we may witness some sign of evolutionof lbgs from $z\sim5$ to $z\sim3$, though the present sample size is verysmall. it is also possible, however, that the brighter lbgs tend to show no orweak lyalpha emission, because our spectroscopic sample is bright (brighterthan $l^{\ast}$) among lbgs at $z\sim5$. more observations are required toestablish spectroscopic nature of lbgs at $z\sim5$.

astro-ph;0408497	radial variation of optical and near-infrared colours in luminous  early-type galaxies in abell 2199	we performed k band surface photometry for luminous early-type galaxies in anearby rich cluster abell 2199. combining it with b and r band surfacephotometry, radial variations of b-r and r-k colours in the galaxies wereinvestigated. it is found that the inner regions of the galaxies are redder inboth of b-r and r-k colours. comparing the radial variations of both of thecolours with predictions of simple stellar population (ssp) models for a rangeof ages and metallicities, it is suggested that the cluster ellipticals havenegative metallicity gradients but their age gradients are consistent withzero, although our sample is small; the typical metallicity gradient isestimated to be -0.16+- 0.09 in dlogz/dlogr, while the age gradient isestimated to be -0.10 +- 0.14 in dlog(age)/dlogr. considering that similarresults have also been derived in the other recent studies using samples ofellipticals in the coma cluster and less dense environments, it seems thatthere is no strong dependence on galaxy environment in radial gradient ofstellar population in elliptical galaxy.

astro-ph;0409546	the largest blueshifts of [o iii] emission line in two narrow-line  quasars	we have obtained optical intermediate resolution spectra (r = 3000) of thenarrow-line quasars dms 0059-0055 and pg 1543+489. the [o iii] emission line indms 0059-0055 is blueshifted by 880 km/s relative to hbeta. we also confirmthat the [o iii] emission line in pg 1543+489 has a relative blueshift of 1150km/s. these two narrow-line quasars show the largest [o iii] blueshifts knownto date among type 1 active galactic nuclei (agns). the [o iii] emission linesin both objects are broad (1000 - 2000 km/s) and those in dms 0059-0055 showstrong blue asymmetry. we interpret the large blueshift and the profile of the[o iii] lines as the result of an outflow interacting with circumnuclear gas.among type 1 agns with large blueshifted [o iii], there is no correlationbetween the eddington ratios and the amount of [o iii] blueshifts. combiningour new data with published results, we confirm that the eddington ratios ofthe such agns are the highest among agns with the same black hole masses. thesefacts suggest that the eddington ratio is a necessary condition or the [o iii]blueshifts weakly depend on the eddington ratio. our new sample suggests thatthere are possible necessary conditions to produce an outflow besides a higheddington ratio: large black hole mass (&gt; 10^7 m_solar) or high mass accretionrate (&gt; 2 m_solar/yr) or large luminosity (lambda l_{lambda} (5100a) &gt; 10^44.6erg/s).

astro-ph;0509912	supermassive black hole mass functions at intermediate redshifts from  spheroid and agn luminosity functions	redshift evolution of supermassive black hole mass functions (bhmfs) isinvestigated up to z ~ 1. bhmfs at intermediate redshifts are calculated in twoways. one way is from early-type galaxy luminosity functions (lfs); we assumean m_bh - l_sph correlation at a redshift by considering a passive evolution ofl_sph in the local relationship. the resultant bhmfs (spheroid-bhmfs) from lfsof red sequence galaxies indicates a slight decrease of number density withincreasing redshift at m_bh &gt; 10^{7.5-8} m_solar. since a redshift evolution inslope and zeropoint of the m_bh - l_sph relation is unlikely to be capable ofmaking such an evolution in bhmf, the evolution of the spheroid-bhmfs isperhaps due mainly to the decreasing normalization in the galaxy lfs. we alsoinvestigate how spheroid-bhmfs are affected by uncertainties existing in thederivation in detail. the other way of deriving a bhmf is based on thecontinuity equation for number density of smbhs and lfs of active galacticnucleus (agn). the resultant bhmfs (agn-bhmfs) show no clear evolution out to z= 1 at m_bh &gt; 10^8 m_solar, but exhibit a significant decrease with redshift inthe lower mass range. comparison of the spheroid-bhmfs with the agn-bhmfssuggests that at m_bh &gt; 10^{8} m_solar, the spheroid-bhmfs are broadlyconsistent with the agn-bhmfs out to z ~ 1. the agreement between thespheroid-bhmfs and the agn-bhmfs appears to support that most of the smbhs arealready hosted by massive spheroids at z ~ 1 and they evolve withoutsignificant mass growth since then.

astro-ph;0512154	implications for the cosmic reionization from the optical afterglow  spectrum of the gamma-ray burst 050904 at z = 6.3	the gamma-ray burst (grb) 050904 at z = 6.3 provides the first opportunity ofprobing the intergalactic medium (igm) by grbs at the epoch of thereionization. here we present a spectral modeling analysis of the opticalafterglow spectrum taken by the subaru telescope, aiming to constrain thereionization history. the spectrum shows a clear damping wing at wavelengthsredward of the lyman break, and the wing shape can be fit either by a damped lyalpha system with a column density of log (n_hi/cm^{-2}) ~ 21.6 at a redshiftclose to the detected metal absorption lines (z_metal = 6.295), or by almostneutral igm extending to a slightly higher redshift of z_{igm,u} ~ 6.36. in thelatter case, the difference from z_metal may be explained by acceleration ofmetal absorbing shells by the activities of the grb or its progenitor. however,we exclude this possibility by using the light transmission feature around thely beta resonance, leading to a firm upper limit of z_{igm,u} &lt; 6.314. we thenshow an evidence that the igm was largely ionized already at z=6.3, with thebest-fit neutral fraction of igm, x_hi = n_hi/n_h = 0.00, and upper limits ofx_hi &lt; 0.17 and 0.60 at 68 and 95% c.l., respectively. this is the first directand quantitative upper limit on x_hi at z &gt; 6. various systematic uncertaintiesare examined, but none of them appears large enough to change this conclusion.to get further information on the reionization, it is important to increase thesample size of z &gt;~ 6 grbs, in order to find grbs with low column densities(log n_hi &lt;~ 20) within their host galaxies, and for statistical studies of lyalpha line emission from host galaxies.

astro-ph;0607036	discovery of h alpha absorption in the unusual broad absorption line  quasar sdss j083942.11+380526.3	we discovered an h alpha absorption in a broad h alpha emission line of anunusual broad absorption line quasar, sdss j083942.11+380526.3 at z=2.318, bynear-infrared spectroscopy with the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera forohs (cisco) on the subaru telescope. the presence of non-stellar h alphaabsorption is known only in the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151 to date, thus ourdiscovery is the first case for quasars. the h alpha absorption line isblueshifted by 520 km/s relative to the h alpha emission line, and its redshiftalmost coincides with those of uv low-ionization metal absorption lines. thewidth of the h alpha absorption (~ 340 km/s) is similar to those of the uvlow-ionization absorption lines. these facts suggest that the h alpha and thelow-ionization metal absorption lines are produced by the same low-ionizationgas which has a substantial amount of neutral gas. the column density of theneutral hydrogen is estimated to be ~ 10^18 cm^-2 by assuming a gas temperatureof 10,000 k from the analysis of the curve of growth. the continuum spectrum isreproduced by a reddened (e(b-v) ~ 0.15 mag for the smc-like reddening law)composite quasar spectrum. furthermore, the uv spectrum of sdssj083942.11+380526.3 shows a remarkable similarity to that of ngc 4151 in itslow state, suggesting the physical condition of the absorber in sdssj083942.11+380526.3 is similar to that of ngc 4151 in the low state. asproposed for ngc 4151, sdss j083942.11+380526.3 may be also seen through theclose direction of the surface of the obscuring torus.

astro-ph;9812224	the iris far-infrared galaxy survey : expected number count, redshift,  and perspective	infrared imaging surveyor (iris) is a satellite which will be launched in thebeginning of 2003. one of the main purposes of the iris mission is an all-skysurvey at far-infrared (fir) with a flux limit much deeper than that of iras.in order to examine the performance of the survey, we estimated the fir galaxycounts in four (50, 70, 120, and 150 $\mu$m) bands based on some models. weadopted a multicomponent model which consists of cirrus and starburstcomponents for galaxy spectra, and the nearby fir luminosity function derivedfrom that of iras galaxies. we derived the number counts, redshiftdistributions, and infrared diffuse background radiation spectra for i) noevolution, ii) pure luminosity evolution, iii) pure density evolution with $q_0= 0.1$ and 0.5. we found that a large number of galaxies ($\sim {\rm a few}\times 10^6$ in the whole sky) will be detected in this survey. with the aid ofa vast number of detection, we will detect the effect of galaxy evolution, andevaluate the amplitude of evolution at least in the nearby universe in the irissurvey, though it will be still difficult to constrain which type of evolutiontakes place from the number count alone. we also studied the estimation ofredshifts of detected galaxies by their infrared colors alone. althoughsignificant contamination takes place among nearby faint galaxies and high-$z$ones, we found that rough estimation of galaxy redshift can be practicable byjointly using present and future optical surveys.

astro-ph;9903299	expected sub-mm emission and dust properties of lyman break galaxies at  high redshift	we investigate expected sub-mm emission and dust properties of the lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) in the hubble deep field (hdf). the scuba deep survey(hughes et al., 1998) provides an upper limit of the 850 micron flux densitiesof the lbgs. with this constraint, we argue that a typical ultra-violet tofar-infrared spectral shape of the high-redshift lbgs is rather close to atemplate spectrum of low-reddening starburst galaxies in the local universe butdifferent from that of heavily dust-enshrouded ultra-luminous far-infraredgalaxies like arp220. we also evaluate the lower-limit temperature of dust inlbgs assuming single- and two-component modified black-body spectrum. toestimate the total amount of energy re-emitted in fir wavelength, we take twodifferent approaches; model fitting of the uv spectra of lbgs and an empiricalmethod using the relationship between uv spectral shape and uv/fir flux ratioobserved for local starburst galaxies. both methods give lower-limittemperature of the lbgs as around 40 k, which is higher than the typical dusttemperature of local optical- and infrared-selected galaxies. this result isalso supported by the comparison of the expected sub-mm flux of the lbgs withthe cosmic fir background radiation. the high dust temperature may indicate theeffective massive-star formation or different dust properties in thehigh-redshift lbgs.

astro-ph;9907437	a rich cluster of galaxies near the quasar b2 1335+28 at z=1.1: color  distribution and star-formation properties	we previously reported a significant clustering of red galaxies (r-k=3.5--6)around the radio-loud quasar b2 1335+28 at z=1.086. in this paper, we establishthe existence of a rich cluster at the quasar redshift, and study theproperties of the cluster galaxies through further detailed analysis of thephotometric data. the color distribution of the galaxies in the cluster isquite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\sim 70%) is much larger than inintermediate-redshift clusters. using evolutionary synthesis models, we showthat this color distribution can be explained by galaxies with various amountsof star-formation activity mixed with the old stellar populations. notably,there are about a dozen galaxies which show very red optical-nir colors butalso show significant uv excess with respect to passive-evolution models. theycan be interpreted as old early-type galaxies with a small amount of starformation. the fact that the uv-excess red galaxies are more abundant than thequiescent red ones suggests that a large fraction of old galaxies in thiscluster are still forming stars to some extent. however, a sequence ofquiescent red galaxies is clearly identified on the r-k versus kcolor-magnitude (c-m) diagram. the slope and zero point of their c-m relationappear to be consistent with those expected for the precursors of the c-mrelation of present-day cluster ellipticals when observed at z=1.1. we estimatethe abell richness class of the cluster to be r \sim 1. new x-ray datapresented here place an upper limit of l_x &lt; 2 10^{44} erg s^{-1} for thecluster luminosity. inspections of the wider optical images reveal some lumpystructure, suggesting that the whole system is still dynamically young.

0811.2041	the stellar populations of lyman break galaxies at z~5	we present the results of spectral energy distribution(sed) fitting analysisfor lyman break galaxies(lbgs) at z~5 in the goods-n and its flanking fields(the goods-ff). with the publicly available irac images in the goods-n and iracdata in the goods-ff, we constructed the rest-frame uv to optical seds for alarge sample (~100) of uv-selected galaxies at z~5. comparing the observed sedswith model seds generated with a population synthesis code, we derived abest-fit set of parameters (stellar mass, age, color excess, and star formationrate) for each of sample lbgs. the derived stellar masses range from 10^8 to10^11m_sun with a median value of 4.1x10^9m_sun. the comparison with z=2-3 lbgsshows that the stellar masses of z~5 lbgs are systematically smaller by afactor of 3-4 than those of z=2-3 lbgs in a similar rest-frame uv luminosityrange. the star formation ages are relatively younger than those of the z=2-3lbgs. we also compared the results for our sample with other studies for thez=5-6 galaxies. although there seem to be similarities and differences in theproperties, we could not conclude its significance. we also derived a stellarmass function of our sample by correcting for incompletenesses. although thenumber densities in the massive end are comparable to the theoreticalpredictions from semi-analytic models, the number densities in the low-masspart are smaller than the model predictions. by integrating the stellar massfunction down to 10^8 m_sun, the stellar mass density at z~5 is calculated tobe (0.7-2.4)x10^7m_sun mpc^-3. the stellar mass density at z~5 is dominated bymassive part of the stellar mass function. compared with other observationalstudies and the model predictions, the mass density of our sample is consistentwith general trend of the increase of the stellar mass density with time.
