0901.1699	dust formation observed in young supernova remnants with spitzer	we present dust features and masses observed in young supernova remnants(snrs) with spitzer irs mapping and staring observations of four youngestsupernova remnants: snr 1e102.2-7219 (e0102) in the smc, cas a and g11.2-0.3 inour galaxy, and n132d in the lmc. the spectral mapping data revealed a numberof dust features which include 21 micron-peak dust and featureless dust in casa and 18-micron peak dust in e0102 and n132d. the 18 micron-peak feature isfitted by a mix of mgsio$_3$ and solid si dust grains, while the 21-micron peakdust is by a mix of silicates and feo; we also explore dust fitting usingcontinuous distribution of ellipsoid grain models. we report detection of cofundamental band from cas a in near-infrared. we review dust features observedand identified in other snrs. the dust emission is spatially correlated withthe ejecta emission, showing dust is formed in sn ejecta. the spectra of e0102show rich gas lines from ejecta including strong ejecta lines of ne and o,including two [ne iii] lines and two [ne v] lines which allow us to diagnosticdensity and temperature of the ejecta and measure the ejecta masses. e0102 andn132d show weak or lacking ar, si, and fe ejecta, whereas the young galacticsnr cas a show strong ar, si, and s and weak fe. we discuss compositions andmasses of dust and association with those of ejecta and finally, dustcontribution from sne to early universe.

0905.0497	dust formation in the young core-collapse supernova remnant e0102	we present spitzer irs and irac observations of the young supernova remnante0102 (snr 1e0102.2-7219) in the small magellanic cloud. the infrared spectrashow strong ejecta lines of ne and o, with the [ne ii] line at 12.8 micronshaving a large velocity dispersion of 2,000-4,500 km/s indicative offast-moving ejecta. unlike the young galactic snr cas a, e0102 lacks emissionfrom ar and fe. diagnostics of the observed [ne iii] line pairs imply that [neiii] emitting ejecta have a low temperature of 650 k, while [ne v] line pairsimply that the infrared [ne v] emitting ejecta have a high density of~10^4/cm3. we have calculated radiative shock models for various velocityranges including the effects of photoionization. the shock model indicates thatthe [ne v] lines come mainly from the cooling zone, which is hot and dense,whereas [ne ii] and [ne iii] come mainly from the photoinization zone, whichhas a low temperature of 400-1000 k. we estimate an infrared emitting ne ejectamass of 0.04 msun from the infrared observations, and discuss implications forthe progenitor mass. the spectra also have a dust continuum feature peaking at18 microns that coincides spatially with the ejecta, providing evidence thatdust formed in the expanding ejecta. the 18-micron-peak dust feature is fittedby a mixture of mgsio3 and si dust grains, while the rest of the continuumrequires either carbon or al2o3 grains. we measure the total dust mass formedwithin the ejecta of e0102 to be ~0.014 msun. the dust mass in e0102 is thus afactor of a few smaller than that in cas a. the composition of the dust is alsodifferent, showing relatively less silicate and likely no fe-bearing dust, asis suggested by the absence of fe-emitting ejecta.

0905.2564	accounting for the foreground contribution to the dust emission towards  kepler's supernova remnant	whether or not supernovae contribute significantly to the overall dust budgetis a controversial subject. submillimetre (submm) observations, sensitive tocold dust, have shown an excess at 450 and 850 microns in young remnantscassiopeia a (cas a) and kepler. some of the submm emission from cas a has beenshown to be contaminated by unrelated material along the line of sight. in thispaper we explore the emission from material towards kepler using submmcontinuum imaging and spectroscopic observations of atomic and molecular gas,via hi, 12co (j=2-1) and 13co (j=2-1). we detect weak co emission (peak ta* =0.2-1k, 1-2km/s fwhm) from diffuse, optically thin gas at the locations of someof the submm clumps. the contribution to the submm emission from foregroundmolecular and atomic clouds is negligible. the revised dust mass for kepler'sremnant is 0.1--1.2 solar masses, about half of the quoted values in theoriginal study by morgan et al. (2003), but still sufficient to explain theorigin of dust at high redshifts.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0911.0176	submillimetre variability of eta carinae: cool dust within the outer  ejecta	previous submillimetre (submm) observations detected 0.7 solar masses of cooldust emission around the luminous blue variable (lbv) star eta carinae. theseobservations were hindered by the low declination of eta carinae andcontamination from free-free emission orginating from the stellar wind. here,we present deep submm observations with laboca at 870um, taken shortly after amaximum in the 5.5-yr radio cycle. we find a significant difference in thesubmm flux measured here compared with the previous measurement: the firstindication of variability at submm wavelengths. a comparison of the submmstructures with ionised emission features suggests the 870um is dominated byemission from the ionised wind and not thermal emission from dust. we estimate0.4 +/- 0.1 solar masses of dust surrounding eta carinae. the spatialdistribution of the submm emission limits the mass loss to within the lastthousand years, and is associated with mass ejected during the great eruptionsand the pre-outburst lbv wind phase; we estimate that eta carinae has ejected &gt;40 solar masses of gas within this timescale.

0911.3593	the submillimetre properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present the results of scuba observations of a complete sample of localulirgs. twenty of the initial sample of 23 sources are detected at 850 um andnearly half of the objects are also detected at 450 um. this data is combinedwith existing observations of a further seven ulirgs to produce the largestsample of submm observations of ulirgs currently available. we use similartechniques to the slugs survey to fit dust spectral energy distributions (seds)to their far-ir emission. we find that ulirgs have a higher dust temperaturethan lower luminosity objects (42k compared to 35k) and a steeper emissivityindex. for those objects where 450 um fluxes are available we also attempt atwo component dust sed fit, with warm and cool dust and a dust emissivity indexof beta=2. such a model has been found to be a good fit to lower luminositysystems. we find that it also works well for ulirgs, but that ulirgs have asmaller cold dust component. comparison of the dust mass derived for ulirgs andmore normal spiral galaxies suggests that the dust content of a ulirg is simplythe combined dust content of the two galaxies whose merger has triggered theulirg activity. we examine the high end of the 850 um luminosity function andfind results consistent with those of the earlier slugs survey. we also findthat ulirgs make up only about 50% of the high end of the 850 um luminosityfunction, with lirgs containing a large mass of cool dust likely to beresponsible for the rest.

1002.3618	the agn fraction of submm-selected galaxies and contributions to the  submm/mm-wave extragalactic background light	we present a comparison of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) at 450, 850 and 1100 microns with deep guaranteed time 15 micronsakari fu-hyu survey data and spitzer guaranteed time data at 3.6-24 microns inthe lockman hole east. the akari data was analysed using bespoke software basedin part on the drizzling and minimum-variance matched filtering developed forshades, and was cross calibrated against infrared space observatory (iso)fluxes. our stacking analyses find akari 15um galaxies with &gt;~200 microjycontribute &gt;10% of the 450 micron background, but only &lt;4% of the 1100 micronbackground, suggesting that different populations contribute at mm-wavelengths.we confirm our earlier result that the ultra-deep 450 micron scuba-2 cosmologysurvey will be dominated by populations already detected by akari and spitzermid-infrared surveys. the superb mid-infrared wavelength coverage afforded bycombining spitzer and akari photometry is an excellent diagnostic of agncontributions, and we find that (23-52)% of submm-selected galaxies have agnbolometric fractions f_agn&gt;0.3.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

1005.2409	the herschel-atlas: extragalactic number counts from 250 to 500 microns	aims. the herschel-atlas survey (h-atlas) will be the largest area survey tobe undertaken by the herschel space observatory. it will cover 550 sq. deg. ofextragalactic sky at wavelengths of 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 microns whencompleted, reaching flux limits (5 sigma) from 32 to 145mjy. we here presentgalaxy number counts obtained for spire observations of the first ~14 sq. deg.observed at 250, 350 and 500 microns. methods. number counts are a fundamentaltool in constraining models of galaxy evolution. we use source catalogsextracted from the h-atlas maps as the basis for such an analysis. correctionfactors for completeness and flux boosting are derived by applying ourextraction method to model catalogs and then applied to the raw observationalcounts. results. we find a steep rise in the number counts at flux levels of100-200mjy in all three spire bands, consistent with results from blast. thecounts are compared to a range of galaxy evolution models. none of the currentmodels is an ideal fit to the data but all ascribe the steep rise to apopulation of luminous, rapidly evolving dusty galaxies at moderate to highredshift.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.3155	evolution of the far-infrared-radio correlation and infrared seds of  massive galaxies over z = 0 - 2	we investigate the far-infrared-radio correlation (frc) ofstellar-mass-selected galaxies in the extended chandra deep field south usingfar-infrared imaging from spitzer and radio imaging from the very large arrayand giant metre-wave radio telescope. we stack in redshift bins to probegalaxies below the noise and confusion limits. radio fluxes are k-correctedusing observed flux ratios, leading to tentative evidence for an evolution inspectral index. we compare spectral energy distribution (sed) templates oflocal galaxies for k-correcting fir fluxes, and show that the data are best fitby a quiescent spiral template (m51) rather than a warm starburst (m82) orulirg (arp220), implying a predominance of cold dust in massive galaxies athigh redshift. in contrast we measure total infrared luminosities that areconsistent with high star-formation rates. we observe that the frc index (q)does not evolve significantly over z=0-2 when computed from k-corrected 24 or160-mum photometry, but that using 70-mum fluxes leads to an apparent declinein q beyond z~1. this suggests some change in the sed at high redshift, eithera steepening of the spectrum at rest-frame ~25-35mum or a deficiency at ~70mumleading to a drop in the total infrared/radio ratios. we compare our results toother work in the literature and find synergies with recent findings on thehigh-redshift frc, high specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies andthe cold dust temperatures in these galaxies.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.6627	dust in historical galactic type ia supernova remnants with herschel	the origin of interstellar dust in galaxies is poorly understood,particularly the relative contributions from supernovae and the cool stellarwinds of low-intermediate mass stars. here, we present herschel pacs and spirephotometry at 70-500um of the historical young supernova remnants: kepler andtycho; both thought to be the remnants of type ia explosion events. we detect awarm dust component in kepler's remnant with t = 82k and mass 0.0031msun; thisis spatially coincident with thermal x-ray emission optical knots andfilaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellarmaterial swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant. similarly fortycho's remnant, we detect warm dust at 90k with mass 0.0086msun. comparing thespatial distribution of the warm dust with x-rays from the ejecta and swept-upmedium, and ha emission arising from the post-shock edge, we show that the warmdust is swept up interstellar material. we find no evidence of a cool (25-50 k)component of dust with mass &gt;0.07msun as observed in core-collapse remnants ofmassive stars. neither the warm or cold dust components detected here arespatially coincident with supernova ejecta material. we compare the lack ofobserved supernova dust with a theoretical model of dust formation in type iaremnants which predicts dust masses of 0.088(0.017)msun for ejecta expandinginto surrounding densities of 1(5)cm-3. the model predicts that silicon- andcarbon-rich dust grains will encounter the interior edge of the observed dustemission at 400 years confirming that the majority of the warm dust originatesfrom swept up circumstellar or interstellar grains (for kepler and tychorespectively). the lack of cold dust grains in the ejecta suggests that type iaremnants do not produce substantial quantities of iron-rich dust grains and hasimportant consequences for the 'missing' iron mass observed in ejecta.

1112.3653	spitzer irac identification of herschel-atlas spire sources	we use spitzer-irac data to identify near-infrared counterparts tosubmillimeter galaxies detected with herschel-spire at 250um in the herschelastrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas). using a likelihood ratioanalysis we identify 146 reliable irac counterparts to 123 spire sources out ofthe 159. we find that, compared to the field population, the spire counterpartsoccupy a distinct region of 3.6 and 4.5um color-magnitude space, and we usethis property to identify a further 23 counterparts to 13 spire sources. theirac identification rate of 86% is significantly higher than those that havebeen demonstrated with wide-field ground-based optical and near-ir imaging ofherschel fields. we estimate a false identification rate of 3.6%, correspondingto 4 to 5 sources. among the 73 counterparts that are undetected in sdss, 57have both 3.6 and 4.5um coverage. of these 43 have [3.6] - [4.5]&gt; 0 indicatingthat they are likely to be at z &gt; 1.4. thus, ~ 40% of identified spire galaxiesare likely to be high redshift (z &gt; 1.4) sources. we discuss the statisticalproperties of the irac-identified spire galaxy sample including far-irluminosities, dust temperatures, star-formation rates, and stellar masses. themajority of our detected galaxies have 10^10 to 10^11 l_sun total irluminosities and are not intense starbursting galaxies as those found at z ~ 2,but they have a factor of 2 to 3 above average specific star-formation ratescompared to near-ir selected galaxy samples.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1206.4692	the evolutionary connection between qsos and smgs: molecular gas in  far-infrared luminous qsos at z ~ 2.5	we present iram plateau de bure interferometer observations of the 12co(3-2)emission from two far-infrared luminous qsos at z ~ 2.5 selected from theherschel-atlas survey. these far-infrared bright qsos were selected to havesupermassive black holes (smbhs) with masses similar to those thought to residein sub-millimetre galaxies (smgs) at z ~ 2.5; making them ideal candidates assystems in transition from an ultraluminous infrared galaxy phase to a sub-mmfaint, unobscured, qso. we detect 12co(3-2) emission from both qsos and wecompare their baryonic, dynamical and smbh masses to those of smgs at the sameepoch. we find that these far-infrared bright qsos have similar dynamical butlower gas masses than smgs. in particular we find that far-infrared bright qsoshave ~50+-23% less warm/dense gas than smgs, which combined with previousresults showing the qsos lack the extended, cool reservoir of gas seen in smgs,suggests that they are at a different evolutionary stage. this is consistentwith the hypothesis that far-infrared bright qsos represent a short (~1myr) butubiquitous phase in the transformation of dust obscured, gas-rich,starburst-dominated smgs into unobscured, gas-poor, qsos.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1208.3079	herschel-atlas: multi-wavelength seds and physical properties of 250  micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5	we present a pan-chromatic analysis of an unprecedented sample of 1402 250micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5 (mean z = 0.24) from the herschel-atlassurvey. we complement our herschel 100-500 micron data with uv-k-bandphotometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey and apply themagphys energy-balance technique to produce pan-chromatic seds for arepresentative sample of 250 micron selected galaxies spanning the most recent5 gyr of cosmic history. we derive estimates of physical parameters, includingstar formation rates, stellar masses, dust masses and infrared luminosities.the typical h-atlas galaxy at z &lt; 0.5 has a far-infrared luminosity in therange 10^10 - 10^12 lsolar (sfr: 1-50 msolar/yr) thus is broadly representativeof normal star forming galaxies over this redshift range. we show that 250micron-selected galaxies contain a larger mass of dust at a given infra-redluminosity or star formation rate than previous samples selected at 60 micronfrom iras. we derive typical seds for h-atlas galaxies, and show that theemergent sed shape is most sensitive to specific star formation rate. theoptical-uv seds also become more reddened due to dust at higher redshifts. ourtemplate seds are significantly cooler than existing infra-red templates. theymay therefore be most appropriate for inferring total ir luminosities frommoderate redshift submillimetre selected samples and for inclusion in models ofthe lower redshift submillimetre galaxy populations.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1212.2211	h-atlas: the cosmic abundance of dust from the far-infrared background  power spectrum	we present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmicfar-infrared background (cfirb) anisotropies in one of the extragalactic fieldsof the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) at 250, 350and 500 \mu m bands. consistent with recent measurements of the cfirb powerspectrum in herschel-spire maps, we confirm the existence of a clear one-haloterm of galaxy clustering on arcminute angular scales with large-scale two-haloterm of clustering at 30 arcminutes to angular scales of a few degrees. thepower spectrum at the largest angular scales, especially at 250 \mu m, iscontaminated by the galactic cirrus. the angular power spectrum is modeledusing a conditional luminosity function approach to describe the spatialdistribution of unresolved galaxies that make up the bulk of the cfirb.integrating over the dusty galaxy population responsible for the backgroundanisotropies, we find that the cosmic abundance of dust, relative to thecritical density, to be between \omega_dust=10^{-6} and 8 x 10^{-6} in theredshift range z ~ 0-3. this dust abundance is consistent with estimates of thedust content in the universe using quasar reddening and magnificationmeasurements in the sdss.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1307.8127	a herschel-atlas study of dusty spheroids: probing the minor-merger  process in the local universe	we use multi-wavelength (0.12 - 500 micron) photometry from herschel-atlas,wise, ukidss, sdss and galex, to study 23 nearby spheroidal galaxies withprominent dust lanes (dlsgs). dlsgs are considered to be remnants of recentminor mergers, making them ideal laboratories for studying both theinterstellar medium (ism) of spheroids and minor-merger-driven star formationin the nearby universe. the dlsgs exhibit star formation rates (sfrs) between0.01 and 10 msun yr^-1, with a median of 0.26 msun yr^-1 (a factor of 3.5greater than the average sg). the median dust mass, dust-to-stellar mass ratioand dust temperature in these galaxies are around 10^7.6 msun yr^-1, ~0.05% and~19.5 k respectively. the dust masses are at least a factor of 50 greater thanthat expected from stellar mass loss and, like the sfrs, show no correlationwith galaxy luminosity, suggesting that both the ism and the star formationhave external drivers. adopting literature gas-to-dust ratios and starformation histories derived from fits to the panchromatic photometry, weestimate that the median current and initial gas-to-stellar mass ratios inthese systems are ~4% and ~7% respectively. if, as indicated by recent work,minor mergers that drive star formation in spheroids with (nuv-r)&gt;3.8 (thecolour range of our dlsgs) have stellar mass ratios between 1:6 and 1:10, thenthe satellite gas fractions are likely &gt;50%.

1308.5681	h-atlas: estimating redshifts of herschel sources from sub-mm fluxes	upon its completion the herschel atlas (h-atlas) will be the largestsubmillimetre survey to date, detecting close to half-a-million sources. itwill only be possible to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a small fractionof these sources. however, if the rest-frame spectral energy distribution (sed)of a typical h-atlas source is known, this sed and the observed herschel fluxescan be used to estimate the redshifts of the h-atlas sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts. in this paper, we use a subset of 40 h-atlas sourceswith previously measured redshifts in the range 0.5&lt;z&lt;4.2 to derive a suitableaverage template for high redshift h-atlas sources. we find that a templatewith two dust components t_c = 23.9 k, t_h = 46.9 k and ratio of mass of colddust to mass of warm dust of 30.1) provides a good fit to the rest-frame fluxesof the sources in our calibration sample. we use a jackknife technique toestimate the accuracy of the redshifts estimated with this template, finding aroot mean square of delta z/(1+z) = 0.26. for sources for which there is priorinformation that they lie at z &gt; 1 we estimate that the rms of delta z/(1+z) =0.12. we have used this template to estimate the redshift distribution for thesources detected in the h-atlas equatorial fields, finding a bimodaldistribution with a mean redshift of 1.2, 1.9 and 2.5 for 250, 350 and 500 umselected sources respectively. \end{abstract}

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

0802.0497	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - vii. optical/ir  photometry and stellar masses of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present estimates of the photometric redshifts, stellar masses and starformation histories of sources in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades). this paper describes the 60 scuba sources detected in the lockmanhole covering an area of ~320 square arcmin. using photometry spanning the bband to 8um, we find that the average scuba source forms a significant fractionof its stars in an early period of star formation and that most of theremainder forms in a shorter more intense burst around the redshift it isobserved. this trend does not vary significantly with source redshift but theexact ratio of early to late mass is quite sensitive to the way extinction istreated in the modelling. however, the sources show a clear increase in stellarmass with redshift, consistent with downsizing. in terms of sed types, only twoout of the 51 sources we have obtained photometric redshifts for are best fitby a quasar-like spectral energy distribution, with approximately 80 per centof the sources being best fit with late-type spectra (sc, im and starburst). byincluding photometry at 850um, we conclude that the average scuba source isforming stars at a rate somewhere between 6 and 30 times the rate implied fromthe rest-frame optical in a dust obscured burst and that this burst creates15-65 per cent of the total stellar mass. using a simplistic calculation, weestimate from the average star formation history that between one in five andone in 15 bright (l_* +2 mag &lt; l_optical &lt; l_* -1 mag) galaxies in the fieldover the interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 will at some point in their lifetime experience asimilar energetic dusty burst of star formation. finally, we compute theevolution of the star formation rate density and find it peaks around z=2.

1311.5898	herschel-atlas: deep hst/wfc3 imaging of strongly lensed submillimeter  galaxies	we report on deep near-infrared observations obtained with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope (hst) of the first fiveconfirmed gravitational lensing events discovered by the herschel astrophysicalterahertz large area survey (h-atlas). we succeed in disentangling thebackground galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the twocomponents. the hst data allow us to significantly improve on previousconstraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy and to perform accuratelens modelling of these systems, as described in the accompanying paper by dyeet al. we fit the spectral energy distributions of the background sources fromnear-ir to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification factors estimatedby dye et al. to derive the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies. wefind these galaxies to have star-formation rates of approximately 400 to 2000m_sol/yr, with approximately (6-25)x10^10 m_sol of their baryonic mass alreadyturned into stars. at these rates of star formation, all remaining moleculargas will be exhausted in less than 100 myr, reaching a final mass in stars of afew 10^11 m_sol. these galaxies are thus proto-ellipticals caught during theirmajor episode of star formation, and observed at the peak epoch z=1.5-3 of thecosmic star formation history of the universe.

1401.0986	herschel-atlas/gama:how does the far-ir luminosity function depend on  galaxy group properties?	we use the herschel atlas (h-atlas) phase i data to study the conditionalluminosity function of far-ir (250 um) selected galaxies in optically-selectedgalaxy groups from the gama spectroscopic survey, as well as environmentaleffects on the far-ir-to-optical colour. we applied two methods, which gaveconsistent results for the far-ir conditional luminosity functions. the directmatching method matches h-atlas sources to gama/sdss galaxies, then links theoptical counterparts to gama groups. the stacking method counts the number offar-ir sources within the projected radii of gama groups, subtracting the localbackground. we investigated the dependence of the far-ir (250 um) luminosityfunction on group mass in the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt; 10d14msun/h and on redshiftin the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, using a sample of 3000 groups containing h-atlassources with gama redshifts over an area of 126 sq. deg. we find that thecharacteristic 250 um luminosity, l^*(250), increases with group mass up to m_h~ 10d13msun/h, but is roughly constant above this, while it increases withredshift at high group masses, but less so at low masses. we also find that thegroup far-ir luminosity-to-mass ratio l(250)/m_h increases with redshift and ishigher in low-mass groups. we estimate that around 70% of the 250 um luminositydensity in the local universe is contributed by groups with m_h &gt; 10d12msun/h.we also find that the far-ir-to-optical colours of h-atlas galaxies areindependent of group mass over the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt;10d14msun/h in the localuniverse. we also compare our observational results with recent semi-analyticalmodels, and find that none of these galaxy formation model can reproduce theconditional far-ir luminosity functions of galaxy groups.

1403.2994	herschel-atlas: properties of dusty massive galaxies at low and high  redshifts	we present a comparison of the physical properties of a rest-frame $250\mu$mselected sample of massive, dusty galaxies from $0&lt;z&lt;5.3$. our sample comprises29 high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs) from the literature, and 843dusty galaxies at $z&lt;0.5$ from the herschel-atlas, selected to have a similarstellar mass to the smgs. the $z&gt;1$ smgs have an average sfr of$390^{+80}_{-70}\,$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ which is 120 times that of thelow-redshift sample matched in stellar mass to the smgs (sfr$=3.3\pm{0.2}$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). the smgs harbour a substantial mass of dust($1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times{10}^9\,$m$_\odot$), compared to$(1.6\pm0.1)\times{10}^8\,$m$_\odot$ for low-redshift dusty galaxies. at lowredshifts the dust luminosity is dominated by the diffuse ism, whereas a largefraction of the dust luminosity in smgs originates from star-forming regions.at the same dust mass smgs are offset towards a higher sfr compared to thelow-redshift h-atlas galaxies. this is not only due to the higher gas fractionin smgs but also because they are undergoing a more efficient mode of starformation, which is consistent with their bursty star-formation histories. theoffset in sfr between smgs and low-redshift galaxies is similar to that foundin co studies, suggesting that dust mass is as good a tracer of molecular gasas co.

1403.2995	the dust budget crisis in high-redshift submillimetre galaxies	we apply a chemical evolution model to investigate the sources and evolutionof dust in a sample of 26 high-redshift ($z&gt;1$) submillimetre galaxies (smgs)from the literature, with complete photometry from ultraviolet to thesubmillimetre. we show that dust produced only by low-intermediate mass starsfalls a factor 240 short of the observed dust masses of smgs, the well-known`dust-budget crisis'. adding an extra source of dust from supernovae canaccount for the dust mass in 19 per cent of the smg sample. even afteraccounting for dust produced by supernovae the remaining deficit in the dustmass budget provides support for higher supernova yields, substantial graingrowth in the interstellar medium or a top-heavy imf. including efficientdestruction of dust by supernova shocks increases the tension between our modeland observed smg dust masses. the models which best reproduce the physicalproperties of smgs have a rapid build-up of dust from both stellar andinterstellar sources and minimal dust destruction. alternatively, invoking atop-heavy imf or significant changes in the dust grain properties can solve thedust budget crisis only if dust is produced by both low mass stars andsupernovae and is not efficiently destroyed by supernova shocks.

1404.5676	herschel-atlas: far-infrared properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet  quasars	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from thefaint im- ages radio sky at twenty-one centimetres (first) and the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7), over the h-atlas phase 1 area(9h, 12h and 14.5h). using a stacking analysis we find a significantcorrelation between the far-infrared luminosity and 1.4-ghz luminosity forradio-loud quasars. partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsiccorrelation after removing the redshift contribution while for radio-quietquasars no partial correlation is found. using a single-temperature grey-bodymodel we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in the case ofradio-loud quasars comparing to radio-quiet quasars. also, radio-loud quasarsare found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift andoptical luminosity bins. in addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at loweroptical luminosities tend to have on average higher fir and 250-micronluminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same opticalluminosites. even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe thefir data, the fir luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.these results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with starformation especially at lower accretion rates.

0803.0475	the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades) - viii. the nature  of faint submm galaxies in shades, swire and sxdf surveys	we present the optical-to-submm spectral energy distributions for 33 radio &amp;mid-ir identified submillimetre galaxies discovered via the shades 850 micronscuba imaging in the subaru-xmm deep field (sxdf). optical data for the sourcescomes from the subaru-xmm deep field (sxdf) and mid- and far-ir fluxes fromswire. we obtain photometric redshift estimates for our sources using opticaland irac 3.6 and 4.5 micron fluxes. we then fit spectral energy distribution(sed) templates to the longer wavelength data to determine the nature of thefar-ir emission that dominates the bolometric luminosity of these sources. theinfrared template fits are also used to resolve ambiguous identifications andcases of redshift aliasing. the redshift distribution obtained broadly matchesprevious results for submm sources and on the shades sxdf field. our templatefitting finds that agn, present in about 10% of sources, do not contributesignificantly to their bolometric luminosity. dust heating by starbursts, witheither arp220 or m82 type seds, appears to be responsible for the luminosity inmost sources (23/33 are fitted by arp220 templates, 2/33 by the warmer m82templates). 8/33 sources, in contrast, are fit by a cooler cirrus dusttemplate, suggesting that cold dust has a role in some of these highly luminousobjects. three of our sources appear to have multiple identifications orcomponents at the same redshift, but we find no statistical evidence that closeassociations are common among our shades sources. examination of rest-frame k-band luminosity suggests that 'downsizing' is underway in the submm galaxypopulation, with lower redshift systems lying in lower mass host galaxies. ofour 33 identifications six are found to be of lower reliability but theirexclusion would not significantly alter our conclusions.

1406.1487	lens models of herschel-selected galaxies from high-resolution near-ir  observations	we present keck-adaptive optics and hubble space telescope high resolutionnear-infrared (ir) imaging for 500 um-bright candidate lensing systemsidentified by the herschel multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) andherschel astrophysical terahertz survey (h-atlas). out of 87 candidates withnear-ir imaging, 15 (~17%) display clear near-ir lensing morphologies. wepresent near-ir lens models to reconstruct and recover basic rest-frame opticalmorphological properties of the background galaxies from 12 new systems.sources with the largest near-ir magnification factors also tend to be the mostcompact, consistent with the size bias predicted from simulations and pre-vious lensing models for sub-millimeter galaxies. for four new sources thatalso have high-resolution sub-mm maps, we test for differential lensing betweenthe stellar and dust components and find that the 880 um magnification factor(u_880) is ~1.5 times higher than the near-ir magnification factor (u_nir), onaverage. we also find that the stellar emission is ~2 times more extended insize than dust. the rest-frame optical properties of our sample ofherschel-selected lensed smgs are consistent with those of unlensed smgs, whichsuggests that the two populations are similar.

1407.5994	colour matters: the effects of lensing on the positional offsets between  optical and submillimetre galaxies in herschel-atlas	we report an unexpected variation in the positional offset distributionsbetween herschel-atlas sub-millimetre (submm) sources and their opticalassociations, depending on both 250-{\mu}m signal-to-noise ratio and250/350-{\mu}m colour. we show that redder and brighter submm sources haveoptical associations with a broader distribution of positional offsets thanwould be expected if these offsets were due to random positional errors in thesource extraction. the observation can be explained by two possible effects:either red submm sources trace a more clustered population than blue ones, andtheir positional errors are increased by confusion; or red submm sources aregenerally at high redshifts and are frequently associated with low-redshiftlensing structures which are identified as false counterparts. we performvarious analyses of the data, including the multiplicity of opticalassociations, the redshift and magnitude distributions in h-atlas in comparisonto hermes, and simulations of weak lensing, and we conclude that the effectsare most likely to be explained by widespread weak lensing of herschel-spiresources by foreground structures. this has important consequences forcounterpart identification and derived redshift distributions and luminosityfunctions of submm surveys.

1409.2499	the temperature dependence of the far-infrared-radio correlation in the  herschel-atlas	we use 10,387 galaxies from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) to probe the far-infrared radio correlation (firc) of starforming galaxies as a function of redshift, wavelength, and effective dusttemperature. all of the sources in our 250 {\mu}m-selected sample havespectroscopic redshifts, as well as 1.4 ghz flux density estimates measuredfrom the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres (first) survey.this enables us to study not only individual sources, but also the averageproperties of the 250 {\mu}m selected population using median stackingtechniques. we find that individual sources detected at $\geq 5\sigma$ in boththe h-atlas and first data have logarithmic flux ratios (i.e. firc $q_\lambda$parameters) consistent with previous studies of the firc. in contrast, thestacked values show larger $q_\lambda$, suggesting excess far-ir fluxdensity/luminosity in 250{\mu}m selected sources above what has been seen inprevious analyses. in addition, we find evidence that 250 {\mu}m sources withwarm dust seds have a larger 1.4 ghz luminosity than the cooler sources in oursample. though we find no evidence for redshift evolution of the monochromaticfirc, our analysis reveals significant temperature dependence. whilst the fircis reasonably constant with temperature at 100 {\mu}m, we find increasinginverse correlation with temperature as we probe longer pacs and spirewavelengths. these results may have important implications for the use ofmonochromatic dust luminosity as a star formation rate indicator instar-forming galaxies, and in the future, for using radio data to determinegalaxy star formation rates.

1410.4502	cross-correlation between the cmb lensing potential measured by planck  and high-z sub-mm galaxies detected by the herschel-atlas survey	we present the first measurement of the correlation between the map of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) lensing potential derived from the\emph{planck} nominal mission data and $z\gtrsim 1.5$ galaxies detected by the\emph{herschel}-atlas (h-atlas) survey covering about $600\,\hbox{deg}^2$, i.e.about 1.4\% of the sky. we reject the hypothesis that there is no correlationbetween cmb lensing and galaxy detection at a $20\,\sigma$ significance,checking the result by performing a number of null tests. the significance ofthe detection of the theoretically expected cross-correlation signal is foundto be $10\,\sigma$. the galaxy bias parameter, $b$, derived from a jointanalysis of the cross-power spectrum and of the auto-power spectrum of thegalaxy density contrast is found to be $b=2.80^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, consistentwith earlier estimates for h-atlas galaxies at similar redshifts. on the otherhand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be a factor $1.62 \pm0.16$ higher than expected from the standard model and also found bycross-correlation analyses with other tracers of the large-scale structure. theenhancement due to lensing magnification can account for only a fraction of theexcess cross-correlation signal. we suggest that part of it may be due to anincomplete removal of the contamination of the cib, that includes the h-atlassources we are cross-correlating with. in any case, the highly significantdetection reported here using a catalog covering only 1.4\% of the skydemonstrates the potential of cmb lensing correlations with submillimetersurveys.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

1503.01128	a multi-wavelength exploration of the [cii]/ir ratio in h-atlas/gama  galaxies out to z=0.2	we explore the behaviour of [cii]-157.74um forbidden fine-structure lineobserved in a sample of 28 galaxies selected from ~50deg^2 of the h-atlassurvey. the sample is restricted to galaxies with flux densities higher thans_160um&gt;150mjy and optical spectra from the gama survey at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2. far-irspectra centred on this redshifted line were taken with the pacs instrumenton-board the herschel space observatory. the galaxies span 10&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12(where l_ir=l_ir[8-1000um]) and 7.3&lt;log(l_[cii]/lo)&lt;9.3, covering a variety ofoptical galaxy morphologies. the sample exhibits the so-called [cii] deficit athigh ir luminosities, i.e. l_[cii]/l_ir (hereafter [cii]/ir) decreases at highl_ir. we find significant differences between those galaxies presenting[cii]/ir&gt;2.5x10^-3 with respect to those showing lower ratios. in particular,those with high ratios tend to have: (1) l_ir&lt;10^11lo; (2) cold dusttemperatures, t_d&lt;30k; (3) disk-like morphologies in r-band images; (4) a wisecolour 0.5&lt;s_12um/s_22um&lt;1.0; (5) low surface brightness sigma_ir~10^8-9 lokpc^-2, (6) and specific star-formation rates of ssfr~0.05-3 gyr^-1. we suggestthat the strength of the far-uv radiation fields (&lt;g_o&gt;) is main parameterresponsible for controlling the [cii]/ir ratio. it is possible that relativelyhigh &lt;g_o&gt; creates a positively charged dust grain distribution, impeding anefficient photo-electric extraction of electrons from these grains to thencollisionally excite carbon atoms. within the brighter ir population,11&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12, the low [cii]/ir ratio is unlikely to be modified by [cii]self absorption or controlled by the presence of a moderately luminous agn(identified via the bpt diagram).

1503.08720	revealing the complex nature of the strong gravitationally lensed system  h-atlas j090311.6+003906 using alma	we have modelled atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) longbaseline imaging of the strong gravitational lens system h-atlasj090311.6+003906 (sdp.81). we have reconstructed the distribution of band 6 and7 continuum emission in the z=3.042 source and we have determined its kinematicproperties by reconstructing co(5-4) and co(8-7) line emission in bands 4 and6. the continuum imaging reveals a highly non-uniform distribution of dust withclumps on scales of 200 pc. in contrast, the co line emission shows arelatively smooth, disk-like velocity field which is well fit by a rotatingdisk model with an inclination angle of 40+/-5 degrees and an asymptoticrotation velocity of 320 km/s. the inferred dynamical mass within 1.5kpc is(3.5+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol which is comparable to the total molecular gas massesof (2.7+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol and (3.5+/-0.6)x10^{10} m_sol from the dustcontinuum emission and co emission respectively. our new reconstruction of thelensed hst near-infrared emission shows two objects which appear to beinteracting, with the rotating disk of gas and dust revealed by alma distinctlyoffset from the near-infrared emission. the clumpy nature of the dust and a lowvalue of the toomre parameter of q=0.3 suggest that the disk is in a state ofcollapse. we estimate a star formation rate in the disk of 470+/-80 m_sol/yrwith an efficiency 65 times greater than typical low-redshift galaxies. ourfindings add to the growing body of evidence that the most infra-red luminous,dust obscured galaxies in the high redshift universe represent a population ofmerger induced starbursts.

1504.05254	spitzer imaging of strongly-lensed herschel-selected dusty star forming  galaxies	we present the rest-frame optical spectral energy distribution and stellarmasses of six herschel- selected gravitationally lensed dusty, star-forminggalaxies (dsfgs) at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. these galaxies were first identified withherschel/spire imaging data from the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas) and the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey(hermes). the targets were observed with spitzer/irac at 3.6 and 4.5um. due tothe spatial resolution of the irac observations at the level of 2 arcseconds,the lensing features of a background dsfg in the near-infrared are blended withthe flux from the foreground lensing galaxy in the irac imaging data. we makeuse of higher resolution hubble/wfc3 or keck/nirc2 adaptive optics imaging datato fit light profiles of the foreground lensing galaxy (or galaxies) as a wayto model the foreground components, in order to successfully disentangle theforeground lens and background source flux densities in the irac images. theflux density measurements at 3.6 and 4.5um, once combined with hubble/wfc3 andkeck/nirc2 data, provide important constraints on the rest-frame opticalspectral energy distribution of the herschel-selected lensed dsfgs. we modelthe combined uv- to millimeter-wavelength seds to establish the stellar mass,dust mass, star-formation rate, visual extinction, and other parameters foreach of these herschel-selected dsfgs. these systems have inferred stellarmasses in the range 8 x 10^10 to 4 x 10^11 msun and star-formation rates ofaround 100 msun yr-1. this puts these lensed sub-millimeter systems well abovethe sfr-m* relation observed for normal star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. the high values of sfr inferred for these systems are consistentwith a major merger-driven scenario for star formation.

1505.06947	h-atlas/gama and hevics - dusty early-type galaxies in different  environments	the herschel space observatory has had a tremendous impact on the study ofextragalactic dust. specifically, early-type galaxies (etg) have been the focusof several studies. in this paper we combine results from two herschel studies- a virgo cluster study hevics and a broader, low-redshift h-atlas/gama study -and contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies. thiscomparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multipleherschel studies of early-type galaxies. a comparison between consistentmodified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out, revealing strongdifferences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar massratio. in particular, the hevics sample lacks massive etg with as high aspecific dust content as found in h-atlas. this is most likely connected withthe difference in environment for the two samples. we calculate nearestneighbour environment densities in a consistent way, showing that h-atlas etgoccupy sparser regions of the local universe, whereas hevics etg occupy denseregions. this is also true for etg that are not herschel-detected but are inthe virgo and gama parent samples. spectral energy distributions are fit to thepanchromatic data. from these we find that in h-atlas the specific starformation rate anticorrelates with stellar mass and reaches values as high asin our galaxy. on the other hand hevics etg appear to have little starformation. based on the trends found here, h-atlas etg are thought to have moreextended star formation histories and a younger stellar population than hevicsetg.

1507.01552	$\textit{herschel}$-atlas:the connection between star formation and agn  activity in radio-loud and radio-quiet active galaxies	we examine the relationship between star formation and agn activity byconstructing matched samples of local ($0&lt;z&lt;0.6$) radio-loud and radio-quietagn in the $\textit{herschel}$-atlas fields. radio-loud agn are classified ashigh-excitation and low-excitation radio galaxies (hergs, lergs) using theiremission lines and $\textit{wise}$ 22-$\mu$m luminosity. agn accretion and jetpowers in these active galaxies are traced by [oiii] emission-line and radioluminosity, respectively. star formation rates (sfrs) and specific starformation rates (ssfrs) were derived using $\textit{herschel}$ 250-$\mu$mluminosity and stellar mass measurements from the sdss$-$mpa-jhu catalogue. inthe past, star formation studies of agn have mostly focused on high-redshiftsources to observe the thermal dust emission that peaks in the far-infrared,which limited the samples to powerful objects. however, with$\textit{herschel}$ we can expand this to low redshifts. our stacking analysesshow that sfrs and ssfrs of both radio-loud and radio-quiet agn increase withincreasing agn power but that radio-loud agn tend to have lower sfr.additionally, radio-quiet agn are found to have approximately an order ofmagnitude higher ssfrs than radio-loud agn for a given level of agn power. thedifference between the star formation properties of radio-loud and -quiet agnis also seen in samples matched in stellar mass.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.

astro-ph;0002234	the scuba local universe galaxy survey i: first measurements of the  submillimetre luminosity and dust mass functions	we have used scuba to observe a complete sample of 104 galaxies selected at60 microns from the iras bgs and we present here the 850 micron measurements.fitting the 60,100 and 850 micron fluxes with a single temperature dust modelgives the sample mean temperature t=36 k and beta = 1.3. we do not rule out thepossibility of dust which is colder than this, if a 20 k component was presentthen our dust masses would increase by factor 1.5-3. we present the firstmeasurements of the luminosity and dust mass functions, which were well fittedby schechter functions (unlike those 60 microns). we have correlated manyglobal galaxy properties with the submillimetre and find that there is atendancy for less optically luminous galaxies to contain warmer dust and havegreater star formation efficiencies (cf. young 1999). the average gas-to-dustratio for the sample is 581 +/- 43 (using both atomic and molecular hydrogen),significantly higher than the galactic value of 160. we believe thisdiscrepancy is due to a cold dust component at t &lt; 20 k. there is a suprisinglytight correlation between dust mass and the mass of molecular hydrogen asestimated from co measurements, with an intrinsic scatter of ~50%.

astro-ph;0002436	constraining the radio-submm redshift indicator using data from the  scuba local universe galaxy survey	many of the faint submm sources uncovered by deep scuba surveys still remainunidentified at most, if not all other wavelengths. the most successful methodso far of obtaining accurate positions and hence allowing more secureidentifications has been to use centimetre wavelength imaging with the vla.this has led to a tempting approach for obtaining redshift estimates for thispopulation (carilli &amp; yun 1999,2000), which relies on the tight fir-radiorelationship and takes advantage of the steep spectral slope in the submm. inthis paper we use the submm data from the scuba local universe galaxy survey(slugs) to estimate the usefulness of, and the uncertainties in, theradio-submm redshift estimator. we investigate the dependencies of thesubmm-radio spectral index on various galaxy properties and find that there isno significant trend with dust temperature or 850 micron luminosity. the ratioof 850 micron/1.4 ghz flux was found to decrease with increasing radio and firluminosity, and we propose that this is due to a component of the dust notassociated with recent star formation but which is instead heated to 15-20 k bythe general interstellar radiation field.

astro-ph;0007054	high spatial resolution observations of cudss14a: a scuba-selected  ultraluminous galaxy at high redshift	we present a high-resolution millimetre interferometric image of thebrightest scuba-selected galaxy from the canada-uk deep scuba survey (cudss).we make a very clear detection at 1.3 mm, but fail to resolve any structure inthe source. the interferometric position is within 1.5 arcsec of the scuba 850$\mu$m centroid, and also within 1.5 arcsec of a 44 $\mu$jy radio source and avery faint, extremely red galaxy which we had previously identified as thesubmillimetre source. we also present new optical and infrared imaging, andinfrared spectroscopy of this source. we model the overall spectral energydistribution and conclude that it lies within the redshift range 2$&lt; z &lt; 4.5$.the submm/fir luminosity of cudss14a is very weakly dependent on redshiftwithin the constrained range, and is roughly 4$\times10^{12}$ l$_\odot$ (forh$_0$=75 and an assumed arp220-like spectrum), which implies a star-formationrate $\sim$1000 m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. we derive an approximate gas mass of $\sim10^{10}$ m$_\odot$ which would imply the current star-forming activity cannotbe sustained for longer than about 10 million years. with the present datahowever we are unable to rule out a significant agn contribution to the totalluminosity.

astro-ph;0201180	the canada-uk deep submillimeter survey vi: the 3-hour field	we present the complete submillimeter data for the canada-uk deepsubmillimeter survey (cudss) 3-hour field. the obeservations were taken withthe submillimeter common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerkmaxwell telescope on mauna kea. the 3-hour field is one of two main fields inour survey and covers 60 square arcminutes to a 3-sigma depth of 3 mjy. in thisfield we have detected 27 sources above 3-sigma and 15 above 3.5-sigma. weassume the source counts follow the form $n(s) {\propto} s^{-\alpha}$ andmeasure $\alpha$ = 3.3$^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$. this is in good agreement with previousstudies and further supports our claim (eales et al., 2000) that scuba sourcesbrighter than 3 mjy produce ~20% of the 850$\mu$m background energy. usingpreliminary iso 15 $\mu$m maps and vla 1.4 ghz data we have identifiedcounterparts for six objects and have marginal detections at 450$\mu$m for twoadditional sources. with this information we estimate a median redshift for thesample of 2.0$\pm$0.5, with $\sim$10% lying at $z&lt;$ 1. we have measured theangular clustering of s850 &gt; 3 mjy sources using the source catalogues from thecudss two main fields, the 3-hour and 14-hour fields, and find a marginaldetection of clustering, primarily from the 14-hour field, of$\omega(\theta)=4.4\pm2.9 \theta^{-0.8}$. this is consistent with clustering atleast as strong as that seen for the lyman-break galaxy population and theextremely red objects. since scuba sources are selected over a broader range inredshifts than these two populations the strength of the true spatialclustering is expected to be correspondingly stronger.

astro-ph;0201181	the canada-uk deep submillimeter survey v: the submillimeter properties  of lyman-break galaxies	we have used 850$\mu$m maps obtained as part of the canada-uk deepsubmillimeter survey (cudss) to investigate the sub-mm properties oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). we used three samples of lyman-break galaxies: twofrom the canada-france deep fields (cfdf) survey covering cudss-14 and cudss-3,and one from steidel and collaborators also covering cudss-14. we measure amean flux from both cfdf lbg samples at a level of $\sim2\sigma$ of 0.414 $\pm$0.263 mjy for cudss-03 and 0.382 $\pm$ 0.206 mjy for cudss-14, but the steidelet al. sample is consistent with zero flux. from this we place upper limits onthe lyman-break contribution to the $850{\mu}m$ background of $\sim$20%. wehave also measured the cross-clustering between the lbgs and scuba sources.  from this measurement we infer a large clustering amplitude of $r_o$ = 11.5$\pm$ 3.0 $\pm$ 3.0 $h^{-1}$mpc for the steidel et al. sample (where the firsterror is statistical and the second systematic), $r_o$ = 4.5 $\pm$ 7.0 $\pm$5.0 $h^{-1}$mpc for cfdf-14 and $r_o$ = 7.5 $\pm$ 7.0 $\pm$ 5.0 $h^{-1}$mpc forcfdf-3. the steidel et al sample, for which we have most only significantdetection of clustering is also the largest of the three samples and hasspectroscopically confirmed redshifts.

astro-ph;0210260	a census of metals at high and low redshifts and the connection between  submillimetre sources and spheroid formation	deep surveys in many wavebands have shown that the rate at which stars wereforming was at least a factor of 10 higher at z &gt; 1 than today. heavy elements(metals) are produced by stars, and the star formation history deduced by thesesurveys implies that a significant fraction of metals in the universe todayshould already exist at z~2-3. however, only 10% of the total metals expectedto exist at this epoch have so far been accounted for (in dlas and the lymanforest). in this paper, we use the results of submillimetre surveys of thelocal and high redshift universe to show that there was much more dust ingalaxies in the past. we find that a large proportion of the missing metals aretraced by this dust, bringing the metals implied from the star formationhistory and observations into agreement. we also show that the observeddistribution of dust masses at high redshift can be reproduced remarkably wellby a simple model for the evolution of dust in spheroids, suggesting that thedescendants of the dusty galaxies found in the deep submm surveys are therelatively dust-free spiral bulges and ellipticals in the universe today.

0808.3139	the star-formation history of k-selected galaxies	we have studied the ujy radio properties of k-selected galaxies detected inthe ultra-deep survey portion of ukidss using 610- and 1,400-mhz images fromthe vla and gmrt. these deep radio mosaics, combined with the largest anddeepest k image currently available, allow high-s/n detections of manyk-selected sub-populations, including sbzk and pbzk star-forming and passivegalaxies. we find a strong correlation between the radio and k fluxes and alinear relationship between sfr and k luminosity. we find no evidence, fromeither radio spectral indices or a comparison with submm-derived sfrs, that thefull sample is strongly contaminated by agn. the sbzk and pbzk galaxies havesimilar levels of radio flux, sfr and specific sfr (ssfr) at z &lt; 1.4,suggesting there is strong contamination of the pbzk sample by star-forminggalaxies. at z &gt; 1.4, pbzk galaxies become difficult to detect in the radiostack, though the implied sfrs are still much higher than expected forpassively evolving galaxies. their radio emission may come from low-luminosityagn. eros straddle the passive and star-forming regions of the bzk diagram andalso straddle the two groups in terms of their radio properties. k-bright erosamples are dominated by passive galaxies and faint ero samples contain morestar-forming galaxies. the star-formation history (sfh) from stacking all ksources in the uds agrees well with that derived for other wavebands and otherradio surveys, at least out to z ~ 2. the radio-derived sfh then appears tofall more steeply than that measured at other wavelengths. the ssfr fork-selected sources rises strongly with redshift at all stellar masses, andshows a weak dependence on stellar mass. high- and low-mass galaxies show asimilar decline in ssfr since z ~ 2 (abridged).

astro-ph;0401602	revised masses of dust and gas of slugs fir bright galaxies based on a  recent co survey	recent co measurements of an essentially complete sub-sample of galaxies fromthe scuba local universe survey (slugs) are used to examine their implicationsfor dust and gas masses in this sample. estimates of dust masses are affectedby a contribution to the scuba brightness measurements by co(3-2) emission, andmolecular gas masses by the use of a modified value of the co-to-h_2 conversionfactor x. the average dust mass is reduced by 25-38 per cent, which has nobearing on earlier conclusions concering the shapes of the dust mass luminosityfunction derived from the slugs. the value of x found from the co survey, whenapplied together with the reduction in dust masses, leads to lower estimatesfor the mean gas-to-dust mass ratios, where the gas includes both h_2 and hi.for the co sample, the mean global ratio is reduced from approximately 430 toabout 320-360, but is further reduced to values near 50 when applied to thenuclear regions relevant to the co observations. we discuss these results andsuggest that the differences between the nuclear and outer regions may simplyreflect differences in metallicity or the existence of considerable amounts ofunobserved cold dust in the outer regions of these galaxiies.

0809.0887	cassiopeia a: dust factory revealed via submillimetre polarimetry	if type-ii supernovae - the evolutionary end points of short-lived, massivestars - produce a significant quantity of dust (&gt;0.1 m_sun) then they canexplain the rest-frame far-infrared emission seen in galaxies and quasars inthe first gyr of the universe. submillimetre observations of the galacticsupernova remnant, cas a, provided the first observational evidence for theformation of significant quantities of dust in type-ii supernovae. in thispaper we present new data which show that the submm emission from cas a ispolarised at a level significantly higher than that of its synchrotronemission. the orientation is consistent with that of the magnetic field in casa, implying that the polarised submm emission is associated with the remnant.no known mechanism would vary the synchrotron polarisation in this way and sowe attribute the excess polarised submm flux to cold dust within the remnant,providing fresh evidence that cosmic dust can form rapidly. this is supportedby the presence of both polarised and unpolarised dust emission in the north ofthe remnant, where there is no contamination from foreground molecular clouds.the inferred dust polarisation fraction is unprecedented (f_pol ~ 30%) which,coupled with the brief timescale available for grain alignment (&lt;300 yr),suggests that supernova dust differs from that seen in other galactic sources(where f_pol=2-7%), or that a highly efficient grain alignment process mustoperate in the environment of a supernova remnant.

astro-ph;0609039	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- ii. submillimetre  maps, catalogue and number counts	we present the maps, source catalogue and number counts of the largest, mostcomplete and unbiased extragalactic submillimetre survey ever undertaken: the850-micron scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades). using thesubmillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt), shades mapped two separate regions of sky: thesubaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf) and the lockman hole east (lh). these scubamaps cover 720 square arcmin with an rms noise level of about 2 mjy and haveuncovered &gt;100 submillimetre galaxies. in order to ensure the utmost robustnessof the resulting source catalogue, data reduction was independently carried outby four sub-groups drawn within the shades team, providing an unprecedenteddegree of reliability with respect to other scuba catalogues available from theliterature. individual source lists from the four groups were combined toproduce a robust 120-object shades catalogue; an invaluable resource forfollow-up campaigns aiming to study the properties of a complete and consistentsample of submillimetre galaxies. we present differential and integral sourcenumber counts of submillimetre galaxies and find that the differential countsare better fit with a broken power-law or a schechter function than with asingle power-law; the shades data alone significantly show that a break isrequired at several mjy, although the precise position of the break is not wellconstrained. we also find that an 850-micron survey complete down to 2 mjywould resolve 20-30 per cent of the far-ir background into point sources.[abridged]
