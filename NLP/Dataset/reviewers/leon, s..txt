0706.2555	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies. v. quantification of the  isolation	the amiga project aims to build a well defined and statistically significantreference sample of isolated galaxies in order to estimate the environmentaleffects on the formation and evolution of galaxies. the goal of this paper isto provide a measure of the environment of the isolated galaxies in the amigasample, quantifying the influence of the candidate neighbours identified in ourprevious work and their potential effects on the evolution of the primarygalaxies. here we provide a quantification of the isolation degree of thegalaxies in this sample. our starting sample is the catalogue of isolatedgalaxies (cig). we used two parameters to estimate the influence exerted by theneighbour galaxies on the cig galaxy: the local number density of neighbourgalaxies and the tidal strength affecting the cig galaxy. we show that bothparameters together provide a comprehensive picture of the environment. forcomparison, those parameters have also been derived for galaxies in denserenvironments such as triplets, groups and clusters. the cig galaxies show acontinuous spectrum of isolation, as quantified by the two parameters, fromvery isolated to interacting. the fraction of cig galaxies whose properties areexpected to be influenced by the environment is however low (159 out of 950galaxies). the isolated parameters derived for the comparsion samples gavehigher values than for the cig and we found clear differences for the averagevalues of the 4 samples considered, proving the sensitivity of theseparameters. the environment of the galaxies in the cig has been characterised,using two complementary parameters quantifying the isolation degree, the localnumber density of the neighbour galaxies and the tidal forces affecting theisolated galaxies.

0903.4417	molecular gas in nearby powerful radio galaxies	powerful radio-agn are normally hosted by massive elliptical galaxies whichare usually very poor in molecular gas. nevertheless the gas is needed in thevery center to feed the nuclear activity. thus it is important to study theorigin, the distribution and the kinematics of the molecular gas in suchobjects. we have performed at the iram-30m telescope a survey of the co(1-0)and co(2-1) emission in the most powerful radio galaxies of the local universe,selected only on the basis of their radio-continuum fluxes. the main result ofthis survey is the very low content in molecular gas of such galaxies comparedto fir selected galaxies. the median value of the molecular gas mass, takinginto account the upper limits, is 1x10^8 msun; if we calculate it for all thegalaxies together, and if we separate them into fr-i and fr-ii type galaxies,an important difference is found between them. moreover, the co spectraindicates the presence of a central molecular gas disk in these radio galaxies.our results contrast with previous surveys, mainly selected through the firemission, with a larger mass of molecular gas observed. the first resultsindicate that minor mergers are good candidates to fuel the central part of theradio galaxies of our sample.

0707.1190	nuclear starburst-driven evolution of the central region in ngc 6764	we study the co and the radiocontinuum emission in an active galaxy toanalyze the interplay between the central activity and the molecular gas. wepresent new high-resolution observations of the co(1-0) and co(2-1) emissionlines, and 3.5 cm and 20 cm radio continuum emission in the central region ofthe liner/starburst galaxy ngc 6764. the galaxy has an outflow morphology inradio continuum, spatially coincident with the co and h$\alpha$ emission, andcentered slightly off the radio continuum peak at the liner nucleus. the totalmolecular gas mass in the center is about 7x10^8 \msun, using a co luminosityto total molecular gas conversion factor that is three times lower than thestandard one. co(1-0) emission is found near the boundaries of the radiocontinuum emission cone. the outflow has a projected expansion velocity of 25km/s relative to the systemic velocity of ngc6764. about 4x 10^6 \msun ofmolecular gas is detected in the outflow. the approximate location (~1 kpc) ofthe dynamical inner lindblad resonance has been derived from the rotationcurve. the peak of the co emission is slightly (&lt; 200 pc) offset from the peakof the radio continuum.  the molecular gas has most likely been ejected by the stellar winds from therecent starburst, but the co line ratios show indication of an interaction withthe agn. the energy released by the nuclear starburst is sufficient to explainthe observed outflow, even if the data cannot exclude the agn from being themajor energy source. comparison of the outflow with hydrodynamical simulationssuggests that the nuclear starburst is 3--7 myr old and the bubble-like outflowis still confined and not freely expanding.

0909.1511	amiga project: quantification of the isolation of 950 cig galaxies	the role of the environment on galaxy evolution is still not fullyunderstood. in order to quantify and set limits on the role of nurture one mustidentify and study a sample of isolated galaxies. the amiga project "analysisof the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies" is doing a multi-wavelengthstudy of a large sample of isolated galaxies in order to examine theirinterstellar medium and star formation activity. we processed data for 950galaxies from the catalogue of isolated galaxies (cig, karachentseva 1973) andevaluated their isolation using an automated star-galaxy classificationprocedure (down to m_b ~17.5) on large digitised poss-i fields surrounding eachisolated galaxy (within a projected radius of at least 0.5 mpc). we defined,compared and discussed various criteria to quantify the degree of isolation forthese galaxies: e.g. karachentseva's revised criterion, local surface densitycomputations, estimation of the external tidal force affecting each isolatedgalaxy. we found galaxies violating karachentseva's original criterion, and wedefined various subsamples of galaxies according to their degree of isolation.additionally, we sought for the redshifts of the primary and companion galaxiesto access the radial dimension. we also applied our pipeline to triplets,compact groups and clusters and interpret the isolated galaxy population inlight of these control samples.

0909.2736	setting the normalcy level of hi properties in isolated galaxies	studying the atomic gas (hi) properties of the most isolated galaxies isessential to quantify the effect that the environment exerts on this sensitivecomponent of the interstellar medium. we observed and compiled hi data for awell defined sample of ~ 800 galaxies in the catalog of isolated galaxies, aspart of the amiga project (analysis of the ism in isolated galaxies,http://amiga.iaa.es), which enlarges considerably previous samples used toquantify the hi deficiency in galaxies located in denser environments. bystudying the shape of 182 hi profiles, we revisited the usually accepted resultthat, independently of the environment, more than half of the galaxies presenta perturbed hi disk. in isolated galaxies this would certainly be a strikingresult if these are supposed to be the most relaxed systems, and hasimplications in the relaxation time scales of hi disks and the nature of themost frequent perturbing mechanisms in galaxies. our sample likely exhibits thelowest hi asymmetry level in the local universe. we found that other fieldsamples present an excess of ~ 20% more asymmetric hi profiles than that incig. still a small percentage of galaxies in our sample present largeasymmetries. follow-up high resolution vla maps give insight into the origin ofsuch asymmetries.

0909.3793	amiga project: active galaxies in a complete sample of isolated galaxies	the project amiga (analysis of the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies)provides a statistically significant sample of the most isolated galaxies inthe northern sky. such a control sample is necessary to understand the role ofthe environment in evolution and galaxy properties like the interstellar medium(ism), star formation and nuclear activity. the data is publicly released undera vo interface at http://amiga.iaa.es/. one of our main goals is the study ofnuclear activity in non-interacting galaxies using different methods. we focuson the well known radiocontinuum-far infrared (fir) correlation in order tofindradio-excess galaxies which are candidates to host an active galacticnucleus (agn) and fir colours to find obscured agn candidates. we looked forthe existing information on nuclear activity in the v\'eron-cetty catalogue andin the nasa extragalactic database (ned). we also used the nuclear spectra fromthe sloan digital sky survey which allow us to determine the possible presenceof an agn and to study the properties of the underlying stellar populations. weproduced a final catalogue of agn-candidate galaxies which will provide abaseline for the study of the nuclear activity depending on the environment. wefind that the fraction of fir selected agn-candidates ranges between 7% and20%. there are no radio-excess galaxies in our sample above a factor 5 of radioexcess which is the lowest rate found in comparison with other samples indenser environments. finally, we obtained a fraction of about 22% of agn usingthe optical spectra, a significant fraction for a sample of isolated galaxies.we conclude that the environment plays a crucial and direct role in triggeringradio nuclear activity and not only via the density-morphology or thedensity-luminosity relations.

0707.4127	star formation in isolated amiga galaxies: dynamical influence of bars	star formation depends strongly both on the local environment of galaxies,and on the internal dynamics of the interstellar medium. to disentangle the twoeffects, we obtained, in the framework of the amiga project, ha and gunn rphotometric data for more than 200 spiral galaxies lying in very low-densityregions of the local universe. we characterise the ha emission, tracing currentstar formation, of the 45 largest and less inclined galaxies observed for whichwe estimate the torques between the gas and the bulk of the optical matter. wecould subsequently study the ha morphological aspect of these isolated spiralgalaxies. using fourier analysis, we focus on the modes of the spiral arms andalso on the strength of the bars, computing the torques between the gas andnewly formed stars (ha) and the bulk of the optical matter (gunn r). weinterpret the various bar/spiral morphologies observed in terms of the secularevolution experienced by galaxies in isolation. we also classify the differentspatial distributions of star forming regions in barred galaxies. the observedfrequency of particular patterns brings constraints on the lifetime of thevarious evolution phases. we propose an evolutive sequence accounting for thetransitions between the different phases we could observe. isolated galaxiesappear not to be preferentially barred or unbarred. through numericalsimulations, trying to fit the ha distributions yields constraints on the starformation law, which is likely to differ from a genuine schmidt law. inparticular, it is probable that the relative velocity of the gas in the baralso needs to be taken into account.

1010.3835	xmm-newton observations of the hot spot galaxy ngc 2903	we report on the first deeper x-ray broad-band observation of the hot spotgalaxy ngc 2903 obtained with xmm-newton. x-ray imaging and spectra of thespiral barred galaxy were obtained from xmm-newton archival data to study itsx-ray population and the conditions of the hot gas in its central region. weinvestigate the spectral properties of the discrete point-source population andgive estimates of their x-ray spectral parameters. by analysing the rgsspectra, we derive temperature and abundances for the hot gas located in itscentral region. a total of six x-ray point sources (four of them ulxcandidates) were detected in the energy range of 0.3-10.0 kev located withinthe galaxy d25 optical disk. three of these sources are detected for the firsttime, and one of them with a luminosity of higher than 10^39 erg/s. afterfitting three different models, we were able to estimate their luminosities,which are compatible with those of binaries with a compact object in the formof black holes (bhs) rather than neutron stars (nss). we extracted the combinedfirst-order rgs1 and rgs2 spectra of its central region, which display severalemission lines. both o\,{\sc vii} $f$ and $r$ lines seem to be of similarstrength, which is consistent with the presence of the collisionally ionizedgas that is typical of starburst galaxies. we fitted the spectrum to a modelfor a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium (cie) and the continuum wasmodelled with a power law, resulting in a plasma temperature of t = 0.31 \pm0.01 kev and an emission measure em \equiv n_hn_ev =6.4_{-0.4}^{+0.5}\times10^{61}$~cm$^{-3}. we also estimated abundances that are consistent with solarvalues.

1102.5104	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) xv. molecular gas kinematics  in the inner 3kpc of ngc6951	within the nuclei of galaxies project we have obtained iram pdbi and 30m12co(1-0) and 12co(2-1) observations of the spiral galaxy ngc 6951. previouswork shows that there is indirect evidence of gas inflow from 3 kpc down tosmall radii: a large-scale stellar bar, a prominent starburst ring (r~580 pc)and a liner/seyfert 2 nucleus. in this paper we study the gas kinematics astraced by the co line emission in detail. we quantify the influence of thelarge-scale stellar bar by constructing an analytical model of the evolution ofgas particles in a barred potential. from this model gravitational torques andmass accumulation rates are computed. we compare our model-based gravitationaltorque results with previous observationally-based ones. the model also showsthat the large-scale stellar bar is indeed the dominant force for driving thegas inward, to the starburst ring. inside the ring itself a nuclear stellaroval might play an important role. detailed analysis of the co gas kinematicsthere shows that emission arises from two co-spatial, but kinematicallydistinct components at several locations. the main emission component canalways be related to the overall bar-driven gas kinematics. the secondcomponent exhibits velocities that are larger than expected for gas on stableorbits, has a molecular gas mass of 1.8x10^6msun, is very likely connected tothe nuclear stellar oval, and is consistent with inflowing motion towards thevery center. this may form the last link in the chain of gas inflow towards theactive galactic nucleus in ngc 6951.

1107.0601	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies: viii. the rate of asymmetric hi  profiles in spiral galaxies	(abridged) measures of the hi properties of a galaxy are among the mostsensitive interaction diagnostic at our disposal. we report here on a study ofhi profile asymmetries (e.g., lopsidedness) in a sample of some of the mostisolated galaxies in the local universe. this presents us with an excellentopportunity to quantify the range of intrinsic hi asymmetries and provides uswith a zero-point calibration for evaluating these measurements in lessisolated samples. we characterize the hi profile asymmetries and search forcorrelations between hi asymmetry and their environments, as well as theiroptical and far infrared (fir) properties. we use high signal-to-noise globalhi profiles for galaxies in the amiga project (http://amiga.iaa.csic.es). werestrict our study to n=166 galaxies with accurate measures of the hi shapeproperties. we quantify asymmetries using a flux ratio parameter. the asymmetryparameter distribution of our isolated sample is well described by a gaussianmodel. the width of the distribution is sigma=0.13, and could be even smaller(sigma=0.11) if instrumental errors are reduced. only 2% of our carefullyvetted isolated galaxies sample show an asymmetry in excess of 3sigma. by usingthis sample we minimize environmental effects as confirmed by the lack ofcorrelation between hi asymmetry and tidal force (one-on-one interactions) andneighbor galaxy number density. on the other hand, field galaxy samples showwider distributions and deviate from a gaussian curve. as a result we findhigher asymmetry rates (~10-20%) in such samples. we find evidence that thespiral arm strength is inversely correlated with the hi asymmetry. we also findan excess of fir luminous galaxies with larger hi asymmetries that may bespirals associated with hidden accretion events. our sample presents thesmallest fraction of asymmetric hi profiles compared with any other yetstudied.

0710.1096	multifrequency observations of the blazar 3c 279 in january 2006	we report first results of a multifrequency campaign from radio to hard x-rayenergies of the prominent gamma-ray blazar 3c 279, which was organised aroundan integral too observation in january 2006, and triggered on its opticalstate. the variable blazar was observed at an intermediate optical state, and awell-covered multifrequency spectrum from radio to hard x-ray energies could bederived. the sed shows the typical two-hump shape, the signature of non-thermalsynchrotron and inverse-compton (ic) emission from a relativistic jet. by thesignificant exposure times of integral and chandra, the ic spectrum (0.3 - 100kev) was most accurately measured, showing - for the first time - a possiblebending. a comparison of this 2006 sed to the one observed in 2003, alsocentered on an integral observation, during an optical low-state, reveals thesurprising fact that - despite a significant change at the high-energysynchrotron emission (near-ir/optical/uv) - the rest of the sed remainsunchanged. in particular, the low-energy ic emission (x- and hard x-rayenergies) remains the same as in 2003, proving that the two emission componentsdo not vary simultaneously, and provides strong constraints on the modelling ofthe overall emission of 3c 279.

1108.2130	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies ix. molecular gas properties	aims: we characterize the molecular gas content using co emission of aredshift-limited subsample of isolated galaxies from the amiga (analysis of theinterstellar medium of isolated galaxies) project. methods: we present the12co(1-0) data for 273 amiga galaxies. we constructed a redshift-limited samplecontaining galaxies with 1500\kms &lt;v&lt;5000\kms and excluded objects withmorphological evidence of possible interaction. this sample ($n=173$) is thebasis for our statistical analysis. it is dominated, both in absolute numberand in detection rate, by galaxies of type t=3-5 (sb-sc). most galaxies wereobserved with a single pointing towards their centers. therefore, we performedan extrapolation to the total molecular gas mass expected in the entire diskbased on the assumption of an exponential distribution. we then studied therelationships between \mhtwo\ and other galactic properties (\lb,\dopttwo,\lk,\lfir, and \mhi). results: we find correlations between \mhtwo\ and \lb,\dopttwo, \lk, and \lfir. the tightest correlation of \mhtwo\ holds with \lfir\and, for $t=3-5$, with \lk, and the poorest with \dopttwo. the correlationswith \lfir and \lk are very close to linearity. the correlation with \lb isnonlinear so that \mhtwo/\lb\ increases with \lb. the molecular and the atomicgas masses of our sample show no strong correlation. we find a low mean value,log(\mhtwo/\mhi)=-0.7 (for $t=3-5$), and a strong decrease in this ratio withmorphological type. the molecular gas column density and the surface density ofthe star formation rate (the kennicutt-schmidt law) show a tight correlationwith a rough unity slope. we compare the relations of \mhtwo\ with \lb and \lkfound for amiga galaxies to samples of interacting galaxies from the literatureand find an indication for an enhancement of the molecular gas in interactinggalaxies of up to 0.2-0.3 dex.

1202.0458	on the molecular gas content and sfr in hickson compact groups: enhanced  or deficient?	we study the effect of the extreme environment in hickson compact groups(hcgs) on the molecular gas mass, \mhtwo, and the star formation rate (sfr) ofgalaxies as a function of atomic hydrogen (hi) content and evolutionary phaseof the group. we have selected a redshift limited (d$&lt;$100 mpc) sample of 88galaxies in 20 hcgs with available atomic hydrogen (hi) vla maps, covering awide range of hi deficiencies and evolutionary phases of the groups, andcontaining at least one spiral galaxy. we derived the far-infrared (fir)luminosity (\lfir) from iras data and used it as a tracer of the sfr. wecalculated the hi mass, \lfir and \mhtwo deficiencies. the mean deficiencies of\lfir and \mhtwo of spiral galaxies in hcgs are close to 0, indicating thattheir average sfr and molecular gas content are similar to those of isolatedgalaxies. however, there are indications of an excess in \mhtwo\($\sim$ 50%) inspiral galaxies in hcgs which can be interpreted as either an enhancedmolecular gas content or as a higher concentration of \mhtwo towards the centerin comparison to galaxies in lower density environments. in contrast, the mean\mhi of spiral galaxies in hcgs is only 12% of the expected value. the specificstar formation rate (ssfr= sfr/stellar mass) tends to be lower for galaxieswith a higher \mhtwo\ or \mhi\ deficiency. this trend is not seen for the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/\mhtwo). we found tentative indications for anenhancement of \mhtwo\ in spiral galaxies in hcgs in an early evolutionaryphase and a decrease in later phases. we suggest that this might be due to anenhancement of the conversion from atomic to molecular gas due to on-goingtidal interactions in an early evolutionary phase, followed by hi stripping anda decrease of the molecular gas content because of lack of replenishment.

1202.6490	molecular gas in infrared ultraluminous qso hosts	we report co detections in 17 out of 19 infrared ultraluminous qso (ir qso)hosts observed with the iram 30m telescope. the cold molecular gas reservoir inthese objects is in a range of 0.2--2.1$\times 10^{10}m_\odot$ (adopting aco-to-${\rm h_2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm co}=0.8 m_\odot {\rm (k kms^{-1} pc^2)^{-1}}$). we find that the molecular gas properties of ir qsos,such as the molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency ($l_{\rmfir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$) and the co (1-0) line widths, are indistinguishablefrom those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). a comparison oflow- and high-redshift co detected qsos reveals a tight correlation betweenl$_{\rm fir}$ and $l^\prime_{\rm co(1-0)}$ for all qsos. this suggests that,similar to ulirgs, the far-infrared emissions of all qsos are mainly from dustheated by star formation rather than by active galactic nuclei (agns),confirming similar findings from mid-infrared spectroscopic observations by{\it spitzer}. a correlation between the agn-associated bolometric luminositiesand the co line luminosities suggests that star formation and agns draw fromthe same reservoir of gas and there is a link between star formation on $\sim$kpc scale and the central black hole accretion process on much smaller scales.

0705.0479	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies. iv. a catalogue of neighbours  around isolated galaxies	studies of the effects of environment on galaxy properties and evolutionrequire well defined control samples. such isolated galaxy samples have up tonow been small or poorly defined. the amiga project (analysis of theinterstellar medium of isolated galaxies) represents an attempt to define astatistically useful sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local (z &lt;0.05) universe. a suitable large sample for the amiga project already exists,the catalogue of isolated galaxies (cig, karachentseva 1973; 1050 galaxies),and we use this sample as a starting point to refine and perform a betterquantification of its isolation properties. digitised poss-i e images wereanalysed out to a minimum projected radius r &gt; 0.5 mpc around 950 cig galaxies(those within vr = 1500 km s-1 were excluded). we identified all galaxycandidates in each field brighter than b = 17.5 with a high degree ofconfidence using the lmorpho software. we generated a catalogue ofapproximately 54 000 potential neighbours (redshifts exist for 30% of thissample). six hundred sixty-six galaxies pass and two hundred eighty-four failthe original cig isolation criterion. the available redshift data confirm thatour catalogue involves a largely background population rather than physicallyassociated neighbours. we find that the exclusion of neighbours within a factorof four in size around each cig galaxy, employed in the original isolationcriterion, corresponds to delta vr ~ 18000 km s-1 indicating that it was aconservative limit. galaxies in the cig have been found to show differentdegrees of isolation. we conclude that a quantitative measure of this ismandatory. it will be the subject of future work based on the catalogue ofneighbours obtained here.

1402.5526	effects of the environment on galaxies in the catalogue of isolated  galaxies: physical satellites and large scale structure	we aim to identify and quantify the effects of the satellite distributionaround a sample of galaxies in the catalogue of isolated galaxies (cig), aswell as the effects of the large scale structure (lss) using the sdss-dr9. torecover the physically bound galaxies we focus on the satellites which arewithin the escape speed of each cig galaxy. we also propose a more conservativemethod using the stacked gaussian distribution of the velocity difference ofthe neighbours. the tidal strengths affecting the primary galaxy are estimatedto quantify the effects of the local and lss environments. we also define theprojected number density parameter at the 5$^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour tocharacterise the lss around the cig galaxies. out of the 386 cig galaxiesconsidered in this study, at least 340 (88\% of the sample) have no physicallylinked satellite. out of the 386 cig galaxies, 327 (85\% of the sample) have nophysical companion within a projected distance of 0.3 mpc. the cig galaxies aredistributed following the lss of the local universe, although presenting alarge heterogeneity in their degree of connection with it. a clear segregationappears between early-type cig galaxies with companions and isolated late-typecig galaxies. isolated galaxies are in general bluer, with likely youngerstellar populations and rather high star formation with respect to older,redder cig galaxies with companions. reciprocally, the satellites are redderand with an older stellar populations around massive early-type cig galaxies,while they have a younger stellar content around massive late-type ciggalaxies. this suggests that the cig is composed of a heterogeneous populationof galaxies, sampling from old to more recent, dynamical systems of galaxies.

0803.0335	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies. vii. far-infrared and radio  continuum study of nuclear activity	we present a study of the nuclear activity in a well-defined sample of themost isolated galaxies in the local universe traced by their far-infrared (fir)and radio continuum emission. we use the well-known radio continuum-fircorrelation to select radio-excess galaxies that are candidates to host anactive galactic nucleus (agn), as well as the fir colours to find obscured agncandidates. the existing information on nuclear activity in the v\'eron-cettycatalogue and in the nasa extragalactic database are also used. a finalcatalogue of agn-candidate galaxies has been produced. it contains 89 agncandidates and is publicly available on the amiga web page(http://www.iaa.csic.es/amiga.html). at most ~ 1.5 % of the galaxies shows aradio-excess with respect to the radio-fir correlation, and this fraction evengoes down to less than 0.8 % after rejection of back/foreground sources. wefind that the fraction of fir colour selected agn-candidates is ~ 28 % with alower limit of ~ 7 %. a comparison with the results from the literature showsthat the amiga sample has the lowest ratio of agn candidates, both globally andseparated into early and late types. field galaxies as well as poor cluster andgroup environments show intermediate values, while the highest rates of agncandidates are found in the central parts of clusters and in pair/mergerdominated samples. we conclude that the environment plays a crucial and directrole in triggering radio nuclear activity and not only via thedensity-morphology relation. isolated, early-type galaxies show a particularlylow level of activity at radio wavelengths hence constituting the mostnurture-free population of luminous early-type galaxies.

0804.0132	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies. vi. radio continuum properties of  isolated galaxies: a very radio quiet sample	the study of the radio properties of the amiga sample is intended tocharacterize the radio continuum emission for a sample least affected by localenvironment, thus providing a reference against which less isolated andinteracting samples can be compared. radio continuum data at 325, 1420 and 4850mhz were extracted from the wenss, nvss/first and gb6 surveys, respectively. wefocus on the complete amiga subsample composed of 719 galaxies. comparisonbetween the nvss and first detections indicates that the radio continuum iscoming from disk-dominated emission in spiral galaxies, in contrast to theresults found in high-density environments where nuclear activity is morefrequent. the comparison of the radio continuum power with a comparable sample,which is however not selected with respect to its environment, the condon etal. ugc-sf sample of star-forming field galaxies, shows a lower mean value forthe amiga sample. we have obtained radio-to-optical flux ratios (r) using thenvss radio continuum flux. the distribution of r for the amiga galaxies isconsistent with a sample dominated by radio emission from star formation (sf)and a small number of active galactic nuclei (agn), with less than 3% of thesample with r &gt; 100. we derived the radio luminosity function (rlf) and totalpower density of the radio continuum emission for the amiga sample at 1.4 ghz,and compared them with results from other low redshift studies. the schechterfit of the rlf indicates a major weight of the low-luminosity galaxies. theresults indicate the very low level of radio continuum emission in our sampleof isolated galaxies, which is dominated by mild disk sf. it confirms hence theamiga sample as a suitable template to effectively quantify the role ofinteractions in samples extracted from denser environments.

1503.02649	first results from high angular resolution alma observations toward the  hl tau region	we present atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) observationsfrom the 2014 long baseline campaign in dust continuum and spectral lineemission from the hl tau region. the continuum images at wavelengths of 2.9,1.3, and 0.87 mm have unprecedented angular resolutions of 0.075 arcseconds (10au) to 0.025 arcseconds (3.5 au), revealing an astonishing level of detail inthe circumstellar disk surrounding the young solar analogue hl tau, with apattern of bright and dark rings observed at all wavelengths. by fittingellipses to the most distinct rings, we measure precise values for the diskinclination (46.72pm0.05 degrees) and position angle (+138.02pm0.07 degrees).we obtain a high-fidelity image of the 1.0 mm spectral index ($\alpha$), whichranges from $\alpha\sim2.0$ in the optically-thick central peak and twobrightest rings, increasing to 2.3-3.0 in the dark rings. the dark rings arenot devoid of emission, we estimate a grain emissivity index of 0.8 for theinnermost dark ring and lower for subsequent dark rings, consistent with somedegree of grain growth and evolution. additional clues that the rings arisefrom planet formation include an increase in their central offsets with radiusand the presence of numerous orbital resonances. at a resolution of 35 au, weresolve the molecular component of the disk in hco+ (1-0) which exhibits apattern over lsr velocities from 2-12 km/s consistent with keplerian motionaround a ~1.3 solar mass star, although complicated by absorption at lowblue-shifted velocities. we also serendipitously detect and resolve the nearbyprotostars xz tau (a/b) and lkha358 at 2.9 mm.

1504.00117	catalogues of isolated galaxies, isolated pairs, and isolated triplets  in the local universe	the construction of catalogues of galaxies and the a posteriori study ofgalaxy properties in relation to their environment have been hampered by scarceredshift information. the new 3-dimensional (3d) surveys permit small, faint,physically bound satellites to be distinguished from a background-projectedgalaxy population. we aim to provide representative samples of isolatedgalaxies, isolated pairs, and isolated triplets for testing galaxy evolutionand secular processes in low density regions of the local universe, as well asto characterise their local and large-scale environments. we used spectroscopicdata from the tenth data release of the sdss-dr10 to automatically andhomogeneously compile catalogues of 3702 isolated galaxies, 1240 isolatedpairs, and 315 isolated triplets in the local universe. to quantify the effectsof their local and large-scale environments, we computed the projected densityand the tidal strength for the brightest galaxy in each sample. we findevidence of isolated pairs and isolated triplets that are physically bound atprojected separations up to $d \leq 450$ kpc with radial velocity difference$\delta v \leq 160$ km s$^{-1}$, where the effect of the companion typicallyaccounts for more than 98% of the total tidal strength affecting the centralgalaxy. for galaxies in the catalogues, we provide their positions, redshifts,and degrees of relation with their physical and large-scale environments. thecatalogues are publicly available to the scientific community. for isolatedgalaxies, isolated pairs, and isolated triplets, there is no difference intheir degree of interaction with the large-scale structure, which may suggestthat they have a common origin in their formation and evolution. we find thatmost of them belong to the outer parts of filaments, walls, and clusters, andgenerally differ from the void population of galaxies.

astro-ph;0006100	tidal tails around 20 galactic globular cluster: observational evidence  for gravitational disk/bulge shocking	large-field multi-color images of 20 galactic globular clusters are used toinvestigate the presence of tidal tails around these stellar systems. field andcluster stars are sorted with the help of color-magnitude diagrams, andstar-count analysis is performed on the selected cluster stars in order toincrease the signal-to-noise ratio of their surface density. we study theoverdensities of these stars using the wavelet transform of the star counts inorder to filter the background density noise and to detect the weak structures,at large scale, formed by the numerous stars previously members of theclusters. we associate these stellar overdensities with the stars evaporatedfrom the clusters because of dynamical relaxation and/or tidal stripping fromthe clusters by the galactic gravitational field. most of the globular clustersin our sample display strong evidence of tidal interactions with the galacticplane in the form of large and extended deformations. these tidal tails exhibitprojected directions preferentially towards the galactic center. all theclusters observed, which do not suffer from strong observational biases,present such tidal tails, tracing their dynamical evolution (evaporation, tidalshocking, tidal torquing, and bulge shocking) in the galaxy. the clustersexhibit different regimes of mass loss rate, detected using the radial densityslope in the outer parts of the clusters. for ngc 5139 ($\omega$ centauri), weestimate, taking into account the possible presence of mass segregation in itsouter parts, that about 0.6 to 1% of its mass has been lost during the crossing(abridged)

astro-ph;0011520	molecular gas in the powerful radio galaxies 3c~31 and 3c~264: major or  minor mergers?	we report the detection of $^{12}$co~($1 \to 0$) and $^{12}$co~($2 \to 1$)emission from the central regions ($\lesssim 5$--$10 {\rm kpc}$) of the twopowerful radio galaxies 3c~31 and 3c~264. their individual co emission exhibitsa double-horned line profile that is characteristic of an inclined rotatingdisk with a central depression at the rising part of its rotation curve. theinferred disk or ring distributions of the molecular gas is consistent with theobserved presence of dust disks or rings detected optically in the cores ofboth galaxies. for a co to h$_2$ conversion factor similar to that of ourgalaxy, the corresponding total mass in molecular hydrogen gas is $(1.3 \pm0.2) \times 10^9 {\rm m_{\odot}}$ in 3c~31 and $(0.31 \pm 0.06) \times 10^9{\rm m_{\odot}}$ in 3c~264. despite their relatively large molecular-gas massesand other peculiarities, both 3c~31 and 3c~264, as well as many other powerfulradio galaxies in the (revised) 3c catalog, are known to lie within thefundamental plane of normal elliptical galaxies. we reason that if their gasoriginates from the mergers of two gas-rich disk galaxies, as has been invokedto explain the molecular gas in other radio galaxies, then both 3c~31 and3c~264 must have merged a long time (a few billion years or more) ago but theirremnant elliptical galaxies only recently (last tens of millions of years orless) become active in radio. instead, we argue that the cannibalism ofgas-rich galaxies provides a simpler explanation for the origin of moleculargas in the elliptical hosts of radio galaxies. given the transient nature oftheir observed disturbances, these galaxies probably become active in radiosoon after the accretion event when sufficient molecular gas agglomerates intheir nuclei.

astro-ph;0501341	a study of the type ii-p supernova 2003gd in m74	we present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type ii-p supernova2003gd, which was discovered in m74 close to the end of its plateau phase. sn2003gd is the first type ii supernova to have a directly confirmed redsupergiant progenitor. we compare sn 2003gd with sn 1999em, a similar type ii-psupernova, and estimate an explosion date of 18th march 2003. we determine areddening towards the supernova of e(b-v) = 0.14+/-0.06, using three differentmethods. we also calculate three new distances to m74 of 9.6+/-2.8 mpc,7.7+/-1.7 mpc and 9.6+/-2.2 mpc. the former was estimated using thestandardised candle method (scm), for type ii supernovae, and the latter twousing the brightest supergiants method (bsm). when combined with existingkinematic and bsm distance estimates, we derive a mean value of 9.3+/-1.8 mpc.sn 2003gd was found to have a lower tail luminosity compared to other``normal'' type ii-p sne bringing into question the nature of this supernova.we present a discussion concluding that this is a ``normal'' type ii-psupernova which is consistent with the observed progenitor mass of 8(+4/-2) mo.

astro-ph;0504201	the amiga project. i. optical characterization of the cig catalog	the amiga project (analysis of the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies)is compiling a multiwavelength database of isolated galaxies that includesoptical (b and halpha), infrared (fir and nir) and radio (continuum plus hi andco lines) properties. it involves a refinement of the pioneering catalog ofisolated galaxies. this paper is the first in a series and begins with analysisof the global properties of the nearly redshift-complete cig with emphasis onthe optical luminosity function (olf) which we compare with other recentestimates of the olf for a variety of environments. the cig redshiftdistribution for n= 956 galaxies re-enforces the evidence for a bimodalstructure seen earlier in smaller samples. the peaks at redshift near 1500 and6000km/s correspond respectively to galaxies in the local supercluster andthose in more distant large-scale components (particularly perseus-pisces). thetwo peaks in the redshift distribution are superimposed on 50% or more of thesample that is distributed in a much more homogeneous way. the cig probablyrepresents the most homogeneous local field example that has ever beencompiled. our derivation of the cig olf is consistent with other studies of theolf for lower density environments. this comparison via the schechter parameterformalization shows that: 1) m* increases with galaxy surface density on thesky and 2) alpha shows a weaker tendency to do the same. the cig represents thelargest and most complete foundation for studies of isolated galaxies and islikely as close as we can come to a field sample.

astro-ph;0507403	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) iii. the warped liner ngc3718	we present the first interferometric observations of co(1-0) and co(2-1) lineemission from the warped liner ngc3718, obtained with the iram pdbi. this l1.9galaxy has a prominent dust lane and on kpc scales, a strongly warped atomicand molecular gas disk. the molecular gas is closely associated with the dustlane across the nucleus and its kinematic center is consistent with the mmcontinuum agn. a comparison of our interferometric mosaic data, which fullycover the ~9kpc warped disk, with a previously obtained iram 30m single dishco(1-0) map shows that the molecular gas distribution in the disk is heavilyresolved by the pdbi map. after applying a short-spacing correction with theiram 30m data, we find in total six main source components within the dustlane: one associated with the nucleus, four symmetrically positioned on eitherside at galactocentric distances of about 1.3kpc and 4.0kpc from the center,and a sixth on the western side at ~3kpc with only a very weak easterncounterpart. in the framework of a kinematic model using tilted rings, weinterpret the five symmetric source components as locations of strong orbitalcrowding. we further find indications that the warp appears not only on kpcscales, but continues down to 250pc. besides the sixth feature on the westernside, the lower flux of the eastern components compared to the western onesindicates an intrinsic large scale asymmetry in ngc3718 that cannot beexplained by the warp. indications for a small scale asymmetry are also seen inthe central 600pc. these asymmetries might be evidence for a tidal interactionwith a companion galaxy (large scales) and gas accretion onto the nucleus(small scales). our study of ngc3718 is part of the nuga project that aims atinvestigating the different processes of gas accretion onto agn.

astro-ph;0509825	continuum emission in ngc1068 and ngc3147: indications for a turnover in  the core spectra	we present new interferometric observations of the continuum emission at mmwavelengths in the seyfert galaxies ngc1068 and ngc3147. three mm continuumpeaks are detected in ngc1068, one centered on the core, one associated withthe jet and the third one with the counter-jet. this is the first significantdetection of the radio jet and counter-jet at mm wavelengths in ngc1068. whilethe fluxes of the jet components agree with a steep spectral index extrapolatedfrom cm-wavelengths, the core fluxes indicate a turnover of the inverted cm-into a steep mm-spectrum at roughly 50ghz which is most likely caused byelectron-scattered synchrotron emission. as in ngc 1068, the spectrum of thepointlike continuum source in ngc3147 also shows a turnover between cm andmm-wavelengths at 25ghz resulting from synchrotron self-absorption different tongc1068. this strongly resembles the spectrum of sgra*, the weakly activenucleus of our own galaxy, and m81*, a link between sgra* and seyfert galaxiesin terms of activity sequence, which may display a similar turnover.

astro-ph;0511652	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies - ii. morphological refinement	we present a complete poss ii-based refinement of the optical morphologiesfor galaxies in the karatchenseva's catalog of isolated galaxies that forms thebasis of the amiga project. comparison with independent classifications madefor an sdss overlap sample of more than 200 galaxies confirms the reliabilityof the early vs. late-type discrimination and the accuracy of spiral subtypeswithin deltat = 1-2. ccd images taken at the osn were also used to solveambiguities. 193 galaxies are flagged for the presence of nearby companions orsigns of distortion likely due to interaction. this most isolated sample ofgalaxies in the local universe is dominated by 2 populations: 1) 82% spirals(sa-sd) with the bulk being luminous systems with small bulges (63% betweentypes sb-sc) and 2) a significant population of early-type e-s0 galaxies (14%).most of the types later than sd are low luminosity galaxies concentrated in thelocal supercluster where isolation is difficult to evaluate. the late-typespiral majority of the sample spans a luminosity range m_b-corr = -18 to -22mag. few of the e/s0 population are more luminous than -21.0 marking an absenceof, an often sought, super l* merger (eg fossil elliptical) population. therarity of high luminosity systems results in a fainter derived m* for thispopulation compared to the spiral optical luminosity function (olf). the e-s0population is from 0.2 to 0.6 mag fainter depending how the sample is defined.this marks the amiga sample as almost unique among samples that compare earlyand late-type olfs separately. in other samples, which always involve galaxiesin higher density environments, m*(e/s0) is almost always 0.3-0.5 mag brighterthan m*(s), presumably reflecting a stronger correlation between m* andenvironmental density for early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0610784	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies iii. iras data and infrared  diagnostics	we describe the mid- (mir) and far- (fir) infrared properties of a large($\sim$1000) sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local universe. thissample is intended as a ``nurture-free'' zero point against which moreenvironmentally influenced samples can be compared. we reprocess iras mir/firsurvey data using the addscan/scanpi utility for 1030 out of 1050 galaxies fromthe catalogue of isolated galaxies (cig) as part of the amiga project. we focuson diagnostics (fir luminosity $l_{fir}$, $r=\log(l_{fir}/l_{b})$ and irascolours) thought to be sensitive to effects of environment or interaction. thedistribution of $\log(l_{fir})$ is sharply peaked from 9.0--10.5 with very few($&lt;$2%) galaxies above 10.5. the optically normalised luminosity diagnostic $r=\log(l_{fir}/l_{b})$ shows a distribution sharply peaked between 0.0 and$-$1.0. these results were compared to the magnitude limited cfa sample thatwas selected without environmental discrimination. this modestly (e.g. comparedto cluster, binary galaxy and compact group samples) environmentally affectedsample shows significantly higher mean $\log(l_{fir})$ and $r$, whereas themean $\log(l_{b})$ is the same. our sample shows a strong $l_{fir}$ vs. $l_{b}$correlation, with a slope steeper than one ($l_{fir} \propto l_{b}^{1.41}$).interacting galaxies were found above this correlation, showing an enhancementin $l_{fir}$. with respect to the iras colours, we found higher$f_{60}/f_{100}$ value for ellipticals and late-type galaxies than for spirals,indicating a higher dust temperature. the results indicate that the firemission is a variable enhanced by interaction, and that our sample probablyshows the lowest possible mean value. this attests to the utility of our samplefor defining a nurture-free zero point.

astro-ph;0701378	globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in fornax - i. kinematics in the  cluster core from multi-object spectroscopy	we acquired radial velocities of a significant number of globular clusters(gcs) on wide fields between galaxies in the nearby fornax cluster of galaxies,in order to derive their velocity dispersion radial profile and to probe thedynamics of the cluster. we used flames on the vlt to obtain accuratevelocities for 149 gcs, within a ~500x150 kpc strip centered on ngc 1399, thefornax central galaxy. these objects are at the very bright tail (m_v &lt; -9.5)of the gc luminosity function, overlapping the so-called ``ultra-compactdwarfs'' magnitude range. eight of the brightest flames-confirmed membersindeed show hints of resolution in the subarcsecond pre-imaging data we usedfor selecting the ~500 targets for flames spectroscopy. ignoring the gcs aroundgalaxies by applying 3d_25 diameter masks, we find 61 gcs of 20.0 &lt; v &lt; 22.2lying in the intra-cluster (ic) medium. the velocity dispersion of thepopulation of icgcs is 200 km/s at ~150 kpc from the central ngc 1399 and risesto nearly 400 km/s at 200 kpc, a value which compares with the velocitydispersion of the population of dwarf galaxies, thought to be infalling fromthe surroundings of the cluster.

astro-ph;0701403	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): vi. detection of a molecular  gas disk/torus via hcn in the seyfert2 galaxy ngc6951?	several studies of nearby active galaxies indicate significantly higherhcn-to-co intensity ratios in agn than in starburst (sb) environments. hcnenhancement can be caused by many different effects, such as higher gasdensities/temperatures, uv/x-ray radiation, and non-collisional excitation. asactive galaxies often exhibit intense circumnuclear sb, high angularresolution/sensitivity observations are of paramount importance todisentangling the influence of sb from that of nuclear activity on thechemistry of the surrounding molecular gas. the tight relation of hcnenhancement and nuclear activity may qualify hcn as an ideal tracer ofmolecular gas close to the agn, providing complementary and additionalinformation to that gained via co. ngc6951 houses nuclear and sb activity,making it an ideal testbed in which to study the effects of differentexcitation conditions on the molecular gas. we used the new abcd configurationsof the iram pdbi to observe hcn(1-0) in ngc6951 at high angular resolution(1''). we detect very compact (&lt;50pc) hcn emission in its nucleus, supportingprevious hints of nuclear gas structure. our observations also reveal hcnemission in the sb ring and resolve it into several peaks, leading to a highercoincidence between the hcn and co distributions than previously reported. wefind a significantly higher hcn-to-co intensity ratio (&gt;0.4) in the nucleusthan in the sb ring (0.02-0.05). as for ngc1068, this might result from ahigher hcn abundance in the centre due to an x-ray dominated gas chemistry, buta higher gas density/temperature or additional non-collisional excitation ofhcn cannot be entirely ruled out, based on these observations. the compact hcnemission is associated with rotating gas in a circumnuclear disk/torus.

astro-ph;9709121	molecular gas in galaxies of hickson compact groups	we have observed 70 galaxies belonging to 45 hickson compact groups in theco(1-0) and co(2-1) lines, in order to determine their molecular content. wedetected 57 galaxies, corresponding to a detection rate of 81%. we compare thegas content relative to blue and fir luminosities of galaxies in compact groupswith respect to other samples in the literature, including various environmentsand morphological types. we find that there is some hint of enhanced m(h2)/lband m(dust)/lb ratios in the galaxies from compact group with respect to ourcontrol sample, especially for the most compact groups, suggesting that tidalinteractions can drive the gas component inwards, by removing its angularmomentum, and concentrating it in the dense central regions, where it is easilydetected. the molecular gas content in compact group galaxies is similar tothat in pairs and starburst samples. however, the total l(fir) luminosity ofhcgs is quite similar to that of the control sample, and therefore the starformation efficiency appears lower than in the control galaxies. however thisassumes that the fir spatial distributions are similar in both samples which isnot the case at radio frequencies. higher spatial resolution fir data areneeded to make a valid comparison. given their short dynamical frictiontime-scale, it is possible that some of these systems are in the final stagebefore merging, leading to ultra-luminous starburst phases. we also find forall galaxy samples that the \htwo content (derived from co luminosity andnormalised to blue luminosity) is strongly correlated to the l(fir)luminosity,while the total gas content h2+hi is not.

astro-ph;9812112	interacting star clusters in the lmc - overmerging problem solved by  cluster group formation	we present the tidal tail distributions of a sample of candidate binaryclusters located in the bar of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). one isolatedcluster, sl 268, is presented in order to study the effect of the lmc tidalfield. all the candidate binary clusters show tidal tails, confirming that thepairs are formed by physically linked objects. the stellar mass in the tailscovers a large range, from $1.8\times 10^3$ to $3\times 10^4$\msun. we derive atotal mass estimate for sl 268 and sl 356. at large radii, the projecteddensity profiles of sl 268 and sl 356 fall off as $r^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma=2.27$ and $\gamma=3.44$, respectively. out of 4 pairs or multiple systems, 2are older than the theoretical survival time of binary clusters (going from afew $10^6$ yr to $10^8$ yr). a pair shows too large age difference between thecomponents to be consistent with classical theoretical models of binary clusterformation (fujimoto &amp; kumai 1997). we refer to this as the ``overmerging''problem.a different scenario is proposed: the formation proceeds in largemolecular complexes giving birth to groups of clusters over a few $10^7$ yr. inthese groups the expected cluster encounter rate is larger, and tidal capturehas higher probability. cluster pairs are not born together through thesplitting of the parent cloud, but formed later by tidal capture. for 3 pairs,we tentatively identify the star cluster group (scg) memberships. the scgformation, through the recent cluster starburst triggered by the lmc-smcencounter, in contrast with the quiescent open cluster formation in the milkyway can be an explanation to the paucity of binary clusters observed in ourgalaxy.

astro-ph;9910148	n-body simulations of globular cluster tides	we present n-body simulations of globular clusters, in orbits around thegalaxy, in order to study quantitatively and geometrically the tidal effectsthey encounter. the clusters are modelised with multi-mass king-michie models(michie 1963), including mass segregation at initial conditions. the galaxy ismodelled as realistic as possible, with three components: bulge, disk and darkhalo. the main finding is that there exist two giant tidal tails around theglobuler cluster in permanence along its orbit, whatever this orbit. the lengthof these tails is of the order of 5 tidal radii, or greater. the escaped starsare distributed radially as a power law in density, with a slope of -4. thetails present substructures, or clumps, that are the relics of the strongestshocks. due to the compressive disk-shocking, the clusters display a prolateshape which major axis is precessing around the z axis. the tails arepreferentially formed by the lowest mass stars, as expected, so that the tidaltruncation increases mass segregation. internal rotation of the clusterincreases the mass loss. the flattening of dark matter cannot influencesignificantly the dynamics of the clusters. the orientation and the strength ofthe tidal tails are signatures of the last disk crossing, so that observedtidal tails can constrain strongly the cluster orbit and the galactic model(vertical scale of the disc).

0810.4333	simultaneous polarization monitoring of supernovae sn2008d/xt080109 and  sn2007uy: isolating geometry from dust	the possible existence of a continuum encompassing the diversity of explosivestellar deaths,ranging from ordinary sne to relativistic hypernovae associatedwith long duration grbs, is under intense debate. in this context, sn2008dassociated with xt080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it mightexemplify a potential borderline event. the main aim is to infer geometricinformation of sn2008d through the evolution of its linear opticalpolarization. we also report the polarization evolution of sn2007uy, anddiscuss the properties of the host ism towards the xt. the final goal is tocompare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both sne,which shone contemporaneously in ngc2770. this fortunate coincidence brought usthe opportunity to observe both sne simultaneously, and most importantly, withidentical instrumental setups. the observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6days after the xt and are distributed in 11 visits. in addition we performedobservations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. wereport positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for sn2008d ata level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for sn2007uy. sn2007uy shows constant polarization,which could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constanteccentricity expansion on the sky plane. a statistical analysis of thedistribution of the sn2008d stokes parametres suggests that it could show anintrinsic variable polarization component. assuming the sn2007uy polarizationis constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic sn2008d polarizationcould be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variableeccentricity. we come to the same result even if we make no assumption onsn2007uy, although at a lower significance level. we suggest that at least theprojected, if not the intrinsic, geometries of both sne could differ.
