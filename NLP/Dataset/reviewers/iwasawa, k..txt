0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0907.1527	probing variability patterns of the fe k line complex in bright nearby  agns	the unprecedented sensitivity of current x-ray telescopes allows for thefirst time to address the issue of the fe k line complex variability patternsin bright, nearby agns. we examine xmm-newton observations of the brightestsources of the fero sample of radio-quiet type 1 agns with the aim ofcharacterizing the temporal behaviour of fe k complex features. a systematicmapping of residual flux above and below the continuum in the 4-9 kev range isperformed in the time vs energy domain, with the purpose of identifyinginteresting spectral features in the three energy bands: 5.4-6.1 kev, 6.1-6.8kev and 6.8-7.2 kev, corresponding respectively to the redshifted, rest frameand blueshifted or highly ionized fe kalpha line bands. the variabilitysignificance is assessed by extracting light curves and comparing them withmontecarlo simulations. the time-averaged profile of the fe k complex revealedspectral complexity in several observations. red- and blue-shifted components(either in emission or absorption) were observed in 30 out of 72 observations,with an average &lt;ew&gt;~90 ev for emission and &lt;ew&gt;~ -30 ev for absorptionfeatures. we detected significant line variability (with confidence levelsranging between 90% and 99.7%) within at least one of the above energy bands in26 out of 72 observations on time scales of ~6-30 ks. reliability of thesefeatures has been carefully calculated using this sample and has been assessedat ~3sigma confidence level. this work increases the currently scanty number ofdetections of variable, energy shifted, fe lines and confirms the reliabilityof the claimed detections. we found that the distribution of detected featuresis peaked at high variability significances in the red- and blue-shifted energybands, suggesting an origin in a relativistically modified accretion flow.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0912.4166	the x-ray to optical-uv luminosity ratio of x-ray selected type 1 agn in  xmm-cosmos	we present a study of the x-ray to optical properties of a sample of 545x-ray selected type 1 agn, from the xmm-cosmos survey, over a wide range ofredshifts ($0.04&lt;\z&lt;4.25$) and x-ray luminosities ($40.6 \leq \log \lhard \leq45.3$). about 60% of them are spectroscopically identified type 1 agn, whilethe others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as type 1agn on the basis of their multi-band spectral energy distributions. we discussthe relationship between uv and x-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the$\alphaox$ spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. wecompare our findings with previous investigations of optically selectedbroad-line agn (mostly from sdss). a highly significant correlation between$\alphaox$ and $\lo$ is found, in agreement with previous investigations ofoptically selected samples. we calculate bolometric corrections, $\kbol$, forthe whole sample using hard x-ray luminosities ($\lhard$), and the eddingtonratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates areavailable. we confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction withincreasing eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. a tight correlationis found between $\alphaox$ and $\kbol$, which can be used to estimate accuratebolometric corrections using only optical and x-ray data. we find a significantcorrelation between $\alphaox$ and eddington ratio, in which $\alphaox$increases for increasing eddington ratios.

1002.2062	the suzaku broadband x-ray spectrum of the dwarf seyfert galaxy ngc4395	we present a suzaku observation of the dwarf seyfert galaxy ngc4395 with anestimated black hole mass of ~10^5 msun. rapid and strong x-ray variabilitywith an rms amplitude of ~60 per cent is observed in the 0.4-10 kev band withthe xis cameras. the shape of the light curve appears to depend on energies.the hard x-ray emission is detected up to 35 kev with the hxd-pin detector at asimilar flux level as observed with the integral ibis. the x-ray spectrum below10 kev is strongly absorbed by partially ionized (xi~35) gas with a meanequivalent hydrogen column density of ~2e22 cm^-2, when a simple absorptionmodel is applied. the spectral shape is also strongly variable but not a simplefunction of the source brightness. the spectral variability appears to beaccounted for mainly by continuum slope changes, but variability in the ionizedabsorber may also play some part. the apparently flat spectral slope withphoton index of 1.4 below 10 kev, obtained after correcting for absorption, ismarginally inconsistent with the photon index of 2 inferred from the 14-35 kevpin spectrum. if the true spectral slope was as steep as that measured in thehard x-ray band, there would be an extra absorption component, which we areunable to detect. combined with the integral measurements, the hard x-rayemission above 10 kev exceeds the optical emission in terms of luminosity anddominates the broadband energy output, unless a large excess of uv diskemission is yet to be detected in the unobservable band. a weak fe k line isseen at 6.4 kev with the average equivalent width of 110 ev, which does notshow clear flux changes over the 3-day observation.

0708.0158	a compton thick agn powering the hyperluminous infrared galaxy iras  00182--7112	we present x-ray observations of the hyperluminous infrared galaxy (hlirg)iras 00182--7112 (f00183--7111) obtained using the xmm-newton epic camera. aluminous hard x-ray source co-incident with the nucleus is revealed, along withweaker soft x-ray emission which may be extended or offset from the hard. theepic spectrum is extremely flat and shows fe k$\alpha$ emission with very highequivalent width: both are typical characteristics of a buried, compton--thickagn which is seen only in scattered light. perhaps the most remarkablecharacteristic of the spectrum is that the fe k$\alpha$ line energy is that ofhe-like iron, making iras 00182--7112 the first hidden agn known to bedominated by ionized, compton thick reflection. taking an appropriatebolometric correction we find that this agn could easily dominate the firenergetics. the nuclear reflection spectrum is seen through a relatively coldabsorber with column density consistent with recent spitzer observations. thesoft x-ray emission, which may be thermal in nature and associated withstar-forming activity, is seen unabsorbed. the soft x-rays and weak pahfeatures both give estimates of the star formation rate $\sim 300 m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, insufficient to power the fir emission and supportive of the ideathat this hlirg is agn-dominated.

1004.2790	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field (xmm-cosmos):  demography and multiwavelength properties of obscured and unobscured luminous  agn	we report the final optical identifications of the medium-depth (~60 ksec),contiguous (2 deg^2) xmm-newton survey of the cosmos field. xmm-newton hasdetected ~800 x-ray sources down to limiting fluxes of ~5x10^{-16},~3x10^{-15}, and ~7x10^{-15} erg/cm2/s in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kevbands, respectively. the work is complemented by an extensive collection ofmulti-wavelength data from 24 micron to uv, available from the cosmos survey,for each of the x-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for ~50% ofthe sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. the xmm andmultiwavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the x-ray sourceshave optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have irac counterparts, and 1394 (~78%)have mips 24micron detections. thanks to the redshift completeness (almost100%) we were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the x-rayluminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density oflogl_x&gt;44.5 agn is at z~2. spectroscopically-identified obscured and unobscuredagn, as well as normal and starforming galaxies, present well-defined opticaland infrared properties. we devised a robust method to identify a sample of~150 high redshift (z&gt;1), obscured agn candidates for which opticalspectroscopy is not available. we were able to determine that the fraction ofthe obscured agn population at the highest (l_x&gt;10^{44} erg s^{-1}) x-rayluminosity is ~15-30% when selection effects are taken into account, providingan important observational constraint for x-ray background synthesis. westudied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energydistribution of a prototypical type 2 qso, caught in a stage transitioning frombeing starburst dominated to agn dominated, which was possible to isolate onlythanks to the combination of x-ray and infrared observations.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1005.0373	the x-ray to [ne v]3426 flux ratio: discovering heavily obscured agn in  the distant universe	we investigate the possibility of using the ratio between the 2-10 kev fluxand the [ne v]3426 emission line flux (x/nev) as a diagnostic diagram todiscover heavily obscured, possibly compton-thick active galactic nuclei (agn)up to z~1.5. first, we calibrate a relation between x/nev and the coldabsorbing column density n_h using a sample of 74 bright, nearby seyferts withboth x-ray and [ne v] data available in the literature. similarly to what isfound for the x-ray to [o iii]5007 flux ratio (x/oiii), we found that the x/nevratio decreases towards large column densities. essentially all local seyfertswith x/nev values below 15 are found to be compton-thick objects. second, weapply this diagnostic diagram to different samples of distant obscured andunobscured qsos in the sdss: blue, unobscured, type-1 qsos in the redshiftrange z=[0.1-1.5] show x/nev values typical of unobscured seyfert 1s in thelocal universe. conversely, sdss type-2 qsos at z~0.5 classified either ascompton-thick or compton-thin on the basis of their x/oiii ratio, would havebeen mostly classified in the same way based on the x/nev ratio. we apply thex/nev diagnostic diagram to 9 sdss obscured qsos in the redshift rangez=[0.85-1.31], selected by means of their prominent [ne v]3426 line andobserved with chandra acis-s for 10ks each. based on the x/nev ratio,complemented by x-ray spectral analysis, 2 objects appear good compton-thickqso candidates, 4 objects appear as compton-thin qsos, while 3 have anambiguous classification. when excluding from the sample broad lined qsos witha red continuum and thus considering only genuine narrow-line objects, theefficiency in selecting compton-thick qsos through the [ne v] line is about 50%(with large errors, though), more similar to what is achieved with [o iii]selection.

1005.3253	suzaku observations of hard x-ray selected seyfert 2 galaxies	we present suzaku observations of five hard x-ray selected nearby seyfert 2galaxies. all the sources were clearly detected with the pin hard x-raydetector up to several tens of kev, allowing for a fairly good characterizationof the broad-band x-ray continuum. we find that a unique model, even includingmultiple components, fails to represent the spectra of all the sources. heavyobscuration manifests itself in different flavours. for two sources there isevidence for a reflection dominated continuum; among the other three, one is"mildly" compton thick (n_h ~ 10^24 cm-2), while the remaining two are heavilyobscured (n_h ~ 10^23.5 cm-2), but compton thin. strong, narrow, iron kalphalines (ew ~ 1-2 kev) due to neutral or mildly ionized gas, are detected incompton thick agn. in all of them the kalpha line is accompanied by the kbeta.the intensity and shape of the soft x-ray spectrum are different from object toobject. soft x--rays may originate from a nuclear component scattered off, orleaking through, the x-ray absorber, plus thermal x-rays from the host galaxy.emission from circumnuclear gas photoionized by the active nucleus,parameterized with a power law plus individual narrow gaussian lines, alsoprovides an acceptable description of the soft x-ray spectra. the limitedsuzaku xis ccd energy resolution does not allow us to draw firm conclusions onthe origin of the soft x--ray emission. we briefly discuss our findings in thelight of agn unified model and the geometry of the obscuring gas.

0704.0226	correlated modulation between the redshifted fe k alpha line and the  continuum emission in ngc 3783	it has been suggested that x-ray observations of rapidly variable seyfertgalaxies may hold the key to probe the gas orbital motions in the innermostregions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patternsunder the effect of the hole strong gravitational field. we explore thispossibility analizing xmm-newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783.a detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortestpossible time-scales (few ks) using "excess maps" and cross-correlating lightcurves in different energy bands. in addition to a constant core of the fe kalpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted fe k alpha emission featurebetween 5.3-6.1 kev. the line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ksthat is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 kev sourcecontinuum. the time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted feline and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretiondisc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 m_sun. given the shape of theredshfted line emission and the overall x-ray variability pattern, the line islikely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.

1010.4227	the x-ray spectral signatures from the complex circumnuclear regions in  the compton thick agn ngc 424	we present the xmm-newton rgs and epic pn spectra of a long (\simeq 100 ks)observation of one of the soft x-ray brightest compton-thick seyfert 2galaxies, ngc 424. as a first step, we performed a phenomenological analysis ofthe data to derive the properties of all the spectral components. on the basisof these results, we fitted the spectra with self-consistent photoionisationmodels, produced with cloudy. the high-energy part of the spectrum is dominatedby a pure neutral compton reflection component and a neutral iron k-alpha line,together with k-alpha emission from neutral ni, suggesting a significant ni/feoverabundance. the soft x-ray rgs spectrum comes mostly from line emission fromh-like and he-like c, n, o, and ne, as well as from the fe l-shell. thepresence of narrow rrc from o viii, o vii, and c vi, the last two with resolvedwidths corresponding to temperatures around 5-10 ev, is a strong indication ofa gas in photoionisation equilibrium, as confirmed by the prevalence of theforbidden component in the o vii triplet. two gas phases with differentionisation parameters are needed to reproduce the spectrum with aself-consistent photoionisation model, any contribution from a gas incollisional equilibrium being no more than 10% of the total flux in the0.35-1.55 kev band. when this self-consistent model is applied to the 0.5-10kev band of the epic pn spectrum, a third photoionised phase is needed toaccount for emission lines with higher ionisation potential, although k-alphaemission from s xv and fe xxvi remains under-predicted.

1012.1891	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of luminous infrared galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 248luminous infrared (ir) galaxies (lirgs) which comprise the great observatoriesall-sky lirg survey (goals) observed with the infrared spectrograph (irs)on-board the spitzer space telescope. the goals sample enables a directmeasurement of the relative contributions of star-formation and active galacticnuclei (agn) to the total ir emission from a large sample of local lirgs. theagn contribution to the mir emission (f-agn) is estimated by employing severaldiagnostics based on the properties of the [nev], [oiv] and [neii] finestructure gas emission lines, the 6.2 microns pah and the shape of the mircontinuum. we find that 18% of all lirgs contain an agn and that in 10% of allsources the agn contributes more than 50% of the total ir luminosity. summingup the total ir luminosity contributed by agn in all our sources suggests thatagn supply ~12% of the total energy emitted by lirgs. the average spectrum ofsources with an agn looks similar to the average spectrum of sources without anagn, but it has lower pah emission and a flatter mir continuum. agn dominatedlirgs have higher ir luminosities, warmer mir colors and are found ininteracting systems more often than pure starbursts lirgs. however we find nolinear correlations between these properties and f-agn. we used the irac colorsof lirgs to confirm that finding agn on the basis of their mir colors may miss~40% of agn dominated (u)lirgs

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1208.3248	investigation of dual active nuclei, outflows, shock-heated gas, and  young star clusters in markarian 266	results of observations with the spitzer, hubble, galex, chandra, andxmm-newton space telescopes are presented for the luminous infrared galaxy(lirg) merger mrk 266. the sw (seyfert 2) and ne (liner) nuclei reside ingalaxies with hubble types sbb (pec) and s0/a (pec), respectively. bothgalaxies have l &gt; l*, and they are inferred to each contain a ~2.5x10^8 m_sunblack hole. mrk 266 sw is likely the primary source of a bright fe k-alpha linedetected from the system, consistent with the reflection-dominated x-rayspectrum of a heavily obscured agn. optical knots embedded in an arc withaligned radio continuum radiation, combined with luminous h_2 line emission,provide evidence for a radiative bow shock in an agn-driven outflow surroundingthe ne nucleus. soft x-ray emission modeled as shock-heated plasma isco-spatial with radio continuum emission between the galaxies. mid-irdiagnostics indicate roughly equal contributions of agn and starburst radiationpowering the bolometric luminosity. approximately 120 star clusters have beendetected, with most having estimated ages &lt; 50 myr. detection of 24 micronemission extending ~34 arcsec (20 kpc) north of the galaxies is interpreted as~2x10^7 m_sun of dust entrained in an outflowing superwind; at opticalwavelengths this region is resolved into a fragmented morphology indicative ofrayleigh-taylor instabilities in an expanding shell of ionized gas. mrk 266demonstrates that the dust "blow-out" phase can begin in a lirg well before thegalaxies fully coalesce during a subsequent ulirg phase, and rapid gasconsumption in luminous dual agns (kpc scale separations) early in the mergerprocess may explain the paucity of detected binary qsos (sub-pc scale orbits)in large surveys. an evolutionary sequence is proposed representing aprogression from dual to binary agns, accompanied by an increase in observedl_x/l_ir ratios by 10^4 or more.

1301.7318	a herschel survey of the [n ii] 205 micron line in local luminous  infrared galaxies --- the [n ii] 205 micron emission as a star formation rate  indicator	we present, for the first time, a statistical study of [n ii] 205 mciron lineemission for a large sample of local luminous infrared galaxies using herschelspectral and photometric imaging receiver fourier transform spectrometer (spirefts) data. for our sample of galaxies, we investigate the correlation betweenthe [n ii] luminosity (lnii) and the total infrared luminosity (lir), as wellas the dependence of lnii/lir ratio on lir, far infrared colors (iras$f_{60}/f_{100}$) and the [o iii] 88 micron to [n ii] luminosity ratio. we findthat lnii correlates almost linearly with lir for non agn galaxies (all having$l_{ir} &lt; 10^{12} l_solar$) in our sample, which implies that lnii can serve asa sfr tracer which is particularly useful for high redshift galaxies which willbe observed with forthcoming submm spectroscopic facilities such as the atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array. our analysis shows that the deviationfrom the mean lnii-lir relation correlates with tracers of the ionizationparameter, which suggests the scatter in this relation is mainly due to thevariations in the hardness, and/or ionization parameter, of the ambientgalactic uv field among the sources in our sample.

1309.6559	studying the non-thermal lobes of iras 16547-4247 through a  multi-wavelength approach	in the recent years massive protostars have been suggested to be high-energyemitters. among the best candidates is iras 16547-4247, a protostar thatpresents a powerful outflow with clear signatures of interaction with itsenvironment. this source has been revealed to be a potential high-energy sourcebecause it displays non-thermal radio emission of synchrotron origin, which isevidence of relativistic particles. to improve our understanding of iras16547-4247 as a high-energy source, we analyzed xmm-newton archival data andfound that iras 16547-4247 is a hard x-ray source. we discuss these results inthe context of a refined one-zone model and previous radio observations. fromour study we find that it may be difficult to explain the x-ray emission asnon-thermal radiation coming from the interaction region, but it might beproduced by thermal bremsstrahlung (plus photo-electric absorption) by a fastshock at the jet end. in the high-energy range, the source might be detectableby the present generation of cherenkov telescopes, and may eventually bedetected by fermi in the gev range.

1311.1305	the incidence of obscuration in active galactic nuclei	we study the incidence of nuclear obscuration on a complete sample of 1310agn selected on the basis of their rest-frame 2-10 kev x-ray flux from thexmm-cosmos survey, in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5. we classify the agn asobscured or un-obscured on the basis of either the optical spectral propertiesand the overall sed or the shape of the x-ray spectrum. the two classificationsagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be furthersubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities x-ray un-obscured agndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/uv continuum emission in theiroptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at highluminosities broad line agn may have absorbed x-ray spectra, which hints at anincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. weconfirm that the fraction of obscured agn is a decreasing function of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significantevolution only for the most luminous agn, which appear to be more commonlyobscured at higher redshift. we find no significant difference between the meanstellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured agn hosts.we conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscurationin agn is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclearluminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere ofinfluence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the widerscale galactic conditions.

1404.0901	discovery of x-ray emission from the first be/black hole system	mwc 656 (= hd 215227) was recently discovered to be the first binary systemcomposed of a be star and a black hole (bh). we observed it with\textit{xmm-newton}, and detected a faint x-ray source compatible with theposition of the optical star, thus proving it to be the first be/bh x-raybinary. the spectrum analysis requires a model fit with two components, a blackbody plus a power law, with $k_{\rm b}t = 0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$~kev and aphoton index $\gamma= 1.0\pm0.8$, respectively. the non-thermal componentdominates above $\simeq$0.8 kev. the obtained total flux is $f(0.3$--$5.5~{\rmkev}) = (4.6^{+1.3}_{-1.1})\times10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. at adistance of $2.6\pm0.6$~kpc the total flux translates into a luminosity $l_{\rmx} = (3.7\pm1.7)\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. considering the estimated range ofbh masses to be 3.8--6.9 $m_{\odot}$, this luminosity represents$(6.7\pm4.4)\times10^{-8}~l_{\rm edd}$, which is typical of stellar-mass bhs inquiescence. we discuss the origin of the two spectral components: the thermalcomponent is associated with the hot wind of the be star, whereas the power lawcomponent is associated with emission from the vicinity of the bh. we also findthat the position of mwc~656 in the radio versus x-ray luminosity diagram maybe consistent with the radio/x-ray correlation observed in bh low-mass x-raybinaries. this suggests that this correlation might also be valid for bhhigh-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) with x-ray luminosities down to $\sim10^{-8}l_{\rm edd}$. mwc~656 will allow the accretion processes and theaccretion/ejection coupling at very low luminosities for bh~hmxbs to bestudied.

1509.05413	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s. ix. an x-ray outflow in a luminous  obscured quasar at z~1.6	in active galactic nuclei (agn)-galaxy co-evolution models, agn winds andoutflows are often invoked to explain why super-massive black holes andgalaxies stop growing efficiently at a certain phase of their lives. they arecommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. evidence ofultra-fast (v&gt;0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of agn has beencollected in the past decade by sensitive x-ray observations for sizablesamples of agn, mostly at low redshift. here we present ultra-deep xmm-newtonand chandra spectral data of an obscured (nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsicallyluminous (l2-10kev~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named pid352) at z~1.6 (derivedfrom the x-ray spectral analysis) in the chandra deep field-south. the sourceis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observedenergies of e~2-3 kev. while the emission line is interpreted as being due toneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorptionfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (fexxv, fexxvi) with anoutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionizationmodels. the mass outflow rate - ~2 msun/yr - is similar to the source accretionrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. pid352 represents oneof the few cases where indications of x-ray outflowing gas have been observedat high redshift thus far. this wind is powerful enough to provide feedback onthe host galaxy.

1509.07512	excitation mechanisms for hcn (1-0) and hco+ (1-0) in galaxies from the  great observatories all-sky lirg survey	we present new iram 30m spectroscopic observations of the $\sim88$ ghz band,including emission from the cch (n=1-0) multiplet, hcn (1-0), hco+ (1-0), andhnc (1-0), for a sample of 58 local luminous and ultraluminous infraredgalaxies from the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). by combiningour new iram data with literature data and spitzer/irs spectroscopy, we studythe correspondence between these putative tracers of dense gas and the relativecontribution of active galactic nuclei (agn) and star formation to themid-infrared luminosity of each system. we find the hcn (1-0) emission to beenhanced in agn-dominated systems ($\langle$l'$_{hcn (1-0)}$/l'$_{hco^+(1-0)}\rangle=1.84$), compared to composite and starburst-dominated systems($\langle$l'$_{hcn (1-0)}$/l'$_{hco^+ (1-0)}\rangle=1.14$, and 0.88,respectively). however, some composite and starburst systems have l'$_{hcn(1-0)}$/l'$_{hco^+ (1-0)}$ ratios comparable to those of agn, indicating thatenhanced hcn emission is not uniquely associated with energetically dominantagn. after removing agn-dominated systems from the sample, we find a linearrelationship (within the uncertainties) between $\log_{10}$(l'$_{hcn (1-0)}$)and $\log_{10}$(l$_{ir}$), consistent with most previous findings. l'$_{hcn(1-0)}$/l$_{ir}$, typically interpreted as the dense gas depletion time,appears to have no systematic trend with l$_{ir}$ for our sample of luminousand ultraluminous infrared galaxies, and has significant scatter. thegalaxy-integrated hcn (1-0) and hco+ (1-0) emission do not appear to have asimple interpretation, in terms of the agn dominance or the star formationrate, and are likely determined by multiple processes, including density andradiative effects.

0806.1260	chandra reveals twin x-ray jets in the powerful fr-ii radio galaxy 3c353	we report x-ray imaging of the powerful fr-ii radio galaxy 3c353 using thechandra x-ray observatory. 3c353's two 4"-wide and 2'-long jets allow us tostudy in detail the internal structure of the large-scale relativistic outflowsat both radio and x-ray photon energies with the sub-arcsecond spatialresolution. in a 90 ks chandra observation, we have detected x-ray emissionfrom most radio structures in 3c353, including the nucleus, the jet and thecounterjet, the terminal jet regions (hotspots), and one radio lobe. we showthat the detection of the x-ray emission associated with the radio knots andcounterknots puts several crucial constraints on the x-ray emission mechanismsin powerful large-scale jets of quasars and fr-ii sources. in particular, weshow that this detection is inconsistent with the inverse-compton modelproposed in the literature, and instead implies a synchrotron origin of thex-ray jet photons. we also find that the width of the x-ray counterjet ispossibly narrower than that measured in radio bands, that the radio-to-x-rayflux ratio decreases systematically downstream along the jets, and that thereare substantial (kpc-scale) offsets between the positions of the x-ray andradio intensity maxima within each knot, whose magnitudes increase away fromthe nucleus. we discuss all these findings in the wider context of the physicsof extragalactic jets, proposing some particular though not definitivesolutions or interpretations for each problem.

astro-ph;0011360	evidence for ionised accretion discs in five narrow-line seyfert 1  galaxies	(abridged) we present the results of fitting asca spectra of six narrow-lineseyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies with the ionised reflection models of ross &amp; fabian(1993). we find that five of the galaxies (tons 180, pks 0558-504, ark 564, mrk335 and pg 1244+026) are well fit by the ionised disc model, and these areoften better fits than the alternative models considered. the sixth galaxy, ngc4051, has additional spectral complexity that cannot be well described by asimple ionised disc model or any of the other alternative models. all six ofthe nls1s we considered show evidence for a broad fe kalpha line, but none ofthe line centroids are consistent with emission from highly ionised fe. this ismost likely due to the line being redshifted because of relativistic effects.we note that sources with larger ionisation parameters tend to have larger fekalpha ews. we interpret this as evidence that ionised fe features are makingtheir presence felt in the spectra. since most of our sources have steepspectra, highly ionised features are predicted even by the new variable densityreflection models. the one source we analyse with a photon index less than twohas the lowest ionisation parameter in our sample. we conclude that our resultis the strongest evidence yet that nls1 might have ionised accretion discs.this result gives further weight to the hypothesis that these objects containrapidly accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0202297	how the x-ray spectrum of a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy may be  reflection dominated	a model for the inner regions of accretion flows is presented where, due todisc instabilities, cold and dense material is clumped into deep sheets orrings. surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronaldissipation processes occur. we expect this situation to be most relevant whenthe accretion rate is close to eddington and the disc is radiation-pressuredominated, and so may apply to narrow-line seyfert~1 (nls1) galaxies. in thisscenario, the hard x-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so thedetected x-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of thesheets. a simple comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indicescharacteristic of nls1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closelysurrounding the hard x-ray source. we test this model by fitting the xmm-newtonspectrum of the nls1 1h 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 kev with reflectiondominated ionized disc models. a very good fit is found with three differentreflectors each subject to the same \gamma=2.35 power-law. an ironoverabundance is still required to fit the sharp drop in the spectrum at around7 kev. we note that even a small corrugation of the accretion disc may resultin \gamma &gt; 2 and a strong reflection component in the observed spectrum.therefore, this model may also explain the strength and the variabilitycharacteristics of the mcg-6-30-15 fe k line. the idea needs to be tested withfurther broadband xmm-newton observations of nls1s.

astro-ph;0409689	on the transmission- to reprocessing-dominated spectral state  transitions in seyfert 2 galaxies	we present chandra and xmm-newton observations of a small sample (11 objects)of optically-selected seyfert~2 galaxies, for which asca and bepposax hadsuggested compton-thick obscuration of the active nucleus (agn). the main goalof this study is to estimate the rate of transitions between "transmission-"and "reprocessing-dominated" states. we discover one new transition in ngc4939,with a possible additional candidate in ngc5643. this indicates a typicaloccurrence rate of at least ~0.02/year. these transitions could be due to largechanges of the obscuring gas column density, or to a transient dimming of theagn activity, the latter scenario being supported by detailed analysis of thebest studied events. independently of the ultimate mechanism, comparison of theobserved spectral dynamics with monte-carlo simulations demonstrates that theobscuring gas is largely inhomogeneous, with multiple absorbing componentspossibly spread through the whole range of distances from the nucleus between afraction of parsecs up to several hundreds parsecs. as a by-product of thisstudy, we report the first measurement ever of the column density covering theagn in ngc3393 (n_h ~ 4.4x10^{24} atoms/cm/cm), and the discovery of soft x-rayextended emission, apparently aligned along the host galaxy main axis inngc5005. the latter object hosts most likely an historically misclassifiedlow-luminosity compton-thin agn.

astro-ph;0410261	the exceptional x-ray variability of the dwarf seyfert nucleus ngc 4395	an analysis of the x-ray variability of the low luminosity seyfert nucleusngc 4395, based on a long xmm-newton observation, is presented. the powerspectrum shows a clear break from a flat spectrum (alpha ~ 1) to a steeperspectrum (alpha ~ 2) at a frequency f_br = 0.5 - 3.0 * 10^-3 hz, comparable tothe highest characteristic frequency found previously in a seyfert galaxy. thisextends the measured m_bh-f_br values to lower m_bh than previous studies ofseyfert galaxies, and is consistent with an inverse scaling of variabilityfrequency with black hole mass. the variations observed are among the mostviolent seen in an agn to date, with the fractional rms amplitude (f_var)exceeding 100 per cent in the softest band. the amplitude of the variationsseems intrinsically higher in ngc 4395 than most other seyferts, even afteraccounting for the differences in characteristic frequencies. the origin ofthis difference is not clear, but it is unlikely to be a high accretion rate(l/l_edd &lt; 20 per cent for ngc 4395). the variations clearly follow the linearrms-flux relation, further supporting the idea that this is a ubiquitouscharacteristics of accreting black holes. the variations are highly coherentbetween different energy bands with any frequency-dependent time delay limitedto &lt;1 per cent.

astro-ph;0411562	fe k emission in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp220	prominent fe k line emission is detected at around 6.7 kev in the xmm-newtonspectrum of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp220. the continuum emission inthe 2.5-10 kev band is flat and a few other spectral features are suggested.the large ew of the fe k line poses a problem with interpreting the hard x-rayemission as integrated x-ray binary emission. a thermal emission spectrum witha temperature of kt~7 kev modified by some absorption, which would be expectedfrom an internally shocked hot bubble in a starburst region, can describe thespectrum. an ensemble of radio supernovae in a dense environment, as suggestedfrom vlbi imaging, could be another possibility, if frequent occurence of suchpowerful supernovae is sustained. however, the apparent lack of x-ray binaryemission does not match the high supernova rate required by bothinterpretations. highly photoionized, low-density gas illuminated by a hiddencompton-thick agn is a possible alternative, which can be tested bypresence/absence of radiative recombination continua in better quality dataexpected from a forthcoming observation.

astro-ph;0504472	x-ray reflection in the seyfert galaxy 1h0419-577 revealing strong  relativistic effects in the vicinity of a kerr black hole	we report results obtained from six xmm-newton observations of the seyfertgalaxy 1h 0419-577. here we show that the x-ray spectrum and variability arewell described by a two-component model comprising a power law with constantspectral shape and variable normalisation and a much more constant ionisedreflection component from the inner accretion. one of the observations wasperformed when the source was in a particularly low flux state in which thex-ray spectrum is rather peculiar and exhibits a very flat hard spectrum withbroad residuals below 6.6 kev and a steep soft excess below about 1 kev. weinterpret the spectrum as being reflection-dominated by x-ray reprocessedemission from the inner accretion disc. the primary continuum is almostcompletely unobserved possibly because of strong light bending towards thecentral black hole. the ionised reflection model simultaneously accounts forthe broad residuals and hard flat spectrum and for the soft excess. the samemodel provides an excellent description of the data at all the other fluxlevels, the most important difference being a variation in the power lawnormalisation. our results imply that most of the x-ray emission in this sourceoriginates from within few gravitational radii from the central black hole andrequires that the compact object is an almost maximally spinning kerr blackhole.

astro-ph;0504604	molecular gas and nuclear activity in radio galaxies detected by iras	this paper reports the latest results from a millimeter-wave (co)spectroscopic survey of iras-detected radio galaxies with l_1.4ghz ~ 10^23-28w/hz in the redshift range z ~ 0.02-0.15. the iras flux-limited sample contains33 radio galaxies with different radio morphologies and a broad range ofinfrared luminosities l_ir = 10^9-12 l_sun), allowing for an investigation of(a) whether low-z radio-selected agn reside in molecular gas-rich host galaxes,and (b) whether the co properties are correlated with the properties of thehost galaxy or the agn. all of the radio galaxies in mazzarella et al. (1993)and mirabel et al. (1989) have been reobserved. three new co detections havebeen made, raising the total number of co detections to nine and setting thesurvey detection rate at ~ 25%. many of the co lines have double-peakedprofiles, and the co line widths are broad (average delta v_fwhm ~ 500+/-130km/s), exceeding the average co widths of both ultraluminous infrared galaxies(300+/-90 km/s) and palomar-green qsos (260+/-160 km/s), and thus beingindicative of massive host galaxies. the co luminosities translate intomolecular gas masses of ~ 0.4-7x10^9 m_sun, however, the 3-sigma co upperlimits for nondetections do not rule out a molecular gas mass as high as thatof the milky way (~ 3x10^9 m_sun). optical images of eight out of ninemolecular gas-rich radio galaxies show evidence of close companions and/ortidal features. finally, there is no obvious correlation between radio powerand molecular gas mass. however, it is notable that only one f-r ii galaxy outof 12 is detected in this co survey; the remaining detections are of galaxieshosting f-r i and compact radio jets.

astro-ph;0508507	iron fluorescent line emission from black hole accretion disks with  magnetic reconnection-heated corona	we investigate the iron k$\alpha$ fluorescent line produced by hard x-rayphotons from magnetic reconnection-heated corona. the hot corona withtemperature being about $10^9$k can irradiate the underlying disk with acontinuum x-ray spectrum produced via thermal comptonization. then the ironatoms in the disk photoelectrically absorb x-ray photons and radiate k$\alpha$line photons. therefore, the activity of corona is responsible to the iron lineemission from the underlying disk. in previous studies, oversimplified x-rayphoton sources are often assumed above the disk in order to compute the ironline profile or power-law line emissivity profiles are assumed with an indexbeing a free parameter. we adopt the more realistic corona model constructed byliu et al. in which the corona is heated by magnetic energy released throughthe reconnection of magnetic flux loops and which has no free parameter. thenthe accretion energy is dominantly dissipated in the corona, in which x-rayphotons are efficiently produced and irradiate the underlying disk. we find thelocal emmisivity of iron line on the disk is approximated as $f_{{\rmk}\alpha}(r)\propto r^{-5}$. the iron line profiles derived from this modelgive excellent fits to the observational data of mcg-6-30-15 with the profilesderived theoretically for $i\sim 30^{\circ}$ for energy band 4-7kev. possibleorigins of line variability are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0510476	a very deep chandra observation of the perseus cluster: shocks, ripples  and conduction	we present the first results from a very deep chandra x-ray observation ofthe core of the perseus cluster of galaxies. a pressure map reveals a clearthick band of high pressure around the inner radio bubbles. the gas in the bandmust be expanding outward and the sharp front to it is identified as a shockfront, yet we see no temperature jump across it; indeed there is more softemission behind the shock than in front of it. we conclude that in this innerregion either thermal conduction operates efficiently or the co-existingrelativistic plasma seen as the radio mini-halo is mediating the shock. ifcommon, isothermal shocks in cluster cores mean that we cannot diagnose theexpansion speed of radio bubbles from temperature measurements alone. they canat times expand more rapidly than currently assumed without producingsignificant regions of hot gas. bubbles may also be significantly moreenergetic. the pressure ripples found in earlier images are identified asisothermal sound waves. a simple estimate based on their amplitude confirmsthat they can be an effective distributed heat source able to balance radiativecooling. we see multiphase gas with about 10^9 msun at a temperature of about0.5 kev. much, but not all, of this cooler gas is spatially associated with theoptical filamentary nebula around the central galaxy, ngc 1275. a residualcooling flow of about 50 msun/yr may be taking place. a channel is found in thepressure map along the path of the bubbles, with indications found of outerbubbles. the channel connects in the s with a curious cold front.

astro-ph;0602191	xmm-newton study of the complex and variable spectrum of ngc 4051	we study the x-ray spectral variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxyngc 4051 as observed during two xmm-newton observations. the data show evidencefor a neutral and constant reflection component and for constant emission fromphotoionized gas, which are included in all spectral models. the nuclearemission can be modelled both in terms of a ``standard model'' (pivoting powerlaw plus a black body component for the soft excess) and of a two--componentone (power law plus ionized reflection from the accretion disc). the standardmodel results indicate that the soft excess does not follow the standard blackbody law. moreover, although the spectral slope is correlated with flux, whichis consistent with spectral pivoting, the hardest photon indexes are so flat asto require rather unusual scenarios. these problems can be solved in terms ofthe two-component model in which the soft excess is not thermal, but due to theionized reflection component. the variability of the reflection component fromthe inner disc closely follows the predictions of the light bending model,suggesting that most of the primary nuclear emission is produced in the veryinnermost regions, only a few gravitational radii from the central black hole.(abridged)

astro-ph;0605236	on the x-ray, optical emission line and black hole mass properties of  local seyfert galaxies	we investigate the relation between x-ray nuclear emission, optical emissionline luminosities and black hole masses for a sample of 47 seyfert galaxies.the sample, which has been selected from the palomar optical spectroscopicsurvey of nearby galaxies (ho, filippenko &amp; sargent 1997), covers a wide rangeof nuclear powers, from l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down to very lowluminosities (l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). best available data from chandra,xmm-newton and, in a few cases, asca observations have been considered. thanksto the good spatial resolution available from these observations and a propermodeling of the various spectral components, it has been possible to obtainaccurate nuclear x-ray luminosities not contaminated by off-nuclear sourcesand/or diffuse emission. x-ray luminosities have then been corrected takinginto account the likely candidate compton thick sources, which are a highfraction (&gt; 30%) among type 2 seyferts in our sample. the main result of thisstudy is that we confirm strong linear correlations between 2-10 kev,[oiii]\lambda5007, h_{alpha} luminosities which show the same slope as quasarsand luminous seyfert galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activitydisplayed. moreover, despite the wide range of eddington ratios (l/l_{edd})tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down to ~ 10^{-7}), nocorrelation is found between the x-ray or optical emission line luminositiesand the black hole mass. our results suggest that seyfert nuclei in our sampleare consistent with being a scaled-down version of more luminous agn.

astro-ph;0610283	a longer xmm-newton look at i zwicky 1: variability of the x-ray  continuum, absorption, and iron kalpha line	we present the second xmm-newton observation (85 ks) of the narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) i zw 1 and describe its mean spectral and timingcharacteristics. on average, i zw 1 is ~35 per cent dimmer in 2005 than in theshorter (20 ks) 2002 observation. between the two epochs the intrinsicabsorption column density diminished, but there were also subtle changes in thecontinuum shape. considering the blurred ionised reflection model, thelong-term changes can be associated with a varying contribution of the powerlaw component relative to the total spectrum. examination of normalised lightcurves indicates that the high-energy variations are quite structured and thatthere are delays, but only in some parts of the light curve. interestingly, ahard x-ray lag first appears during the most-distinct structure in the meanlight curve, a flux dip ~25 ks into the observation. the previously discoveredbroad, ionised fe ka line shows significant variations over the course of the2005 observation. the amplitude of the variations is 25-45 per cent and theyare unlikely due to changes in the fe ka-producing region, but perhaps arisefrom orbital motion around the black hole or obscuration in the broad ironline-emitting region. the 2002 data are re-examined for variability of the feka line at that epoch. there is evidence of energy and flux variations that areassociated with a hard x-ray flare that occurred during that observation.

(1994), we find definite evidence forthe {\sc o\,vii} and {\sc o\,viii} k-shell absorption edges of the warmabsorber and a doubling of the warm absorber column density within the 3 weeksseparating the two observations. no intra-day {\it flux-correlated} variabilityof the warm absorber is found. however, we report the discovery of an `event'in which the warm absorber parameters temporarily change for\sim10\,000\thinspace s before returning to their original values. possibleinterpretations are discussed but a contradiction remains: the constancy of theionization state of the warm absorber argues that it lies at large distancesfrom the central source whereas the short term change in column density arguesfor small distances. fluorescent iron emission is examined. as found by fabianet al. (1994), the iron line is broad and strong (equivalent width\sim300\thinspace ev). the line profile is also suggestive of it being skewed.such a line would be expected from a relativistic accretion disk. we also findvery rapid primary x-ray variability. assuming relativistic beaming to beunimportant, the derived efficiency is comparable to the maximum obtainablefrom accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole. correlated variability outsideof the energy range of {\it asca} might exceed this maximum, thus requiringefficient accretion onto a kerr hole.

astro-ph;9604162	rosat pspc and hri observations of the composite starburst/seyfert 2  galaxy ngc 1672	the nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc 1672 is thought to have a weak seyfertnucleus in addition to its strong starburst activity. observations with thepspc and hri instruments on board the rosat x-ray satellite show that threex-ray sources with luminosities (1--2)\times 10^{40} erg/s are clearlyidentified with ngc 1672. the strongest x-ray source lies at the nucleus, andthe other two lie near the ends of the prominent bar, locations that are alsobright in h-alpha and near-infrared images. the nuclear source is resolved bythe hri on about the scale of the recently identified nuclear ring, and one ofthe sources at the ends of the bar is also probably resolved. the x-rayspectrum of the nuclear source is quite soft, having a raymond--smith plasmatemperature of about 0.7 kev and little evidence for intrinsic absorption. therosat band x-ray flux of the nuclear source appears to be dominated not byx-ray binary emission but rather by diffuse gas emission. while the propertiesof the nuclear source are generally supportive of a superbubble interpretation,its large density and emission measure stretch the limits that can becomfortably accommodated by such models. we do not detect direct emission fromthe putative seyfert nucleus, although an alternative model for the nuclearsource is thermal emission from gas that is photoionized by a hidden seyfertnucleus. the spectra of the other two x-ray sources are harder than that of thenuclear source, and superbubble models for them have the same strengths andweaknesses.

astro-ph;9803289	do nuclear starbursts obscure the x-ray background?	we propose a model for the source of the x-ray background (xrb) in which lowluminosity active nuclei (l&lt;10^43 erg/s) are obscured by nuclear starburstswithin the inner 100pc. the obscuring material covers most of the sky as seenfrom the central source, rather than being distributed in a toroidal structure,and hardens the averaged x-ray spectrum by photoelectric absorption. the gas isturbulent with velocity dispersion of a few 100 km/s and cloud-cloud collisionslead to copious star formation. although supernovae tend to produce outflows,most of the gas is trapped in the gravity field of the starforming clusteritself and the central black hole. a hot (t=10^6-10^7 k) virialised phase ofthis gas, comprising a few per cent of the total obscuring material, feeds thecentral engine of 10^7 solar masses through bondi accretion, at a sub-eddingtonrate appropriate for the luminosity of these objects. if starburst-obscuredobjects give rise to the residual xrb, then only 10 per cent of the accretionin active galaxies occurs close to the eddington limit in unabsorbed objects.

astro-ph;9807276	heavy and complex x-ray absorption towards the nucleus of markarian 6	we have used the asca satellite to make the first x-ray spectra of markarian6, a bright seyfert 1.5 galaxy with complex and variable permitted lines, anionization cone, and remarkable radio structures. our 0.6--9.5 kev spectrapenetrate to the black hole core of this seyfert and reveal heavy and complexintrinsic x-ray absorption. both total covering and single partial coveringmodels fail to acceptably fit the observed absorption, and double partialcovering or partial covering plus warm absorption appears to be required. thedouble partial covering model provides the best statistical fit to the data,and we measure large column densities of ~ (3-20) * 10^{22} cm^{-2}irrespective of the particular spectral model under consideration. these x-raycolumns are over an order of magnitude larger than expected based onobservations at longer wavelengths. our data suggest that most of the x-rayabsorption occurs either in gas that has a relatively small amount of dust orin gas that is located within the broad line region. the x-ray absorber maywell be the putative `atmosphere' above the torus that collimates theionization cone. we also detect an apparently broad 6.4 kev iron k-alpha line,and we present optical spectra demonstrating that the optical emission lineswere in a representative state during our asca observation.

astro-ph;9808313	an x-ray investigation of powerful far-infrared galaxies	we present asca results on four prototype powerful far-infrared galaxies,mrk231, mrk273, arp220 and ngc6240. the soft x-ray spectra show signatures ofthermal emission with temperatures of (0.5-1) kev, which is probably producedin starbursts. their soft x-ray (0.5-2 kev) luminosities range from 4x10^40erg/s to 7x10^41 erg/s. the x-ray properties are examined in the context of astarburst. evidence for a heavily obscured active nucleus is found in mrk273and ngc6240. the asca spectra of both galaxies show strong iron k emission linefeatures. the hard x-ray emission (e&gt;3 kev) in ngc6240 is most likely thereflected light of a hidden qso whose intrinsic luminosity is suspected to be\~10^45 erg/s, comparable to the far-ir luminosity. the 2-10 kev emission,possibly related to an agn, is found in mrk231. the observed 2-10 kevluminosity is only 2x10^42 erg/s, and the origin of the hard x-ray emission isuncertain due to the low quality of the present data. no evidence for an agn isfound in arp220 in the x-ray data. however, the soft x-ray emission originatingin a starburst is also as weak as the halpha nebula and near-ir continuumdespite the large far-ir excess. the possible existence of a powerful butheavily obscured (compton-thick) agn is discussed.

astro-ph;9901121	the mass density in black holes inferred from the x-ray background	the x-ray background (xrb) probably originates from the integrated x-rayemission of active galactic nuclei (agn). modelling of its flat spectrumimplies considerable absorption in most agn. compton down-scattering means thatsources in which the absorption is compton thick are unlikely to be majorcontributors to the background intensity so the observed spectral intensity atabout 30 kev is little affected by photoelectric absorption. assuming that theintrinsic photon index of agn is 2, we then use the 30 kev intensity of the xrbto infer the absorption-corrected energy density of the background. soltan'sargument then enables us to convert this to a mean local density in blackholes, assuming an accretion efficiency of 0.1 and a mean agn redshift of 2.the result is within a factor of two of that estimated by haehnelt et al fromthe optically-determined black hole masses of magorrian et al. we conclude thatthere is no strong need for any radiatively inefficient mode of accretion forbuilding the masses of black holes. furthermore we show that the absorptionmodel for the xrb implies that about 85 per cent of accretion power in theuniverse is absorbed. this power probably emerges in the infrared bands whereit can be several tens per cent of the recently inferred backgrounds there. thetotal power emitted by accretion is then about one fifth that of stars.

astro-ph;9902159	x-ray and lensing results on the cluster around the powerful radio  galaxy 4c+55.16	we present results from asca and rosat hri observations of the powerful radiogalaxy 4c+55.16 at redshift 0.24. extended soft x-ray emission is imaged by therosat hri. the x-ray brightness profile is sharply peaked on the radio galaxy,characteristic of a strong cooling flow. the x-ray spectrum obtained from ascais consistent with multi-phase intracluster gas. there is evidence for anabsorbed cool component as well as ambient cluster medium in the asca spectrum.a spectral fit, taking a cooling-flow component into account, gives atemperature of kt=5.4(+1.4/-0.9) kev, metal abundance 0.5(+/-0.1)zsun, excessabsorption on the cool component, nh=4.9(+3.4/-1.3)e+21 cm-2, and anabsorption-corrected bolometric luminosity of 2.2e+45 erg/s (h0=50km/s/mpc,q0=0.5). the mass deposition rate is estimated to be about 1100 msun/yr fromthe spectral analysis, in good agreement with that derived from imaginganalysis of the rosat data when corrected for absorption. we tentativelyidentify a blue feature, seen about 15 arcsec from the centre of the radiogalaxy in a published optical image, as a gravitationally-lensed arc. theinferred lensing mass is consistent with the gravitational mass derived fromthe x-ray data. the best-estimate of the redshift of the lensed object is1.5(&gt;0.7). all the observed properties suggest that the environment of 4c+55.16is similar to known massive cooling flow clusters. this is the first massivecooling flow to be found around a powerful, radio source with a compact,ghz-peaked spectrum core.

astro-ph;9905261	soft x-ray spectroscopy of compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxies with  bepposax	we present a x-ray spectroscopic study of the bright compton-thick seyfert 2sngc1068 and the circinus galaxy, performed with bepposax. matt et al. (1997 and1998) interpreted the spectrum above 4 kev as the superposition of comptonreflection and warm plasma scattering of the nuclear radiation. when thiscontinuum is extrapolated downwards to 0.1 kev, further components arise. thengc1068 spectrum is rich in emission lines, mainly due to k-alpha transitionsof he-like elements from oxygen to iron, plus a k-alpha fluorescent line fromneutral iron. if the ionized lines originate in the warm scatterer, its thermaland ionization structure must be complex. from the continuum and lineproperties, we estimate a column density, of the warm scatterer less than a few10^21 atoms/cm/cm. in the circinus galaxy, the absence of highly ionized ironis consistent with a scattering medium with ionization parameter u&lt;5 anddensity about a few times 10^22 atoms/cm/cm. in both cases the neutral ironline is most naturally explained as fluorescence in the medium responsible forthe compton reflection continuum. in ngc1068 an optically thin plasma emissionwith kt~500 ev and strongly sub-solar metallicity is required, while such acomponent is only marginal in the circinus galaxy. we tentatively identify thiscomponent as emission of diffuse hot gas in the nuclear starbursts. possiblecauses for the metal depletion are discussed.

astro-ph;9907352	first constraints on iron abundance versus reflection fraction from the  seyfert~1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15	we report on a joint asca and rxte observation spanning an $\sim$ 400~ks timeinterval of the bright seyfert~1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15. the data clearly confirmthe presence of a broad skewed iron line ($w_{k\alpha} \sim$ 266 ev) andcompton reflection continuum at higher energies reported in our previous paper.we also investigate whether the gravitational and doppler effects that affectthe iron line may also be manifest in the reflected continuum. the uniquenessof this data set is underlined by the extremely good statistics that we obtainfrom the approximately four million photons that make up the 2-20 kev rxte pcaspectrum alone. this, coupled with the high energy coverage of hexte and thespectral resolution of asca in the iron line regime has allowed us to constrainthe relationship between abundance and reflection fraction for the first timeat the 99 per cent confidence level. the reflection fraction is entirelyconsistent with a flat disk, i.e. the cold material subtends $\rm 2 \pi$ sr atthe source, to an accuracy of 20 per cent. monte carlo simulations show thatthe observed strong iron line intensity is explained by an overabundance ofiron by a factor of $\sim$ 2 and an underabundance of the lower-z elements by asimilar factor. by considering non-standard abundances, a clear and consistentpicture can be made in which both the iron line and reflection continuum comefrom the same material such as e.g. an accretion disk.

astro-ph;9909239	the x-ray variability of the seyfert~1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15 from long asca  and rxte observations	we present an analysis of the long rxte observation of the seyfert~1 galaxymcg-6-30-15, taken in july 1997. our results show that the behaviour iscomplicated. we find clear evidence from colour ratios and direct spectralfitting that changes to the intrinsic photon index are taking place. spectralhardening is evident during periods of diminished intensity; in particular, ageneral trend for harder spectra is seen in the period following the hardestrxte flare. flux-correlated studies further show that the 3-10 kev photon indexsteepens while that in the 10-20 kev band, flattens with flux. the largestchanges come from the spectral index below 10kev; however, changes in theintrinsic power law slope, and reflection both contribute in varying degrees tothe overall spectral variability. we find that the iron line flux is consistentwith being constant over large time intervals on the order of days (althoughthe asca and rxte spectra show that $f_{k\alpha}$ changes on shorter timeintervals of order &lt; 10ks), and equivalent width which anticorrelates with thecontinuum flux, and reflection fraction. flux-correlated studies point atpossible ionization signatures, while detailed spectral analysis of short timeintervals surrounding flare events hint tentatively at observed spectralresponses to the flare. we present a simple model for partial ionization wherethe bulk of the variability comes from within 6r_g. temporal analysis furtherprovides evidence for possible time (&lt; 1000s) and phase (phi~0.6 rad) lags.finally, we report an apparent break in the power density spectrum (~ 4-5 x10^{-6}hz) and a possible 33 hr period. estimates for the mass of the blackhole in mcg-6-30-15 are discussed in the context of spectral and temporalfindings.

astro-ph;9910361	new x-ray constraints on starburst and seyfert activity in the barred  spiral galaxy ngc 1672	the nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc 1672 shows dramatic starburst activityand may also host a seyfert 2 nucleus. we present new x-ray observations thatset constraints on starburst and seyfert activity in ngc 1672. two rosat hriexposures, taken in 1992 and 1997, are used to investigate long-termvariability of the known x-ray sources and to search for new sources of x-rayemission. we find large-amplitude (about 69%) variability from x-3, one of theoff-nuclear sources located near an end of the galactic bar. x-3 has a peakobserved 0.2-2.0 kev luminosity of about 2.5 x 10^{39} erg/s, and it isprobably a luminous x-ray binary or young supernova remnant. we do not observevariability of the nuclear source x-1 or the strong off-nuclear source x-2. ouranalyses also reveal two new off-nuclear sources, one of which is associatedwith a bright region along a spiral arm, and we find evidence for large-scalediffuse x-ray emission throughout part of the disk of ngc 1672. furthermore, weuse asca data taken in 1995 to constrain the hard x-ray properties of ngc 1672.while the nuclear source x-1 is the dominant soft x-ray source in ngc 1672, wefind that the bulk of the 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev emission is spatiallycoincident with the off-nuclear source x-3, giving it an apparent 0.2-8 kevluminosity of about 6 x 10^{39} erg/s. a power-law plus raymond-smith modelprovides an acceptable fit to the full-band asca spectra. we do not find anyevidence for a luminous but absorbed nuclear x-ray source. if there is aluminous seyfert 2 nucleus in ngc 1672, it must be obscured by a`compton-thick' torus with a column density of &gt; 2 x 10^{24} cm^{-2}.

astro-ph;9911521	zw 1718.1-0108: a highly disturbed galaxy cluster at low galactic  latitude	we report the discovery of highly distorted x-ray emission associated withthe nearby cluster zw1718.1-0108, one of whose dominant members is the powerfulradio galaxy 3c353. this cluster has been missed by previous x-ray clustersurveys because of its low galactic latitude (b = 19.5deg), despite itsbrightness in the hard x-ray band (2-10 kev flux of 1.2e-11 erg/s/cm2). ouroptical ccd image of the central part of the cluster reveals many membergalaxies which are dimmed substantially by heavy galactic extinction. we havemeasured redshifts of three bright galaxies near the x-ray emission peak andthey are all found to be around z=0.028. the asca gis and rosat hri images showthree aligned x-ray clumps embedded in low surface-brightness x-ray emissionextended by about 30 arcmin. the averaged temperature measured with asca iskt=4.3+/-0.2 kev, which appears to be hot for the bolometric luminosity 1.1e+44erg/s, when compared to the temperature-luminosity correlation of galaxyclusters. the irregular x-ray morphology and evidence for a non-uniformtemperature distribution suggest that the system is undergoing a merger ofsubstructures. since the sizes and luminosities of the individual clumps areconsistent with those of galaxy groups, zw1718.1-0108 is interpreted as anon-going merger of galaxy groups in a dark matter halo forming a cluster ofgalaxies and thus is in a transition phase of cluster formation.

0812.1652	the xmm-newton view of agn with intermediate mass black holes	we have observed with xmm-newton four radiatively efficient active type 1galaxies with black hole masses &lt; 10^6 msun, selected optically from the sdss.we show here that their soft x-ray spectrum exhibits a soft excess with thesame characteristics as that observed ubiquitously in radio-quiet seyfert 1galaxies and type 1 quasars, both in terms of temperatures and strength.however, even when the soft x-ray excess is modelled with a pure thermal disc,its luminosity turns out to be much lower than that expected from accretiontheory for the given temperature, casting further doubts on a thermalinterpretation for soft excesses. while alternative scenarios for the nature ofthe soft excess (namely smeared ionized absorption and disc reflection) cannotbe distinguished on a pure statistical basis, we point out that the absorptionmodel produces a strong correlation between absorbing column density andionization state, which may be difficult to interpret and is most likelyspurious. as for reflection, it does only invoke standard ingredients of anyaccretion model for radiatively efficient sources such as a hard x-rays sourceand a relatively cold (though partially ionized) accretion disc, and thereforeseems the natural choice to explain the soft excess in most (if not all) cases.the reflection model is also consistent with the additional presence of athermal disc component with the theoretically expected temperature (although,again, with smaller-than-expected total luminosity). the observed activegalaxies are among the most variable in x-rays and their excess variance isamong the largest. this is in line with their relatively small black hole massand with expectations from simple power spectra models.
