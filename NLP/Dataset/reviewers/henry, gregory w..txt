0704.1191	five intermediate-period planets from the n2k sample	we report the detection of five jovian mass planets orbiting high metallicitystars. four of these stars were first observed as part of the n2k program andexhibited low rms velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.however, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal thepresence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days toa few years. hd 11506 is a g0v star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a3.85 year orbit. hd 17156 is a g0v star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 dayorbit. the eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for aplanet with a relatively short period. the orbital period for this planetplaces it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have beendetected. hd 125612 is a g3v star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4year orbit. hd 170469 is a g5iv star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a3.13 year orbit. hd 231701 is an f8v star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142day orbit. all of these stars have supersolar metallicity. three of the fivestars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightnessvariability. a transit search conducted for hd 17156 was negative but coveredonly 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

0903.0652	a search for multi-planet systems using the hobby-eberly telescope	extrasolar multiple-planet systems provide valuable opportunities for testingtheories of planet formation and evolution. the architectures of the knownmultiple-planet systems demonstrate a fascinating level of diversity, whichmotivates the search for additional examples of such systems in order to betterconstrain their formation and dynamical histories. here we describe acomprehensive investigation of 22 planetary systems in an effort to answerthree questions: 1) are there additional planets? 2) where could additionalplanets reside in stable orbits? and 3) what limits can these observationsplace on such objects? we find no evidence for additional bodies in any ofthese systems; indeed, these new data do not support three previously announcedplanets (hd 20367b: udry et al. 2003, hd 74156d: bean et al. 2008, and 47 umac: fischer et al. 2002). the dynamical simulations show that nearly all of the22 systems have large regions in which additional planets could exist in stableorbits. the detection-limit computations indicate that this study is sensitiveto close-in neptune-mass planets for most of the systems targeted. we concludewith a discussion on the implications of these non-detections.

0908.1705	refined stellar, orbital and planetary parameters of the eccentric  hat-p-2 planetary system	we present refined parameters for the extrasolar planetary system hat-p-2(also known as hd 147506), based on new radial velocity and photometric data.hat-p-2b is a transiting extrasolar planet that exhibits an eccentric orbit. wepresent a detailed analysis of the planetary and stellar parameters, yieldingconsistent results for the mass and radius of the star, better constraints onthe orbital eccentricity, and refined planetary parameters. the improvedparameters for the host star are m_star = 1.36 +/- 0.04 m_sun and r_star = 1.64+/- 0.08 r_sun, while the planet has a mass of m_p = 9.09 +/- 0.24 m_jup andradius of r_p = 1.16 +/- 0.08 r_jup. the refined transit epoch and period forthe planet are e = 2,454,387.49375 +/- 0.00074 (bjd) and p = 5.6334729 +/-0.0000061 (days), and the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are e= 0.5171 +/- 0.0033 and omega = 185.22 +/- 0.95 degrees. these orbital elementsallow us to predict the timings of secondary eclipses with a reasonableaccuracy of ~15 minutes. we also discuss the effects of this significanteccentricity including the characterization of the asymmetry in the transitlight curve. simple formulae are presented for the above, and these, in turn,can be used to constrain the orbital eccentricity using purely photometricdata. these will be particularly useful for very high precision, space-borneobservations of transiting planets.

0908.1977	the 8 micron phase variation of the hot saturn hd 149026b	we monitor the star hd 149026 and its saturn-mass planet at 8.0 micron overslightly more than half an orbit using the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. we find an increase of 0.0227% +/- 0.0066% (3.4 sigmasignificance) in the combined planet-star flux during this interval. theminimum flux from the planet is 45% +/- 19% of the maximum planet flux,corresponding to a difference in brightness temperature of 480 +/- 140 kbetween the two hemispheres. we derive a new secondary eclipse depth of 0.0411%+/- 0.0076% in this band, corresponding to a dayside brightness temperature of1440 +/- 150 k. our new secondary eclipse depth is half that of a previousmeasurement (3.0 sigma difference) in this same bandpass by harrington et al.(2007). we re-fit the harrington et al. (2007) data and obtain a comparablygood fit with a smaller eclipse depth that is consistent with our new value. incontrast to earlier claims, our new eclipse depth suggests that this planet'sdayside emission spectrum is relatively cool, with an 8 micron brightnesstemperature that is less than the maximum planet-wide equilibrium temperature.we measure the interval between the transit and secondary eclipse and find thatthat the secondary eclipse occurs 20.9 +7.2 / -6.5 minutes earlier (2.9 sigma)than predicted for a circular orbit, a marginally significant result. thiscorresponds to e*cos(omega) = -0.0079 +0.0027 / -0.0025 where e is the planet'sorbital eccentricity and omega is the argument of pericenter.

0912.2716	a long-period planet orbiting a nearby sun-like star	the doppler wobble induced by the extra-solar planet hd 134987b was firstdetected by data from the keck telescope nearly a decade ago, and wassubsequently confirmed by data from the anglo-australian telescope. however, asmore data have been acquired for this star over the years since, the quality ofa single keplerian fit to that data has been getting steadily worse. the bestfit single keplerian to the 138 keck and aat observations now in hand has anroot-mean-square (rms) scatter of 6.6 m/s. this is significantly in excess ofboth the instrumental precision achieved by both the keck and anglo-australianplanet searches for stars of this magnitude, and of the jitter expected for astar with the properties of hd134987. however, a double keplerian (i.e. dualplanet) fit delivers a significantly reduced rms of 3.3 m/s. the best-fitdouble planet solution has minimum planet masses of 1.59 and 0.82mjup, orbitalperiods of 258 and 5000d, and eccentricities of 0.23 and 0.12 respectively. wefind evidence that activity-induced jitter is a significant factor in our fitsand do not find evidence for asteroseismological p-modes. we also present sevenyears of photometry at a typical precision of 0.003mag with the t8 0.8mautomatic photometric telescope at fairborn observatory. these observations donot detect photometric variability and support the inference that the detectedradial-velocity periods are due to planetary mass companions rather than due tophotospheric spots and plages.

1109.2955	a high eccentricity component in the double planet system around hd  163607 and a planet around hd 164509	we report the detection of three new exoplanets from keck observatory. hd163607 is a metal-rich g5iv star with two planets. the inner planet has anobserved orbital period of 75.29 $\pm$ 0.02 days, a semi-amplitude of 51.1$\pm$ 1.4 \ms, an eccentricity of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.02 and a derived minimum mass of\msini = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.02 \mjup. this is the largest eccentricity of any knownplanet in a multi-planet system. the argument of periastron passage is 78.7$\pm$ 2.0$^{\circ}$; consequently, the planet's closest approach to its parentstar is very near the line of sight, leading to a relatively high transitprobability of 8%. the outer planet has an orbital period of 3.60 $\pm$ 0.02years, an orbital eccentricity of 0.12 $\pm$ 0.06 and a semi-amplitude of 40.4$\pm$ 1.3 \ms. the minimum mass is \msini = 2.29 $\pm$ 0.16 \mjup. hd 164509 isa metal-rich g5v star with a planet in an orbital period of 282.4 $\pm$ 3.8days and an eccentricity of 0.26 $\pm$ 0.14. the semi-amplitude of 14.2 $\pm$2.7 \ms\ implies a minimum mass of 0.48 $\pm$ 0.09 \mjup. the radial velocitiesof hd 164509 also exhibit a residual linear trend of -5.1 $\pm$ 0.7 \ms\ peryear, indicating the presence of an additional longer period companion in thesystem. photometric observations demonstrate that hd 163607 and hd 164509 areconstant in brightness to sub-millimag levels on their radial velocity periods.this provides strong support for planetary reflex motion as the cause of theradial velocity variations.

1109.4634	the stellar activity-rotation relationship and the evolution of stellar  dynamos	we present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with x-ray luminositiesand rotation periods. this is used to study the relationship between rotationand stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time.from an unbiased subset of this sample the power law slope of the unsaturatedregime, l_x / l_bol = ro^\beta, is fit as \beta = -2.70 +/- 0.13. this isinconsistent with the canonical \beta=-2 slope to a confidence of 5 sigma, andargues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. from a simplescaling analysis this implies \delta\omega / \omega = \omega^0.7, i.e. thedifferential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down.super-saturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and itsparametric dependencies are explored. significant correlations are found withboth the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theoryproviding a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. weestimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation andsuper-saturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. late f-typestars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straightfrom super-saturated to unsaturated x-ray emission. the theoretical thresholdfor coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empiricalsaturation threshold (ro &lt; 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. instead wesuggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars withsaturated coronal emission. this is supported by a correlation between theempirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition betweenconvective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.

1110.1104	surprising variations in the rotation of the chemically peculiar stars  cu virginis and v901 orionis	cu vir and v901 ori belong among these few magnetic chemically peculiar starswhose rotation periods vary on timescales of decades. we aim to study thestability of the periods in cu vir and v901 ori using all accessibleobservational data containing phase information. we collected all availablerelevant archived observations supplemented with our new measurements of thesestars and analysed the period variations of the stars using a novel method thatallows for the combination of data of diverse sorts. we found that the shapesof their phase curves were constant, while the periods were changing. bothstars exhibit alternating intervals of rotational braking and acceleration. therotation period of cu vir was gradually shortening until the year 1968, when itreached its local minimum of 0.52067198 d. the period then started increasing,reaching its local maximum of 0.5207163 d in the year 2005. since that time therotation has begun to accelerate again. we also found much smaller periodchanges in cu vir on a timescale of several years. the rotation period of v901ori was increasing for the past quarter-century, reaching a maximum of 1.538771d in the year 2003, when the rotation period began to decrease. a theoreticallyunexpected alternating variability of rotation periods in these stars wouldremove the spin-down time paradox and brings a new insight into structure andevolution of magnetic upper-main-sequence stars.

1209.4394	rotational and cyclical variability in gamma cassiopeiae. ii. fifteen  seasons	the b0.5ive star gam cas is of great interest because it is the prototype ofa small group of classical be stars having hard x-ray emission of unknownorigin. we discuss results from ongoing b and v observations of the gam casstar-disk system acquired with an apt during the observing seasons 1997-2011.in an earlier study, smith, henry, &amp; vishniac showed that light variations ingam cas are dominated by a series of comparatively prominent cycles withamplitudes of 0.02-0.03 mag and lengths of 2-3 months, superimposed on a1.21-day periodic signal some five times smaller, which they attributed torotation. the cycle lengths clustered around 70 days. changes in both cyclelength and amplitude were observed from year to year. these authors also foundthe v-band cycles to be 30-40% larger than the b-band cycles. in the presentstudy we find continued evidence for these variability patterns and for thebimodal distribution of the b/v amplitude ratios in the long cycles. during the2010 observing season, gam cas underwent a mass loss event (outburst), asevidenced by the brightening and reddening seen in our new photometry. thisepisode coincided with a waning of the amplitude in the ongoing cycle. the beoutburst ended the following year, and the light-curve amplitude returned topre-outburst levels. this behavior reinforces the interpretation that cyclesarise from a global disk instability. remarkably, we also find that both theamplitude and the asymmetry of the rotational waveform changed over the years.we review arguments for this modulation arising from transits of a surfacemagnetic disturbance. finally, to a limit of 5 mmag, we find no evidence forany photometric variation corresponding to the gam cas binary period, 203.55days, or to the first few harmonics.

1304.4144	multiperiodicity, modulations and flip-flops in variable star light  curves ii. analysis of ii peg photometry during 1979-2010	according to earlier doppler images of the magnetically active primary giantcomponent of the rs cvn binary ii peg, the surface of the star was dominated byone single active longitude that was clearly drifting in the rotational frameof the binary system during 1994-2002; later imaging for 2004-2010, however,showed decreased and chaotic spot activity, with no signs of the drift pattern.here we set out to investigate from a more extensive photometric datasetwhether such a drift is a persistent phenomenon, in which case it could be dueto either an azimuthal dynamo wave or an indication of the binary systemorbital synchronization still being incomplete. we analyse the datasets usingthe carrier fit method (hereafter cf), especially suitable for analyzing timeseries in which a fast clocking frequency (such as the rotation of the star) ismodulated with a slower process (such as the stellar activity cycle). wecombine all collected photometric data into one single data set, and analyze itwith the cf method. as a result, we confirm the earlier results of the spotactivity having been dominated by one primary spotted region almost through theentire data set, and the existence of a persistent, nearly linear drift.disruptions of the linear trend and complicated phase behavior are also seen,but the period analysis reveals a rather stable periodicity withp(spot)=6.71054d plus/minus 0.00005d. after the linear trend is removed fromthe data, we identify several abrupt phase jumps, three of which are analyzedin more detail with the cf method. these phase jumps closely resemble what iscalled flip-flop event, but the new spot configurations do not, in most cases,persist for longer than a few months.

0802.1705	multi-wavelength constraints on the day-night circulation patterns of hd  189733b	we present new spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot jupiterhd 189733b in the mips 24 micron bandpass, spanning the same part of theplanet's orbit as our previous observations in the irac 8 micron bandpass(knutson et al. 2007). we find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux fromthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this correspondsto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-48 k and 1220 +/- 47 k, respectively. the planet reaches its maximum flux at anorbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30degrees east of the substellar point. because tidally locked hot jupiters wouldhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, thesmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet'satmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the nightside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperaturedifferences. the similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for hd189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in afundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these twowavelengths. one-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8micron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. ifthese two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that thetemperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence thatthe atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.

1504.05586	a detection of water in the transmission spectrum of the hot jupiter  wasp-12b and implications for its atmospheric composition	detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements oftheir atmospheric properties that constrain the planets' origins and evolution.for example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hotjupiter wasp-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygenratio (c/o $&gt;$ 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than iscommonly assumed for giant planets. here we report a precise near-infraredtransmission spectrum for wasp-12b based on six transit observations with thehubble space telescope/wide field camera 3. we bin the data in 13spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 - 1.67 $\mu$m and measure the transitdepths to a median precision of 51 ppm. we retrieve the atmospheric propertiesusing the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption(7$\sigma$ confidence). this detection marks the first high-confidence,spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of wasp-12b. theretrieved 1$\sigma$ water volume mixing ratio is between $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$,which is consistent with c/o $&gt;$ 1 to within 2$\sigma$. however, we alsointroduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for c/o and metallicityunder the assumption of chemical equilibrium. with this approach, we constrainc/o to $0.5^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ at $1\,\sigma$ and rule out a carbon-rich atmospherecomposition (c/o$&gt;1$) at $&gt;3\sigma$ confidence. further observations andmodeling of the planet's global thermal structure and dynamics would aid inresolving the tension between our inferred c/o and previous constraints. ourfindings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data withmultiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on thechemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.

1505.01063	xo-2b: a hot jupiter with a variable host star that potentially affects  its measured transit depth	the transiting hot jupiter xo-2b is an ideal target for multi-objectphotometry and spectroscopy as it has a relatively bright ($v$-mag = 11.25) k0vhost star (xo-2n) and a large planet-to-star contrast ratio(r$_{p}$/r$_{s}\approx0.015$). it also has a nearby (31.21") binary stellarcompanion (xo-2s) of nearly the same brightness ($v$-mag = 11.20) and spectraltype (g9v), allowing for the characterization and removal of shared systematicerrors (e.g., airmass brightness variations). we have therefore conducted amultiyear (2012--2015) study of xo-2b with the university of arizona's 61"(1.55~m) kuiper telescope and mont4k ccd in the bessel u and harris bphotometric passbands to measure its rayleigh scattering slope to place upperlimits on the pressure-dependent radius at, e.g., 10~bar. such measurements areneeded to constrain its derived molecular abundances from primary transitobservations. we have also been monitoring xo-2n since the 2013--2014 winterseason with tennessee state university's celestron-14 (0.36~m) automatedimaging telescope to investigate stellar variability, which could affectxo-2b's transit depth. our observations indicate that xo-2n is variable,potentially due to {cool star} spots, {with a peak-to-peak amplitude of $0.0049\pm 0.0007$~r-mag and a period of $29.89 \pm 0.16$~days for the 2013--2014observing season and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $0.0035 \pm 0.0007$~r-mag and$27.34 \pm 0.21$~day period for the 2014--2015 observing season. because of}the likely influence of xo-2n's variability on the derivation of xo-2b'stransit depth, we cannot bin multiple nights of data to decrease ouruncertainties, preventing us from constraining its gas abundances. this studydemonstrates that long-term monitoring programs of exoplanet host stars arecrucial for understanding host star variability.

1507.03611	sun-like magnetic cycles in the rapidly-rotating young solar analog hd  30495	a growing body of evidence suggests that multiple dynamo mechanisms can drivemagnetic variability on different timescales, not only in the sun but also inother stars. many solar activity proxies exhibit a quasi-biennial ($\sim$2year) variation, which is superimposed upon the dominant 11 year cycle. awell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationshipsbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long andshort cycles simultaneously. within this sample, the solar cycle periods aretypical of a more rapidly rotating star, implying that the sun might be in atransitional state or that it has an unusual evolutionary history. in thiswork, we present new and archival observations of dual magnetic cycles in theyoung solar analog hd 30495, an $\sim$1 gyr-old g1.5v star with a rotationperiod near 11 days. this star falls squarely on the relationships establishedby the broader stellar sample, with short-period variations at $\sim$1.7 yearsand a long cycle of $\sim$12 years. we measure three individual long-periodcycles and find durations ranging from 9.6-15.5 years. we find the short-termvariability to be intermittent, but present throughout the majority of the timeseries, though its occurrence and amplitude are uncorrelated with the longercycle. these essentially solar-like variations occur in a sun-like star withmore rapid rotation, though surface differential rotation measurements leaveopen the possibility of a solar equivalence.

1512.04341	a continuum from clear to cloudy hot-jupiter exoplanets without  primordial water depletion	thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectralanalysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number ofexoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1to 1.7 {\mu}m). recent studies show that some hot-jupiter exoplanets have muchweaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted.the low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low waterabundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetarydisk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this levelof depletion can actually occur. alternatively, these weak signals could be theresult of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra.here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot jupiters coveringthe wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both theoptical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. ourresults reveal a diverse group of hot jupiters that exhibit a continuum fromclear to cloudy atmospheres. we find that the difference between the planetaryradius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric fordistinguishing different atmosphere types. the difference correlates with thespectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen inclear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with cloudsand hazes. this result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion duringformation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weakerspectral signatures.
