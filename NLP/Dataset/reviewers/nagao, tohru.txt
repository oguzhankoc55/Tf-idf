0901.3388	a search for molecular gas toward a bzk-selected star-forming galaxy at  z = 2.044	we present a search for co(3-2) emission in sdf-26821, a bzk-selectedstar-forming galaxy (sbzk) at z = 2.044, using the 45-m telescope of thenobeyama radio observatory and the nobeyama millimeter array. we do not detectsignificant emission and derive 2 \sigma limits: the co luminosity of l'co &lt;3.1 x 10^10 k km s^{-1} pc^{-2}, the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to columinosity of l_fir/l'co &gt; 57 lsun (k km s^{-1} pc^{-2})^{-1}, and themolecular gas mass of m_h2 &lt; 2.5 x 10^10 msun, assuming a velocity width of 200km s^{-1} and a co-to-h2 conversion factor of alpha_co=0.8 msun (k km s^{-1}pc^{-2})^{-1}. the ratio of l_fir/l'co, a measure of star formation efficiency(sfe), is comparable to or higher than the two z ~ 1.5 sbzks detected inco(2-1) previously, suggesting that sbzks can have a wide range of sfes.comparisons of far-infrared luminosity, gas mass, and stellar mass among thesbzks suggest that sdf-26821 is at an earlier stage of forming stars with asimilar sfe and/or more efficiently forming stars than the two z ~ 1.5 sbzks.the higher sfes and specific star formation rates of the sbzks compared tolocal spirals are indicative of the difference in star formation modes betweenthese systems, suggesting that sbzks are not just scaled-up versions of localspirals.

0905.1123	observational limits on type 1 agn accretion rate in cosmos	we present black hole masses and accretion rates for 182 type 1 agn incosmos. we estimate masses using the scaling relations for the broad hb, mgii,and civ emission lines in the redshift ranges 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.88, 1&lt;z&lt;2.4, and2.7&lt;z&lt;4.9. we estimate the accretion rate using an eddington ratio l_i/l_eddestimated from optical and x-ray data. we find that very few type 1 agn accretebelow l_i/l_edd ~ 0.01, despite simulations of synthetic spectra which showthat the survey is sensitive to such type 1 agn. at lower accretion rates theblr may become obscured, diluted or nonexistent. we find evidence that type 1agn at higher accretion rates have higher optical luminosities, as more oftheir emission comes from the cool (optical) accretion disk with respect toshorter wavelengths. we measure a larger range in accretion rate than previousworks, suggesting that cosmos is more efficient at finding low accretion ratetype 1 agn. however the measured range in accretion rate is still comparable tothe intrinsic scatter from the scaling relations, suggesting that type 1 agnaccrete at a narrow range of eddington ratio, with l_i/l_edd ~ 0.1.

0905.1581	chemical evolution of high-redshift radio galaxies	we present new deep optical spectra of 9 high-z radio galaxies (hzrgs) at z &gt;2.7 obtained with fors2 on vlt. these rest-frame ultraviolet spectra are usedto infer the metallicity of the narrow-line regions (nlrs) in order toinvestigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in high-z universe. we focusmainly on the civ/heii and ciii]/civ flux ratios that are sensitive to gasmetallicity and ionization parameter. although the nv emission has been widelyused to infer the gas metallicity, it is often too weak to be measuredaccurately for nlrs. by combining our new spectra with data from theliterature, we examine the possible redshift evolution of the nlr metallicityfor 57 hzrgs at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4. based on the comparison between the observedemission-line flux ratios and the results of our photoionization modelcalculations, we find no significant metallicity evolution in nlrs of hzrgs, upto z ~ 4. our results imply that massive galaxies had almost completed theirchemical evolution at much higher redshift (z &gt; 5). finally, although we detectstrong nv emission lines in 5 hzrgs at z &gt; 2.7, we point out that high nv/heiiratios are not indicative of high metallicities but correspond to highionization parameters of gas clouds in nlrs.

0910.2672	the nature of optically dull active galactic nuclei in cosmos	we present infrared, optical, and x-ray data of 48 x-ray bright, opticallydull agns in the cosmos field. these objects exhibit the x-ray luminosity of anactive galactic nucleus (agn) but lack broad and narrow emission lines in theiroptical spectrum. we show that despite the lack of optical emission lines, mostof these optically dull agns are not well-described by a typical passive redgalaxy spectrum: instead they exhibit weak but significant blue emission likean unobscured agn. photometric observations over several years additionallyshow significant variability in the blue emission of four optically dull agns.the nature of the blue and infrared emission suggest that the opticallyinactive appearance of these agns cannot be caused by obscuration intrinsic tothe agns. instead, up to ~70% of optically dull agns are diluted by theirhosts, with bright or simply edge-on hosts lying preferentially within thespectroscopic aperture. the remaining ~30% of optically dull agns haveanomalously high f_x/f_o ratios and are intrinsically weak, not obscured, inthe optical. these optically dull agns are best described as a weakly accretingagn with a truncated accretion disk from a radiatively inefficient accretionflow.

1011.5811	the mass-metallicity relation of sdss quasars	active galactic nuclei (agns) are characterized by a clear correlationbetween luminosity and metallicity (l_agn-z_agn relation). the origin of thiscorrelation is not clear. it may result from a relation between the black holemass (m_bh) and metallicity, or from a relation between the accretion rate(l/l_edd) and metallicity. to investigate the origin of the l_agn-z_agnrelation, we use optical spectra of 2383 quasars at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 from thesloan digital sky survey. by using this data set, we have constructed compositespectra of 33 subsamples in intervals of both m_bh and l/l_edd. from thesecomposite spectra we measure emission-line flux ratios that are sensitive tothe metallicity of the broad line region (blr); specifically, nv/civ, nv/heii,(siiv+oiv])/civ, and aliii/civ. we find that there is a significant correlationbetween m_bh and z_blr as inferred from all four metallicity-sensitiveemission-line flux ratios. this result strongly suggests that the observedl_agn-z_agn relation is mostly a consequence of the m_bh-z_agn relation. therelation between m_bh and z_blr is likely a consequence of both the m_bh-m_bulrelation and of the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxy. we also findthat l/l_edd correlates with the emission line flux ratios involving nv (morespecifically, nv/civ and nv/heii), while it does not correlate with the othertwo metallicity sensitive emission line flux ratios, i.e., (siiv+oiv])/civ andaliii/civ. these correlations indicate that the emission-line flux ratiosinvolving nv depend on both metallicity and relative abundance of nitrogen. wesuggest that the relation between l/l_edd and those line ratios involvingnitrogen, is caused by a delay of the black hole accretion rate relative to theonset of nuclear star formation of about 10^8 years, which is the timescalerequired for the nitrogen enrichment.

1012.2471	metallicity diagnostics with infrared fine-structure lines	although measuring the gas metallicity in galaxies at various redshifts iscrucial to constrain galaxy evolutionary scenarios, only rest-frame opticalemission lines have been generally used to measure the metallicity. this hasprevented us to accurately measure the metallicity of dust-obscured galaxies,and accordingly to understand the chemical evolution of dusty populations, suchas ultraluminous infrared galaxies. here we propose diagnostics of the gasmetallicity based on infrared fine structure emission lines, which are nearlyunaffected by dust extinction even the most obscured systems. specifically, wefocus on fine-structure lines arising mostly from hii regions, not inphoto-dissociation regions, to minimize the dependence and uncertainties of themetallicity diagnostics from various physical parameters. based onphotoionization models, we show that the emission-line flux ratio of([oiii]51.80+[oiii]88.33)/[niii]57.21 is an excellent tracer of the gasmetallicity. the individual line ratios [oiii]51.80/[niii]57.21 or[oiii]88.33/[niii]57.21 can also be used as diagnostics of the metallicity, butthey suffer a stronger dependence on the gas density. the line ratios[oiii]88.33/[oiii]51.80 and [nii]121.7/[niii]57.21 can be used to measure and,therefore, account for the dependences on the of the gas density and ionizationparameter, respectively. we show that these diagnostic fine-structure lines aredetectable with herschel in luminous infrared galaxies out z=0.4. metallicitymeasurements with these fine-structure lines will be feasible at relativelyhigh redshift (z=1 or more) with spica, the future infrared space observatory.

1102.4621	spectropolarimetric evidence for radiatively inefficient accretion in an  optically dull active galaxy	we present subaru/focas spectropolarimetry of two active galaxies in thecosmic evolution survey. these objects were selected to be optically dull, withthe bright x-ray emission of an agn but missing optical emission lines in ourprevious spectroscopy. our new observations show that one target has very weakemission lines consistent with an optically dull agn, while the other objecthas strong emission lines typical of a host-diluted type 2 seyfert galaxy. inneither source do we observe polarized emission lines, with 3-sigma upperlimits of p_blr &lt; 2%. this means that the missing broad emission lines (andweaker narrow emission lines) are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration,e.g., by the canonical agn torus. the weak-lined optically dull agn exhibits ablue polarized continuum with p = 0.78 +/- 0.07% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 7200a (p = 1.37 +/- 0.16% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 5050 a). the wavelengthdependence of this polarized flux is similar to that of an unobscured agncontinuum and represents the intrinsic agn emission, either as synchrotronemission or the outer part of an accretion disk reflected by a clumpy dustscatterer. because this intrinsic agn emission lacks emission lines, thissource is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

1103.0276	accretion rate and the physical nature of unobscured active galaxies	we show how accretion rate governs the physical properties of a sample ofunobscured broad-line, narrow-line, and lineless active galactic nuclei (agns).we avoid the systematic errors plaguing previous studies of agn accretion rateby using accurate accretion luminosities (l_int) from well-sampledmultiwavelength seds from the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), and accurateblack hole masses derived from virial scaling relations (for broad-line agns)or host-agn relations (for narrow-line and lineless agns). in general, broademission lines are present only at the highest accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &gt;0.01), and these rapidly accreting agns are observed as broad-line agns orpossibly as obscured narrow-line agns. narrow-line and lineless agns at lowerspecific accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01) are unobscured and yet lack abroad line region. the disappearance of the broad emission lines is caused byan expanding radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf) at the inner radiusof the accretion disk. the presence of the riaf also drives l_int/l_edd &lt; 10^-2narrow-line and lineless agns to 10 times higher ratios of radio to optical/uvemission than l_int/l_edd &gt; 0.01 broad-line agns, since the unbound nature ofthe riaf means it is easier to form a radio outflow. the ir torus signaturealso tends to become weaker or disappear from l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01 agns, althoughthere may be additional mid-ir synchrotron emission associated with the riaf.together these results suggest that specific accretion rate is an importantphysical "axis" of agn unification, described by a simple model.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1104.5019	a census of star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3 in the subaru deep field	several uv and near-infrared color selection methods have identified galaxiesat z = 1-3. since each method suffers from selection biases, we have appliedthree leading techniques (lyman break, bx/bm, and bzk selection) simultaneouslyin the subaru deep field. this field has reliable ({\delta}z/(1 + z) =0.02--0.09) photometric redshifts for ~53,000 galaxies from 20 bands(1500{\aa}--2.2{\mu}m). the bzk, lbg, and bx/bm samples suffer contaminationfrom z&lt;1 interlopers of 6%, 8%, and 20%, respectively. around the redshiftswhere it is most sensitive (z~1.9 for star-forming bzk, z~1.8 for z~2 lbgs,z~1.6 for bm, and z~2.3 for bx), each technique finds 60-80% of the census ofthe three methods. in addition, each of the color techniques shares 75-96% ofits galaxies with another method, which is consistent with previous studiesthat adopt identical criteria on magnitudes and colors. combining the threesamples gives a comprehensive census that includes ~90% of z-phot = 1-3galaxies, using standard magnitude limits similar to previous studies. in fact,we find that among z = 1-2.5 galaxies in the color selection census, 81-90% ofthem can be selected by just combining the bzk selection with one of the uvtechniques (z~2 lbg or bx and bm). the average galaxy stellar mass, reddeningand sfrs all decrease systematically from the sbzk population to the lbgs, andto the bx/bms. the combined color selections yield a total cosmic sfr densityof 0.18 $\pm$ 0.03 m_sun yr^{-1} mpc^{-3} for k_ab &lt;= 24. we find that 65% ofthe star formation is in galaxies with e(b-v) &gt; 0.25 mag, even though they areonly one-fourth of the census by number.

1112.2260	the role of galaxy interaction in environmental dependence of the star  formation activity at z~1.2	in order to understand environmental effects on star formation inhigh-redshift galaxies, we investigate the physical relationships between thestar formation activity, stellar mass, and environment for z ~1.2 galaxies inthe 2 deg^2 cosmos field. we estimate star formation using the [oii] emissionline and environment from the local galaxy density. our analysis shows that formassive galaxies m_*&gt;10^10 m_sun, the fraction of [oii] emitters inhigh-density environments is 1.7 times higher than in low-density environments,while the [oii] emitter fraction does not depend on environment for low-massm_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun galaxies. in order to understand what drives these trends, weinvestigate the role of companion galaxies in our sample. we find that thefraction of [oii] emitters in galaxies with companions is 2.4 times as high asthat in galaxies without companions at m_* &gt; 10^10 m_sun. in addition, massivegalaxies are more likely to have companions in high-density environments.however, although the "number" of star forming galaxies increases for massivegalaxies with close companions and in dense environments, the "average" starformation rate of star forming galaxies at a given mass is independent ofenvironment and the presence/absence of a close companion. these resultssuggest that interactions and/or mergers in high-density environment couldinduce star formation in massive galaxies at z~1.2, increasing the fraction ofstar-forming galaxies with m_* &gt; 10^10 m_sun.

1112.2403	stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 3	the stellar metallicity is a direct measure of the amount of metals presentin a galaxy, as a large part of the metals lie in its stars. in this paper weinvestigate new stellar metallicity indicators suitable for high-z galaxiesstudying the stellar photospheric absorption lines in the rest frameultraviolet, hence sampling predominantly young hot stars. we defined these newindicators based on the equivalent widths (ew) of selected features usingtheoretical spectra created with the evolutionary population synthesis codestarburts99. we used them to compute the stellar metallicity for a sample ofuv-selected galaxies at z &gt; 3 from the amaze survey using very deep (37h perobject) vlt/fors spectra. moreover, we applied the new metallicity indicatorsto eight additional high redshift galaxies found in literature. we thencompared stellar and gas-phase metallicities measured from the emission linesfor all these galaxies, finding that within the errors the two estimates are ingood agreement, with possible tendency to have stellar metallicities lower thanthe gas phase ones. for the first time, we are able to study the stellarmass-metallicity relation at z &gt; 3. we find that the metallicity of young, hotstars in galaxies at z \sim 3 have similar values of the aged stars in localsdss galaxies, contrary to what observed for the gas phase metallicity.

1203.1326	discovery of a protocluster at z~6	we report the discovery of a protocluster at z~6 containing at least eightcluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-fieldimage of the subaru deep field (sdf). the overdensity of the protocluster issignificant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density ofi'-dropout galaxies. the overdense region covers ~36 sq. arcmin, and includes30 i'-dropout galaxies. follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these arereal z~6 galaxies (5.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.3). eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrowredshift range centered at z=6.01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase innumber density over the average in redshift space. we found no significantdifference in the observed properties, such as ly-alpha luminosities and uvcontinuum magnitudes, between the eight protocluster members and the sevennon-members. the velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is 647km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standardcold dark matter model. this discrepancy could be attributed to thedistinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight protoclustermembers. we discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either theprotocluster is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is stillimmature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster. ineither case, this concentration of z=6.01 galaxies in the sdf may be one of thefirst sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe.

1205.4834	alma reveals a chemically evolved submillimeter galaxy at z=4.76	the chemical properties of high-z galaxies provide important information toconstrain galaxy evolutionary scenarios. however, widely-used metallicitydiagnostics based on rest-frame optical emission lines are not usable forheavily dust-enshrouded galaxies (such as sub-millimeter galaxies; smgs),especially at z&gt;3. here we focus on the flux ratio of the far-infraredfine-structure emission lines [nii]205um and [cii]158um to assess themetallicity of high-z smgs. through alma cycle 0 observations, we have detectedthe [nii]205um emission in a strongly [cii]-emitting smg, less j033229.4-275619at z=4.76. the velocity-integrated [nii]/[cii] flux ratio is 0.043 +/- 0.008.this is the first measurement of the [nii]/[cii] flux ratio in high-z galaxies,and the inferred flux ratio is similar to the ratio observed in the nearbyuniverse (~0.02-0.07). the velocity-integrated flux ratio and photoionizationmodels suggest that the metallicity in this smg is consistent with solar,implying the chemical evolution has progressed very rapidly in this system atz=4.76. we also obtain a tight upper limit on the co(12-11) transition, whichtranslates into co(12-11)/co(2-1) &lt;3.8 (3 sigma). this suggests that themolecular gas clouds in less j033229.4-275619 are not affected significantly bythe radiation field emitted by the agn in this system.

0712.3108	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) - v. optically faint variable  object survey	we present our survey for optically faint variable objects using multi-epoch(8-10 epochs over 2-4 years) $i'$-band imaging data obtained with subarusuprime-cam over 0.918 deg$^2$ in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf). wefound 1040 optically variable objects by image subtraction for all thecombinations of images at different epochs. this is the first statisticalsample of variable objects at depths achieved with 8-10m class telescopes orhst. the detection limit for variable components is $i'_{\rm{vari}}\sim25.5$mag. these variable objects were classified into variable stars, supernovae(sne), and active galactic nuclei (agn), based on the optical morphologies,magnitudes, colors, and optical-mid-infrared colors of the host objects,spatial offsets of variable components from the host objects, and light curves.detection completeness was examined by simulating light curves for periodic andirregular variability. we detected optical variability for $36\pm2%$ ($51\pm3%$for a bright sample with $i'&lt;24.4$ mag) of x-ray sources in the field. numberdensities of variable obejcts as functions of time intervals $\delta{t}$ andvariable component magnitudes $i'_{\rm{vari}}$ are obtained. number densitiesof variable stars, sne, and agn are 120, 489, and 579 objects deg$^{-2}$,respectively. bimodal distributions of variable stars in the color-magnitudediagrams indicate that the variable star sample consists of bright ($v\sim22$mag) blue variable stars of the halo population and faint ($v\sim23.5$ mag) redvariable stars of the disk population. there are a few candidates of rr lyraeproviding a possible number density of $\sim10^{-2}$ kpc$^{-3}$ at a distanceof $&gt;150$ kpc from the galactic center.

1307.7712	"direct" gas-phase metallicities, stellar properties, and local  environments of emission-line galaxies at redshift below 0.90	using deep narrow-band (nb) imaging and optical spectroscopy from the kecktelescope and mmt, we identify a sample of 20 emission-line galaxies (elgs) atz=0.065-0.90 where the weak auroral emission line, [oiii]4363, is detected at&gt;3\sigma. these detections allow us to determine the gas-phase metallicityusing the "direct'' method. with electron temperature measurements and dustattenuation corrections from balmer decrements, we find that 4 of theselow-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor with 12+log(o/h) &lt;= 7.65 orone-tenth solar. our most metal-deficient galaxy has 12+log(o/h) =7.24^{+0.45}_{-0.30} (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowestmetallicity galaxies identified in the local universe. we find that ourgalaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with average specificstar formation rate (sfr) of (100 myr)^{-1}, and that they have high centralsfr surface densities (average of 0.5 msun/yr/kpc^2. in addition, more thantwo-thirds of our galaxies have between one and four nearby companions within aprojected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is an excess among star-forminggalaxies at z=0.4-0.85. we also find that the gas-phase metallicities for agiven stellar mass and sfr lie systematically below the local m-z-(sfr)relation by \approx0.2 dex (2\sigma\ significance). these results are partlydue to selection effects, since galaxies with strong star formation and lowmetallicity are more likely to yield [oiii]4363 detections. finally, theobserved higher ionization parameter and electron density suggest that they arelower redshift analogs to typical z&gt;1 galaxies.

0802.2021	the effect of radiation pressure on virial black hole mass estimates and  the case of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies	we consider the effect of radiation pressure from ionizing photons on blackhole (bh) mass estimates based on the application of the virial theorem tobroad emission lines in agn spectra. bh masses based only on the virial productv^2r and neglecting the effect of radiation pressure can be severelyunderestimated especially in objects close to the eddington limit. we providean empirical calibration of the correction for radiation pressure and we showthat it is consistent with a simple physical model in which blr clouds areoptically thick to ionizing radiation and have average column densities ofnh~10^23 cm^-2. this value is remarkably similar to what is required instandard blr photoionization models to explain observed spectra. with theinclusion of radiation pressure the discrepancy between virial bh masses basedon single epoch spectra and on reverberation mapping data drops from 0.4 to 0.2dex rms. the use of single epoch observations as surrogates of reverberationmapping campaigns can thus provide more accurate bh masses than previouslythought. finally, we show that narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies haveapparently low bh masses because they are radiating close to their eddingtonlimit. after the radiation pressure correction, nls1 galaxies have bh massessimilar to other broad line agns and follow the same mbh-sigma/l relations asother active and normal galaxies. radiation forces arising from ionizing photonmomentum deposition constitute an important physical effect which must be takeninto account when computing virial bh masses.

0802.4123	a photometric survey for lyalpha-heii dual emitters: searching for  population iii stars in high-redshift galaxies	we present a new photometric search for high-z galaxies hosting populationiii (popiii) stars based on deep intermediate-band imaging observationsobtained in the subaru deep field (sdf), by using suprime-cam on the subarutelescope. by combining our new data with the existing broad-band andnarrow-band data, we searched for galaxies which emit strongly both in ly_alphaand in heii 1640 (``dual emitters'') that are promising candidates forpopiii-hosting galaxies, at 3.93&lt;z&lt;4.01 and 4.57&lt;z&lt;4.65. although we found 10``dual emitters'', most of them turn out to be [oii]-[oiii] dual emitters orh_beta-(h_alpha+[nii]) dual emitters at z&lt;1, as inferred from their broad-bandcolors and from the ratio of the equivalent widths. no convincing candidate ofly_alpha-heii dual emitter of sfr_popiii &gt; 2 msun/yr was found by ourphotometric search in 4.03 x 10^5 mpc^3 in the sdf. this result disfavors lowfeedback models for popiii star clusters, and implies an upper-limit of thepopiii sfr density of sfrd_popiii &lt; 5 x 10^-6 msun/yr/mpc^3. this new selectionmethod to search for popiii-hosting galaxies should be useful in futurenarrow-band surveys to achieve the first observational detection ofpopiii-hosting galaxies at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0003055	the high-ionization nuclear emission-line region of seyfert galaxies	recently murayama &amp; taniguchi proposed that a significant part of thehigh-ionization nuclear emission-line region (hiner) in seyfert nuclei arisesfrom the inner wall of dusty tori because type 1 seyfert nuclei (s1s) show theexcess hiner emission with respect to type 2 seyfert ones (s2s). this meansthat the radiation from the hiner has the anisotropic property and thusstatistical properties of the hiner emission can be used to investigate theviewing angle toward dusty tori for various types of seyfert nuclei. in orderto investigate viewing angles toward various types of seyferys, we apply thishiner test to them.  our main results are as follows. (1) the nls1s are viewed from a more face-onview toward dusty tori than the s2s. however, the hiner properties of the nls1sare indistinguishable from those of the s1s. (2) the type 1.5 seyferts appearto comprise heterogeneous populations. (3) the type 1.8 and 1.9 seyferts andthe objects showing either a broad pa_beta line or polarized broad balmer linesare seen from a large inclination angle and the emission from the blrs of suchobjects reaches us through optically-thin parts of dusty tori. these threeresults support strongly the current unified model of seyfert nuclei. and, (4)the line ratios of [fe x]6374 to the low-ionization emission-lines have ratherisotropic property than those of [fe vii]6087. therefore it is suggested thatthe [fe x] emission is not useful investigating the viewing angle toward thedusty torus in seyfert nuclei. the most plausible reason seems that the [fe x]emission is spatially extended and thus its strength tends to show less viewingangle dependence.

astro-ph;0107025	seyfert-type dependences of narrow emission-line ratios and physical  properties of high-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in seyfert  galaxies	in order to examine how narrow emission-line flux ratios depend on theseyfert type, we compiled various narrow emission-line flux ratios of 355seyfert galaxies from the literature. we present in this paper that theintensity of the high-ionization emission lines, [fe vii]6087, [fe x]6374 and[ne v]3426, tend to be stronger in seyfert 1 galaxies than in seyfert 2galaxies. in addition to these lines, [o iii]4363 and [ne iii]3869, whoseionization potentials are not high (&lt; 100 ev), but whose critical densities aresignificantly high (&gt; 10^7 cm^-3), also exhibit the same tendency. on the otherhand, the emission-line flux ratios among low-ionization emission lines do notshow such a tendency. we point out that the most plausible interpretation ofthese results is that the high-ionization emission lines arise mainly fromhighly-ionized, dense gas clouds, which are located very close to nuclei, andthus can be hidden by dusty tori. to examine the physical properties of thesehighly-ionized dense gas clouds, photoionization model calculations wereperformed. as a result, we find that the hydrogen density and the ionizationparameter of these highly-ionized dense gas clouds are constrained to be n_h &gt;10^6 cm^-3 and u &gt; 10^-2, respectively. these lower limits are almostindependent both from the metallicity of gas clouds and from the spectralenergy distribution of the nuclear ionizing radiation.

astro-ph;0110498	is there an advection-dominated accretion flow in radio galaxies with  double-peaked balmer lines?	in order to examine the prediction that the broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs)with double-peaked balmer lines harbor an accretion disk characterized by anadvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) in their nuclei, we investigatenarrow emission-line flux ratios of the narrow-line regions which arephotoionized by the nuclear continuum radiation. we compile data from theliterature and confirm the pioneering work of eracleous &amp; halpern that theblrgs with the double-peaked balmer emission exhibit larger flux ratios of both[o i]6300/[o iii]5007 and [o ii]3727/[o iii]5007 than the blrgs without thedouble-peaked balmer emission. to examine whether or not these properties areattributed to the difference in the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theionizing radiation between the blrgs with and without the double-peaked balmeremission, we perform photoionization model calculations using two types ofinput continuum radiation; one has the strong big blue bump which is expectedfor standard optically-thick accretion disks and another does not exhibit astrong big blue bump as expected for optically-thin adafs. we find that thedata of the blrgs with the double-peaked balmer lines are consistent with themodels adopting the sed without a strong big blue bump while the data of theblrgs without the double-peaked emission lines are well described by the modelsadopting the sed with a strong big blue bump. on the other hand, the observeddifferences in the nlr emission is hard to be explain by the difference in thecontribution of shocks. these results support the idea that the double-peakedbalmer lines arise at an outer region of an accretion disk which is illuminatedby an inner, geometrically-thick adaf.

astro-ph;0204171	gas metallicity of narrow-line regions in narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies  and broad-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we investigate gas metallicity of narrow-line regions in narrow-line seyfert1 galaxies (nls1s) and broad-line ones (bls1s) in order to examine whether ornot there is a difference in the gas metallicity between the two populations ofseyfert 1 galaxies. we apply two methods to study this issue. one is to use theemission-line flux ratio of [n ii]6583/h_alpha in combination with some otheroptical emission-line flux ratios. this method, which has been often applied toseyfert 2 galaxies, suggests that the gas metallicity of narrow-line regions isindistinguishable or possibly higher in bls1s than in nls1s. on the contrary,the other method in which only forbidden emission-line fluxes are used resultsin that nls1s tend to possess metal-richer gas in the narrow-line regions thanbls1s. we point out that this inconsistency may be owing to the contaminationof the broad component of permitted lines into the narrow component of ones inthe first method. since the results derived by using only forbiddenemission-line fluxes do not suffer from any uncertainty of the fitting functionfor the broad component of balmer lines, the results from this method are morereliable than those derived by using permitted lines. we thus conclude that thegas metallicity of narrow-line regions tends to be higher in nls1s than inbls1s.

astro-ph;0205153	effects of a burst of formation of first-generation stars on the  evolution of galaxies	first-generation (population iii) stars in the universe play an importantrole inearly enrichment of heavy elements in galaxies and intergalactic mediumand thus affect the history of galaxies. the physical and chemical propertiesof primordial gas clouds are significantly different from those of present-daygas clouds observed in the nearby universe because the primordial gas clouds donot contain any heavy elements which are important coolants in the gas.previous theoretical considerations have suggested that typical masses of thefirst-generation stars are between several $m_\odot$ and $\approx 10 m_\odot$although it has been argued that the formation of very massive stars (e.g., $&gt;100 m_\odot$) is also likely. if stars with several $m_\odot$ are most popularones at the epoch of galaxy formation, most stars will evolve to hot (e.g.,$\gtrsim 10^5$ k), luminous ($\sim 10^4 l_\odot$) stars with gaseous and dustyenvelope prior to going to die as white dwarf stars. although the duration ofthis phase is short (e.g., $\sim 10^5$ yr), such evolved stars could contributeboth to the ionization of gas in galaxies and to the production of a lot ofdust grains if the formation of intermediate-mass stars is highly enhanced. wecompare gaseous emission-line properties of such nebulae with some interestinghigh-redshift galaxies such asiras f10214+4724 and powerful radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0212546	iron is not depleted in high-ionization nuclear emission-line regions of  active galactic nuclei	in order to examine whether or not high-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions (hiners) in narrow-line regions of active galactic nuclei are dusty, wefocus on two high-ionization forbidden emission lines, [fe vii]6087 and [nev]3426. we perform photoionization model calculations to investigate possibledependences of the flux ratio of [fe vii]6087/[ne v]3426 on various gasproperties, in order to investigate how useful this flux ratio to explore thedust abundances in hiners. based on our photoionization model calculations, weshow that the observed range of the flux ratio of [fe vii]6087/[ne v]3426 isconsistent with the dust-free models while that is hard to be explained by thedusty models. this suggests that iron is not depleted at hiners, which impliesthat the hiners are not dusty. this results is consistent with the idea thatthe hiners are located closer than the dust-sublimation radius (i.e., innerradius of dusty tori) and thus can be hidden by dusty tori when seen from aedge-on view toward the tori, which has been also suggested by the agn-typedependence of the visibility of high-ionization emission lines.

astro-ph;0306225	subaru high-dispersion spectroscopy of narrow-line region in the seyfert  galaxy ngc 4151	we report on a study of forbidden emission-line spectrum of nearby seyfert1.5 galaxy ngc 4151 based on the high-resolution (r ~ 45,000) optical spectrumobtained by using the high dispersion spectrograph boarded on the subarutelescope. the profile parameters such as the emission-line widths, thevelocity shifts from the recession velocity of the host galaxy, and theasymmetry indices, for emission lines including very faint ones such as [ariv]4712,4740 and [fe vi]5631,5677 are investigated. statistically significantcorrelations between the measured profile parameters and the critical densitiesof transitions are found while there are no meaningful correlations between theprofile parameters and the ionization potentials of ions. by comparing theresults with photoionization model calculations, we remark that a simplepower-law distribution of the gas density which is independent of the radiusfrom the nucleus cannot explain the observed correlation between theemission-line widths and the critical densities of the transitions. taking theadditional dense gas component expected to exist at the innermost of thenarrow-line region into account, the observed correlations between theemission-line width and the critical density of the transitions can beunderstood since high-critical-density emission lines can arise at suchrelatively inner regions even if their ionization potentials are low. theobserved correlation between the blueshift amounts of emission lines and thecritical densities of the ions is also explained if such dense gas cloudslocated closer to the nucleus have larger outflowing velocities.

astro-ph;0603580	gas metallicity diagnostics in star-forming galaxies	generally the gas metallicity in distant galaxies can only be inferred byusing a few prominent emission lines. various theoretical models have been usedto predict the relationship between emission line fluxes and metallicity,suggesting that some line ratios can be used as diagnostics of the gasmetallicity in galaxies. however, accurate empirical calibrations of theseemission line flux ratios from real galaxy spectra spanning a wide metallicityrange are still lacking. in this paper we provide such empirical calibrationsby using the combination of two sets of spectroscopic data: one consisting oflow-metallicity galaxies with a measurement of [oiii]4363, and the other oneconsisting of galaxies in the sdss dr4 whose metallicity has been determinedfrom various strong emission lines in their spectra. this combined data setconstitutes the largest sample of galaxies with information on the gasmetallicity available so far and spanning the widest metallicity range. ourempirical diagrams show that the line ratio [oiii]/[oii] is a useful tool tobreak the degeneracy in the r_23 parameter when no information on the [nii]line is available. the line ratio [neiii]/[oii] also results to be a usefulmetallicity indicator for high-z galaxies. finally, we compare these empiricalrelations with photoionization models. we find that the empiricalr_23-metallicity sequence is strongly discrepant with respect to the trendexpected by models with constant ionization parameter, which is interpreted asa consequence of a strong metallicity dependence of the average ionizationparameter in galaxies. this result should warn about the use of theoreticalmodels with constant ionization parameter to infer metallicities from observedline ratios.

astro-ph;0702552	anti-correlation between the mass of a supermassive black hole and the  mass accretion rate in type i ultraluminous infrared galaxies and nearby qsos	we discovered a significant anti-correlation between the mass of asupermassive black hole (smbh), $m_{\rm bh}$, and the luminosity ratio ofinfrared to active galactic nuclei (agn) eddington luminosity, $l_{\rmir}/l_{\rm edd}$, over four orders of magnitude for ultraluminous infraredgalaxies with type i seyfert nuclei (type i ulirgs) and nearby qsos. thisanti-correlation ($m_{\rm bh}$ vs. $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm edd}$) can be interpretedas the anti-correlation between the mass of a smbh and the rate of massaccretion onto a smbh normalized by the agn eddington rate, $\dot{m}_{\rmbh}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd}$. in other words, the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}_{\rmbh}$ is not proportional to that of the central bh mass. thus, thisanti-correlation indicates that bh growth is determined by the external masssupply process, and not the agn eddington-limited mechanism. moreover, we foundan interesting tendency for type i ulirgs to favor a super-eddington accretionflow, whereas qsos tended to show a sub-eddington flow. on the basis of ourfindings, we suggest that a central smbh grows by changing its mass accretionrate from super-eddington to sub-eddington. according to a coevolution scenarioof ulirgs and qsos based on the radiation drag process, it has been predictedthat a self-gravitating massive torus, whose mass is larger than a central bh,exists in the early phase of bh growth (type i ulirg phase) but not in thefinal phase of bh growth (qso phase). at the same time, if one considers themass accretion rate onto a central smbh via a turbulent viscosity, theanti-correlation ($m_{\rm bh}$ vs. $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm edd}$) is well explainedby the positive correlation between the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}_{\rm bh}$and the mass ratio of a massive torus to a smbh.

astro-ph;9910036	what are narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies ?: toward a  viewing-angle-dependent unified model for seyfert galaxies	recently growing evidence has been accumulated that the nls1s are viewed fromnearly pole-on viewing angles. however, there has been no theoretical modelwhich explains the following important correlations; 1) weaker optical fe iiemitters always have wider emission-line widths but stronger optical fe iiemitters have either wider or narrower line widths, and 2) s1s with wider linewidths always have flatter soft x-ray spectra but s1s with narrower line widthshave either steeper or flatter soft x-ray spectra.  photoionization models predict that the partly-ionized zone in the broad lineregion (blr) with a disk-like configuration, in which the optical fe iiemission is thought to arise, is very optically thick. if we observe thisdisk-like blr from an inclined viewing angle, the fe ii emitting region locatedin the far-side half disk cannot be seen entirely because of the large opticaldepth while almost all the hbeta emission can be seen because the ionizedhydrogen is located in the outer surfaces of blr clouds. this explains that thefe ii/hbeta ratio depends on viewing angle.  recent discovery of relativistic outflows in some nls1s suggests that thenuclear radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas very close to thecentral engine. the kinetic doppler effect increases the soft x-rayluminosities if we observe s1s from a nearly pole-on view given the above rangeof beta. these explain why nls1s tend to have steeper soft x-ray spectratogether with higher soft x-ray luminosities. furthermore, the extinction ofsoft x-ray photons due to dust grain above the dusty tori are expected to moreserious for the bls1s than for the nls1s. we thus suggest that theseorientation effects are responsible for the second important correlation.

astro-ph;9910285	extended high-ionization nuclear emission-line region in the seyfert  galaxy ngc 4051	we present an optical spectroscopic analysis of the well-known seyfert galaxyngc 4051. the high-ionization nuclear emission-line region (hiner) traced by[fe x]6374 is found to be spatially extended to a radius of 3a rcseconds (150pc) west and southwest from the nucleus; ngc 4051 is the third example whichhas an extended hiner.  the nuclear spectrum shows that the flux of [fe x]6374 is stronger than thatof [fe vii] 6087 in our observation. this property cannot be interpreted interms of a simple one-zone photoionization model.  in order to understand what happens in the nuclear region in ngc 4051, weinvestigate the physical condition of the nuclear emission-line region indetail using new photoionization models in which the following threeemission-line components are taken into account; (1) optically thick,ionization-bounded clouds; (2) optically thin, matter-bounded clouds; and (3) acontamination component which emits h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ lines. here theobserved extended hiner is considered to be associated with the low-density,matter-bounded clouds. candidates of the contamination component are either thebroad-line region (blr) or nuclear star forming regions or both. the complexityof the excitation condition found in ngc 4051 can be consistently understood ifwe take account of these contamination components.

0812.1329	exploring the disk-jet connection from the properties of narrow line  regions in powerful young radio-loud agns	we investigate the optical emission-line flux ratios of narrow-line regions,in order to determine whether the formation of agn jets requires specificaccretion conditions. we find that bright compact radio galaxies, which arepowerful radio galaxies in the early stage of the jet activity, exhibitsystematically larger flux ratios of [o{\sc i}]$\lambda$6300/[o{\sciii}]$\lambda$5007 and smaller flux ratios of [o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007/[o{\sciii}]$\lambda$4363 than radio-quiet (rq) seyfert 2 galaxies. comparing theobserved line ratios with photoionization models, it is found that thedifference in the flux ratio of low- to high-ionization lines (e.g., [o{\sci}]$\lambda$6300/[o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007) can be well understood by thedifference in the spectral energy distribution (sed) of ionizing sources.powerful young radio-loud (yrl) agns favor sed without a strong big blue bump,i.e., a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf), while rq agns areconsistent with the models adopting sed with a strong big blue bump, i.e., ageometrically thin, optically thick disk. these findings imply that theformation of powerful agn jets requires the accretion disk with harder ionizingsed (i.e., a riaf). we discuss the obscuring structure of yrl agns as aplausible origin of the difference in flux ratios of [o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007/[o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$4363.
