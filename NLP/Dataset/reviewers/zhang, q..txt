0903.0159	linking pre- and proto-stellar objects in the intermediate-/high-mass  star forming region iras 05345+3157	to better understand the initial conditions of the high-mass star formationprocess, it is crucial to study at high-angular resolution the morphology, thekinematics, and eventually the interactions of the coldest condensationsassociated with intermediate-/high-mass star forming regions. the paper studiesthe cold condensations in the intermediate-/high-mass proto-cluster iras05345+3157, focusing the attention on the interaction with the other objects inthe cluster. we have performed millimeter high-angular resolution observations,both in the continuum and several molecular lines, with the pdbi and the sma.in a recent paper, we have already published part of these data. the mainfinding of that work was the detection of two cold and dense gaseouscondensations, called n and s (masses ~2 and ~9 m_sun), characterised by highvalues of the deuterium fractionation (~0.1 in both cores). in this paper, wepresent a full report of the observations, and a complete analysis of the dataobtained. the millimeter maps reveal the presence of 3 cores inside theinterferometers primary beam, called c1-a, c1-b and c2. none of them areassociated with cores n and s. c1-b is very likely associated with a newlyformed early-b zams star embedded inside a hot-core, while c1-a is more likelyassociated with a class 0 intermediate-mass protostar. the nature of c2 isunclear. both c1-a and c1-b are good candidates as driving sources of apowerful co outflow, which strongly interacts with n and s, as demonstrated bythe velocity gradient across both condensations. our major conclusion is thatthe chemical properties of these pre-stellar cores are similar to thoseobserved in low-mass isolated ones, while the kinematics is dominated by theturbulence triggered by the co outflow and can influece their evolution.

0704.1301	iras 18317-0757: a cluster of embedded massive stars and protostars	we present high-resolution, multiwavelength continuum and molecular-lineimages of the massive star forming region iras 18317-0757. the ir through mmspectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25and 63 k) with a total luminosity of approximately log(l/lsun)=5.2. previoussubmm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of whichis associated with the uchii region g23.96+0.15, and another with an h2o maser.in our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the uchii region is detected, withtotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in vlacm-wave maps. for the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and inthe msx mid-ir bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperatureof 13-40k and luminosity of 1000-40000 lsun. by combining single-dish andinterferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized c18o coresin this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. whilethe overall extent of the c18o and dust emission is similar, the emission peaksdo not correlate well in detail. at least 11 of the 123 stars identified by2mass in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. twostars (both associated with the uchii region) were previously identified as ostars via ir spectroscopy. most of the rest of the reddened stars have noobvious correlation with the c18o cores or the dust cores. in summary, ourobservations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloudhas taken place during the time required for the uchii region to form and the ostars to become detectable at ir wavelengths. additional star formation appearsto be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four b-type(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of c18o molecular cores.

0907.2232	rotational structure and outflow in the infrared dark cloud 18223-3	we examine an infrared dark cloud (irdc) at high spatial resolution as ameans to study rotation, outflow, and infall at the onset of massive starformation. submillimeter array observations combined with iram 30 meter data in12co(2--1) reveal the outflow orientation in the irdc 18223-3 region, and pdbi3 mm observations confirm this orientation in other molecular species. theimplication of the outflow's presence is that an accretion disk is feeding it,so using high density tracers such as c18o, n2h+, and ch3oh, we looked forindications of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow direction.surprisingly, this gradient turns out to be most apparent in ch3oh. the largesize (28,000 au) of the flattened rotating object detected indicates that thisvelocity gradient cannot be due solely to a disk, but rather from inwardspiraling gas within which a keplerian disk likely exists. from the outflowparameters, we derive properties of the source such as an outflow dynamical ageof ~37,000 years, outflow mass of ~13 m_sun, and outflow energy of ~1.7 x 10^46erg. while the outflow mass and energy are clearly consistent with a high-massstar forming region, the outflow dynamical age indicates a slightly moreevolved evolutionary stage than previous spectral energy distribution (sed)modeling indicates. the calculated outflow properties reveal that this is trulya massive star in the making. we also present a model of the observed methanolvelocity gradient. the rotational signatures can be modeled via rotationallyinfalling gas. these data present evidence for one of the youngest knownoutflow/infall/disk systems in massive star formation. a tentative evolutionarypicture for massive disks is discussed.

0911.4072	three intermediate-mass ysos with different properties emerging from the  same natal cloud in iras 00117+6412	we observed with the vla, pdbi, and sma the centimeter and millimetercontinuum, n2h+(1-0), and co(2-1) emission associated with a dusty cloudharboring a nascent cluster with intermediate-mass protostars. at centimeterwavelengths we found a strong source, tracing a uchii region, at the easternedge of the dusty cloud, with a shell-like structure, and with thenear-infrared counterpart falling in the center of the shell. this ispresumably the most massive source of the forming cluster. about 15'' to thewest of the uchii region and well embedded in the dusty cloud, we detected astrong millimeter source, mm1, associated with centimeter and near-infraredemission. mm1 seems to be driving a prominent high-velocity co bipolar outflow,and is embedded in a ridge of dense gas traced by n2h+. we estimated that mm1is an intermediate-mass source in the class 0/i phase. about 15'' to the southof mm1, and still more deeply embedded in the dusty cloud, we detected acompact millimeter source, mm2, with neither centimeter nor near-infraredemission, but with water maser emission. mm2 is associated with a clump ofn2h+, whose kinematics reveal a clear velocity gradient and additionally wefound signposts of infall motions. mm2, being deeply embedded within the dustycloud, with an associated water maser but no hints of co outflow emission, isan intriguing object, presumably of intermediate mass. in conclusion, the uchiiregion is found at the border of a dusty cloud which is currently undergoingactive star formation. two intermediate-mass protostars in the dusty cloud seemto have formed after the uchii region and have different properties related tothe outflow phenomenon.

0707.2904	the 10^5lsun high-mass protostellar object iras23151+5912	while most sources above 10^5lsun have already formed an ultracompact hiiregion (uchii), this is not necessarily the case for sources of lowerluminosity. characterizing sources in the transition phase, i.e., very luminousobjects without any detectable free-free emission, is important for a generalunderstanding of massive star formation. therefore, we observed the luminoushigh-mass protostellar object iras23151+5912 with the submillimeter array at875mum in the submm continuum and spectral line emission at sub-arcsecondresolution. the 875mum submm continuum emission has been resolved into at leasttwo condensations. the previously believed driving source of one of theoutflows, the infrared source irs1, is ~0.9'' offset from the main submm peak.over the entire 4ghz bandwidth we detect an intermediate dense spectral lineforest with 27 lines from 8 different species, isotopologues orvibrationally-torsionally excited states. temperature estimates based on thech3oh line series result in values of t(peak1)~150+-50k and t(peak2)~80~30k forthe two submm peak positions, respectively. the sio(8-7) red- and blue-shiftedline maps indicate the presence of two molecular outflows. in contrast, thevibrationally-torsionally excited ch3oh line exhibits a velocity gradientapproximately perpendicular to one of the outflows. with a size ofapproximately 5000au and no keplerian rotation signature, this structure doesnot resemble a genuine accretion disk but rather a larger-scale rotating toroidthat may harbor a more common accretion disk at its so far unresolved center.

1105.0344	submillimeter continuum observations of sagittarius b2 at subarcsecond  spatial resolution	we report the first high spatial resolution submillimeter continuumobservations of the sagittarius b2 cloud complex using the submillimeter array(sma). with the subarcsecond resolution provided by the sma, the two massivestar-forming clumps sgr b2(n) and sgr b2(m) are resolved into multiple compactsources. in total, twelve submillimeter cores are identified in the sgr b2(m)region, while only two components are observed in the sgr b2(n) clump. the gasmass and column density are estimated from the dust continuum emission. we findthat most of the cores have gas masses in excess of 100 m$_{\odot}$ and columndensities above 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. the very fragmented appearance of sgrb2(m), in contrast to the monolithic structure of sgr b2 (n), suggests that theformer is more evolved. the density profile of the sgr b2(n)-sma1 core is wellfitted by a plummer density distribution. this would lead one to believe thatin the evolutionary sequence of the sgr b2 cloud complex, a massive star formsfirst in an homogeneous core, and the rest of the cluster forms subsequently inthe then fragmenting structure.

1107.2849	dissecting a hot molecular core: the case of g31.41+0.31	we made a detailed observational analysis of a well known hot molecular corelying in the high-mass star-forming region g31.41+0.31. this core is believedto contain deeply embedded massive stars and presents a velocity gradient thathas been interpreted either as rotation or as expansion, depending on theauthors. our aim was to shed light on this question and possibly prepare theground for higher resolution alma observations which could directly detectcircumstellar disks around the embedded massive stars. observations atsub-arcsecond resolution were performed with the submillimeter array in methylcyanide, a typical hot molecular core tracer, and 12co and 13co, well knownoutflow tracers. we also obtained sensitive continuum maps at 1.3 mm. ourfindings confirm the existence of a sharp velocity gradient across the core,but cannot confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow perpendicular to it. theimproved angular resolution and sampling of the uv plane allow us to attainhigher quality channel maps of the ch3cn lines with respect to previous studiesand thus significantly improve our knowledge of the structure and kinematics ofthe hot molecular core. while no conclusive argument can rule out any of thetwo interpretations (rotation or expansion) proposed to explain the velocitygradient observed in the core, in our opinion the observational evidencecollected so far indicates the rotating toroid as the most likely scenario. theoutflow hypothesis appears less plausible, because the dynamical time scale istoo short compared to that needed to form species such as ch3cn, and the massloss and momentum rates estimated from our measurements appear too high.

0710.4238	multi-line (sub)millimetre observations of the high-mass proto cluster  iras 05358+3543	since most high- and intermediate-mass protostars are at great distance andform in clusters, high linear resolution observations are needed to investigatetheir physical properties. to study the gas in the innermost region around theprotostars in the proto-cluster iras 05358+3543, we observed the source inseveral transitions of methanol and other molecular species with the plateau debure interferometer and the submillimeter array, reaching a linear resolutionof 1100 au. we determine the kinetic temperature of the gas around theprotostars through an lvg and lte analysis of their molecular emission; thecolumn densities of ch3oh, ch3cn and so2 are also derived. constrains on thedensity of the gas are estimated for two of the protostellar cores. we findthat the dust condensations are in various evolutionary stages. the powerhouseof the cluster, mm1a, harbours a hot core with t~220 (75&lt;t&lt;330) k. adouble-peaked profile is detected in several transitions toward mm1a, and wefound a velocity gradient along a linear structure which could be perpendicularto one of the outflows from the vicinity of mm1a. since the size of thedouble-peaked emission is less than 1100 au, we suggest that mm1a might host amassive circumstellar disk. the other sources are in earlier stages of starformation. the least active source, mm3, could be a starless massive core,since it is cold (t&lt;20 k), with a large reservoir of accreting material (m ~ 19m_\odot), but no molecular emission peaks on it.

1208.6135	unexpected anisotropic two dimensional electron gas at the laalo3/srtio3  (110) interface	the observation of a two dimensional electron gas (2deg) (1, 2),superconductivity (3, 4), magnetic effects (5) and electronic phase separation(6-8) at the interfaces of insulating oxides, especially laalo3/srtio3, hasfurther enhanced the potential of complex oxides for novel electronics. theoccurrence of the 2deg is strongly believed to be driven by the polarizationdiscontinuity (9) at the interface between the two oxides. in this scenario,the crystal orientation plays an important role and no conductivity would beexpected for e.g., the interface between laalo3 and (110)-oriented srtio3,which should not have a polarization discontinuity (10, 11). here, we reportthe observation of unexpected conductivity at the laalo3/srtio3 interfaceprepared on (110)-oriented srtio3. the conductivity was further found to bestrongly anisotropic, with the ratio of the conductance along the differentdirections parallel to the substrate surface showing a remarkable dependence onthe oxygen pressure during deposition. the conductance and its anisotropy arediscussed based on the atomic structure at the interface, as revealed byscanning transmission electron microscopy (stem) and further supported bydensity functional theory (dft) calculations.

1210.3366	the protocluster g18.67+0.03: a test case for class i methanol masers as  evolutionary indicators for massive star formation	we present high angular resolution submillimeter array (sma) and karl g.jansky very large array (vla) observations of the massive protoclusterg18.67+0.03. previously targeted in maser surveys of glimpse extended greenobjects (egos), this cluster contains three class i methanol maser sources,providing a unique opportunity to test the proposed role of class i masers asevolutionary indicators for massive star formation. the millimeter observationsreveal bipolar molecular outflows, traced by 13co(2-1) emission, associatedwith all three class i maser sources. two of these sources (including the ego)are also associated with 6.7 ghz class ii methanol masers; the class ii masersare coincident with millimeter continuum cores that exhibit hot core lineemission and drive active outflows, as indicated by the detection of sio(5-4).in these cases, the class i masers are coincident with outflow lobes, andappear as clear cases of excitation by active outflows. in contrast, the thirdclass i source is associated with an ultracompact hii region, and not withclass ii masers. the lack of sio emission suggests the 13co outflow is a relic,consistent with its longer dynamical timescale. our data show that massiveyoung stellar objects associated only with class i masers are not necessarilyyoung, and provide the first unambiguous evidence that class i masers may beexcited by both young (hot core) and older (uc hii) mysos within the sameprotocluster.

1212.0792	a new radio recombination line maser object toward the monr2 hii region	we report the detection of a new radio recombination line (rrl) maser objecttoward the irs2 source in the monr2 ultracompact hii region. the continuumemission at 1.3mm and 0.85mm and the h30a and h26a lines were observed with thesubmillimeter array (sma) at angular resolutions of about 0.5"-3". the smaobservations show that the monr2-irs2 source is very compact and remainsunresolved at spatial scales &lt;=400au. its continuum power spectrum atmillimeter wavelengths is almost flat (alpha=-0.16, with s_nu proportional tonu^alpha), indicating that this source is dominated by optically thin free-freeemission. the h30a and h26a rrl emission is also compact and peaks toward theposition of the monr2-irs2 source. the measured rrl profiles are double-peakedwith the h26a line showing a clear asymmetry in its spectrum. since the derivedline-to-continuum flux ratios (80 and 180kms-1 for h30a and h26a, respectively)exceed the lte predictions, the rrls toward monr2-irs2 are affected by maseramplification. the amplification factors are however smaller than those foundtoward the emission line star mwc349a, indicating that monr2-irs2 is a weaklyamplified maser. radiative transfer modelling of the rrl emission toward thissource shows that the rrl masers arise from a dense and collimated jet embeddedin a cylindrical ionized wind, oriented nearly along the direction of theline-of-sight. high-angular resolution observations at sub-millimeterwavelengths are needed to unveil weakly amplified rrl masers in very youngmassive stars.

1302.2416	coupled valence and spin state transition in (pr0.7sm0.3)0.7ca0.3coo3	the coupled valence and spin state transition (vsst) taking place in(pr0.7sm0.3)0.7ca0.3coo3 was investigated by soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy(xas) experiments carried out at the pr-m4,5, co-l2,3, and o-1s edges. thisvsst is found to be composed of a sharp pr/co valence and co spin statetransition centered at t*=89.3 k, followed by a smoother co spin-stateevolution at higher temperatures. at t &lt; t*, we found that the praseodymiumdisplays a mixed valence pr3+/pr4+ with about 0.13 pr4+/f.u., while all theco3+ is in the low-spin (ls) state. at t around t*, the sharp valencetransition converts all the pr4+ to pr3+ with a corresponding co3+ to co4+compensation. this is accompanied by an equally sharp spin state transition ofthe co3+ from the low to an incoherent mixture of low and high spin (hs)states. an involvement of the intermediate spin (is) state can be discarded forthe co3+. while above t* and at high temperatures the system shares rathersimilar properties as sr-doped lacoo3, at low temperatures it behaves much morelike eucoo3 with its highly stable ls configuration for the co3+. apparently,the mechanism responsible for the formation of pr4+ at low temperatures alsohelps to stabilize the co3+ in the ls configuration despite the presence ofco4+ ions. we also found out that that the co4+ is in an is state over theentire temperature range investigated in this study (10-290 k). the presence ofco3+ hs and co4+ is at elevated temperatures facilitates the conductivity ofthe material.

1305.6509	dr 21(oh): a highly fragmented, magnetized, turbulent dense core	we present high-angular-resolution observations of the massive star formingcore dr21(oh) at 880 mum using the submillimeter array (sma). the dense coreexhibits an overall velocity gradient in a keplerian-like pattern, which breaksat the center of the core where sma 6 and sma 7 are located. the dustpolarization shows a complex magnetic field, compatible with a toroidalconfiguration. this is in contrast with the large, parsec-scale filament thatsurrounds the core, where there is a smooth magnetic field. the total magneticfield strengths in the filament and in the core are 0.9 and 2.1 mg,respectively. we found evidence of magnetic field diffusion at the core scales,far beyond the expected value for ambipolar diffusion. it is possible that thediffusion arises from fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence.the dynamics of the dr 21(oh) core appear to be controlled energetically inequal parts by the magnetic field, magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence andthe angular momentum. the effect of the angular momentum (this is a fastrotating core) is probably causing the observed toroidal field configuration.yet, gravitation overwhelms all the forces, making this a clear supercriticalcore with a mass-to-flux ratio of ~6 times the critical value. however,simulations show that this is not enough for the high level of fragmentationobserved at 1000 au scales. thus, rotation and outflow feedback is probably themain cause of the observed fragmentation.

0801.1778	atca 3mm observations of ngc6334i and i(n): dense cores, outflows and an  uchii region	aims: investigation of the dense gas, the outflows and the continuum emissionfrom the massive twin cores ngc6334i and i(n) at high spatial resolution.methods: we imaged the region with the australia telescope compact array (atca)at 3.4mm wavelength in continuum as well as ch3cn(5_k-4_k) and hcn(1-0)spectral line emission. results: while the continuum emission in ngc6334imainly traces the uchii region, toward ngc6334i(n) we detect line emission fromfour of the previously identified dust continuum condensations that are ofprotostellar or pre-stellar nature. the ch3cn(5_k-4_k) lines are detected inall k-components up to energies of 128k above ground toward two protostellarcondensations in both regions. we find line-width increasing with increasing kfor all sources, which indicates a higher degree of internal motions closer tothe central protostars. toward the main mm and ch3cn source in ngc6334i weidentify a velocity gradient approximately perpendicular to the large-scalemolecular outflow. this may be interpreted as a signature of an accretion disk,although other scenarios, e.g., an unresolved double source, could produce asimilar signature as well. no comparable signature is found toward any of theother sources. hcn does not trace the dense gas well but it is dominated by themolecular outflows. while the outflow in ngc6334i exhibits a normal hubble-lawlike velocity structure, the data indicate a precessing outflow close to theplane of the sky for ngc6334i(n). furthermore, we observe a wide (~15.4km/s)hcn absorption line, much broader than the previously observed ch3oh and nh3absorption lines. several explanations for the difference are discussed.

1306.6868	anomalous metallic state and anisotropic multiband superconductivity in  nb3pd0.7se7	we report the discovery of superconductivity in nb$_3$pd$_{x}$se$_7$ with a$x$-dependent superconducting transition-temperature as high as $t_c \simeq 2.1$ k for $x \simeq0.7$ (middle point of the resistive transition). needle-likesingle crystals display anisotropic upper-critical fields with an anisotropy$\gamma = h^{b}_{c2}/h^{a}_{c2}$ as large as 6 between fields applied alongtheir needle axis (or $b-$axis) or along the $a-$axis. as for the fe basedsuperconductors $\gamma$ is temperature-dependent suggesting thatnb$_3$pd$_{0.7}$se$_7$ is a multi-band superconductor. this is supported byband structure calculations which reveal a fermi surface composed ofquasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional sheets of hole character, aswell as three-dimensional sheets of both hole- and electron-character.remarkably, $h^{b}_{c2}$ is observed to saturate at $h^{b}_{c2}(t \rightarrow 0\text{k}) \simeq 14.1$ t which is $4.26 \times h_p$ where $h_p$ is thepauli-limiting field in the weak-coupling regime. the synthesis procedureyields additional crystals belonging to the nb$_2$pd$_{x}$se$_5$ phase whichalso becomes superconducting when the fraction of pd is varied. for both phaseswe find that superconductivity condenses out of an anomalous metallic state,i.e. displaying $\partial \rho/ \partial t &lt; 0$ above $t_c$ similarly to whatis observed in the pseudogap-phase of the underdoped cuprates. an anomalousmetallic state, low-dimensionality, multi-band character, extremely high andanisotropic $h_{c2}$s, are all ingredients for unconventionalsuperconductivity.

1312.0272	submillimeter polarisation and magnetic field properties in the  envelopes of proto-planetary nebulae crl 618 and oh 231.8+4.2	we have carried out continuum and line polarisation observations of twoproto-planetary nebulae (ppne), crl 618 and oh 231.8+4.2, using thesubmillimeter array (sma) in its compact configuration. the frequency range ofobservations, 330-345 ghz, includes the co(j=3-2) line emission. crl 618 and oh231.8+4.2 show quadrupolar and bipolar optical lobes, respectively, surroundedby a dusty envelope reminiscent of their agb phase. we report a detection ofdust continuum polarised emission in both ppne above 4 sigma but no molecularline polarisation detection above a 3 sigma limit. oh 231.8+4.2 is slightlymore polarised on average than crl 618 with a mean fractional polarisation of4.3 and 0.3 per cent, respectively. this agrees with the previous finding thatsilicate dust shows higher polarisation than carbonaceous dust. in bothobjects, an anti-correlation between the fractional polarisation and theintensity is observed. neither ppne show a well defined toroidal equatorialfield, rather the field is generally well aligned and organised along the polardirection. this is clearly seen in crl 618 while in the case of oh 231.8+4.2,the geometry indicates an x-shaped structure coinciding overall with adipole/polar configuration. however in the later case, the presence of afragmented and weak toroidal field should not be discarded. finally, in bothppne, we observed that the well organised magnetic field is parallel with themajor axis of the 12co outflow. this alignment could indicate the presence of amagnetic outflow launching mechanism. based on our new high resolution data wepropose two scenarios to explain the evolution of the magnetic field in evolvedstars.

1312.1996	dynamics of lysozyme and its hydration water under electric field	the effects of static electric field on the dynamics of lysozyme and itshydration water have been investigated by means of incoherent quasi-elasticneutron scattering (qens). measurements were performed on lysozyme samples,hydrated respectively with heavy water (d2o) to capture the protein dynamics,and with light water (h2o), to probe the dynamics of the hydration shell, inthe temperature range from 210 $&lt;$ t $&lt;$ 260 k. the hydration fraction in bothcases was about $\sim$ 0.38 gram of water per gram of dry protein. the fieldstrengths investigated were respectively 0 kv/mm and 2 kv/mm (2 10$^6$ v/m) forthe protein hydrated with d2o and 0 kv and 1 kv/mm for the h2o hydratedcounterpart. while the overall internal protons dynamics of the protein appearsto be unaffected by the application of electric field up to 2 kv/mm, likely dueto the stronger intra-molecular interactions, there is also no appreciablequantitative enhancement of the diffusive dynamics of the hydration water, aswould be anticipated based on our recent observations in water confined insilica pores under field values of 2.5 kv/mm. this may be due to the differencein surface interactions between water and the two adsorption hosts (silica andprotein), or to the existence of a critical threshold field value ec $\sim$ 2-3kv/mm for increased molecular diffusion, for which electrical breakdown is alimitation for our sample.

1401.3603	tuning the critical temperature of cuprate superconductor films using  self-assembled organic layers	many of the electronic properties of high-temperature cuprate superconductors(htsc) are strongly dependent on the number of charge carriers put into thecuo$_2$ planes (doping). superconductivity appears over a dome-shaped region ofthe doping-temperature phase diagram. the highest critical temperature (tc) isobtained for the so-called "optimum doping". the doping mechanism is usuallychemical; it can be done by cationic substitution. this is the case, forexample, in la$_{2-x}$sr$_x$cuo$_4$ where la3+ is replaced by sr2+ thus addinga hole to the cuo$_2$ planes. a similar effect is achieved by adding oxygen asin the case of yba$_2$cu$_3$o$_{6+\delta}$ where $\delta$ represents the excessoxygen in the sample. in this paper we report on a different mechanism, onethat enables the addition or removal of carriers from the surface of the htsc.this method utilizes a self-assembled monolayer (sam) of polar moleculesadsorbed on the cuprate surface. in the case of optically active molecules, thepolarity of the sam can be modulated by shining light on the coated surface.this results in a light-induced modulation of the superconducting phasetransition of the sample. the ability to control the superconducting transitiontemperature with the use of sams makes these surfaces practical for variousdevices such as switches and detectors based on high-tc superconductors.

1401.8292	fragmentation of massive dense cores down to ~1000 au: relation between  fragmentation and density structure	in order to shed light on the main physical processes controllingfragmentation of massive dense cores, we present a uniform study of the densitystructure of 19 massive dense cores, selected to be at similar evolutionarystages, for which their relative fragmentation level was assessed in a previouswork. we inferred the density structure of the 19 cores through a simultaneousfit of the radial intensity profiles at 450 and 850 micron (or 1.2 mm in twocases) and the spectral energy distribution, assuming spherical symmetry andthat the density and temperature of the cores decrease with radius followingpower-laws. we find a weak (inverse) trend of fragmentation level and densitypower-law index, with steeper density profiles tending to show lowerfragmentation, and vice versa. in addition, we find a trend of fragmentationincreasing with density within a given radius, which arises from a combinationof flat density profile and high central density and is consistent with jeansfragmentation. we considered the effects of rotational-to-gravitational energyratio, non-thermal velocity dispersion, and turbulence mode on the densitystructure of the cores, and found that compressive turbulence seems to yieldhigher central densities. finally, a possible explanation for the origin ofcores with concentrated density profiles, which are the cores showing nofragmentation, could be related with a strong magnetic field, consistent withthe outcome of radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

1402.3518	a sub-arcsecond study of the hot molecular core in g023.01-00.41	(abridged) methods: we performed sma observations at 1.3 mm with both themost extended and compact array configurations, providing sub-arcsecond andhigh sensitivity maps of various molecular lines, including both hot-core andoutflow tracers. we also reconstruct the spectral energy distribution of theregion from millimeter to near infrared wavelengths, using the herschel/hi-galmaps, as well as archival data. results: from the spectral energy distribution,we derive a bolometric luminosity of about 4x10^4 lsun. our interferometricobservations reveal that the distribution of dense gas and dust in the hmc issignificantly flattened and extends up to a radius of 8000 au from the centerof radio continuum and maser emission in the region. the equatorial plane ofthis hmc is strictly perpendicular to the elongation of the collimated bipolaroutflow, as imaged on scales of about 0.1-0.5 pc in the main co isotopomers aswell as in the sio(5-4) line. in the innermost hmc regions (ca. 1000 au), thevelocity field traced by the ch3cn(12_k-11_k) line emission shows thatmolecular gas is both expanding along the outflow direction following ahubble-law, and rotating about the outflow axis, in agreement with the (3-d)velocity field traced by methanol masers. the velocity field associated withrotation indicates a dynamical mass of 19 msun at the center of the core. thelatter is likely to be concentrated in a single o9.5 zams star, consistent withthe estimated bolometric luminosity of g023.01-00.41. the physical propertiesof the co(2-1) outflow emission, such as its momentum rate 6x10^-3 msun km/s/yr and its outflow rate 2x10^-4 msun/yr, support our estimates of theluminosity (and mass) of the embedded young stellar object.

1409.3487	high pressure dynamics of hydrated protein in bio-protective trehalose  environment	we present a pressure dependence study of the dynamics of lysozyme proteinpowder immersed in deuterated $\alpha$,$\alpha$-trehalose environment viaquasi-elastic neutron scattering (qens). the goal is to assess thebaro-protective benefits of trehalose on bio-molecules by comparing thefindings with those of a trehalose-free reference study. while the mean-squaredisplacement of the trehalose-free protein (hydrated to $d_{d_2o}\simeq$40 w\%)as a whole, is reduced by increasing pressure, the actual observable relaxationdynamics in the pico-(ps) to nano-seconds (ns) time range remains largelyunaffected by pressure - up to the maximum investigated pressure of 2.78(2)kbar. our observation is independent of whether or not the protein is mixedwith the deuterated sugar. this suggests that the hydrated protein'sconformational states at atmospheric pressure remain unaltered by hydrostaticpressures, below 2.78 kbar. we also found the qens response to be totallyrecoverable after ambient pressure conditions are restored. circular dichroismand neutron diffraction measurements confirm that the protein structuralintegrity is conserved and remains intact, after pressure is released. weobserve however a clear narrowing of the quasi-elastic neutron (qens) responseas the temperature is decreased from 290 k to 230 k in both cases, which weparametrize using the kohlrausch-williams-watts (kww) stretched exponentialmodel. only the fraction of protons that are immobile on the accessible timewindow of the instrument, referred to as the elastic incoherent structurefactor or (eisf) is observably sensitive to pressure, increasing onlymarginally but systematically with increasing pressure.

1410.2605	g11.92-0.61-mm2: a bonafide massive prestellar core?	core accretion models of massive star formation require the existence ofstable massive starless cores, but robust observational examples of suchobjects have proven elusive. we report subarcsecond-resolution sma 1.3 mm, 1.1mm, and 0.88 mm and vla 1.3 cm observations of an excellent massive starlesscore candidate, g11.92-0.61-mm2, initially identified in the course of studiesof glimpse extended green objects (egos). separated by ~7.2" from the nearbymm1 protostellar hot core, mm2 is a strong, compact dust continuum source(submillimeter spectral index alpha=2.6+/-0.1), but is devoid of star formationindicators. in contrast to mm1, mm2 has no masers, no centimeter continuum, andno (sub)millimeter wavelength line emission in ~24 ghz of bandwidth observedwith the sma, including n2h+(3-2), hco+(3-2), and hcn(3-2). additionally, thereis no evidence for an outflow driven by mm2. the (sub)millimeter spectralenergy distribution (sed) of mm2 is best fit with a dust temperature of ~17-19k and luminosity of ~5-7 l_sun. the combined physical properties of mm2, asinferred from its dust continuum emission, are extreme: m&gt;30 m_sun within aradius&lt;1000 au, n(h2)&gt;10^25 cm^-2 and n(h2)&gt;10^9 cm^-3. comparison of themolecular abundance limits derived from our sma observations with gas-grainchemical models indicates that extremely dense (n(h)&gt;&gt;10^8 cm^-3), cold (&lt;20 k)conditions are required to explain the lack of observed (sub)millimeter lineemission, consistent with the dust continuum results. our data suggest thatg11.92-0.61-mm2 is the best candidate for a bonafide massive prestellar corefound to date, and a promising target for future, higher-sensitivityobservations.

astro-ph;0603093	disks around young o-b (proto)stars: observations and theory	disks are a natural outcome of the star formation process in which they playa crucial role. luminous, massive stars of spectral type earlier than b4 arelikely to be those that benefit most from the existence of accretion disks,which may significantly reduce the effect of radiation pressure on theaccreting material. the scope of the present contribution is to review thecurrent knowledge about disks in young high-mass (proto)stars and discuss theirimplications. the issues of disk stability and lifetime are also discussed. weconclude that for protostars of less than ~20 solar masses, disks with masscomparable to that of the central star are common. above this limit thesituation is unclear and there are no good examples of proto o4-o8 starssurrounded by accretion disks: in these objects only huge, massive, toroidal,non-equilibrium rotating structures are seen. it is clear on the other handthat the observed disks in stars of 10-20 solar masses are likely to beunstable and with short lifetimes.

astro-ph;0702190	hot ammonia in ngc6334i &amp; i(n)	aims: the massive twin cores ngc6334i and i(n) are in different evolutionarystages and hence ideal targets to study evolutionary variations within the samelarger-scale environment. here, we study the warm, compact gas components.methods: we imaged the two regions with the australia telescope compact array(atca) at high angular resolution in the nh3(3,3) to (6,6) inversion lines.results: compact emission is detected toward both regions in all observedinversion lines with energy levels up to 407k above ground. this isparticularly surprising for ngc6334i(n) since it lacks bright infrared emissionand is considered a massive cold core at an early evolutionary stage. highoptical depth and multiply-peaked line profiles complicate rotation temperatureestimates, and we can only conclude that gas components with temperatures &gt;100kare present in both regions. toward ngc6334i, we confirm previous reports ofnh3(3,3) maser emission toward the outflow bow-shocks. furthermore, we reportthe first detection of an nh3(6,6) maser toward the central region of ngc6334i.this maser is centered on the second millimeter (mm) peak and elongated alongthe outflow axis, indicating that this mm continuum core harbors the drivingsource of the molecular outflow. toward the main mm peak in ngc6334i(n), wedetect a double-horn line profile in the nh3(6,6) transition. the current datado not allow us to differentiate whether this double-horn profile is producedby multiple gas components along the line of sight, or whether it may trace apotential underlying massive accretion disk. the data to figures 3 to 7 arealso available in electronic form at the cds via anonymous ftp tocdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or viahttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?j/a+a/.

astro-ph;0702560	interferometric multi-wavelength (sub)millimeter continuum study of the  young high-mass protocluster iras05358+3543	the young massive star-forming region iras05358+3543 was observed athigh-spatial resolution in the continuum emission at 3.1 and 1.2mm with theplateau de bure interferometer, and at 875 and 438mum with the submillimeterarray. we resolve at least four continuum sub-sources that are likely ofprotostellar nature. two of them are potentially part of a proto-binary systemwith a projected separation of 1700au. additional (sub)mm continuum peaks arenot necessarily harboring protostars but maybe caused by the multiple molecularoutflows. the spectral energy distributions (seds) of the sub-sources showseveral features. the main power house mm1, which is associated with ch3ohmaser emission, a hypercompact hii region and a mid-infrared source, exhibits atypical sed with a free-free emission component at cm and long mm wavelengthsand a cold dust component in the (sub)mm part of the spectrum (spectral indexbetween 1.2mm and 438mum alpha~3.6). the free-free emission corresponds to alyman continuum flux of an embedded 13msun b1 star. the coldest source of theregion, mm3, has alpha~3.7 between 1.2mm and 875mum, but has lower thanexpected fluxes in the shorter wavelength 438mum band. this turnover of theplanck-function sets an upper limit on the dust temperature of mm3 ofapproximately 20k. the uv-data analysis of the density structure of individualsub-cores reveals distributions with power-law indices between 1.5 and 2. thisresembles the density distributions of the larger-scale cluster-forming clumpas well as those from typical low-mass cores.

astro-ph;0702696	submillimeter array observations of 321 ghz water maser emission in  cepheus a	using the submillimeter array (sma) we have imaged for the first time the321.226 ghz, 10_{29}-9_{36} ortho-h2o maser emission. this is also the firstdetection of this line in the cepheus a high-mass star-forming region. the22.235 ghz, 6_{16}-5_{23} water masers were also observed with the very largearray 43 days following the sma observations. three of the nine detectedsubmillimeter maser spots are associated with the centimeter masers spatiallyas well as kinematically, while there are 36 22 ghz maser spots withoutcorresponding submillimeter masers. in the hw2 source, both the 321 ghz and 22ghz masers occur within the region of ~1'' which includes the disk-jet system,but the position angles of the roughly linear structures traced by the masersindicate that the 321 ghz masers are along the jet while the 22 ghz masers areperpendicular to it. we interpret the submillimeter masers in cepheus a to betracing significantly hotter regions (600~2000 k) than the centimeter masers.

0810.5637	chemical diversity in high-mass star formation	massive star formation exhibits an extremely rich chemistry. however, notmuch evolutionary details are known yet, especially at high spatial resolution.therefore, we synthesize previously published submillimeter arrayhigh-spatial-resolution spectral line observations toward four regions ofhigh-mass star formation that are in various evolutionary stages with a rangeof luminosities. estimating column densities and comparing the spatiallyresolved molecular emission allows us to characterize the chemical evolution inmore detail. furthermore, we model the chemical evolution of massive warmmolecular cores to be directly compared with the data. the four regions revealmany different characteristics. while some of them, e.g., the detection rate ofch3oh, can be explained by variations of the average gas temperatures, otherfeatures are attributed to chemical effects. for example, c34s is observedmainly at the core-edges and not toward their centers because oftemperature-selective desorption and successive gas-phase chemistry reactions.most nitrogen-bearing molecules are only found toward the hot molecular coresand not the earlier evolutionary stages, indicating that the formation andexcitation of such complex nitrogen-bearing molecules needs significant heatingand time to be fully developed. furthermore, we discuss the observationaldifficulties to study massive accretion disks in the young deeply embeddedphase of massive star formation. the general potential and limitations of suchkind of dataset are discussed, and future directions are outlined. the analysisand modeling of this source sample reveals many interesting features toward achemical evolutionary sequence. however, it is only an early step, and manyobservational and theoretical challenges in that field lie ahead.
