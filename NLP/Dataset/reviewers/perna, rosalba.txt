0904.2413	the first outburst of the new magnetar candidate sgr 0501+4516	we report here on the outburst onset and evolution of the new soft gammarepeater sgr 0501+4516. we monitored the new sgr with xmm-newton starting on2008 august 23, one day after the source became burst-active, and continuingwith 4 more observations, with the last one on 2008 september 30. combining thedata with the swift-xrt and suzaku data, we modelled the outburst decay over160 days, and we found that the source flux decreased exponentially with atimescale of t_c=23.8 days. in the first xmm-newton observation a large numberof short x-ray bursts were observed, the rate of which decayed drastically inthe following observations. we found large changes in the spectral and timingbehavior of the source during the outburst, with softening emission as the fluxdecayed, and the non-thermal soft x-ray spectral component fading faster thanthe thermal one. almost simultaneously to our xmm-newton observations (on 2008august 29 and september 2), we observed the source in the hard x-ray range withintegral, which clearly detected the source up to ~100kev in the firstpointing, while giving only upper limits during the second pointing,discovering a variable hard x-ray component fading in less than 10 days afterthe bursting activation. we performed a phase-coherent x-ray timing analysisover about 160 days starting with the burst activation and found evidence of astrong second derivative period component (\ddot{p} = -1.6(4)x10^{-19}s/s^{-2}). thanks to the phase-connection, we were able to study the thephase-resolved spectral evolution of sgr 0501+4516 in great detail. we alsoreport on the rosat quiescent source data, taken back in 1992 when the sourceexhibits a flux ~80 times lower than that measured during the outburst, and arather soft, thermal spectrum.

0904.3935	gravitational lensing of anisotropic sources	in strong gravitational lensing, the multiple images we see correspond tolight rays that leave the source in slightly different directions. if thesource emission is anisotropic, the images may differ from conventional lensingpredictions (which assume isotropy). to identify scales on which sourceanisotropy may be important, we study the angle delta between the light raysemerging from the source, for different lensing configurations. if the lens hasa power law profile m propto r^gamma, the angle delta initially increases withlens redshift and then either diverges (for a steep profile gamma&lt;1), remainsconstant (for an isothermal profile gamma=1), or vanishes (for a shallowprofile gamma&gt;1) as zl approaches zs. the scaling with lens mass is roughlydelta propto m^(1/(2-gamma)). the results for an nfw profile are qualitativelysimilar to those for a shallow power law, with delta peaking at about half theredshift of the source (not half the distance). in practice, beaming couldmodify the statistics of beamed sources lensed by massive clusters: for anopening angle theta_jet, there is a probability as high as p ~ 0.02-0.07(theta_jet/{0.5} deg)^-1 that one of the lensed images may be missed (for 2 &lt;zs &lt; 6). differential absorption within active galactic nuclei could modify theflux ratios of agns lensed by clusters; a sample of agns lensed by clusterscould provide further constraints on the sizes of absorbing regions. sourceanisotropy is not likely to be a significant effect in galaxy-scale stronglensing.

1003.3840	the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of grbs from massive rapidly-rotating  stellar progenitors	the properties of a massive star prior to its final explosion are imprintedin the circumstellar medium (csm) created by its wind and termination shock. weperform a detailed, comprehensive calculation of the time-variable andangle-dependent transmission spectra of an average-luminosity gamma-ray burst(grb) which explodes in the csm structure produced by the collapse of a 20msun, rapidly rotating, z=0.001 progenitor star. we study both the case inwhich metals are initially in the gaseous phase, as well as the situation inwhich they are heavily depleted into dust. we find that high-velocity linesfrom low-ionization states of silicon, carbon, and iron are initially presentin the spectrum only if the metals are heavily depleted into dust prior to thegrb explosion. however, such lines disappear on timescales of a fraction of asecond for a burst observed on-axis, and of a few seconds for a burst seen athigh-latitude, making their observation virtually impossible. rest-frame linesproduced in the termination shock are instead clearly visible in allconditions. we conclude that time-resolved, early-time spectroscopy is not apromising way in which the properties of the grb progenitor wind can beroutinely studied. previous detections of high velocity features in grb uvspectra must have been due either due to a superposition of a physicallyunrelated absorber or to a progenitor star with very unusual properties.

1010.0903	instabilities in the gamma ray burst central engine. what makes the jet  variable?	both types of long and short gamma ray bursts involve a stage of ahyper-eddington accretion of hot and dense plasma torus onto a newly born blackhole. the prompt gamma ray emission originates in jets at some distance fromthis 'central engine' and in most events is rapidly variable, having a form ofspikes and subpulses. this indicates at the variable nature of the engineitself, for which a plausible mechanism is an internal instability in theaccreting flow. we solve numerically the structure and evolution of theneutrino-cooled torus. we take into account the detailed treatment of themicrophysics in the nuclear equation of state that includes the neutrinotrapping effect. the models are calculated for both schwarzschild and kerrblack holes. we find that for sufficiently large accretion rates (&gt; 10 msun/sfor non-rotating black hole, and &gt;1 msun/s for rotating black hole, dependingon its spin), the inner regions of the disk become opaque, while the heliumnuclei are being photodissociated. the sudden change of pressure in this regionleads to the development of a viscous and thermal instability, and the neutrinopressure acts similarly to the radiation pressure in sub-eddington disks. inthe case of rapidly rotating black holes, the instability is enhanced andappears for much lower accretion rates. we also find the important and possiblyfurther destabilizing role of the energy transfer from the rotating black holeto the torus via the magnetic coupling.

1101.1098	a unified model of the magnetar and radio pulsar bursting phenomenology	anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) are youngneutron stars (nss) characterized by high x-ray quiescent luminosities,outbursts, and, in the case of sgrs, sporadic giant flares. they are believedto be powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields (hence dubbed magnetars). thediversity of their observed behaviours is however not understood, and made evenmore puzzling by the discovery of magnetar-like bursts from "low-field"pulsars. here we perform long-term 2d simulations that follow the evolution ofmagnetic stresses in the crust; these, together with recent calculations of thebreaking stress of the neutron star crust, allow us to establish whenstarquakes occur. for the first time, we provide a quantitative estimate of theburst energetics, event rate, and location on the neutron star surface, whichbear a direct relevance for the interpretation of the overall magnetarphenomenology. typically, an "sgr-like" object tends to be more active than an"axp-like" object or a "high-$b$ radio pulsar", but there is no fundamentalseparation among what constitutes the apparent different classes. among the keyelements that create the variety of observed phenomena, age is more importantthan a small variation in magnetic field strength. we find that outbursts canalso be produced in old, lower-field pulsars (b ~ a few x 10^{12} g), but thoseevents are much less frequent than in young, high-field magnetars.

1107.5302	emission geometry, radiation pattern, and magnetic topology of the  magnetar xte j1810-197 in its quiescent state	the return to the quiescent state of the anomalous x-ray pulsar xte j1810-197following its 2003 outburst represents a unique opportunity to probe thesurface emission properties of a magnetar. the quiescent emission of xtej1810-197 is composed of two thermal components, one arising from the wholestar surface, and the other from a small warm spot on it. by modeling themagnitude and shape of the pulse profile in narrow spectral bands, we have beenable to constrain the physical characteristics and geometrical parameters ofthe system: the two angles that the line of sight and the spin axis make withrespect to the warm spot axis (\psi\ and \xi\ respectively), the angular sizeof the spot, and the overall surface temperature distribution. our modelingaccounts for the general relativistic effects of gravitational redshift andlight bending near the stellar surface, and allows for local anisotropicemission. we found that the surface temperature distribution on the neutronstar is consistent with the expectations of a dipole magnetic fieldconfiguration; the local radiation requires a pencil-beamed emission pattern,suggesting the presence of a magnetized atmosphere. for a typical value of theradius, r=13 km, the viewing parameters (symmetric for an interchange between\psi\ and \xi), range from \psi=\xi=38 deg to (\psi,\xi)=(52 deg, 29 deg).these angles are consistent with those obtained by modeling the axp inoutburst, with uncertainty contours reduced by a factor of 2.5.

1109.5184	magnetars vs. high magnetic field pulsars: a theoretical interpretation  of the apparent dichotomy	highly magnetized neutron stars (nss) are characterized by a bewilderingrange of astrophysical manifestations. here, building on our simulations of theevolution of magnetic stresses in the ns crust and its ensuing fractures (perna&amp; pons 2011), we explore in detail, for the middle-age and old nss, thedependence of starquake frequency and energetics on the relative strength ofthe poloidal (b_p) and toroidal (b_tor) components. we find that, for b_p&gt;~10^{14}g, since a strong crustal toroidal field b_tor b_p is quickly formedon a hall timescale, the initial toroidal field needs to be b_tor &gt;&gt; b_p tohave a clear influence on the outbursting behaviour. for initial fields b_p &lt;~10^{14}g, it is very unlikely that a middle-age (t~10^5 years) ns shows anybursting activity. this study allows us to solve the apparent puzzle of how nsswith similar dipolar magnetic fields can behave in a remarkably different way:an outbursting 'magnetar' with a high x-ray luminosity, or a quiet,low-luminosity, "high-$b$" radio pulsar. as an example, we consider thespecific cases of the magnetar 1e2259+586 and the radio pulsar psrj1814-1744,which at present have a similar dipolar field ~6x10^{13}g. we determine foreach object an initial magnetic field configuration that reproduces theobserved timing parameters at their current age. the same two configurationsalso account for the differences in quiescent x-ray luminosity and for the'magnetar/outbursting' behaviour of 1e2259+586 but not of psrj1814-1744. wefurther use the theoretically predicted surface temperature distribution tocompute the light-curve for these objects. in the case of 1e2259+586, for whichdata are available, our predicted temperature distribution gives rise to apulse profile whose double-peaked nature and modulation level is consistentwith the observations.

1201.5390	signatures of photon-axion conversion in the thermal spectra and  polarization of neutron stars	conversion of photons into axions under the presence of a strong magneticfield can dim the radiation from magnetized astrophysical objects. here weperform a detailed calculation aimed at quantifying the signatures ofphoton-axion conversion in the spectra, light curves, and polarization ofneutron stars (nss). we take into account the energy and angle-dependence ofthe conversion probability and the surface thermal emission from nss. thelatter is computed from magnetized atmosphere models that include the effect ofphoton polarization mode conversion due to vacuum polarization. the resultingspectral models, inclusive of the general-relativistic effects of gravitationalredshift and light deflection, allow us to make realistic predictions for theeffects of photon to axion conversion on observed ns spectra, light curves, andpolarization signals. we identify unique signatures of the conversion, such asan increase of the effective area of a hot spot as it rotates away from theobserver line of sight. for a star emitting from the entire surface, theconversion produces apparent radii that are either larger or smaller (dependingon axion mass and coupling strength) than the limits set by ns equations ofstate. for an emission region that is observed phase-on, photon-axionconversion results in an inversion of the plane of polarization with respect tothe no-conversion case. while the quantitative details of the features that weidentify depend on ns properties (magnetic field strength, temperature) andaxion parameters, the spectral and polarization signatures induced byphoton-axion conversion are distinctive enough to make nss very interesting andpromising probes of axion physics.

1201.5391	the effects of irradiation on hot jovian atmospheres: heat  redistribution and energy dissipation	hot jupiters, due to the proximity to their parent stars, are subjected to astrong irradiating flux which governs their radiative and dynamical properties.we compute a suite of 3d circulation models with dual-band radiative transfer,exploring a relevant range of irradiation temperatures, both with and withouttemperature inversions. we find that, for irradiation temperatures t \lesssim2000 k, heat redistribution is very efficient, producing comparable day- andnight-side fluxes. for tirr \approx 2200-2400 k, the redistribution starts tobreak down, resulting in a high day-night flux contrast. our simulationsindicate that the efficiency of redistribution is primarily governed by theratio of advective to radiative timescales. models with temperature inversionsdisplay a higher day-night contrast due to the deposition of starlight athigher altitudes, but we find this opacity-driven effect to be secondarycompared to the effects of irradiation. the hotspot offset from the substellarpoint is large when insolation is weak and redistribution is efficient, anddecreases as redistribution breaks down. the atmospheric flow can bepotentially subjected to the kelvin-helmholtz instability (as indicated by therichardson number) only in the uppermost layers, with a depth that penetratesdown to pressures of a few millibars at most. shocks penetrate deeper, down toseveral bars in the hottest model. ohmic dissipation generally occurs down todeeper levels than shock dissipation (to tens of bars), but the penetrationdepth varies with the atmospheric opacity. the total dissipated ohmic powerincreases steeply with the strength of the irradiating flux and the dissipationdepth recedes into the atmosphere, favoring radius inflation in the mostirradiated objects.

1202.0010	gamma-ray-burst host galaxy surveys at redshift z&gt;4: probes of star  formation rate and cosmic reionization	measuring the star formation rate (sfr) at high redshift is crucial forunderstanding cosmic reionization and galaxy formation. two commoncomplementary approaches are lyman-break-galaxy (lbg) surveys for large samplesand gamma-ray-burst (grb) observations for sensitivity to sfr in smallgalaxies. the z&gt;4 grb-inferred sfr is higher than the lbg rate, but thisdifference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modelingassumptions. using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model,with star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature tvir&gt;2e4 k(m_dm&gt;2e8 m_sun), we show that grb and lbg-derived sfrs are consistent if grbsextend to faint galaxies (m_ab&lt;-11). to test star formation below the detectionlimit l_lim~0.05l^*_{z=3} of lbg surveys, we propose to measure the fractionf_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) of grb hosts with l&gt;l_lim. this fraction quantifies themissing star formation fraction in lbg surveys, constraining themass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modelingassumptions. because f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of starformation rates derived from lbg and grb surveys, if these estimators areunbiased, measuring f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution ofthe grb production rate per unit mass of star formation. our analysis predictssignificant success for grb host detections at z~5 with f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z)~0.4,but rarer detections at z&gt;6. by analyzing the upper limits on host-galaxyluminosities of six z&gt;5 grbs from literature data, we infer that galaxies withm_ab&gt;-15 were present at z&gt;5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating the key roleplayed by very faint galaxies during reionization.

1205.3259	the influence of fallback discs on the spectral and timing properties of  neutron stars	fallback discs around neutron stars (nss) are believed to be an expectedoutcome of supernova explosions. here we investigate the consequences of such acommon outcome for the timing and spectral properties of the associated nspopulation, using monte carlo population synthesis models. we find that thelong-term torque exerted by the fallback disc can substantially influence thelate-time period distribution, but with quantitative differences which dependon whether the initial spin distribution is dominated by slow or fast pulsars.for the latter, a single-peaked initial spin distribution becomes bimodal atlater times. timing ages tend to underestimate the real age of older pulsars,and overestimate the age of younger ones. braking indices cluster in the range1.5 &lt;~ n &lt;~ 3 for slow-born pulsars, and -0.5 &lt;~ n &lt;~ 5 for fast-born pulsars,with the younger objects found predominantly below n &lt;~ 3. large values of n,while not common, are possible, and associated with torque transitions in thens+disc system. the 0.1-10 kev thermal luminosity of the ns+disc system isfound to be generally dominated by the disc emission at early times, t &lt;~ 10^3yr, but this declines faster than the thermal surface emission of the ns.depending on the initial parameters, there can be occasional periods in whichsome nss switch from the propeller to the accretion phase, increasing theirluminosity up to the eddington limit for ~ 10^3-10^4 years.

1205.6467	x-ray emission from high-redshift miniquasars: self-regulating the  population of massive black holes through global warming	observations of high-redshift quasars at z&gt;6 imply that supermassive blackholes (smbhs) with masses over a billion solar masses were in place less than 1gyr after the big bang. if these smbhs assembled from "seed" bhs left behind bythe first stars, then they must have accreted gas at close to the eddingtonlimit during a large fraction (&gt;50%) of the time. a generic problem with thisscenario, however, is that the mass density in million-solar-mass smbhs at z=6already exceeds the locally observed smbh mass density by several orders ofmagnitude; in order to avoid this overproduction, bh seed formation and growthmust become significantly less efficient in less massive protogalaxies, whileproceeding uninterrupted in the most massive galaxies that formed first. usingmonte-carlo realizations of the merger and growth history of bhs, we show thatx-rays from the earliest accreting bhs can provide such a feedback mechanism.our calculations paint a self-consistent picture of black-hole-made climatechange, in which the first miniquasars---among them the ancestors of the z&gt;6quasar smbhs---globally warm the igm and suppress the formation and growth ofsubsequent generations of bhs. we present two specific models with globalminiquasar feedback that provide excellent agreement with recent estimates ofthe z=6 smbh mass function. for each of these models, we estimate the rate ofbh mergers at z&gt;6 that could be detected by the proposed gravitational-waveobservatory elisa/ngo.

1209.0783	general relativistic simulations of accretion induced collapse of  neutron stars to black holes	neutron stars (nss) in the astrophysical universe are often surrounded byaccretion disks. accretion of matter onto an ns may increase its mass above themaximum value allowed by its equation of state, inducing its collapse to ablack hole (bh). here we study this process for the first time, inthree-dimensions, and in full general relativity. by considering three initialns configurations, each with and without a surrounding disk (of mass ~7%m_{ns}), we investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the dynamics of thecollapse and its imprint on both the gravitational wave (gw) andelectromagnetic (em) signals that can be emitted by these sources. we show inparticular that, even if the gw signal is similar for the accretion inducedcollapse (aic) and the collapse of an ns in vacuum (and detectable only forgalactic sources), the em counterpart could allow us to discriminate betweenthese two types of events. in fact, our simulations show that, while thecollapse of an ns in vacuum leaves no appreciable baryonic matter outside theevent horizon, an aic is followed by a phase of rapid accretion of thesurviving disk onto the newly formed bh. the post-collapse accretion rates, onthe order of ~10^{-2} m_{sun} s^{-1}, make these events tantalizing candidatesas engines of short gamma-ray bursts.

0711.4096	"orphan" afterglows in the universal structured jet model for gamma-ray  bursts	the paucity of reliable achromatic breaks in gamma-ray burst afterglow lightcurves motivates independent measurements of the jet aperture. serendipitoussearches of afterglows, especially at radio wavelengths, have long been theclassic alternative. these survey data have been interpreted assuming auniformly emitting jet with sharp edges (``top-hat'' jet), in which case theratio of weakly relativistically beamed afterglows to grbs scales with the jetsolid angle. in this paper, we consider, instead, a very wide outflow with aluminosity that decreases across the emitting surface. in particular, we adoptthe universal structured jet (usj) model, that is an alternative to the top-hatmodel for the structure of the jet. however, the interpretation of the surveydata is very different: in the usj model we only observe the emission withinthe jet aperture and the observed ratio of prompt emission rate to afterglowrate should solely depend on selection effects. we compute the number and rateof afterglows expected in all-sky snapshot observations as a function of thesurvey sensitivity. we find that the current (negative) results for oa searchesare in agreement with our expectations. in radio and x-ray bands this wasmainly due to the low sensitivity of the surveys, while in the optical band thesky-coverage was not sufficient. in general we find that x-ray surveys are poortools for oa searches, if the jet is structured. on the other hand, the firstradio survey and future instruments like the allen telescope array (in theradio band) and especially gaia, pan-starrs and lsst (in the optical band) willhave chances to detect afterglows.

1210.8152	compact binary progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts	in recent years, detailed observations and accurate numerical simulationshave provided support to the idea that mergers of compact binaries containingeither two neutron stars (nss) or an ns and a black hole (bh) may constitutethe central engine of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs). the merger of suchcompact binaries is expected to lead to the production of a spinning bhsurrounded by an accreting torus. several mechanisms can extract energy fromthis system and power the sgrbs. here we connect observations and numericalsimulations of compact binary mergers, and use the current sample of sgrbs withmeasured energies to constrain the mass of their powering tori. by comparingthe masses of the tori with the results of fully general-relativisticsimulations, we are able to infer the properties of the binary progenitorswhich yield sgrbs. by assuming a constant efficiency in converting torus massinto jet energy, epsilon_{jet}=10%, we find that most of the tori have massessmaller than 0.01m_{sun}, favoring "high-mass" binary nss mergers, i.e.,binaries with total masses &gt;~1.5 the maximum mass of an isolated ns. this hasimportant consequences for the gravitational-wave signals that may be detectedin association with sgrbs, since "high-mass" systems do not form a long-livedhypermassive ns after the merger. while ns-bh systems cannot be excluded to bethe engine of at least some of the sgrbs, the bh would need to have an initialspin of ~0.9, or higher.

1303.5060	constraints on warm dark matter models from high-redshift long gamma-ray  bursts	structures in warm dark matter (wdm) models are exponentially suppressedbelow a certain scale, characterized by the dark matter particle mass, $m_{\rmx}$. since structures form hierarchically, the presence of collapsed objects athigh-redshifts can set strong lower limits on $m_{\rm x}$. we place robustconstraints on $m_{\rm x}$ using recent results from the {\it swift} databaseof high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we parameterize the redshiftevolution of the ratio between the cosmic grb rate and star formation rate(sfr) as $\propto (1+z)^\alpha$, thereby allowing astrophysical uncertaintiesto partially mimic the cosmological suppression of structures in wdm models.using a maximum likelihood estimator on two different $z&gt;4$ grb subsamples(including two bursts at $z&gt;8$), we constrain $m_{\rm x} \gtrsim 1.6$-1.8 kevat 95% c.l., when marginalized over a flat prior in $\alpha$. we furtherestimate that 5 years of a svom-like mission would tighten these constraints to$m_{\rm x} \gtrsim 2.3 $ kev. our results show that grbs are a powerful probeof high-redshift structures, providing robust and competitive constraints on$m_{\rm x}$.

1306.1608	formation of stable magnetars from binary neutron star mergers	by performing fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations ofbinary neutron star mergers, we investigate the possibility that the end resultof the merger is a stable magnetar. in particular, we show that, for a binarycomposed of two equal-mass neutron stars (nss) of gravitational mass m~1.2 msunand equation of state similar to shen et al. at high densities, the mergerproduct is a stable ns. such ns is found to be differentially rotating andultraspinning with spin parameter j/m^2~0.86, where j is its total angularmomentum, and it is surrounded by a disk of ~0.1 msun. while in our globalsimulations the magnetic field is amplified by about two orders of magnitude,local simulations have shown that hydrodynamic instabilities and the onset ofthe magnetorotational instability could further increase the magnetic fieldstrength up to magnetar levels. this leads to the interesting possibility that,for some ns mergers, a stable and magnetized ns surrounded by an accretion diskcould be formed. we discuss the impact of these new results for the emission ofelectromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave signals and for the centralengine of short gamma-ray bursts.

1306.6083	the imprint of the crustal magnetic field on the thermal spectra and  pulse profiles of isolated neutron stars	isolated neutron stars (nss) show a bewildering variety of astrophysicalmanifestations, presumably shaped by the magnetic field strength and topologyat birth. here, using state-of-the art calculations of the coupled magnetic andthermal evolution of nss, we compute the thermal spectra and pulse profilesexpected for a variety of initial magnetic field configurations. in particular,we contrast models with purely poloidal magnetic fields to models dominated bya strong internal toroidal component. we find that, while the former displaysdouble peaked profiles and very low pulsed fractions, in the latter, theanisotropy in the surface temperature produced by the toroidal field oftenresults in a single pulse profile, with pulsed fractions that can exceed the50-60% level even for perfectly isotropic local emission. we further use ourtheoretical results to generate simulated "observed" spectra, and show thatblackbody (bb) fits result in inferred radii that can be significantly smallerthan the actual ns radius, even as low as ~ 1-2 km for old nss with stronginternal toroidal fields and a high absorption column density along their lineof sight. we compute the size of the inferred bb radius for a fewrepresentative magnetic field configurations, ns ages, and magnitudes of thecolumn density. our theoretical results are of direct relevance to theinterpretation of x-ray observations of isolated nss, as well as to theconstraints on the equation of state of dense matter through radiusmeasurements.

1309.1473	on the observed duration distribution of gamma-ray bursts from  collapsars	the duration of the prompt emission of long gamma-ray bursts is generallyconsidered to be fairly similar to the duration of the activity of the enginein the center of the progenitor star. here, we investigate the relation betweenthe duration of the engine activity and that of the observed light curve, usinginputs from both numerical simulations and observations. we find that theobserved burst duration is a good proxy for the engine duration after the timenecessary for the jet to break out the star's surface is subtracted. however,the observed duration is a function of the viewing angle and can besignificantly shorter than the duration of the engine activity. we also showthat the observed, redshift-corrected burst duration evolves only moderatelywith redshift for both observations and synthetic light curves. we concludethat the broad distribution of the observed duration of long batse gamma-raybursts is mostly accounted for by an engine lasting ~20 s, the dispersion beingdue to viewing and redshift effects. our results do not rule out the existenceof engines with very long duration. however, we find that they are constrainedto be a small minority of the batse detected bursts.

1312.4981	the fate of fallback matter around newly born compact objects	the presence of fallback disks around young neutron stars has been invokedover the years to explain a large variety of phenomena. here we perform anumerical investigation of the formation of such disks during a supernovaexplosion, considering both neutron star (ns) and black hole (bh) remnants.using the public code mesa, we compute the angular momentum distribution of thepre-supernova material, for stars with initial masses m in the range 13 - 40msun, initial surface rotational velocities vsurf between 25% and 75% of thecritical velocity, and for metallicities z of 1%, 10% and 100% of the solarvalue. these pre sn models are exploded with energies e varying between 10^{50}- 3x10^{52} ergs, and the amount of fallback material is computed. we findthat, if magnetic torques play an important role in angular momentum transport,then fallback disks around nss, even for low-metallicity main sequence stars,are not an outcome of sn explosions. formation of such disks around young nsscan only happen under the condition of negligible magnetic torques and afine-tuned explosion energy. for those stars which leave behind bh remnants,disk formation is ubiquitous if magnetic fields do not play a strong role;however, unlike the ns case, even with strong magnetic coupling in theinterior, a disk can form in a large region of the {z,m,vsurf,e} parameterspace. together with the compact, hyperaccreting fallback disks widelydiscussed in the literature, we identify regions in the above parameter spacewhich lead to extended, long-lived disks around bhs. we find that the physicalconditions in these disks may be conducive to planet formation, hence leadingto the possible existence of planets orbiting black holes.

1406.0874	spectral features in isolated neutron stars induced by inhomogeneous  surface temperatures	the thermal x-ray spectra of several isolated neutron stars displaydeviations from a pure blackbody. the accurate physical interpretation of thesespectral features bears profound implications for our understanding of theatmospheric composition, magnetic field strength and topology, and equation ofstate of dense matter. with specific details varying from source to source,common explanations for the features have ranged from atomic transitions in themagnetized atmospheres or condensed surface, to cyclotron lines generated in ahot ionized layer near the surface. here we quantitatively evaluate the x-rayspectral distortions induced by inhomogeneous temperature distributions of theneutron star surface. to this aim, we explore several surface temperaturedistributions, we simulate their corresponding general relativistic x-rayspectra (assuming an isotropic, blackbody emission), and fit the latter with asingle blackbody model. we find that, in some cases, the presence of a spurious'spectral line' is required at a high significance level in order to obtainstatistically acceptable fits, with central energy and equivalent width similarto the values typically observed. we also perform a fit to a specific object,rx j0806.4-4123, finding several surface temperature distributions able tomodel the observed spectrum. the explored effect is unlikely to work in allsources with detected lines, but in some cases it can indeed be responsible forthe appearance of such lines. our results enforce the idea that surfacetemperature anisotropy can be an important factor that should be considered andexplored also in combination with more sophisticated emission models likeatmospheres.

1406.1503	the luminosity and stellar mass functions of grb host galaxies: insight  into the metallicity bias	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are powerful probes of the universestar formation history, but correlation between the two depends on the highlydebated presence/strength of a metallicity bias. to investigate thiscorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes starformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,applying it to grb production. we predict luminosities, stellar masses, andmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. ourbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistentwith the large majority of long-duration grbs in metal-poor environmentsoriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondarycontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binaryevolution. because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximumlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominantat z&lt;2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.this possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-biasbased on low-z samples. however, while metallicity predictions matchobservations well at high redshift, there is tension with low redshiftobservations, since a significant fraction of grb hosts are predicted to have(near-)solar metallicity. this is in contrast to observations, unless obscured,metal-rich hosts are preferentially missed in current datasets, and suggeststhat lower efficiencies of the metal-independent grb channel might be preferredfollowing a comprehensive fit from complete samples. overall, we are able toestablish the presence of a metallicity bias for grb production, but continuedcharacterization of grb host galaxies is needed to quantify its strength.

0803.2042	constraints on the emission and viewing geometry of the transient  anomalous x-ray pulsar xte j1810-197	the temporal decay of the flux components of transient anomalous x-ray pulsarxte j1810-197 following its 2002 outburst presents a unique opportunity toprobe the emission geometry of a magnetar. toward this goal, we model themagnitude of the pulsar's modulation in narrow spectral bands over time.following previous work, we assume that the post-outburst flux is produced intwo distinct thermal components arising from a hot spot and a warm concentricring. we include general relativistic effects on the blackbody spectra due togravitational redshift and light bending near the stellar surface, whichstrongly depend on radius. this affects the model fits for the temperature andsize of the emission regions. for the hot spot, the observed temporal andenergy-dependent pulse modulation is found to require an anisotropic,pencil-beamed radiation pattern. we are able to constrain an allowed range forthe angles that the line-of-sight (psi) and the hot spot pole (xi) make withrespect to the spin-axis. within errors, this is defined by the locus of pointsin the xi-psi plane that lie along the line (xi+beta(r))(psi+beta(r)) ~constant, where beta(r) is a function of the radius r of the star. for acanonical value of r=12 km, the viewing parameters range from psi=xi=37 deg to(psi,xi)=(85 deg,15 deg). we discuss our results in the context of magnetaremission models.

1408.0013	gravitational waves from massive magnetars formed in binary neutron star  mergers	binary neutron star (ns) mergers are among the most promising sources ofgravitational waves (gws), as well as candidate progenitors for short gamma-raybursts (sgrbs). depending on the total initial mass of the system, and the nsequation of state (eos), the post-merger phase can see a prompt collapse to ablack hole, or the formation of a supramassive ns, or even a stable ns. in thecase of post-merger ns (pmns) formation, magnetic field amplification duringthe merger will produce a magnetar with a large induced mass quadrupole moment,and millisecond spin. if the timescale for orthogonalization of the magneticsymmetry axis with the spin axis is sufficiently short the ns will radiate itsspin down energy primarily via gws. here we study this scenario for variousoutcomes of ns formation: we generalise the set of equilibrium states for atwisted torus magnetic configuration to include solutions that, at a fixedexterior dipole field, carry a larger magnetic energy reservoir; we hencecompute their magnetic ellipticity and the strength of the expected gw signalas a function of the magnitude of the dipole and toroidal field. the relativenumber of gw detections from pmnss and from binary nss is a strong function ofthe ns equation of state (eos), being higher (~ 1%) for the stiffest eoss andnegligibly small for the softest ones. for intermediate-stiffness eoss, such asthe n=4/7 polytrope recently used by giacomazzo \&amp; perna or the gm1 used bylasky et al., the relative fraction is ~0.3%; correspondingly we estimate a gwdetection rate from stable pmnss of ~ (0.1-1) yr$^{-1}$ with advanceddetectors, and of ~ (100-1000) yr$^{-1}$ with third generation detectors suchas the einstein telescope. measurement of such gw signal would provide strongconstraints on the ns eos and on the nature of the binary progenitors givingrise to sgrbs.

1409.1250	high resolution transmission spectroscopy as a diagnostic for jovian  exoplanet atmospheres: constraints from theoretical models	we present high resolution transmission spectra of giant planet atmospheresfrom a coupled 3-d atmospheric dynamics and transmission spectrum model thatincludes doppler shifts which arise from winds and planetary motion. we modeljovian planets covering more than two orders of magnitude in incident flux,corresponding to planets with 0.9 to 55 day orbital periods around solar-typestars. the results of our 3-d dynamical models reveal certain aspects of highresolution transmission spectra that are not present in simple 1-d models. wefind that the hottest planets experience strong substellar to anti-stellar(ssas) winds, resulting in transmission spectra with net blue shifts of up to 3km s$^{-1}$, whereas less irradiated planets show almost no net doppler shifts.compared to 1-d models, peak line strengths are significantly reduced for thehottest atmospheres owing to doppler broadening from a combination of rotation(which is faster for close-in planets under the assumption of tidal locking)and atmospheric winds. finally, high resolution transmission spectra may beuseful in studying the atmospheres of exoplanets with optically thick cloudssince line cores for very strong transitions should remain optically thick tovery high altitude. high resolution transmission spectra are an excellentobservational test for the validity of 3-d atmospheric dynamics models, becausethey provide a direct probe of wind structures and heat circulation.ground-based exoplanet spectroscopy is currently on the verge of being able toverify some of our modeling predictions, most notably the dependence of ssaswinds on insolation. we caution that interpretation of high resolutiontransmission spectra based on 1-d atmospheric models may be inadequate, as 3-datmospheric motions can produce a noticeable effect on the absorptionsignatures.

0805.0138	x-ray flares, neutrino cooled disks, and the dynamics of late accretion  in grb engines	we compute the average luminosity of x-ray flares as a function of time, fora sample of 10 long-duration gamma-ray burst afterglows. the mean luminosity,averaged over a timescale longer than the duration of the individual flares,declines as a power-law in time with index ~-1.5. we elaborate on theproperties of the central engine that can produce such a decline. assuming thatthe engine is an accreting compact object, and for a standard conversion factorbetween accretion rate and jet luminosity, the switch between a neutrino-cooledthin disk and a non-cooled thick disk takes place at the transition from theprompt to the flaring phase. we discuss the implications of this coincidenceunder different scenarios for the powering of the grb outflow. we also showthat the interaction of the outflow with the envelope of the progenitor starcannot produce flares out of a continuous relativistic flow, and conclude thatit is the dynamics of the disk or the jet-launching mechanism that generates anintrinsically unsteady outflow on timescales much longer than the dynamicaltimescale of the system. this is consistent with the fact that x-ray flares areobserved in short-duration grbs as well as in long-duration ones.

1507.02689	modelling of the surface emission of the low-magnetic field magnetar sgr  0418+5729	we perform a detailed modelling of the post-outburst surface emission of thelow magnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729. the dipolar magnetic field of thissource, b=6x10^12 g estimated from its spin-down rate, is in the observed rangeof magnetic fields for normal pulsars. the source is further characterized by ahigh pulse fraction and a single-peak profile. using synthetic temperaturedistribution profiles, and fully accounting for the general-relativisticeffects of light deflection and gravitational redshift, we generate syntheticx-ray spectra and pulse profiles that we fit to the observations. we find thatasymmetric and symmetric surface temperature distributions can reproduceequally well the observed pulse profiles and spectra of sgr 0418. nonetheless,the modelling allows us to place constraints on the system geometry (i.e. theangles $\psi$ and $\xi$ that the rotation axis makes with the line of sight andthe dipolar axis, respectively), as well as on the spot size and temperaturecontrast on the neutron star surface. after performing an analysis iteratingbetween the pulse profile and spectra, as done in similar previous works, wefurther employed, for the first time in this context, a markov-chainmonte-carlo approach to extract constraints on the model parameters from thepulse profiles and spectra, simultaneously. we find that, to reproduce theobserved spectrum and flux modulation: (a) the angles must be restricted to$65\deg &lt; \psi+\xi &lt; 125\deg$ or $235\deg &lt; \psi+\xi &lt;295\deg$; (b) thetemperature contrast between the poles and the equator must be at least afactor of $\sim6$, and (c) the size of the hottest region ranges between0.2-0.7 km (including uncertainties on the source distance). last, we interpretour findings within the context of internal and external heating models.

1509.05406	the imprint of the cosmic supermassive black hole growth history on the  21 cm background radiation	the redshifted 21 cm transition line of hydrogen tracks the thermal evolutionof the neutral intergalactic medium (igm) at "cosmic dawn," during theemergence of the first luminous astrophysical objects (~100 myr after the bigbang) but before these objects ionized the igm (~400-800 myr after the bigbang). because x-rays, in particular, are likely to be the chief energy courierfor heating the igm, measurements of the 21 cm signature can be used to inferknowledge about the first astrophysical x-ray sources. using analytic argumentsand a numerical population synthesis algorithm, we argue that the progenitorsof supermassive black holes (smbhs) should be the dominant source of hardastrophysical x-rays---and thus the primary driver of igm heating and the 21 cmsignature---at redshifts $z &lt; 20$, if (i) they grow readily from the remnantsof population iii stars and (ii) produce x-rays in quantities comparable towhat is observed from active galactic nuclei and high-mass x-ray binaries. weshow that models satisfying these assumptions dominate over contributions toigm heating from stellar populations, and cause the 21 cm brightnesstemperature to rise at $z &gt; 20$. an absence of such a signature in theforthcoming observational data would imply that smbh formation occurred later(e.g. via so-called direct collapse scenarios), that it was not a commonoccurrence in early galaxies and protogalaxies, or that it produced far fewerx-rays than empirical trends at lower redshifts, either due to intrinsicdimness (radiative inefficiency) or compton-thick obscuration close to thesource.

1509.05427	formation, disruption and energy output of population iii x-ray binaries	the first astrophysical objects shaped the cosmic environment by reionizingand heating the intergalactic medium (igm). in particular, x-rays are veryefficient at heating the igm before it became completely ionized, an effectthat can be measured through the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. high-massx-ray binaries (hmxbs), known to be prolific x-ray sources in star-forminggalaxies at lower redshifts, are prime candidates for driving the thermalevolution of the igm at redshifts $z &gt; 20$. despite their importance, theformation efficiency of hmxbs from the first stellar populations is not wellunderstood---as such, their collective x-ray emission and the subsequentimprint on the 21 cm signature are usually evaluated using free parameters.using $n$-body simulations, we estimate the rate of hmxb formation via mutualgravitational interactions of nascent, small groups of the first stars (pop iiistars). we run two sets of calculations: one in which stars form in smallgroups of five in nearly keplerian initial orbits, and another in which twosuch groups collide (expected from mergers of host protogalaxies). we find thathmxbs form at a rate of one per $~10^{4}~{\rm m}_{\odot}$ in newly born stars,and that they emit with a power of $\sim 10^{41} ~{\rm erg}~{\rm s} ^{-1}$ inthe $2-10$ kev band per solar mass per year of star formation. this value is afactor $\sim 10^{2}$ larger than what is observed in star forming galaxies atlower redshifts; the x-ray production from early hmxbs would have been evenmore copious, if they also formed $in$ $situ$ or via migration in protostellardisks. combining our results with earlier studies suggests that early hmxbswere highly effective at heating the igm and leaving a strong 21 cm signature.we discuss broader implications of our results, such as the rate of long grbsfrom popiii stars and the direct collapse black hole formation.

astro-ph;0005443	gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of galactic and intergalactic dust	the amount and properties of high-redshift galactic and intergalactic (ig)dust are largely unknown, but could be investigated using multi-wavelengthphotometry of high-z objects that have a known intrinsic spectrum. observationsof gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows appear to support the theoretical model ofan adiabatic blast wave expanding into an external medium. in this model, thesynchrotron peak flux is independent of frequency, providing a flat spectrumwhen observed over time, and therefore allowing straightforward measurement ofthe relative attenuation of afterglow flux in widely separated bands. applyingthis method to dust extinction, we show that for a sample of afterglows whichhave been corrected by galactic extinction, comparison between the numbercounts of peak fluxes in x-ray versus optical can provide constraints on anintergalactic component of dust. a similar technique can probe theredshift-dependence of extinction in grb-forming regions without requiring anassumed relation between extinction and reddening by the dust. probingsystematic changes in extinction with redshift - particularly in ig and/ornon-reddening dust - is crucial to a proper interpretation of the type iasupernova hubble diagram and similar observations, and useful in understandinggrb progenitor environments.

astro-ph;0102478	stability and evolution of supernova fallback disks	we show that thin accretion disks made of carbon or oxygen are subject to thesame thermal ionization instability as hydrogen and helium disks. we argue thatthe instability applies to disks of any metal content. the relevance of theinstability to supernova fallback disks probably means that their power-lawevolution breaks down when they first become neutral. we construct simpleanalytical models for the viscous evolution of fallback disks to show that itis possible for these disks to become neutral when they are still young (agesof a few 10^3 to 10^4 years), compact in size (a few 10^9 cm to 10^11 cm) andgenerally accreting at sub-eddington rates (mdot ~ a few 10^14 - 10^18 g/s).based on recent results on the nature of viscosity in the disks of closebinaries, we argue that this time may also correspond to the end of the diskactivity period. indeed, in the absence of a significant source of viscosity inthe neutral phase, the entire disk will likely turn to dust and become passive.we discuss various applications of the evolutionary model, including anomalousx-ray pulsars and young radio pulsars. our analysis indicates that metal-richfallback disks around newly-born neutron stars and black holes become neutralgenerally inside the tidal truncation radius (roche limit) for planets, at\~10^11 cm. consequently, the efficiency of the planetary formation process inthis context will mostly depend on the ability of the resulting disk of rocksto spread via collisions beyond the roche limit. it appears easier for themerger product of a doubly degenerate binary, whether it is a massive whitedwarf or a neutron star, to harbor planets because it can spread beyond theroche limit before becoming neutral.[abridged]

astro-ph;0207319	neutrino trapping and accretion models for gamma-ray bursts	many models of gamma ray bursts invoke a central engine consisting of a blackhole of a few solar masses accreting matter from a disk at a rate of a fractionto a few solar masses per second. popham et al. and narayan et al. have shownthat, for mdot &gt;~ 0.1 msun/s, accretion proceeds via neutrino cooling andneutrinos can carry away a significant amount of energy from the inner regionsof the disks. we improve on these calculations by including a simpleprescription for neutrino transfer and neutrino opacities in such regions. wefind that the flows become optically thick to neutrinos inside a radiusr~6-40r_s for mdot in the range of 0.1 -10 msun/s, where r_s is the black holeschwarzchild radius. most of the neutrino emission comes from outside thisregion and, the neutrino luminosity stays roughly constant at a value l_{\nu} ~10^{53} erg/s. we show that, for mdot &gt; 1 msun/s, neutrinos are sufficientlytrapped that energy advection becomes the dominant cooling mechanism in theflow. these results imply that neutrino annihilation in hyperaccreting blackholes is an inefficient mechanism for liberating large amounts of energy.extraction of rotational energy by magnetic processes remains the most viablemechanism.

astro-ph;0211235	time-dependent photoionization in a dusty medium ii: evolution of dust  distributions and optical opacities	the interaction of a radiation field with a dusty medium is a relevant issuein several astrophysical contexts. we use the time-dependent photoionizationcode in a dusty medium developed by perna &amp; lazzati (2002), to study themodifications in the dust distribution and the relative optical opacities whena strong x-ray uv radiation flux propagates into a medium. we find thatsilicates are preferentially destroyed with respect to graphite, and theextinction curve becomes significantly flatter (hence implying less reddening),with the characteristic bump at lambda 2175 a highly suppressed, due to thedestruction of the small graphite grains. this could explain the observationallack of such a feature in grb afterglow and agn spectra. for a very intense andhighly variable source irradiating a compact and dense region, time variabilityin the optical opacity resulting from dust destruction can be observed on arelatively short timescale. we show that, under these circumstances, monitoringthe time variability of the opacity can yield powerful clues on the propertiesof dust in the environment of the source. in particular, it allows to break theobservational degeneracy as to whether a grey extinction is the result of a lowdust-to-gas ratio or of a dust grain distribution that is skewed towards largegrains.

astro-ph;0212105	time-dependent photoionization in a dusty medium. iii: the effect of  dust on the photoionization of metals	we use the time-dependent photoionization and dust destruction code developedby perna &amp; lazzati (2002) to study the time evolution of the medium in a dustygaseous cloud illuminated by a bright central source that sets on at time zero.we study the case of a bright source, which lasts for a time scale much smallerthan the recombination and dust creation time scales. for this reason anequilibrium is never reached. we show that the presence of dust and itsproperties, such as its composition, can have a big effect on the time scalefor the evaporation of the soft x-ray absorption, in particular for ionizingsources with hard spectra. we discuss the profile of evaporation of the softx-ray absorbing column, as well as how the apparent ionization state of thecloud evolves in time. we finally consider the apparent metallicity of thecloud that is left behind as a function of the cloud and ionizing sourceproperties.

astro-ph;0305145	jets in grbs: tests and predictions for the structured jet model	the two leading interpretations of achromatic breaks that are observed in thelight curves of grbs afterglow are (i) the manifestation of the edge of a jet,which has a roughly uniform energy profile and a sharp edge and (ii) a line ofsight effect in jets with a variable energy profile. the first scenariorequires the inner engine to produce a jet with a different opening angle eachexplosion, while the latter requires a standard engine. the physical structureof the jet is a crucial factor in understanding grb progenitors, and thereforediscriminating the two jet scenarios is particularly relevant. in thestructured jet case, specific predictions can be made for the distribution ofobserved break angles $\theta_{\rm break}$, while that distribution isarbitrary in the first scenario. we derive the theoretical distribution for thestructured jet model. specifically, we predict the most common angle to beabout 0.12 rad, in rough agreement with the sample. if this agreement wouldhold as the sample size increases, it would strengthen the case for thestandard jet hypothesis. we show that a prediction of this model is that theaverage viewing angle is an increasing function of the survey sensitivity, andin particular that a mission like {\em swift} will find the typical viewingangle to be about 0.3 rad. the local event rate predicted by this model is$r_{\rm grb}(z=0)\sim 0.5 $ gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0305421	bondi accretion and the problem of the missing isolated neutron stars	a large number of neutron stars (nss), ~10^9, populate the galaxy, but only atiny fraction of them is observable during the short radio pulsar lifetime. themajority of these isolated nss, too cold to be detectable by their own thermalemission, should be visible in x-rays as a result of accretion from theinterstellar medium. the rosat all sky survey has however shown that suchaccreting isolated nss are very elusive: only a few tentative candidates havebeen identified, contrary to theoretical predictions that up to severalthousands should be seen. we suggest that the fundamental reason for thisdiscrepancy lies in the use of the standard bondi formula to estimate theaccretion rates. we compute the expected source counts using updated estimatesof the pulsar velocity distribution, realistic hydrogen atmosphere spectra, anda modified expression for the bondi accretion rate as suggested by recent mhdsimulations, and supported by direct observations in the case of accretionaround supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies and in our own. we findthat, whereas the inclusion of atmospheric spectra partly compensates for thereduction in the counts due to the higher mean velocities of the newdistribution, the modified bondi formula dramatically suppresses the sourcecounts. the new predictions are consistent with a null detection at the rosatsensitivity.

astro-ph;0401253	are supershells powered by multiple supernovae? modeling the radio  pulsar population produced by ob associations	traditional searches for radio pulsars have targeted individual small regionssuch as supernova remnants or globular clusters, or have covered largecontiguous regions of the sky. none of these searches has been specificallydirected towards giant supershells, some of which are likely to have beenproduced by multiple supernova (sn) explosions from an ob association. here weperform a montecarlo simulation of the pulsar population associated withsupershells powered by multiple sne. we predict that several tens of radiopulsars could be detected with current instruments associated with the largestgalactic supershells (with kinetic energies &gt;~ 10^{53} ergs), and a few pulsarswith the smaller ones. we test these predictions for some of the supershellswhich lie in regions covered by past pulsar surveys. for the smallersupershells, our results are consistent with the few detected pulsars perbubble. for the giant supershell gsh 242-03+37, we find the multiple snhypothesis inconsistent with current data at the 95% level. we stress theimportance of undertaking deep pulsar surveys in correlation with supershells.failure to detect any pulsar enhancement in the largest of them would putserious constraints on the multiple sn origin for them. conversely, thediscovery of the pulsar population associated with a supershell would allow adifferent/independent approach to the study of pulsar properties.

astro-ph;0407561	accretion flows in early-type galaxies and cmb experiments	we investigate the possible contribution from the emission of accretion flowsaround supermassive black holes in early type galaxies to current measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) at radio frequencies. we consider arange of luminosities suggested by targeted radio observations and accretionmodels and compute the residual contribution of these sources to the spectrumand bispectrum of the observed cmb maps. as for high-resolution cmbexperiments, we find that the unresolved component of these sources could makeup to ~40-50% of the observed cbi and bima power spectrum at l &gt; 2000. as aconsequence, the inferred sigma_8^{sz} value could be biased high by up to6-7%. as for all sky experiments, we find that the contribution ofaccretion-flow sources to the wmap bispectrum is at the 2-3 per cent level atmost. at the flux limit that planck will achieve, however, these sources maycontribute up to 15 per cent of the bispectrum in the 60-100 ghz frequencyrange. moreover, planck should detect hundreds of these sources in the 30-300ghz frequency window. these detections, possibly coupled with galaxy typeconfirmation from optical surveys, will allow number counts to put tighterconstraints on early-type galaxies radio luminosity and accretion flowsproperties. these sources may also contribute up to the 30 per cent level tothe residual radio sources power spectrum in future high-resolution sz surveys(like act or apex) reaching mjy flux limits.

astro-ph;0501233	constraints on the small-scale power spectrum of density fluctuations  from high-redshift gamma-ray bursts	cosmological models that include suppression of the power spectrum of densityfluctuations on small scales exhibit an exponential reduction of high-redshift,non-linear structures, including a reduction in the rate of gamma ray bursts(grbs). here we quantify the constraints that the detection of distant grbswould place on structure formation models with reduced small-scale power. wecompute the number of grbs that could be detectable by the swift satellite athigh redshifts (z &gt; 6), assuming that the grbs trace the cosmic star formationhistory, which itself traces the formation of non-linear structures. wecalibrate simple models of the intrinsic luminosity function of the bursts tothe number and flux distribution of grbs observed by the burst and transientsource experiment (batse). we find that a discovery of high-z grbs would implystrong constraints on models with reduced small-scale power. for example, asingle grb at z &gt; 10, or 10 grbs at z &gt; 5, discovered by swift during itsscheduled two-year mission, would rule out an exponential suppression of thepower spectrum on scales below r_c=0.09 mpc (exemplified by warm dark mattermodels with a particle mass of m_x=2 kev). models with a less sharp suppressionof small-scale power, such as those with a red tilt or a running scalar index,n_s, are more difficult to constrain, because they are more degenerate with anincrease in the power spectrum normalization, sigma_8, and with models in whichstar-formation is allowed in low-mass minihalos. we find that a tilt of \deltan_s ~ 0.1 is difficult to detect; however, an observed rate of 1 grb/yr at z &gt;12 would yield an upper limit on the running of the spectral index, alpha =d(n_s)/d(ln k) &gt; -0.05.

astro-ph;0501345	dynamical evolution of intermediate mass black holes and their  observable signatures in the nearby universe	we investigate the consequences of a model of the assembly and growth ofmassive black holes from primordial seeds, remnants of the first generation ofstars in a hierarchical structure formation scenario. our model traces thebuild-up of mbhs from an early epoch, and follows the merger history of darkmatter halos and their associated holes via monte carlo realizations of themerger hierarchy from early times to the present time. the sequence of minorand major mergers experienced by galactic halos in their hierarchical growthaffects the merger history of mbhs embedded in their nuclei. so, if theformation route for the assembly of smbhs dates back to the early universe, alarge number of bh interactions is inevitable. binary black holes coalescencetimescales can be long enough for a third bh to fall in and interact with thecentral binary. these bh triple interactions lead typically to the finalexpulsion of one of the three bodies and to the recoil of the binary. also,asymmetric emission of gravitational waves in the last stages of the black holemerging can give a recoil velocity to the centre of mass of the coalescingbinary. this scenario leads to the prediction of a population of intermediatemass bhs (imbhs) wandering in galaxy halos at the present epoch. we compute theluminosity distribution produced by these imbhs accreting from theircircumstellar medium. we find that in a milky way-sized galaxy they are unableto account for sources with luminosities &gt; 1e39 erg/s unless they carry abaryonic remnant from which they are able to accrete for a long time. we alsofind that, for typical spiral galaxies, the bright end of the point sourcedistribution correlates with the mass of the galaxy, and the most luminoussources are expected to be found in the disk.

astro-ph;0502300	afterglow observations shed new light on the nature of x-ray flashes	x-ray flashes (xrfs) and x-ray rich gamma-ray bursts (xrgrbs) share manyobservational characteristics with long duration grbs, but the reason for whichtheir prompt emission peaks at lower photon energies, $e_p$, is still underdebate. although many different models have been invoked in order to explainthe lower $e_p$ values, their implications for the afterglow emission were notconsidered in most cases, mainly because observations of xrf afterglows havebecome available only recently. here we examine the predictions of the variousxrf models for the afterglow emission, and test them against the observationsof xrf 030723 and xrgrb 041006, the events with the best monitored afterglowlight curves in their respective class. we show that most existing xrf modelsare hard to reconcile with the observed afterglow light curves, which are veryflat at early times. such light curves are, however, naturally produced by aroughly uniform jet with relatively sharp edges that is viewed off-axis (i.e.from outside of the jet aperture). this type of model self consistentlyaccommodates both the observed prompt emission and the afterglow light curvesof xrgrb 041006 and xrf 030723, implying viewing angles $\theta_{obs}$ from thejet axis of $(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)\sim 0.15\theta_0$ and $\sim \theta_0$,respectively, where $\theta_0\sim 3$ deg is the jet half-opening angle. thissuggests that grbs, xrgrbs and xrfs are intrinsically similar relativistic jetsviewed from different angles, corresponding to $\gamma(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)$of less than 1, between 1 and a few, and more than a few, respectively, where$\gamma$ is the lorentz factor. future observations with swift could help testthis unification scheme in which grbs, xrgrbs and xrfs share the same basicphysics and differ only by their orientation relative to our line of sight.

astro-ph;0511285	on the spin-up/spin-down transitions in accreting x-ray binaries	accreting x-ray binaries display a wide range of behaviours. some of them areobserved to spin up steadily, others to alternate between spin-up and spin-downstates, sometimes superimposed on a longer trend of either spin up or spindown. here we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of thedisk-magnetosphere interaction. our model, based on the simplest version of apurely material torque, accounts for the fact that, when a neutron star is inthe propeller regime, a fraction of the ejected material does not receiveenough energy to completely unbind, and hence falls back into the disk. we showthat the presence of this feedback mass component causes the occurrence ofmultiple states available to the system, for a given, constant value of themass accretion rate dot{m}_* from the companion star. if the angle chi of themagnetic dipole axis with respect to the perpendicular to the disk is largerthan a critical value chi_crit, the system eventually settles in a cycle ofspin-up/spin-down transitions for a constant value of dot{m}_* and independentof the initial conditions. no external perturbations are required to induce thetorque reversals. the transition from spin up to spin down is often accompaniedby a large drop in luminosity. the frequency range spanned in each cycle andthe timescale for torque reversals depend on dot{m}_*, the magnetic field ofthe star, the magnetic colatitude chi, and the degree of elasticity regulatingthe magnetosphere-disk interaction. the critical angle chi_crit ranges from\~25-30 deg for a completely elastic interaction to ~40-45 deg for a totallyanelastic one. for chi ~&lt; chi_crit, cycles are no longer possible and thelong-term evolution of the system is a pure spin up. we specifically illustrateour model in the cases of the x-ray binaries gx 1+4 and 4u 1626-67.

astro-ph;0511506	flares in long and short gamma-ray bursts: a common origin in a  hyperaccreting accretion disk	early-time x-ray observations of grbs with the swift satellite have revealeda more complicated phenomenology than was known before. in particular, thepresence of flaring activity on a wide range of time scales probably requireslate-time energy production within the grb engine. since the flaring activityis observed in both long and short grbs, its origin must be within what is incommon for the two likely progenitors of the two classes of bursts: ahyperaccreting accretion disk around a black hole of a few solar masses. here,we show that some of the observational properties of the flares, such as theduration-time scale correlation, and the duration-peak luminosityanticorrelation displayed by most flares within a given burst, arequalitatively consistent with viscous disk evolution, provided that the disk atlarge radii either fragments or otherwise suffers large amplitude variability.we discuss the physical conditions in the outer parts of the disk, and concludethat gravitational instability, possibly followed by fragmentation, is the mostlikely candidate for this variability.

astro-ph;0610730	x-ray flares and the duration of engine activity in gamma-ray bursts	the detection of bright x-ray flares superimposed on the regular afterglowdecay in swift gamma-ray bursts has triggered theoretical speculations on theirorigin. we study the temporal properties of flares due to internal dissipationand external shock mechanisms. we first show that at least a sizable fractionof the flares cannot be related to external shock mechanisms, since externalshock flares evolve on much longer time scales than observed. we then studyflares from internal dissipation, showing that the temporal properties allow usto distinguish the emission of slow early shells from that of late fastershells. we show that, due to the rapid evolution of the detected flares, it ismost likely that the flares are produced by relatively fast shells ejected bythe central engine shortly before they are observed. this implies that thecentral engine must be active for, in some cases, as long as one day. wefinally discuss the constraints and implications that this observation has onthe properties and physics of the inner engine, and we elaborate on possiblefuture observational tests on the flare sample to further understand theirorigin and physics.

astro-ph;9701226	microlensing of quasars by stars in their damped lyman alpha absorbers	the damped lyman alpha absorbers (dlas) in quasar spectra are believed to bethe progenitors of present-day disk galaxies. we examine the probability formicrolensing of background quasars by stars in their dlas. microlensing by anindividual star should magnify the continuum but not the broad emission linesof the quasars. consequently, the equivalent width distribution of microlensedquasars would be distorted. we model a representative spiral galaxy as a closedsystem composed of a bulge, a disk, and a halo, and evolve the mass fraction ofstars in the disk based on the observed metallicity of dlas at high redshifts.the microlensing signatures are stronger if the halo of the galaxy is made ofmassive compact halo objects (machos). in this case, the distortion imprintedby microlensing on the equivalent width distribution of quasar emission linescan be detected with high significance in a sample of about 10 dlas with hicolumn densities n&gt;10^21 cm^-2 and absorption redshifts z_abs&lt;1. about a tenthof all quasars with dlas (n&gt;10^20 cm^-2) might show excess variability ontimescales shorter than five years. a search for these signals would complementmicrolensing searches in local galaxies and calibrate the macho mass fractionin galactic halos at high redshifts.

astro-ph;9708159	microlensing of $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows	the afterglow of a cosmological gamma-ray burst (grb) should appear on thesky as a narrow emission ring of radius 3x10^{16}cm(t/day)^{5/8} which expandsfaster than light. after a day, the ring radius is comparable to the einsteinradius of a solar mass lens at a cosmological distance. thus, microlensing byan intervening star can modify significantly the lightcurve and polarizationsignal from a grb afterglow. we show that the achromatic amplification signalof the afterglow flux can be used to determine the impact parameter andexpansion rate of the source in units of the einstein radius of the lens, andprobe the superluminal nature of the expansion. if the synchrotron emissionfrom the afterglow photosphere originates from a set of coherent magnetic fieldpatches, microlensing would induce polarization variability due to thetransient magnification of the patches behind the lens. the microlensinginterpretation of the flux and polarization data can be confirmed by a parallaxexperiment which would probe the amplification peak at different times. thefraction of microlensed afterglows can be used to calibrate the densityparameter of stellar-mass objects in the universe.
