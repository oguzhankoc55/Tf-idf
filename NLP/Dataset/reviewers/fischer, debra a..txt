0704.1191	five intermediate-period planets from the n2k sample	we report the detection of five jovian mass planets orbiting high metallicitystars. four of these stars were first observed as part of the n2k program andexhibited low rms velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.however, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal thepresence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days toa few years. hd 11506 is a g0v star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a3.85 year orbit. hd 17156 is a g0v star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 dayorbit. the eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for aplanet with a relatively short period. the orbital period for this planetplaces it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have beendetected. hd 125612 is a g3v star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4year orbit. hd 170469 is a g5iv star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a3.13 year orbit. hd 231701 is an f8v star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142day orbit. all of these stars have supersolar metallicity. three of the fivestars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightnessvariability. a transit search conducted for hd 17156 was negative but coveredonly 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

0904.0965	astrometric detection of earthlike planets	astrometry can detect rocky planets in a broad range of masses and orbitaldistances and measure their masses and three-dimensional orbital parameters,including eccentricity and inclination, to provide the properties ofterrestrial planets. the masses of both the new planets and the known gasgiants can be measured unambiguously, allowing a direct calculation of thegravitational interactions, both past and future. such dynamical interactionsinform theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, includingearth-like planets. astrometry is the only technique technologically ready todetect planets of earth mass in the habitable zone (hz) around solar-type starswithin 20 pc. these earth analogs are close enough for follow-up observationsto characterize the planets by infrared imaging and spectroscopy with plannedfuture missions such as the james webb space telescope (jwst) and theterrestrial planet finder/darwin. employing a demonstrated astrometricprecision of 1 microarcsecond and a noise floor under 0.1 micro-arcseconds, simlite can make multiple astrometric measurements of the nearest 60 f-, g-, andk-type stars during a five-year mission. sim lite directly tests theories ofrocky planet formation and evolution around sun-like stars and identifies thenearest potentially habitable planets for later spaceborne imaging, e.g., withterrestrial planet finder and darwin. sim was endorsed by the two recentdecadal surveys and it meets the highest-priority goal of the 2008 aaacexoplanet task force.

0908.1705	refined stellar, orbital and planetary parameters of the eccentric  hat-p-2 planetary system	we present refined parameters for the extrasolar planetary system hat-p-2(also known as hd 147506), based on new radial velocity and photometric data.hat-p-2b is a transiting extrasolar planet that exhibits an eccentric orbit. wepresent a detailed analysis of the planetary and stellar parameters, yieldingconsistent results for the mass and radius of the star, better constraints onthe orbital eccentricity, and refined planetary parameters. the improvedparameters for the host star are m_star = 1.36 +/- 0.04 m_sun and r_star = 1.64+/- 0.08 r_sun, while the planet has a mass of m_p = 9.09 +/- 0.24 m_jup andradius of r_p = 1.16 +/- 0.08 r_jup. the refined transit epoch and period forthe planet are e = 2,454,387.49375 +/- 0.00074 (bjd) and p = 5.6334729 +/-0.0000061 (days), and the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are e= 0.5171 +/- 0.0033 and omega = 185.22 +/- 0.95 degrees. these orbital elementsallow us to predict the timings of secondary eclipses with a reasonableaccuracy of ~15 minutes. we also discuss the effects of this significanteccentricity including the characterization of the asymmetry in the transitlight curve. simple formulae are presented for the above, and these, in turn,can be used to constrain the orbital eccentricity using purely photometricdata. these will be particularly useful for very high precision, space-borneobservations of transiting planets.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1003.5549	a bayesian periodogram finds evidence for three planets in 47 ursae  majoris	a bayesian analysis of 47 ursae majoris (47 uma) radial velocity dataconfirms and refines the properties of two previously reported planets withperiods of 1079 and 2325 days and finds evidence for an additional long periodplanet with a period of approximately 10000 days. the three planet model isfound to be 10^5 times more probable than the next most probable model which isa two planet model. the nonlinear model fitting is accomplished with a newhybrid markov chain monte carlo (hmcmc) algorithm which incorporates paralleltempering, simulated annealing and genetic crossover operations. each of thesefeatures facilitate the detection of a global minimum in chi-squared. bycombining all three, the hmcmc greatly increases the probability of realizingthis goal. when applied to the kepler problem it acts as a powerfulmulti-planet kepler periodogram. the measured periods are 1078 \pm 2,2391{+100}{-87}, and 14002{+4018}{-5095}d, and the corresponding eccentricitiesare 0.032 \pm 0.014, 0.098{+.047}{-.096}, and 0.16{+.09}{-.16}. the resultsfavor low eccentricity orbits for all three. assuming the three signals (eachone consistent with a keplerian orbit) are caused by planets, the correspondinglimits on planetary mass (m sin i) and semi-major axis are (2.53{+.07}{-.06}mj,2.10\pm0.02au), (0.54\pm0.07mj, 3.6\pm0.1au), and (1.6{+0.3}{-0.5}mj,11.6{+2.1}{-2.9}au), respectively. we have also characterized a noise inducedeccentricity bias and designed a correction filter that can be used as analternate prior for eccentricity, to enhance the detection of planetary orbitsof low or moderate eccentricity.

1112.1725	the dynamical mass and three-dimensional orbit of hr7672b: a benchmark  brown dwarf with high eccentricity	the companion to the g0v star hr7672 directly imaged by liu et al. (2002) hasmoved measurably along its orbit since the discovery epoch, making it possibleto determine its dynamical properties. originally targeted with adaptive opticsbecause it showed a long-term radial velocity acceleration (trend), we havemonitored this star with precise doppler measurements and have now establisheda 24 year time baseline. the radial velocity variations show significantcurvature (change in the acceleration) including an inflection point. we havealso obtained a recent image of hr7672b with nirc2 at keck. the astrometry alsoshows curvature. in this paper, we use jointly-fitted doppler and astrometricmodels to calculate the three-dimensional orbit and dynamical mass of thecompanion. the mass of the host star is determined using a direct radiusmeasurement from chara interferometry in combination with high resolutionspectroscopic modeling. we find that hr7672b has a highly eccentric,$e=0.50^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, near edge-on, $i=97.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ deg, orbit withsemimajor axis, $a=18.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ au. the mass of the companion is$m=68.7^{+2.4}_{-3.1}m_j$ at the 68.2% confidence level. hr7672b thus residesnear the substellar boundary, just below the hydrogen-fusing limit. thesemeasurements of the companion mass are independent of its brightness andspectrum and establish hr7672b as a rare and precious "benchmark" brown dwarfwith a well-determined mass, age, and metallicity essential for testingtheoretical evolutionary models and synthetic spectral models. it is presentlythe only directly imaged l,t,y-dwarf known to produce an rv trend around asolar-type star.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1208.1268	improved spectroscopic parameters for transiting planet hosts	we report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effectivetemperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host starsof 56 transiting planets. our analysis is based primarily on the stellarparameter classification (spc) technique. we investigate systematic errors byexamining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been usedin previous studies (sme and moog). the spc and sme results, both based oncomparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strongcorrelations between temperature, [fe/h], and log g when solving for all threequantities simultaneously. in contrast the moog results, based on a moretraditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. to combat thecorrelations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, werepeat the spc analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellardensity that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves.previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have beensubject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and10%, respectively, which can be larger than other observational uncertainties,and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

1305.3228	an understanding of the shoulder of giants: jovian planets around late k  dwarf stars and the trend with stellar mass	analyses of exoplanet statistics suggest a trend of giant planet occurrencewith host star mass, a clue to how planets like jupiter form. one missing pieceof the puzzle is the occurrence around late k dwarf stars (masses of0.5-0.75msun and effective temperatures of 3900-4800k). we analyzed four yearsof doppler radial velocities data of 110 late k dwarfs, one of which hosts twopreviously reported giant planets. we estimate that 4.0+/-2.3% of these starshave saturn-mass or larger planets with orbital periods &lt;245d, depending on theplanet mass distribution and rv variability of stars without giant planets. wealso estimate that 0.7+/-0.5% of similar stars observed by kepler have giantplanets. this kepler rate is significantly (99% confidence) lower than thatderived from our doppler survey, but the difference vanishes if only the singledoppler system (hip 57274) with completely resolved orbits is considered. thedifference could also be explained by the exclusion of close binaries (withoutgiant planets) from the doppler but not kepler surveys, the effect oflong-period companions and stellar noise on the doppler data, or an intrinsicdifference between the two populations. our estimates for late k dwarfs bridgethose for solar-type stars and m dwarfs and support a positive trend withstellar mass. small sample size precludes statements about finer structure,e.g. a "shoulder" in the distribution of giant planets with stellar mass.future surveys such as the next generation transit survey and the transitingexoplanet satellite survey will ameliorate this deficiency.

1307.5842	the same frequency of planets inside and outside open clusters of stars	most stars and their planets form in open clusters. over 95 per cent of suchclusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubicparsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apartwithin a few hundred million years. older open clusters have survived by virtueof being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) whenthey formed. such clusters represent a stellar environment very different fromthe birthplace of the sun and other planet-hosting field stars. so far morethan 800 planets have been found around sun-like stars in the field. the fieldplanets are usually the size of neptune or smaller. in contrast, only fourplanets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with massessimilar to or greater than that of jupiter. here we report observations of thetransits of two sun-like stars by planets smaller than neptune in thebillion-year-old open cluster ngc6811. this demonstrates that small planets canform and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequencyand properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planetsaround field stars in the galaxy.

1307.8128	kepler-63b: a giant planet in a polar orbit around a young sun-like star	we present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting theyoung sun-like star kepler-63 (koi-63, $m_{\rm kp} = 11.6$, $t_{\rm eff} =5576$ k, $m_\star = 0.98\, m_\odot$). the planet transits every 9.43 days, withapparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots.the planet's radius is $6.1 \pm 0.2 r_{\earth}$, based on the transit lightcurve and the estimated stellar parameters. the planet's mass could not bemeasured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level ofstellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit we can place a rough upperbound of $120 m_{\earth}$ (3$\sigma$). the host star has a high obliquity($\psi$ = $104^{\circ}$), based on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and ananalysis of starspot-crossing events. this result is valuable because almostall previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets andshorter-period orbits. in addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined withan analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polarstarspot. such spots have previously been inferred using doppler tomography,and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young sun-like stars.

1407.3344	influence of stellar multiplicity on planet formation. ii. planets are  less common in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500 au	almost half of the stellar systems in the solar neighborhood are made up ofmultiple stars. in multiple-star systems, planet formation is under thedynamical influence of stellar companions, and the planet occurrence rate isexpected to be different from that for single stars. there have been numerousstudies on the planet occurrence rate of single star systems. however, to fullyunderstand planet formation, the planet occurrence rate in multiple-starsystems needs to be addressed. in this work, we {{infer}} the planet occurrencerate in multiple-star systems by measuring the stellar multiplicity rate forplanet host stars. for a sub-sample of 56 $kepler$ planet host stars, we useadaptive optics (ao) imaging and the radial velocity (rv) technique to searchfor stellar companions. the combination of these two techniques results in highsearch completeness for stellar companions. we detect 59 visual stellarcompanions to 25 planet host stars with ao data. {{three stellar companions arewithin 2$^{\prime\prime}$, and 27 within 6$^{\prime\prime}$. we also detect 2possible stellar companions (koi 5 and koi 69) showing long-term rvacceleration.}} after correcting for a bias against planet detection inmultiple-star systems due to flux contamination, we find that planet formationis suppressed in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500 au.specifically, we find that compared to single star systems, planets inmultiple-star systems occur $4.5\pm3.2$, $2.6\pm1.0$, and $1.7\pm0.5$ timesless frequently when a stellar companion is present at a distance of 10, 100,and 1000 au, respectively. this conclusion applies only to circumstellarplanets; the planet occurrence rate for circumbinary planets requires furtherinvestigation.

(2014). we validate 7 planet candidates that have planetconfidence over 0.997 (3-{\sigma} level). these validated planets include 3single-transit planets (kic-3558849b, kic-5951458b, and kic-8540376c), 3planets with double transits (kic-8540376b, kic-9663113b, and kic-10525077b),and 1 planet with 4 transits (kic-5437945b). this work provides assessmentregarding the existence of planets at wide separations and the associated falsepositive rate for transiting observation (17%-33%). more than half of thelong-period planets with at least three transits in this paper exhibit transittiming variations up to 41 hours, which suggest additional components thatdynamically interact with the transiting planet candidates. the nature of thesecomponents can be determined by follow-up radial velocity and transitobservations.

(sin i = 0.5), only good fits with both of the lowestorder, eccentricity-type mean-motion resonance variables at the 2:1commensurability, theta_1 and theta_2, librating about 0 deg. are stable. forsin i = 1, there are also some good fits with only theta_1 (involving the innerplanet's periapse longitude) librating that are stable for at least 10^8 years.the libration semiamplitudes are about 6 deg. for theta_1 and 10 deg. fortheta_2 for the stable good fit with the smallest libration amplitudes of boththeta_1 and theta_2. we do not find any good fits that are non-resonant andstable. thus the two planets in the hd 82943 system are almost certainly in 2:1mean-motion resonance, with at least theta_1 librating, and the observationsmay even be consistent with small-amplitude librations of both theta_1 andtheta_2.
