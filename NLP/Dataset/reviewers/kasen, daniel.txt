0907.0708	the diversity of type ia supernovae from broken symmetries	type ia supernovae result when carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systemsaccrete mass from companion stars, reach a critical mass, and explode. the nearuniformity of their light curves makes these supernovae good standard candlesfor measuring cosmic expansion, but a correction must be applied to account forthe fact that the brighter supernovae have broader light curves.one-dimensional modelling, with a certain choice of parameters, can reproducethis general trend in the width-luminosity relation, but the processes ofignition and detonation have recently been shown to be intrinsicallyasymmetric. here we report on multi-dimensional modelling of the explosionphysics and radiative transfer that reveals that the breaking of sphericalsymmetry is a critical factor in determining both the width luminosity relationand the observed scatter about it. the deviation from sphericity can alsoexplain the finite polarization detected in the light from some supernovae. theslope and normalization of the width-luminosity relation has a weak dependenceon certain properties of the white dwarf progenitor, in particular the traceabundances of elements other than carbon and oxygen. failing to correct forthis effect could lead to systematic overestimates of up to 2% in the distanceto remote supernovae.

0909.0275	seeing the collision of a supernova with its companion star	the progenitors of type ia and some core collapse supernovae are thought tobe stars in binary systems, but little observational evidence exists to confirmthe hypothesis. we suggest that the collision of the supernova ejecta with itscompanion star should produce detectable emission in the hours and daysfollowing the explosion. the interaction occurs at distances ~10^11-10^13 cmand shocks the impacting supernova debris, dissipating kinetic energy andre-heating the gas. initially, some radiation may escape promptly through theevacuated region of the shadowcone, producing a bright x-ray (0.1-2 kev) burstlasting minutes to hours with luminosity l ~ 10^44 ergs/s. continuing radiativediffusion from deeper layers of shock heated ejecta produces a longer lastingoptical/uv emission which exceeds the radioactively powered luminosity of thesupernova for the first few days after the explosion. these signatures areprominent for viewing angles looking down upon the shocked region, or about 10%of the time. the properties of the emission provide a straightforward measureof the separation distance between the stars and hence (assuming roche lobeoverflow) the companion's radius. current optical and uv data sets likelyalready constrain red giant companions. by systematically acquiring early timedata for many supernovae, it should eventually be possible to empiricallydetermine how the parameters of the progenitor system influence the outcome ofthe explosion.

0910.1590	type ii supernovae: model light curves and standard candle relationships	a survey of type ii supernovae explosion models has been carried out todetermine how their light curves and spectra vary with their mass, metallicity,and explosion energy. the presupernova models are taken from a recent survey ofmassive stellar evolution at solar metallicity supplemented by new calculationsat subsolar metallicity. explosions are simulated by the motion of a pistonnear the edge of the iron core and the resulting light curves and spectra arecalculated using full multi-wavelength radiation transport. formulae aredeveloped that describe approximately how the model observables (light curveluminosity and duration) scale with the progenitor mass, explosion energy, andradioactive nucleosynthesis. comparison with observational data shows that theexplosion energy of typical supernovae (as measured by kinetic energy atinfinity) varies by nearly an order of magnitude -- from 0.5 to 4.0 x 10^51ergs, with a typical value of ~0.9 x 10^51 ergs. despite the large variation,the models exhibit a tight relationship between luminosity and expansionvelocity, similar to that previously employed empirically to make sne iipstandardized candles. this relation is explained by the simple behavior ofhydrogen recombination in the supernova envelope, but we find a sensitivity toprogenitor metallicity and mass that could lead to systematic errors.additional correlations between light curve luminosity, duration, and colormight enable the use of sne iip to obtain distances accurate to ~20% using onlyphotometric data.

0911.0680	supernova light curves powered by young magnetars	we show that energy deposited into an expanding supernova remnant by a highlymagnetic (b ~ 5 x 10^14 g) neutron star spinning at an initial period of p ~2-20 ms can substantially brighten the light curve. for magnetars withparameters in this range, the rotational energy is released on a timescale ofdays to weeks, which is comparable to the effective diffusion time through thesupernova remnant. the late time energy injection can then be radiated withoutsuffering overwhelming adiabatic expansion losses. the magnetar input alsoproduces a central bubble which sweeps ejecta into an internal dense shell,resulting in a prolonged period of nearly constant photospheric velocity in theobserved spectra. we derive analytic expressions for the light curve rise timeand peak luminosity as a function of b, p and the properties of the supernovaejecta that allow for direct inferences about the underlying magnetar in brightsupernovae. we perform numerical radiation hydrodynamical calculations of a fewspecific instances and compare the resulting light curves to observed events.magnetar activity is likely to impact more than a few percent of all corecollapse supernovae, and may naturally explain some of the brightest eventsever seen (e.g., sn 2005ap and sn 2008es) at l &gt; 10^44 ergs/s.

0911.5358	optical transients from the unbound debris of tidal disruption	in the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, roughly half of thestellar mass becomes bound and falls into the black hole, while the other halfis ejected at high velocity. several previous studies have considered theemission resulting from the accretion of bound material; we consider thepossibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded andbecome transparent. we show that the gradual energy input from hydrogenrecombination compensates for adiabatic loses over significant expansionfactors. the opacity also drops dramatically with recombination, and theinternal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling-transparency wavepropagating from the surface layers inward. the result is a brief opticaltransient occurring ~1 week after disruption and lasting 3-5 days with peakluminosities of 10^40-10^42 ergs/s, depending on the mass of the disruptedstar. these recombination powered transients should accompany thex-ray/ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material, and so may be auseful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events, especially forlower and intermediate mass black holes.

1001.3428	the rise and fall of type ia supernova light curves in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we analyze the rise and fall times of type ia supernova (sn ia) light curvesdiscovered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. from a set of 391 light curvesk-corrected to the rest frame b and v bands, we find a smaller dispersion inthe rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. this is inqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations inradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of thedecline rates. the differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggestthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properlymodel the range of sn ia light curve shapes. we select a subset of 105 lightcurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves anddevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall timesindependently. we find the average time from explosion to b-band peakbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. our average rise time is shorter than the19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different lightcurve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. we findthat slow declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that thedistribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single-peaked. thisdistribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was firstsuggested by strovink (2007) from an analysis of a small set of local sne ia.we divide the sdss-ii sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, tr-tf&lt;= 2 days and tr-tf&gt;2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxyproperties and hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxyproperties or hubble residuals in our sample.

1002.2258	thermonuclear .ia supernovae from helium shell detonations: explosion  models and observables	during the early evolution of an am cvn system, helium is accreted onto thesurface of a white dwarf under conditions suitable for unstable thermonuclearignition. the turbulent motions induced by the convective burning phase in thehe envelope become strong enough to influence the propagation of burning frontsand may result in the onset of a detonation. such an outcome would yieldradioactive isotopes and a faint rapidly rising thermonuclear ".ia" supernova.in this paper, we present hydrodynamic explosion models and observable outcomesof these he shell detonations for a range of initial core and envelope masses.the peak uvoir bolometric luminosities range by a factor of 10 (from 5e41 -5e42 erg/s), and the r-band peak varies from m_r,peak = -15 to -18. the risetimes in all bands are very rapid (&lt;10 d), but the decline rate is slower inthe red than the blue due to a secondary near-ir brightening. thenucleosynthesis primarily yields heavy alpha-chain elements (40ca through 56ni)and unburnt he. thus, the spectra around peak light lack signs of intermediatemass elements and are dominated by caii and tiii features, with the caveat thatour radiative transfer code does not include the non-thermal effects necessaryto produce he features.

1008.3397	low-ionization line emission from starburst galaxies: a new probe of  galactic-scale outflows	we study the kinematically narrow, low-ionization line emission from abright, starburst galaxy at z = 0.69 using slit spectroscopy obtained withkeck/lris. the spectrum reveals strong absorption in mgii and feii resonancetransitions with doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gasoutflow. emission in mgii near and redward of systemic velocity, in concertwith the observed absorption, yields a p cygni-like line profile similar tothose observed in the ly alpha transition in lyman break galaxies. further, themgii emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond theemission from stars and hii regions within the galaxy. assuming the emissionhas a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gasextends to distances &gt; ~7 kpc. we also detect several narrow feii*fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising fromenergy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. wesuggest that the mgii and feii* emission is generated by photon scattering inthe observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic predictionof outflows. these observations provide the first direct constraints on theminimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy.estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact ofoutflows in driving galaxy evolution.

1011.4517	measuring ejecta velocity improves type ia supernova distances	we use a sample of 121 spectroscopically normal type ia supernovae (sne ia)to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, asmeasured from the blueshift of the si ii 6355 feature near maximum brightness,v_si. the sn ia sample was originally used by wang et al. (2009) to show thatthe relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absenceof intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for twosubsamples split by v_si (defined as "normal" and "high-velocity"). we verifythis result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law whenextremely reddened events (e(b-v) &gt; 0.35 mag) are excluded. we also show that(1) the high-velocity subsample is offset by ~0.06 mag to the red from thenormal subsample in the (b_max - v_max) - m_v plane, (2) the b_max - v_maxcumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identicalshapes, but the high-velocity subsample is offset by ~0.07 mag to the red inb_max - v_max, and (3) the bluest high-velocity sne ia are ~0.10 mag redderthan the bluest normal sne ia. together, this evidence indicates a differencein intrinsic color for the subsamples. accounting for this intrinsic colordifference reduces the scatter in hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 magfor sne ia with a_v &lt; 0.7 mag. the scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 magby exclusively using sne ia from the normal subsample. additionally, thisresult can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of r_v foundin large sn ia samples. we explain the correlation between ejecta velocity andcolor as increased line blanketing in the high-velocity sne ia, causing them tobecome redder. we discuss some implications of this result, and stress theimportance of spectroscopy for future sn ia cosmology surveys, with particularfocus on the design of wfirst.

1101.1298	peculiar type ii supernovae from blue supergiants	the vast majority of type ii supernovae (sne) are produced by red supergiants(rsgs), but sn 1987a revealed that blue supergiants (bsgs) can produce membersof this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. this best studiedevent revolutionized our understanding of sne, and linking it to the bulk oftype ii events is essential. we present here optical photometry andspectroscopy gathered for sn 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard type ii snand yet is not a sn 1987a analog. the light curve of sn 2000cb is reminiscentof that of sn 1987a in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but onsubstantially different time scales. spectroscopically, sn 2000cb resembles anormal sn ii but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for sn1987a or normal sne ii, above 18000 km/s for h-alpha at early times. the redcolours, high velocities, late photometric peak, and our modeling of thisobject all point toward a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of asmall-radius star, most likely a bsg, producing 0.1 solar masses of ni-56.adding a similar object to the sample, sn 2005ci, we derive a rate of about 2%of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of bsg explosions.

1102.3444	simple models of metal-line absorption and emission from cool gas  outflows	we analyze the absorption and emission-line profiles produced by a set ofsimple, cool gas wind models motivated by galactic-scale outflow observations.we implement monte carlo radiative transfer techniques that track thepropagation of scattered and fluorescent photons to generate 1d spectra and 2dspectral images. we focus on the mgii 2796,28303 doublet and feii uv1 multipletat ~2600a, but the results are applicable to other transitions that traceoutflows (e.g. nai, lya, siii). by design, the resonance transitions showblue-shifted absorption but one also predicts strong resonance andfine-structure line-emission at roughly the systemic velocity. thisline-emission `fills-in' the absorption reducing the equivalent width by up to50%, shift the absorption-lin centroid by tens of km/s, and reduce theeffective opacity near systemic. analysis of cool gas outflows that ignoresthis line-emission may incorrectly infer that the gas is partially covered,measure asignificantly lower peak optical depth, and/or conclude that gas atsystemic velocity is absent. because the feii lines are connected byoptically-thin transitions to fine-structure levels, their profiles moreclosely reproduce the intrinsic opacity of the wind. together these resultsnaturally explain the absorption and emission-line characteristics observed forstar-forming galaxies at z&lt;1. we also study a scenario promoted to describe theoutflows of z~3 lyman break galaxies and find prfiles inconsistent with theobservations due to scattered photon emission. although line-emissioncomplicates the analysis of absorption-line profiles, the surface brightnessprofiles offer a unique means of assessing the morphology and size ofgalactic-scale winds. furthermore, the kinematics and line-ratios offerpowerful diagnostics of outflows, motivating deep, spatially-extendedspectroscopic observations.

1103.2130	absorption line systems in simulated galaxies fed by cold streams	hydro cosmological simulations reveal that massive galaxies at high redshiftare fed by long narrow streams of merging galaxies and a smoother component ofcold gas. we post-process seven high-resolution simulated galaxies withradiative transfer to study the absorption characteristics of the gas ingalaxies and streams, in comparison with the statistics of observedabsorption-line systems. we find that much of the stream gas is ionized by uvradiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick(n_hi &gt; 10^17 cm^-2) so that the streams appear as lyman-limit systems (llss).at z&gt;3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, givingrise to damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorbers as well. the gas in the central andincoming galaxies remains mostly neutral, responsible for dlas. within one(two) virial radii, the covering factor of optically thick gas is &lt;25% (10%)for llss and &lt;5% (1%) for dlas, slowly declining with time following theuniversal expansion. nevertheless, galaxies and their cold streams in thestudied mass range, m_vir = 10^10 - 10^12 msun, account for &gt;30% of theobserved absorbers in the foreground of quasars, the rest possibly arising fromsmaller galaxies or the intergalactic medium. the mean metallicity in thestreams is ~1% solar, much lower than in the galaxies. the simulated galaxiesreproduce the lyalpha-absorption equivalent widths observed around lyman-breakgalaxies, but they severely underpredict the equivalent widths in metal lines,suggesting that the latter may arise from outflows. we conclude that theobserved metal-poor llss are likely detections of the predicted cold streams.revised analysis of the observed llss kinematics and simulations with moremassive outflows in conjunction with the inflows may enable a clearerdistinction between the signatures of the various gas modes.

1108.4036	the long-term evolution of double white dwarf mergers	in this paper, we present a model for the long-term evolution of the mergerof two unequal mass c/o white dwarfs (wds). after the dynamical phase of themerger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading tonearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 1e-4 to 1 yr, long beforesignificant cooling can occur. due to heating during the dynamical and viscousphases, the less massive wd is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, andradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.  following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near theenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convectivecarbon-burning. if not, kelvin-helmholtz contraction of the inner region of theenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of theenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. as a result, the long-termevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previouscalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventuallyyielding a high-mass o/ne wd or a collapse to a neutron star. during thecooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near theeddington limit. given the double wd merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens ofthese ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a milky way-type galaxy.  while the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physicalpicture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previouswork. furthermore, remaining uncertainties related to the convective structurenear the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution maysignificantly affect our conclusions. thus, future work within the context ofthe physical model presented here is required to better address the eventualfate of double wd mergers, including those for which one or both of thecomponents is a he wd.

1111.0966	a compact degenerate primary-star progenitor of sn 2011fe	while a white dwarf is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausibleprimary star in type ia supernova (sn ia), many other candidates have not beenformally ruled out. shock energy deposited in the envelope of any explodingprimary contributes to the early sn brightness and, since this radiation energyis degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity dependson the initial primary radius. we present a new non-detection limit of thenearby sn ia 2011fe, obtained what appears to be just 4 hours after explosion,allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius, r_p. coupled withthe non-detection of a quiescent x-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesizedni mass, we show that r_p &lt;~ 0.02 r_sun (a factor of 5 smaller than previouslyinferred), that the average density of the primary must be rho_p &gt; 10,000 gmcm^{-3}, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few x 10^5 k.this rules out hydrogen burning main sequence stars and giants. constructingthe helium-burning main sequence and carbon-burning main sequence, we find suchobjects are also excluded. by process of elimination, we find that onlydegeneracy-supported compact objects---wds and neutron stars---are viable asthe primary star of sn 2011fe. with few caveats, we also restrict the companion(secondary) star radius to r_ c &lt;~ 0.1 r_sun, excluding roche-lobe overflowingred giant and main-sequence companions to high significance.

1204.0063	3-d radiative transfer calculations of radiation feedback from massive  black holes: outflow of mass from the dusty "torus"	observational and theoretical arguments suggest that the momentum carried inmass outflows from agn can reach several times l / c, corresponding to outflowrates of hundreds of solar masses per year. radiation pressure on lines alonemay not be sufficient to provide this momentum deposition, and the transfer ofreprocessed ir radiation in dusty nuclear gas has been postulated to providethe extra enhancement. the efficacy of this mechanism, however, will besensitive to multi-dimensional effects such as the tendency for the reprocessedradiation to preferentially escape along sight-lines of lower column density.we use monte carlo radiative transfer calculations to determine the radiationforce on dusty gas residing within approximately 10 parsecs from an accretingsuper-massive black hole. we calculate the net rate of momentum deposition inthe surrounding gas and estimate the mass-loss rate in the resulting outflow asa function of solid angle for different black hole luminosities,sightline-averaged column densities, clumping parameters, and opening angles ofthe dusty gas. we find that these dust-driven winds carry momentum fluxes of1-5 times l / c and correspond to mass-loss rates of 10-100 solar masses peryear for a 10^8 solar mass black hole radiating at or near its eddington limit.these results help to explain the origin of high velocity molecular and atomicoutflows in local ulirgs, and can inform numerical simulations of galaxyevolution including agn feedback.

1210.7240	supernova light curves powered by fallback accretion	some fraction of the material ejected in a core collapse supernova explosionmay remain bound to the compact remnant, and eventually turn around and fallback. we show that the late time (&gt; days) power associated with the accretionof this "fallback" material may significantly affect the optical light curve,in some cases producing super-luminous or otherwise peculiar supernovae. we usespherically symmetric hydrodynamical models to estimate the accretion rate atlate times for a range of progenitor masses and radii and explosion energies.the accretion rate onto the proto-neutron star or black hole decreases as mdot~ t^-5/3 at late times, but its normalization can be significantly enhanced atlow explosion energies, in very massive stars, or if a strong reverse shockwave forms at the helium/hydrogen interface in the progenitor. if the resultingsuper-eddington accretion drives an outflow which thermalizes in the outgoingejecta, the supernova debris will be re-energized at a time when photons candiffuse out efficiently. the resulting light curves are different and morediverse than previous fallback supernova models which ignored the input ofaccretion power and produced short-lived, dim transients. the possible outcomeswhen fallback accretion power is significant include super-luminous (&gt; 10^44ergs / s) type ii events of both short and long durations, as well as luminoustype i events from compact stars that may have experienced significant massloss. accretion power may unbind the remaining infalling material, causing asudden decrease in the brightness of some long duration type ii events. thisscenario may be relevant for explaining some of the recently discovered classesof peculiar and rare supernovae.

1303.5787	effect of a high opacity on the light curves of radioactively powered  transients from compact object mergers	the coalescence of compact objects are a promising astrophysical sources ofgravitational wave (gw) signals. the ejection of r-process material from suchmergers may lead to a radioactively-powered electromagnetic counterpart which,if discovered, would enhance the science return of a gw detection. as verylittle is known about the optical properties of heavy r-process elements,previous light curve models have adopted opacities similar to those of irongroup elements. here we report that the presence of heavier elements,particularly the lanthanides, increase the ejecta opacity by several orders ofmagnitude. we include these higher opacities in time dependent,multi-wavelength radiative transport calculations to predict the broadbandlight curves of one-dimensional models over a range of parameters (ejectamasses from 0.001 to 0.1 solar masses and velocities from 0.1 to 0.3c). we findthat the higher opacities lead to much longer duration light curves which canlast a week or more. the emission is shifted toward the infrared bands due tostrong optical line blanketing, and the colors at later times arerepresentative of a blackbody near the recombination temperature of thelanthanides (t ~ 2500k). we further consider the case in which a second massoutflow, composed of 56ni, is ejected from a disk wind, and show that the netresult is a distinctive two component spectral energy distribution, with abright optical peak due to 56ni and an infrared peak due to r-process ejecta.we briefly consider the prospects for detection and identification of thesetransients.

1303.5788	opacities and spectra of the r-process ejecta from neutron star mergers	material ejected during (or immediately following) the merger of two neutronstars may assemble into heavy elements by the r-process. the subsequentradioactive decay of the nuclei can power electromagnetic emission similar to,but significantly dimmer than, an ordinary supernova. identifying such eventsis an important goal of future transient surveys, offering new perspectives onthe origin of r-process nuclei and the astrophysical sources of gravitationalwaves. predictions of the transient light curves and spectra, however, havesuffered from the uncertain optical properties of heavy ions. here we considerthe opacity of expanding r-process material and argue that it is dominated byline transitions from those ions with the most complex valence electronstructure, namely the lanthanides. for a few representative ions, we run atomicstructure models to calculate radiative data for tens of millions of lines. wefind that the resulting r-process opacities are orders of magnitude larger thanthat of ordinary (e.g., iron-rich) supernova ejecta. radiative transportcalculations using these new opacities indicate that the transient emissionshould be dimmer and redder than previously thought. the spectra appearpseudo-blackbody, with broad absorption features, and peak in the infrared (~1micron). we discuss uncertainties in the opacities and attempt to quantifytheir impact on the spectral predictions. the results have importantimplications for observational strategies to find and study the radioactivelypowered electromagnetic counterparts to compact object mergers.

1304.4957	tidal tail ejection as a signature of type~ia supernovae from white  dwarf mergers	the merger of two white dwarfs may be preceded by the ejection of some massin "tidal tails", creating a circumstellar medium around the system. weconsider the variety of observational signatures from this material, whichdepend on the lag time between the start of the merger and the ultimateexplosion (assuming one occurs) of the system in a type ia supernova. if thetime lag is fairly short, the interaction of the supernova ejecta with thetails could lead to detectable shock emission at radio, optical, and/or x-raywavelengths. at somewhat later times, the tails produce relatively broad naidabsorption lines with velocity widths of order the white dwarf escape speed($\sim 1000$ \kms). that none of these signatures have been detected in normalsne ia constrains the lag time to be either very short ($\lesssim 100$ s) orfairly long ($\gtrsim 100$ yr). if the tails have expanded and cooled overtimescales $\sim 10^4$ yr, they could be observable through narrow naid andcaii h&amp;k absorption lines in the spectra, which are seen in some fraction ofsne ia. using a combination of 3d and 1d hydrodynamical codes, we model themass-loss from tidal interactions in binary systems, and the subsequentinteractions with the interstellar medium, which produce a slow-moving, denseshell of gas. we synthesize naid line profiles by ray-casting through thisshell, and show that in some circumstances tidal tails could be responsible fornarrow absorptions similar to those observed.

1308.1669	confronting simulations of optically thick gas in massive halos with  observations at z=2-3	cosmological hydrodynamic simulations predict the physical state of baryonsin the circumgalactic medium (cgm), which can be directly tested via quasarabsorption line observations. we use high resolution "zoom-in" simulations of21 galaxies to characterize the distribution of neutral hydrogen around halosin the mass range m_vir~ 2x10^11 - 4x10^12 m_sun at z~2. we find that both themass fraction of cool (t &lt;= 3x10^4 k) gas and the covering fraction ofoptically-thick lyman limit systems (llss) depend only weakly on halo mass,even around the critical value for the formation of stable virial shocks. thecovering fraction of llss interior to the virial radius varies between f_c~0.05- 0.2, with significant scatter among halos. our simulations of massive halos(m_vir &gt;= 10^12 m_sun) underpredict the covering fraction of optically-thickgas observed in the quasar cgm by a large factor. the reason for thisdiscrepancy is unclear, but several possibilities are discussed. in the lowermass halos (m_vir &gt;= 5x10^11 m_sun) hosting star-forming galaxies, thepredicted covering factor agrees with observations, however current samples ofquasar-galaxy pairs are too small for a conclusive comparison. to overcome thislimitation, we propose a new observable: the small-scale auto-correlationfunction of optically-thick absorbers detected in the foreground of closequasar pairs. we show that this new observable can constrain the underlyingdark halos hosting llss at z~2-3, as well as the characteristic size andcovering factor of the cgm.

1309.4088	rapidly fading supernovae from massive star explosions	transient surveys have recently discovered a class of supernovae (sne) withextremely rapidly declining light curves. these events are also oftenrelatively faint, especially compared to type ia sne. the common explanationfor these events involves a weak explosion, producing a radioactive outflowwith small ejected mass and kinetic energy (m ~ 0.1 msun and e ~ 0.1 b,respectively), perhaps from the detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf.we argue, in contrast, that these events may be type ib/c sne with typicalmasses and energies (m ~ 3 msun, e ~ 1 b), but which ejected very littleradioactive material. in our picture, the light curve is powered by thediffusion of thermal energy deposited by the explosion shock wave, and therapid evolution is due to recombination, which reduces the opacity and resultsin an "oxygen-plateau" light curve. using a radiative transfer code, wegenerate synthetic spectra and light curves and demonstrate that this model canreasonably fit the observations of one event, sn 2010x. similar models mayexplain the features of other rapidly evolving sne such as sn 2002bj and sn2005ek. sne such as these require stripped-envelope progenitors with ratherlarge radii (r ~ 20 rsun), which may originate from a mass loss episodeoccurring just prior to explosion.

1311.5008	type ia supernovae from merging white dwarfs i. prompt detonations	merging white dwarfs are a possible progenitor of type ia supernovae (sneia). while it is not entirely clear if and when an explosion is triggered insuch systems, numerical models suggest that a detonation might be initiatedbefore the stars have coalesced to form a single compact object. here we studysuch "peri-merger" detonations by means of numerical simulations, modeling thedisruption and nucleosynthesis of the stars until the ejecta reach the coastingphase. synthetic light curves and spectra are generated for comparison withobservations. three models are considered with primary masses 0.96 msun, 1.06msun, and 1.20 msun. of these, the 0.96 msun dwarf merging with an 0.81 msuncompanion, with a ni56 yield of 0.58 msun, is the most promising candidate forreproducing common sne ia. the more massive mergers produce unusually luminoussne ia with peak luminosities approaching those attributed to"super-chandrasekhar" mass sne ia. while the synthetic light curves and spectraof some of the models resemble observed sne ia, the significant asymmetry ofthe ejecta leads to large orientation effects. the peak bolometric luminosityvaries by more than a factor of 2 with the viewing angle, and the velocities ofthe spectral absorption features are lower when observed from angles where thelight curve is brightest. the largest orientation effects are seen in theultraviolet, where the flux varies by more than an order of magnitude. despitethe large variation with viewing angle, the set of three models roughly obeys awidth-luminosity relation, with the brighter light curves declining more slowlyin the b-band. spectral features due to unburned carbon from the secondary starare also seen in some cases.

1312.3649	type ia supernovae from merging white dwarfs ii) post-merger detonations	merging carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs are a promising progenitor system fortype ia supernovae (sn ia), but the underlying physics and timing of thedetonation are still debated. if an explosion occurs after the secondary staris fully disrupted, the exploding primary will expand into a dense co mediumthat may still have a disk-like structure. this interaction will decelerate anddistort the ejecta. here we carry out multi-dimensional simulations of``tamped" sn ia models, using both particle and grid-based codes to study themerger and explosion dynamics, and a radiative transfer code to calculatesynthetic spectra and light curves. we find that post-merger explosions exhibitan hourglass-shaped asymmetry, leading to strong variations in the light curveswith viewing angle. the two most important factors affecting the outcome arethe scale-height of the disk, which depends sensitively on the binary massratio, and the total ${}^{56}$ni yield, which is governed by the centraldensity of the remnant core. the synthetic broadband light curves rise anddecline very slowly, and the spectra generally look peculiar, with weakfeatures from intermediate mass elements but relatively strong carbonabsorption. we also consider the effects of the viscous evolution of theremnant, and show that a longer time delay between merger and explosionprobably leads to larger ${}^{56}$ni yields and more symmetrical remnants. wediscuss the relevance of this class of aspherical ``tamped" sn ia forexplaining the class of ``super-chandrasekhar'' sn ia.

1409.0544	neutron-powered precursors of kilonovae	the merger of binary neutron stars (nss) ejects a small quantity of neutronrich matter, the radioactive decay of which powers a day to week long thermaltransient known as a kilonova. most of the ejecta remains sufficiently denseduring its expansion that all neutrons are captured into nuclei during ther-process. however, recent general relativistic merger simulations by bausweinand collaborators show that a small fraction of the ejected mass (a few percent, or ~1e-4 msun) expands sufficiently rapidly for most neutrons to avoidcapture. this matter originates from the shocked-heated interface between themerging nss. here we show that the beta-decay of these free neutrons in theoutermost ejecta powers a `precursor' to the main kilonova emission, whichpeaks on a timescale of a few hours following merger at u-band magnitude ~22(for an assumed distance of 200 mpc). the high luminosity and blue colors ofthe neutron precursor render it a potentially important counterpart to thegravitational wave source, that may encode valuable information on theproperties of the merging binary (e.g. ns-ns versus ns-black hole) and the nsequation of state. future work is necessary to assess the robustness of thefast moving ejecta and the survival of free neutrons in the face of neutrinoabsorptions, although the precursor properties are robust to a moderate amountof leptonization. our results provide additional motivation for short latencygravitational wave triggers and rapid follow-up searches with sensitive groundbased telescopes.

1409.4426	outflows from accretion disks formed in neutron star mergers: effect of  black hole spin	the accretion disk that forms after a neutron star merger is a source ofneutron-rich ejecta. the ejected material contributes to aradioactively-powered electromagnetic transient, with properties that dependsensitively on the composition of the outflow. here we investigate how the spinof the black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscoustimescales. we carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamicsimulations of merger remnant accretion disks including viscous angularmomentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. the gravity ofthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-newtonian potential. we findthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor ofseveral, relative to the non-spinning case. the enhanced mass loss is due toenergy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential,raising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regionswhere neutrino cooling is ineffective. the mean electron fraction of theoutflow increases moderately with bh spin due to a highly-irradiated (thoughnot neutrino-driven) wind component. while the bulk of the ejecta is still veryneutron-rich, thus generating heavy r-process elements, the leading edge of thewind contains a small amount of lanthanide-free material. this component cangive rise to a ~1 day blue optical `bump' in a kilonova light curve, even inthe case of prompt bh formation, which may facilitate its detection.

1411.3726	kilonova light curves from the disk wind outflows of compact object  mergers	we study the radioactively-powered transients produced by accretion diskwinds following a compact object merger. starting with the outflows generatedin two-dimensional hydrodynamical disk models, we use wavelength-dependentradiative transfer calculations to generate synthetic light curves and spectra.we show that the brightness and color of the resulting kilonova transientscarry information about the merger physics. in the regions of the wind whereneutrino irradiation raises the electron fraction to ye &gt; 0.25, r-processnucleosynthesis halts before producing high-opacity, complex ions (thelanthanides). the kilonova light curves thus show two distinct components: abrief (~2 day) blue optical transient produced in the outer lanthanide-freeejecta, and a longer (~10 day) infrared transient produced in the inner,lanthanide line-blanketed region. mergers producing a longer-lived neutronstar, or a more rapidly spinning black hole, have stronger neutrinoirradiation, generate more lanthanide-free ejecta, and are optically brighterand bluer. at least some optical emission is produced in all disk wind models,which should enhance the detectability of electromagnetic counterparts togravitational wave sources. however, the presence of even a small amount(10^{-4} msun) of overlying, neutron-rich dynamical ejecta will act as a"lanthanide-curtain", obscuring the optical wind emission from certain viewingangles. because the disk outflows have moderate velocities (~10,000 km/s),numerous resolved line features are discernible in the spectra, distinguishingdisk winds from fast-moving dynamical ejecta, and offering a potentialdiagnostic of the detailed composition of freshly produced r-process material.

1412.5588	the interplay of disk wind and dynamical ejecta in the aftermath of  neutron star - black hole mergers	we explore the evolution of the different ejecta components generated duringthe merger of a neutron star (ns) and a black hole (bh). our focus is theinterplay between material ejected dynamically during the merger, and the windlaunched on a viscous timescale by the remnant accretion disk. these componentsare expected to contribute to an electromagnetic transient and to producer-process elements, each with a different signature when considered separately.here we introduce a two-step approach to investigate their combined evolution,using two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. starting from theoutput of a merger simulation, we identify each component in the initialcondition based on its phase space distribution, and evolve the accretion diskin axisymmetry. the wind blown from this disk is injected into athree-dimensional computational domain where the dynamical ejecta is evolved.we find that the wind can suppress fallback accretion on timescales longer than~100 ms. due to self-similar viscous evolution, the disk accretion at latetimes nevertheless approaches a power-law time dependence $\propto t^{-2.2}$.this can power some late-time grb engine activity, although the availableenergy is significantly less than in traditional fallback models. inclusion ofradioactive heating due to the r-process does not significantly affect thefallback accretion rate or the disk wind. we do not find any significantmodification to the wind properties at large radius due to interaction with thedynamical ejecta. this is a consequence of the different expansion velocitiesof the two components.

1507.03645	magnetar driven shock breakout and double peaked supernova light curves	the light curves of some luminous supernovae are suspected to be powered bythe spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar. here we describe a possiblesignature of the central engine: a burst of shock breakout emission occurringseveral days after the supernova explosion. the energy input from the magnetarinflates a high-pressure bubble that drives a shock through the pre-explodedsupernova ejecta. if the magnetar is powerful enough, that shock will near theejecta surface and become radiative. at the time of shock breakout, the ejectawill have expanded to a large radius (~10^{14} cm) so that the radiationreleased is at optical/ultraviolet wavelengths (t ~ 20,000 k) and lasts forseveral days. the luminosity and timescale of this magnetar driven shockbreakout are similar to the first peak observed recently in the double-peakedlight curve of snlsq14bdq. however, for a large region of model parameterspace, the breakout emission is predicted to be dimmer than the diffusiveluminosity from direct magnetar heating. a distinct double peaked light curvemay therefore only be conspicuous if thermal heating from the magnetar issuppressed at early times. we describe how such a delay in heating maynaturally result from inefficient dissipation and thermalization of the pulsarwind magnetic energy. without such suppression, the breakout may only benoticeable as a small bump or kink in the early luminosity or color evolution,or as a small but abrupt rise in the photospheric velocity. a similar breakoutsignature may accompany other central engines in supernovae, such as a blackhole accreting fallback material.

1508.02712	the diversity of transients from magnetar birth	strongly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron stars are contenders for thecentral engines of both long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) andhydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (slsne-i). models for typical (~minutelong) lgrbs invoke magnetars with high dipole magnetic fields (bd &gt; 1e15 g) andshort spin-down times, while models for slsne-i invoke neutron stars withweaker fields and longer spin-down times of weeks. here we identify atransition region in the space of bd and birth period for which a magnetar canpower both a long grb and a luminous sn. in particular, we show that a 2 msperiod magnetar with a spin-down time of ~1e4 s can explain the observations ofboth the ultra-long grb 111209 and its associated luminous sn2011kl. formagnetars with longer spin down times, we predict even longer duration (~1e6 s)grbs and brighter supernovae, a correlation that extends to swift j2058+05(commonly interpreted as a tidal disruption event). we further show thatprevious estimates of the maximum rotational energy of a proto-magnetar weretoo conservative and energies up to emax ~1-2e53 erg are possible. the magnetarmodel can therefore comfortably accommodate the extreme energy requirementsrecently posed by the most luminous supernova asassn-15lh. the high ionizationflux from a pulsar wind nebula powering asassn-15lh may lead to an "ionizationbreak-out" x-ray burst over the coming months, which would be accompanied by anabrupt change in the optical spectrum. we conclude by briefly contrastingmillisecond magnetar and black hole models for slsne and ultra-long grbs.

astro-ph;0107464	spectral consequences of deviation from spherical composition symmetry  in type ia supernovae	we investigate the prospects for constraining the maximum scale of clumpingin composition that is consistent with observed type ia supernova flux spectra.synthetic spectra generated without purely spherical composition symmetryindicate that gross asymmetries make prominent changes to absorption features.motivated by this, we consider the case of a single unblended line forming inan atmosphere with perturbations of different scales and spatial distributions.perturbations of about 1% of the area of the photodisk simply weaken theabsorption feature by the same amount independent of the line of sight.conversely, perturbations of about 10% of the area of the photodisk introducevariation in the absorption depth which does depend on the line of sight. thus,1% photodisk area perturbations may be consistent with observed profilehomogeneity but 10% photodisk area perturbations can not. based on this, wesuggest that the absence of significant variation in the depths of si ii 6355absorption features in normal type ia spectra near maximum light indicates thatany composition perturbations in these events are quite small. this alsoconstrains future three-dimensional explosion models to produce ejecta profileswith only small scale inhomogeneities.

astro-ph;0301312	analysis of the flux and polarization spectra of the type ia supernova  sn 2001el: exploring the geometry of the high-velocity ejecta	sn 2001el is the first normal type ia supernova to show a strong, intrinsicpolarization signal. in addition, during the epochs prior to maximum light, thecaii ir triplet absorption is seen distinctly and separately at both normalphotospheric velocities and at very high velocities. the high-velocity tripletabsorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than therest of the spectrum. the unique observation allows us to construct arelatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of thesupernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere(v \approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,high-velocity structure (v \approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high caii lineopacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. by partially obscuring theunderlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incompletecancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives riseto the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity irtriplet feature. in an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop atechnique for calculating 3-d synthetic polarization spectra and use it togenerate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations. inparticular, we examine the case where the inner ejecta layers are ellipsoidaland the outer, high-velocity structure is one of four possibilities: aspherical shell, an ellipsoidal shell, a clumped shell, or a toroid. thesynthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, andfind a best fit with the clumped shell. we show further that differentgeometries can be more clearly discriminated if observations are obtained fromseveral different lines of sight.

astro-ph;0311009	could there be a hole in type ia supernovae?	in the favored progenitor scenario, type ia supernovae arise from a whitedwarf accreting material from a non-degenerate companion star. soon after thewhite dwarf explodes, the ejected supernova material engulfs the companionstar; two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by marietta et. al. show that,in the interaction, the companion star carves out a conical hole of openingangle 30-40 degrees in the supernova ejecta. in this paper we usemulti-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer calculations to explore theobservable consequences of an ejecta-hole asymmetry. we calculate the variationof the spectrum, luminosity, and polarization with viewing angle for theaspherical supernova near maximum light. we find that the supernova looksnormal from almost all viewing angles except when one looks almost directlydown the hole. in the latter case, one sees into the deeper, hotter layers ofejecta. the supernova is relatively brighter and has a peculiar spectrumcharacterized by more highly ionized species, weaker absorption features, andlower absorption velocities. the spectrum viewed down the hole is comparable tothe class of sn 1991t-like supernovae. we consider how the ejecta-holeasymmetry may explain the current spectropolarimetric observations of sne ia,and suggest a few observational signatures of the geometry. finally, we discussthe variety currently seen in observed sne ia and how an ejecta-hole asymmetrymay fit in as one of several possible sources of diversity.

astro-ph;0606449	secondary maximum in the near-infrared lightcurves of type ia supernovae	we undertake a theoretical study of the near-infrared (nir) lightcurves oftype ia supernovae (sne ia). in these bands, the lightcurves are distinguishedby a secondary maximum occurring roughly 20 to 30 days after the initial one.using time-dependent multi-group radiative transfer calculations, we calculatethe ubvrijhk-band lightcurves of model sn ia ejecta structures. our syntheticnir lightcurves show distinct secondary maxima, and provide favorable fits toobserved sne ia. we offer a detailed explanation of the origin of the nirsecondary maximum, which is shown to relate directly to the ionizationevolution of iron group elements in the ejecta. this understanding providesimmediate intuition into the dependence of the nir lightcurves on the physicalproperties of the ejecta, and in particular explains why brighter supernovaehave a later and more prominent secondary maximum. we demonstrate thedependence of the nir lightcurves on the mass of 56ni, the degree of 56nimixing, the mass of electron caputre elements, the progenitor metallicity, andthe abundance of intermediate mass elements (especially calcium). the secondarymaximum is shown to be a valuable diagnostic of these important physicalparameters. the models further confirm that sne ia should be excellent standardcandles in the nir, with a dispersion &lt; 0.2 mag even when the physicalproperties of the ejecta are varied widely. this study emphasizes theconsummate value of nir observations in probing the structure of sne ia and infurthering their cosmological utility.

astro-ph;0609540	on the origin of the type ia supernova width-luminosity relation	brighter type ia supernovae (sne ia) have broader, more slowly decliningb-band light curves than dimmer sne ia. we study the physical origin of thiswidth-luminosity relation (wlr) using detailed radiative transfer calculationsof chandrasekhar mass sn ia models. we find that the luminosity dependence ofthe diffusion time (emphasized in previous studies) is in fact of secondaryrelevance in understanding the model wlr. instead, the essential physicsinvolves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of sneia. following maximum-light, the sn colors are increasingly affected by thedevelopment of numerous fe ii/co ii lines which blanket the b-band and, at thesame time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. because dimmer sne iaare generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of fe iii to fe iirecombination in the iron-group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a morerapid evolution of the sn colors to the red. the faster b-band decline rate ofdimmer sne ia thus reflects their faster ionization evolution.

astro-ph;0609562	type ia supernova light curves	the diversity of type ia supernova (sn ia) photometry is explored using agrid of 130 one-dimensional models. it is shown that the observable propertiesof sne ia resulting from chandrasekhar-mass explosions are chiefly determinedby their final composition and some measure of ``mixing'' in the explosion. agrid of final compositions is explored including essentially all combinationsof 56ni, stable ``iron'', and intermediate mass elements that result in anunbound white dwarf. light curves (and in some cases spectra) are calculatedfor each model using two different approaches to the radiation transportproblem. within the resulting templates are models that provide goodphotometric matches to essentially the entire range of observed sne ia. on thewhole, the grid of models spans a wide range in b-band peak magnitudes anddecline rates, and does not obey a phillips relation. in particular, modelswith the same mass of 56ni show large variations in their light curve declinerates. we identify the physical parameters responsible for this dispersion, andconsider physically motivated ``cuts'' of the models that agree better with thephillips relation. for example, models that produce a constant total mass ofburned material of 1.1 +/- msun do give a crude phillips relation, albeit withmuch scatter. the scatter is further reduced if one restricts that set tomodels that make 0.1 to 0.3 msun of stable iron and nickel isotopes, and thenmix the ejecta strongly between the center and 0.8 msun. we conclude that thesupernovae that occur most frequently in nature are highly constrained by thephillips relation and that a large part of the currently observed scatter inthe relation is likely a consequence of the intrinsic diversity of theseobjects.

astro-ph;0612198	detonating failed deflagration model of thermonuclear supernovae ii.  comparison to observations	we develop and demonstrate the methodology of testing multi-dimensionalsupernova models against observations by studying the properties of one exampleof the detonation from failed deflagration (dfd) explosion model ofthermonuclear supernovae. using time-dependent multi-dimensional radiativetransfer calculations, we generate the synthetic broadband optical lightcurves, near-infrared light curves, color evolution curves, full spectraltime-series, and spectropolarization of the model, as seen from various viewingangles. all model observables are critically evaluated against examples ofwell-observed, standard type ia supernovae (sne ia). we explore theconsequences of the intrinsic model asphericity by studying the dependence ofthe model emission on viewing angle, and by quantifying the resultingdispersion in (and internal correlations between) various model observables.these statistical properties of the model are also evaluated against those ofthe available observational sample of sne ia. on the whole, the dfd model showsgood agreement with a broad range of sn ia observations. certain deficienciesare also apparent, and point to further developments within the basictheoretical framework. we also identify several intriguing orientation effectsin the model which suggest ways in which the asphericity of sne ia maycontribute to their photometric and spectroscopic diversity and, conversely,how the relative homogeneity of sne ia constrains the degree of asymmetryallowable in the models. the comprehensive methodology adopted in this workproves an essential component of developing and validating theoreticalsupernova models, and helps motivate and clearly define future directions inboth the modeling and the observation of sne ia.

0811.1370	three-dimensional simulations of tidally disrupted solar-type stars and  the observational signatures of shock breakout	we describe a three-dimensional simulation of a $1 m_{\odot}$ solar-type starapproaching a $10^{6} m_{\odot}$ black hole on a parabolic orbit with apericenter distance well within the tidal radius. while falling towards theblack hole, the star is not only stretched along the orbital direction but evenmore severely compressed at right angles to the orbit. the overbearing degreeof compression achieved shortly after pericenter leads to the production ofstrong shocks which largely homogenize the temperature profile of the star,resulting in surface temperatures comparable to the initial temperature of thestar's core. this phenomenon, which precedes the fallback accretion phase,gives rise to a unique double-peaked x-ray signature that, if detected, may beone of the few observable diagnostics of how stars behave under the influenceof strong gravitational fields. if $\sim 10^{6} m_{\odot}$ black holes wereprevalent in small or even dwarf galaxies, the nearest of such flares may bedetectable by exist from no further away than the virgo cluster.
