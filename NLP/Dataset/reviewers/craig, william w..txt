1301.7307	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) mission	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) mission, launched on 13june 2012, is the first focusing high-energy x-ray telescope in orbit. nustaroperates in the band from 3 -- 79 kev, extending the sensitivity of focusingfar beyond the ~10 kev high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous x-raysatellites. the inherently low-background associated with concentrating thex-ray light enables nustar to probe the hard x-ray sky with a more thanone-hundred-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded-maskinstruments that have operated in this bandpass. using its unprecedentedcombination of sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution, nustar will pursuefive primary scientific objectives, and will also undertake a broad program oftargeted observations. the observatory consists of two co-alignedgrazing-incidence x-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axisstabilized spacecraft. deployed into a 600 km, near-circular, 6degreeinclination orbit, the observatory has now completed commissioning, and isperforming consistent with pre-launch expectations. nustar is now executing itsprimary science mission, and with an expected orbit lifetime of ten years, weanticipate proposing a guest investigator program, to begin in fall 2014.

1305.1945	nustar discovery of a 3.76-second transient magnetar near sagittarius a*	we report the discovery of 3.76-s pulsations from a new burst source near sgra* observed by the nustar observatory. the strong signal from sgr j1745-29presents a complex pulse profile modulated with pulsed fraction 27+/-3 % in the3-10 kev band. two observations spaced 9 days apart yield a spin-down rate ofpdot = (6.5+/-1.4)x10^{-12}. this implies a magnetic field b = 1.6x10^14 g,spin-down power edot = 5x10^33 erg/s, and characteristic age p/2pdot = 9x10^3yr, for the rotating dipole model. however, the current pdot may be erratic,especially during outburst. the flux and modulation remained steady during theobservations and the 3-79 kev spectrum is well fitted by a combined blackbodyplus power-law model with temperature kt_bb = 0.96+/-0.02 kev and photon index= 1.5+/-0.4, respectively. the neutral hydrogen column density (nh ~ 1.4x10^23cm^{-2}) measured by nustar and swift suggests that sgr j1745-29 is located ator near the galactic center. the lack of an x-ray counterpart in the publishedchandra survey catalog sets a quiescent 2-8 kev luminosity limit of lx ~&lt; 10^32erg/s. the bursting, timing, and spectral properties indicate a transientmagnetar undergoing an outburst with 2-79 kev luminosity up to 3.5x10^35 erg/sfor a distance of 8 kpc. sgr j1745-29 joins a growing subclass of transientmagnetars, indicating that many magnetars in quiescence remain undetected inthe x-ray band or have been detected as high-b radio pulsars. the peculiarlocation of sgr j1745-29 has important implications for the formation anddynamics of neutron stars in the galactic center region.

1307.6967	nustar detection of hard x-ray phase lags from the accreting pulsar gs  0834-430	the nustar hard x-ray telescope observed the transient be/x-ray binary gs0834-430 during its 2012 outburst - the first active state of this systemobserved in the past 19 years. we performed timing and spectral analysis, andmeasured the x-ray spectrum between 3-79kev with high statistical significance.we find the phase-averaged spectrum to be consistent with that observed in manyother magnetized accreting pulsars. we fail to detect cyclotron resonancescattering features that would allow us to constrain the pulsar's magneticfield in either phase-averaged or phase-resolved spectra. timing analysis showsa clearly detected pulse period of ~12.29s in all energy bands. the pulseprofiles show a strong, energy-dependent hard phase lag of up to 0.3 cycles inphase, or about 4s. such dramatic energy-dependent lags in the pulse profilehave never before been reported in high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb) pulsars.previously reported lags have been significantly smaller in phase andrestricted to low-energies (e&lt;10kev). we investigate the possible mechanismsthat might produce this energy-dependent pulse phase shift. we find the mostlikely explanation for this effect to be a complex beam geometry.

1309.5361	the smooth cyclotron line in her x-1 as seen with nustar	her x-1, one of the brightest and best studied x-ray binaries, shows acyclotron resonant scattering feature (crsf) near 37 kev. this makes it anideal target for detailed study with the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array(nustar), taking advantage of its excellent hard x-ray spectral resolution. weobserved her x-1 three times, coordinated with suzaku, during one of the highflux intervals of its 35d super-orbital period. this paper focuses on the shapeand evolution of the hard x-ray spectrum. the broad-band spectra can be fittedwith a powerlaw with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a crsf. we findthat the crsf has a very smooth and symmetric shape, in all observations and atall pulse-phases. we compare the residuals of a line with a gaussian opticaldepth profile to a lorentzian optical depth profile and find no significantdifferences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. eventhough the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that itssmooth shape does not. additionally, our data show that the continuum is onlychanging marginally between the three observations. these changes can beexplained with varying amounts of thomson scattering in the hot corona of theaccretion disk. the average, luminosity-corrected crsf energy is lower than inpast observations and follows a secular decline. the excellent data quality ofnustar provides the best constraint on the crsf energy to date.

1310.0745	the ultraluminous x-ray sources ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2: a broadband study  with nustar and xmm-newton	we present the results of nustar and xmm-newton observations of the twoultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2. the combined spectralbandpass of the two satellites enables us to produce the first spectrum of x-1between 0.3 and 30 kev, while x-2 is not significantly detected by nustar above10 kev. the nustar data demonstrate that x-1 has a clear cutoff above 10 kev,whose presence was only marginally detectable with previous x-ray observations.this cutoff rules out the interpretation of x-1 as a black hole in a standardlow/hard state, and it is deeper than predicted for the downturn of a broadenediron line in a reflection-dominated regime. the cutoff differs from theprediction of a single-temperature comptonization model. further, a colddisk-like black body component at ~0.3 kev is required by the data, confirmingprevious measurements by xmm-newton only. we observe a spectral transition inx-2, from a state with high luminosity and strong variability to alower-luminosity state with no detectable variability, and we link thisbehavior to a transition from a super-eddington to a sub-eddington regime.

1310.3830	the reflection component from cygnus x-1 in the soft state measured by  nustar and suzaku	the black hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed in late-2012 with the nuclearspectroscopic telescope array (nustar) and suzaku, providing spectral coverageover the ~1-300 kev range. the source was in the soft state with amulti-temperature blackbody, power-law, and reflection components along withabsorption from highly ionized material in the system. the high throughput ofnustar allows for a very high quality measurement of the complex iron lineregion as well as the rest of the reflection component. the iron line isclearly broadened and is well-described by a relativistic blurring model,providing an opportunity to constrain the black hole spin. although the spinconstraint depends somewhat on which continuum model is used, we obtain a*&gt;0.83for all models that provide a good description of the spectrum. however, noneof our spectral fits give a disk inclination that is consistent with the mostrecently reported binary values for cyg x-1. this may indicate that there is a&gt;13 degree misalignment between the orbital plane and the inner accretion disk(i.e., a warped accretion disk) or that there is missing physics in thespectral models.

1310.6221	nustar observations of magnetar 1e 1841-045	we report new spectral and temporal observations of the magnetar 1e 1841-045in the kes 73 supernova remnant obtained with the nuclear spectroscopictelescope array (nustar). combined with new swift and archival xmm-newton andchandra observations, the phase-averaged spectrum is well characterized by ablackbody plus double power-law model, in agreement with previous,multi-mission x-ray results. however, we are unable to reproduce the spectralresults reported using suzaku observations. the pulsed fraction of the sourceis found to increase with photon energy. the measured rms pulsed fraction is~12% and ~17% at ~20 kev and ~50 kev, respectively. we detect a new feature inthe 24--35 kev band pulse profile that is uniquely double-peaked. this featuremay be associated with a possible absorption or emission feature in thephase-resolved spectrum. we fit the x-ray data using the recently developedelectron-positron outflow model of beloborodov (2013) for the hard x-rayemission from magnetars. this produces a satisfactory fit allowing a constrainton the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the neutron star of ~20degrees and on the angle between the rotation axis and line-of-sight of ~50degrees. in this model, the soft x-ray component is inconsistent with a singleblackbody; adding a second blackbody or a power-law component fits the data.the two-blackbody interpretation suggests a hot spot of temperature kt~0.9 kevoccupying ~1% of the stellar surface.

1311.5514	nustar discovery of a luminosity dependent cyclotron line energy in vela  x-1	we present nustar observations of vela x-1, a persistent, yet highlyvariable, neutron star high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb). two observations weretaken at similar orbital phases but separated by nearly a year. they show verydifferent 3-79 kev flux levels as well as strong variability during eachobservation, covering almost one order of magnitude in flux. these observationsallow, for the first time ever, investigations on kilo-second time-scales ofhow the centroid energies of cyclotron resonant scattering features (crsfs)depend on flux for a persistent hmxb. we find that the line energy of theharmonic crsf is correlated with flux, as expected in the sub-criticalaccretion regime. we argue that vela x-1 has a very narrow accretion columnwith a radius of around 0.4 km that sustains a coulomb interaction dominatedshock at the observed luminosities of lx ~ 3x10^36 erg/s. besides the prominentharmonic line at 55 kev the fundamental line around 25 kev is clearly detected.we find that the strengths of the two crsfs are anti-correlated, which weexplain by photon spawning. this anti-correlation is a possible explanation forthe debate about the existence of the fundamental line. the ratio of the lineenergies is variable with time and deviates significantly from 2.0, also apossible consequence of photon spawning, which changes the shape of the line.during the second observation, vela x-1 showed a short off-state in which thepower-law softened and a cut-off was no longer measurable. it is likely thatthe source switched to a different accretion regime at these low mass accretionrates, explaining the drastic change in spectral shape.

1312.2635	first hard x-ray detection of the non-thermal emission around the arches  cluster: morphology and spectral studies with nustar	the arches cluster is a young, densely packed massive star cluster in ourgalaxy that shows a high level of star formation activity. the nature of theextended non-thermal x-ray emission around the cluster remains unclear. theobserved bright fe k_alpha line emission at 6.4 kev from material that isneutral or in a low ionization state can be produced either by x-rayphotoionization or by cosmic-ray particle bombardment or both. in this paper wereport on the first detection of the extended emission around the archescluster above 10 kev with the nustar mission, and present results on itsmorphology and spectrum. the spatial distribution of the hard x-ray emission isfound to be consistent with the broad region around the cluster where the 6.4kev line is observed. the interpretation of the hard x-ray emission within thecontext of the x-ray reflection model puts a strong constraint on theluminosity of the possible illuminating hard x-ray source. the properties ofthe observed emission are also in broad agreement with the low-energycosmic-ray proton excitation scenario.

1312.5039	nustar and swift observations of the fast rotating magnetized white  dwarf ae aquarii	ae aquarii is a cataclysmic variable with the fastest known rotatingmagnetized white dwarf (p_spin = 33.08 s). compared to many intermediatepolars, ae aquarii shows a soft x-ray spectrum with a very low luminosity (l_x~ 10^{31} erg/s). we have analyzed overlapping observations of this system withthe nustar and the swift x-ray observatories in september of 2012. we find the0.5-30 kev spectra to be well fitted by either an optically thin thermal plasmamodel with three temperatures of 0.75 +0.18 -0.45, 2.29 +0.96 -0.82, and 9.33+6.07 -2.18 kev, or an optically thin thermal plasma model with twotemperatures of 1.00 +0.34 -0.23 and 4.64 +1.58 -0.84 kev plus a power-lawcomponent with photon index of 2.50 +0.17 -0.23. the pulse profile in the 3-20kev band is broad and approximately sinusoidal, with a pulsed fraction of 16.6+/- 2.3%. we do not find any evidence for a previously reported sharp featurein the pulse profile.

1401.3646	the disk wind in the rapidly spinning stellar-mass black hole 4u  1630-472 observed with nustar	we present an analysis of a short nustar observation of the stellar-massblack hole and low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1630$-$472. reflection from the inneraccretion disk is clearly detected for the first time in this source, owing tothe sensitivity of nustar. with fits to the reflection spectrum, we findevidence for a rapidly spinning black hole, $a_{*}=0.985^{+0.005}_{-0.014}$($1\sigma$ statistical errors). however, archival data show that the source hasrelatively low radio luminosity. recently claimed relationships between jetpower and black hole spin would predict either a lower spin or a higher peakradio luminosity. we also report the clear detection of an absorption featureat $7.03\pm0.03$ kev, likely signaling a disk wind. if this line arises indense, moderately ionized gas ($\log\xi=3.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) and is dominated byhe-like fe xxv, the wind has a velocity of $v/c=0.043^{+0.002}_{-0.007}$(12900$^{+600}_{-2100}$ km s$^{-1}$). if the line is instead associated with amore highly ionized gas ($\log\xi=6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$), and is dominated by fexxvi, evidence of a blue-shift is only marginal, after taking systematic errorsinto account. our analysis suggests the ionized wind may be launched within200$-$1100 rg, and may be magnetically driven.

1401.4637	the broadband xmm-newton and nustar x-ray spectra of two ultraluminous  x-ray sources in the galaxy ic 342	we present results for two ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs), ic 342 x-1 andic 342 x-2, using two epochs of xmm-newton and nustar observations separated by$\sim$7 days. we observe little spectral or flux variability above 1 kevbetween epochs, with unabsorbed 0.3--30 kev luminosities being$1.04^{+0.08}_{-0.06} \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for ic 342 x-1 and$7.40\pm0.20 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for ic 342 x-2, so that both wereobserved in a similar, luminous state. both sources have a high absorbingcolumn in excess of the galactic value. neither source has a spectrumconsistent with a black hole binary in low/hard state, and both ulxs exhibitstrong curvature in their broadband x-ray spectra. this curvature rules outmodels that invoke a simple reflection-dominated spectrum with a broadened ironline and no cutoff in the illuminating power-law continuum. x-ray spectrum ofic 342 x-1 can be characterized by a soft disk-like black body component at lowenergies and a cool, optically thick comptonization continuum at high energies,but unique physical interpretation of the spectral components remainschallenging. the broadband spectrum of ic 342 x-2 can be fit by either a hot(3.8 kev) accretion disk, or a comptonized continuum with no indication of aseed photon population. although the seed photon component may be masked bysoft excess emission unlikely to be associated with the binary system, combinedwith the high absorption column, it is more plausible that the broadband x-rayemission arises from a simple thin blackbody disk component. secureidentification of the origin of the spectral components in these sources willlikely require broadband spectral variability studies.

1402.1079	nustar results and future plans for magnetar and rotation-powered pulsar  observations	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) is the first focusing hardx-ray mission in orbit and operates in the 3-79 kev range. nustar's sensitivityis roughly two orders of magnitude better than previous missions in this energyband thanks to its superb angular resolution. since its launch in 2012 june,nustar has performed excellently and observed many interesting sourcesincluding four magnetars, two rotation-powered pulsars and the cataclysmicvariable ae aquarii. nustar also discovered 3.76-s pulsations from thetransient source sgr j1745-29 recently found by swift very close to thegalactic center, clearly identifying the source as a transient magnetar. formagnetar 1e 1841-045, we show that the spectrum is well fit by an absorbedblackbody plus broken power-law model with a hard power-law photon index of~1.3. this is consistent with previous results by integral and rxte. we alsofind an interesting double-peaked pulse profile in the 25-35 kev band. for aeaquarii, we show that the spectrum can be described by a multi-temperaturethermal model or a thermal plus non-thermal model; a multi-temperature thermalmodel without a non-thermal component cannot be ruled out. furthermore, we donot see a spiky pulse profile in the hard x-ray band, as previously reportedbased on suzaku observations. for other magnetars and rotation-powered pulsarsobserved with nustar, data analysis results will be soon available.

1403.0900	nustar detection of high-energy x-ray emission and rapid variability  from sagittarius a* flares	sagittarius a* harbors the supermassive black hole that lies at the dynamicalcenter of our galaxy. sagittarius a* spends most of its time in a lowluminosity emission state but flares frequently in the infrared and x-ray,increasing up to a few hundred fold in brightness for up to a few hours at atime. the physical processes giving rise to the x-ray flares are uncertain.here we report the detection with the nustar observatory in summer and fall2012 of four low to medium amplitude x-ray flares to energies up to 79 kev. forthe first time, we clearly see that the power-law spectrum of sagittarius a*x-ray flares extends to high energy, with no evidence for a cut off. althoughthe photon index of the absorbed power-law fits are in agreement with pastobservations, we find a difference between the photon index of two of theflares (significant at the 95% confidence level). the spectra of the twobrightest flares (~55 times quiescence in the 2-10 kev band) are compared tosimple physical models in an attempt to identify the main x-ray emissionmechanism, but the data do not allow us to significantly discriminate betweenthem. however, we confirm the previous finding that the parameters obtainedwith synchrotron models are, for the x-ray emission, physically more reasonablethan those obtained with inverse-compton models. one flare exhibits large andrapid (&lt; 100 s) variability, which, considering the total energy radiated,constrains the location of the flaring region to be within ~10 schwarzschildradii of the black hole.

1403.2722	nustar observations of the bullet cluster: constraints on inverse  compton emission	the search for diffuse non-thermal inverse compton (ic) emission from galaxyclusters at hard x-ray energies has been undertaken with many instruments, withmost detections being either of low significance or controversial. backgroundand contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusingobservatories result in lower sensitivity to ic emission and a greater chanceof false detection. we present 266ks nustar observations of the bullet cluster,detected from 3-30 kev. nustar's unprecedented hard x-ray focusing capabilitylargely eliminates confusion between diffuse ic and point sources; however, atthe highest energies the background still dominates and must be wellunderstood. to this end, we have developed a complete background modelconstructed of physically inspired components constrained by extragalacticsurvey field observations, the specific parameters of which are derived locallyfrom data in non-source regions of target observations. applying the backgroundmodel to the bullet cluster data, we find that the spectrum is well - but notperfectly - described as an isothermal plasma with kt=14.2+/-0.2 kev. toslightly improve the fit, a second temperature component is added, whichappears to account for lower temperature emission from the cool core, pushingthe primary component to kt~15.3 kev. we see no convincing need to invoke an iccomponent to describe the spectrum of the bullet cluster, and instead arguethat it is dominated at all energies by emission from purely thermal gas. theconservatively derived 90% upper limit on the ic flux of 1.1e-12 erg/s/cm^2(50-100 kev), implying a lower limit on b&gt;0.2{\mu}g, is barely consistent withdetected fluxes previously reported. in addition to discussing the possibleorigin of this discrepancy, we remark on the potential implications of thisanalysis for the prospects for detecting ic in galaxy clusters in the future.

1407.3974	the variable hard x-ray emission of ngc4945 as observed by nustar	we present a broadband (~0.5-79 kev) spectral and temporal analysis ofmultiple nustar observations combined with archival suzaku and chandra data ofngc4945, the brightest extragalactic source at 100 kev. we observe hard x-ray(&gt; 10 kev) flux and spectral variability, with flux variations of a factor 2 ontimescales of 20 ksec. a variable primary continuum dominates the high energyspectrum (&gt;10 kev) in all the states, while the reflected/scattered flux whichdominates at e&lt; 10 kev stays approximately constant. from modelling the complexreflection/transmission spectrum we derive a compton depth along the line ofsight of tau_thomson ~ 2.9, and a global covering factor for the circumnucleargas of ~ 0.15. this agrees with the constraints derived from the high energyvariability, which implies that most of the high energy flux is transmitted,rather that compton-scattered. this demonstrates the effectiveness of spectralanalysis in constraining the geometric properties of the circumnuclear gas, andvalidates similar methods used for analyzing the spectra of other bright,compton-thick agn. the lower limits on the e-folding energy are between 200-300kev, consistent with previous bepposax, suzaku and swift bat observations. theaccretion rate, estimated from the x-ray luminosity and assuming a bolometriccorrection typical of type 2 agn, is in the range ~0.1-0.3 lambda_edd dependingon the flux state. the substantial observed x-ray luminosity variability ofngc4945 implies that large errors can arise from using single-epoch x-ray datato derive l/l_edd values for obscured agns.

1408.1644	a broadband x-ray study of the geminga pulsar with nustar and xmm-newton	we report on the first hard x-ray detection of the geminga pulsar above 10kev using a 150 ks observation with the nustar observatory. the double-peakedpulse profile of non-thermal emission seen in the soft x-ray band persists athigher energies. broadband phase-integrated spectra over the 0.2-20 kev bandwith nustar and archival xmm-newton data do not fit to a conventionaltwo-component model of a blackbody plus power-law, but instead exhibit spectralhardening above ~5 kev. we find two spectral models fit the data well: (1) ablackbody (kt1 ~ 42 ev) with a broken power-law (gamma1 ~ 2.0, gamma2 ~ 1.4 andebreak ~ 3.4 kev), and (2) two blackbody components (kt1 ~ 44 ev and kt2 ~ 195ev) with a power-law component (gamma ~ 1.7). in both cases, the extrapolationof the rayleigh-jeans tail of the thermal component is consistent with the uvdata, while the non-thermal component overpredicts the near-infrared data,requiring a spectral flattening at e ~ 0.01 - 1 kev. while strong phasevariation of the power-law index is present below ~5 kev, our phase-resolvedspectroscopy with nustar indicates that another hard non-thermal component withgamma ~ 1.3 emerges above ~5 kev. the spectral hardening in non-thermal x-rayemission as well as spectral flattening between the optical and x-ray bandsargue against the conjecture that a single power-law may account formulti-wavelength non-thermal spectra of middle-aged pulsars.

1409.3248	no time for dead time: timing analysis of bright black hole binaries  with nustar	timing of high-count rate sources with the nustar small explorer missionrequires specialized analysis techniques. nustar was primarily designed forspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates ratherthan for timing analysis of bright objects. the instrumental dead time perevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percentevent-to-event. the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noiselevel in the power density spectrum (pds) that cannot be modeled easily withthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. in thispaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completelyindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain agood proxy of the white noise-subtracted pds. thereafter, one can use a montecarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely afrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent dropof the sensitivity to variability. in this way, most of the standard timinganalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relativeto what would be achieved using more standard techniques. we apply thistechnique to nustar observations of the black hole binaries gx 339-4, cyg x-1and grs 1915+105.

1411.0670	nustar spectroscopy of multi-component x-ray reflection from ngc 1068	we report on observations of ngc1068 with nustar, which provide the bestconstraints to date on its $&gt;10$~kev spectral shape. we find no strongvariability over the past two decades, consistent with its compton-thick agnclassification. the combined nustar, chandra, xmm-newton, and swift-batspectral dataset offers new insights into the complex reflected emission. thecritical combination of the high signal-to-noise nustar data and a spatialdecomposition with chandra allow us to break several model degeneracies andgreatly aid physical interpretation. when modeled as a monolithic (i.e., asingle n_h) reflector, none of the common compton-reflection models are able tomatch the neutral fluorescence lines and broad spectral shape of the comptonreflection. a multi-component reflector with three distinct column densities(e.g., n_h~1.5e23, 5e24, and 1e25 cm^{-2}) provides a more reasonable fit tothe spectral lines and compton hump, with near-solar fe abundances. in thismodel, the higher n_h components provide the bulk of the compton hump fluxwhile the lower n_h component produces much of the line emission, effectivelydecoupling two key features of compton reflection. we note that ~30% of theneutral fe kalpha line flux arises from &gt;2" (~140 pc), implying that asignificant fraction of the &lt;10 kev reflected component arises from regionswell outside of a parsec-scale torus. these results likely have ramificationsfor the interpretation of poorer signal-to-noise observations and/or moredistant objects [abridged].

1411.4745	nustar observation of a type i x-ray burst from grs 1741.9-2853	we report on two nustar observations of grs 1741.9-2853, a faint neutron starlow mass x-ray binary burster located 10' away from the galactic center. nustardetected the source serendipitously as it was emerging from quiescence: itsluminosity was $6\times 10^{34}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ on 2013 july 31, and $5\times10^{35}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ in a second observation on 2013 august 3. a bright, 800-slong, h-triggered mixed h/he thermonuclear type i burst with mild photosphericradius expansion (pre) was present during the second observation. assuming thatthe luminosity during the pre was at the eddington level, a h mass fraction$x=0.7$ in the atmosphere, and a neutron star mass $m=1.4 m_{\odot}$, wedetermine a new lower limit on the distance for this source of $6.3 \pm 0.5$kpc. combining with previous upper limits, this places grs 1741.9-2853 at adistance of 7 kpc. energy independent (achromatic) variability is observedduring the cooling of the neutron star, which could result from the disturbanceof the inner accretion disk by the burst. the large dynamic range of this burstreveals a long power-law decay tail. we also detect, at a 95.6\% confidencelevel (1.7 $\sigma$), a narrow absorption line at $5.46\pm0.10$ kev during thepre phase of the burst, reminiscent of the detection by waki et al.

1411.6752	the hard x-ray view of the young supernova remnant g1.9+0.3	nustar observed g1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the milkyway, for 350 ks and detected emission up to $\sim$30 kev. the remnant's x-raymorphology does not change significantly across the energy range from 3 to 20kev. a combined fit between nustar and chandra shows that the spectrum steepenswith energy. the spectral shape can be well fitted with synchrotron emissionfrom a power-law electron energy distribution with an exponential cutoff withno additional features. it can also be described by a purely phenomenologicalmodel such as a broken power-law or a power-law with an exponential cutoff,though these descriptions lack physical motivation. using a fixed radio flux at1 ghz of 1.17 jy for the synchrotron model, we get a column density of n$_{\rmh}$ = $(7.23\pm0.07) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a spectral index of$\alpha=0.633\pm0.003$, and a roll-off frequency of $\nu_{\rmrolloff}=(3.07\pm0.18) \times 10^{17}$ hz. this can be explained by particleacceleration, to a maximum energy set by the finite remnant age, in a magneticfield of about 10 $\mu$g, for which our roll-off implies a maximum energy ofabout 100 tev for both electrons and ions. much higher magnetic-field strengthswould produce an electron spectrum that was cut off by radiative losses, givinga much higher roll-off frequency that is independent of magnetic-fieldstrength. in this case, ions could be accelerated to much higher energies. asearch for $^{44}$ti emission in the 67.9 kev line results in an upper limit of$1.5 \times 10^{-5}$ $\,\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$assuming a line width of 4.0 kev (1 sigma).

1502.07765	broadband x-ray imaging and spectroscopy of the crab nebula and pulsar  with nustar	we present broadband (3 -- 78 kev) nustar x-ray imaging and spectroscopy ofthe crab nebula and pulsar. we show that while the phase-averaged and spatiallyintegrated nebula + pulsar spectrum is a power-law in this energy band,spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nebula finds a break at $\sim$9 kev inthe spectral photon index of the torus structure with a steepeningcharacterized by $\delta\gamma\sim0.25$. we also confirm a previously reportedsteepening in the pulsed spectrum, and quantify it with a broken power-law withbreak energy at $\sim$12 kev and $\delta\gamma\sim0.27$. we present spectralmaps of the inner 100\as\ of the remnant and measure the size of the nebula asa function of energy in seven bands. these results find that the rate ofshrinkage with energy of the torus size can be fitted by a power-law with anindex of $\gamma = 0.094\pm 0.018$, consistent with the predictions of kenneland coroniti (1984). the change in size is more rapid in the nw direction,coinciding with the counter-jet where we find the index to be a factor of twolarger. nustar observed the crab during the latter part of a $\gamma$-rayflare, but found no increase in flux in the 3 - 78 kev energy band.

1504.07238	a spatially resolved study of the synchrotron emission and titanium in  tycho's supernova remnant with nustar	we report results from deep observations (~750 ks) of tycho's supernovaremnant (snr) with nustar. using these data, we produce narrow-band images overseveral energy bands to identify the regions producing the hardest x-rays andto search for radioactive decay line emission from 44ti. we find that thehardest (&gt;10 kev) x-rays are concentrated in the southwest of tycho, whererecent chandra observations have revealed high emissivity "stripes" associatedwith particles accelerated to the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum. we do notfind evidence of 44ti, and we set limits on its presence and distributionwithin the snr. these limits correspond to a upper-limit 44ti mass of m44 &lt;2.4x10^-4 m_sun for a distance of 2.3 kpc. we perform spatially resolvedspectroscopic analysis of sixty-six regions across tycho. we map the best-fitrolloff frequency of the hard x-ray spectra, and we compare these results tomeasurements of the shock expansion and ambient density. we find that thehighest energy electrons are accelerated at the lowest densities and in thefastest shocks, with a steep dependence of the roll-off frequency with shockvelocity. such a dependence is predicted by models where the maximum energy ofaccelerated electrons is limited by the age of the snr rather than bysynchrotron losses, but this scenario requires far lower magnetic fieldstrengths than those derived from observations in tycho. one way to reconcilethese discrepant findings is through shock obliquity effects, and futureobservational work is necessary to explore the role of obliquity in theparticle acceleration process.

1506.06182	3c 273 with nustar: unveiling the agn	we present results from a 244\,ks \textit{nustar} observation of 3c\,273obtained during a cross-calibration campaign with the \textit{chandra},\textit{integral}, \textit{suzaku}, \textit{swift}, and \textit{xmm-newton}observatories. we show that the spectrum, when fit with a power-law model usingdata from all observatories except \textit{integral} over the 1--78\,kev band,leaves significant residuals in the \textit{nustar} data between 30--78\,kev.the \nustar\ 3--78\,kev spectrum is well-described by an exponentially cutoffpower-law ($\gamma = 1.646 \pm 0.006$, e$_\mathrm{cutoff} =202_{-34}^{+51}$\,kev) with a weak reflection component from cold, densematerial. there is also evidence for a weak ($ew = 23 \pm 11$ ev) neutral ironline. we interpret these features as arising from coronal emission plusreflection off an accretion disk or distant material. beyond 80\,kev\textit{integral} data show clear excess flux relative to an extrapolation ofthe agn model fit to \nustar. this high-energy power-law is consistent with thepresence of a beamed jet, which begins to dominate over emission from the inneraccretion flow at 30-40 kev. modeling the jet locally (in the \textit{nustar} +\textit{integral} band) as a power-law, we find the coronal component is fit by$\gamma_\mathrm{agn} = 1.638 \pm 0.045$, $e_\mathrm{cutoff} = 47 \pm 15$\,kev,and jet photon index by $\gamma_\mathrm{jet} = 1.05 \pm 0.4$. we also consider\textit{fermi}/lat observations of 3c\,273 and here the broad-band spectrum ofthe jet can be described by a log-parabolic model, peaking at $\sim 2$\,mev.finally, we investigate the spectral variability in the \textit{nustar} bandand find an inverse correlation between flux and $\gamma$.

1506.07175	nustar observations of the powerful radio-galaxy cygnus a	we present nustar observations of the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a,focusing on the central absorbed active galactic nucleus (agn). cygnus a isembedded in a cool-core galaxy cluster, and hence we also examine archivalxmm-newton data to facilitate the decomposition of the spectrum into the agnand intracluster medium (icm) components. nustar gives a source-dominatedspectrum of the agn out to &gt;70kev. in gross terms, the nustar spectrum of theagn has the form of a power law (gamma~1.6-1.7) absorbed by a neutral columndensity of n_h~1.6x10^23 cm^-2. however, we also detect curvature in the hard(&gt;10kev) spectrum resulting from reflection by compton-thick matter out of ourline-of-sight to the x-ray source. compton reflection, possibly from the outeraccretion disk or obscuring torus, is required even permitting a high-energycutoff in the continuum source; the limit on the cutoff energy is e_cut&gt;111kev(90% confidence). interestingly, the absorbed power-law plus reflection modelleaves residuals suggesting the absorption/emission from a fast(15,000-26,000km/s), high column-density (n_w&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2), highly ionized(xi~2,500 erg cm/s) wind. a second, even faster ionized wind component is alsosuggested by these data. we show that the ionized wind likely carries asignificant mass and momentum flux, and may carry sufficient kinetic energy toexercise feedback on the host galaxy. if confirmed, the simultaneous presenceof a strong wind and powerful jets in cygnus a demonstrates that feedback fromradio-jets and sub-relativistic winds are not mutually exclusive phases of agnactivity but can occur simultaneously.

1507.04534	nustar discovery of an unusually steady long-term spin-up of the be  binary 2rxp j130159.6-635806	we present spectral and timing analysis of nustar observations of theaccreting x-ray pulsar 2rxp j130159.6-635806. the source was serendipitouslyobserved during a campaign focused on the gamma-ray binary psr b1259-63 and waslater targeted for a dedicated observation. the spectrum has a typical shapefor accreting x-ray pulsars, consisting of a simple power law with anexponential cutoff starting at ~7 kev with a folding energy of e_fold=~18 kev.there is also an indication of the presence of a 6.4 kev iron line in thespectrum at the ~3 sigma significance level. nustar measurements of thepulsation period reveal that the pulsar has undergone a strong and steadyspin-up for the last 20 years. the pulsed fraction is estimated to be ~80%, andis constant with energy up to 40 kev. the power density spectrum shows a breaktowards higher frequencies relative to the current spin period. this, togetherwith steady persistent luminosity, points to a long-term mass accretion ratehigh enough to bring the pulsar out of spin equilibrium.

1507.08740	hard x-ray morphological and spectral studies of the galactic center  molecular cloud sgr b2: constraining past sgr a* flaring activity	galactic center (gc) molecular cloud sgr b2 is the best manifestation of anx-ray reflection nebula (xrn) reprocessing a past giant outburst from thesupermassive black hole sgr a*. alternatively, sgr b2 could be illuminated bylow-energy cosmic ray electrons (lecre) or protons (lecrp). in 2013, nustar forthe first time resolved sgr b2 hard x-ray emission on sub-arcminute scales. twoprominent features are detected above 10 kev - a newly emerging cloudg0.66-0.13 and the central 90" radius region containing two compact cores sgrb2(m) and sgr b2(n) surrounded by diffuse emission. it is inconclusive whetherthe remaining level of sgr b2 emission is still decreasing or has reached aconstant background level. a decreasing fe k$\alpha$ emission can be bestexplained by xrn while a constant background emission can be best explained bylecrp. in the xrn scenario, the 3-79 kev sgr b2 spectrum can well constrain thepast sgr a* outburst, resulting in an outburst spectrum with a peak luminosityof $l_{3-79\rm~kev} \sim 5\times10^{38} \rm~erg~s^{-1}$ derived from themaximum compton-scattered continuum and the fe k$\alpha$ emission consistently.the xrn scenario is preferred by the fast variability of g0.66-0.13, whichcould be a molecular clump located in the sgr b2 envelope reflecting the samesgr a* outburst. in the lecrp scenario, we derived the required cr ion power$dw/dt=(1-4)\times10^{39}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and the cr ionization rate$\zeta_{h}=(6-10)\times 10^{-15}\rm~h^{-1}~s^{-1}$. the sgr b2 background levelx-ray emission will be a powerful tool to constrain gc cr population.

1510.04453	a nustar survey of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present a nustar, chandra, and xmm--newton survey of nine of the nearestultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). the unprecedented sensitivity ofnustar at energies above 10 kev enables spectral modeling with far betterprecision than was previously possible. six of the nine sources observed weredetected sufficiently well by nustar to model in detail their broadband x-rayspectra, and recover the levels of obscuration and intrinsic x-rayluminosities. only one source (iras 13120--5453) has a spectrum consistent witha compton--thick agn, but we cannot rule out that a second source (arp 220)harbors an extremely highly obscured agn as well. variability in column density(reduction by a factor of a few compared to older observations) is seen in iras05189--2524 and mrk 273, altering the classification of these border-linesources from compton-thick to compton-thin. the ulirgs in our sample havesurprisingly low observed fluxes in high energy (&gt;10 kev) x-rays, especiallycompared to their bolometric luminosities. they have lower ratios of unabsorbed2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity, and unabsorbed 2--10 kev to mid-ir [o iv]line luminosity than do seyfert 1 galaxies. we identify iras 08572+3915 asanother candidate intrinsically x-ray weak source, similar to mrk 231. wespeculate that the x-ray weakness of iras 08572+3915 is related to its powerfuloutflow observed at other wavelengths.

1510.04631	nustar hard x-ray survey of the galactic center region i: hard x-ray  morphology and spectroscopy of the diffuse emission	we present the first sub-arcminute images of the galactic center above 10kev, obtained with nustar. nustar resolves the hard x-ray source igrj17456-2901 into non-thermal x-ray filaments, molecular clouds, point sourcesand a previously unknown central component of hard x-ray emission (chxe).nustar detects four non-thermal x-ray filaments, extending the detection oftheir power-law spectra with $\gamma\sim1.3$-$2.3$ up to ~50 kev. amorphological and spectral study of the filaments suggests that their originmay be heterogeneous, where previous studies suggested a common origin in youngpulsar wind nebulae (pwne). nustar detects non-thermal x-ray continuum emissionspatially correlated with the 6.4 kev fe k$\alpha$ fluorescence line emissionassociated with two sgr a molecular clouds: mc1 and the bridge. broad-bandx-ray spectral analysis with a monte-carlo based x-ray reflection modelself-consistently determined their intrinsic column density ($\sim10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), primary x-ray spectra (power-laws with $\gamma\sim2$) and set alower limit of the x-ray luminosity of sgr a* flare illuminating the sgr aclouds to $l_x \stackrel{&gt;}{\sim} 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. above ~20 kev, hardx-ray emission in the central 10 pc region around sgr a* consists of thecandidate pwn g359.95-0.04 and the chxe, possibly resulting from an unresolvedpopulation of massive cvs with white dwarf masses $m_{\rm wd} \sim 0.9m_{\odot}$. spectral energy distribution analysis suggests that g359.95-0.04 islikely the hard x-ray counterpart of the ultra-high gamma-ray source hessj1745-290, strongly favoring a leptonic origin of the gc tev emission.

1512.03957	the nustar view of the non-thermal emission from psr j0437-4715	we present a hard x-ray nustar observation of psr j0437-4715, the nearestmillisecond pulsar. the known pulsations at the apparent pulse period ~5.76 msare detected at energies up to 20 kev. we measure a photon index $\gamma=1.65\pm0.24$ (90% confidence) for the power law fit to the non-thermalemission. it had been shown that spectral models with two or three thermalcomponents fit the xmm-newton spectrum of psr j0437-4715, depending on theslope of the power-law component, and the amount of absorption of soft x-rays.the new constraint on the high-energy emission provided by nustar removesambiguities regarding the thermal components of the emission below 3 kev. weperformed a simultaneous spectral analysis of the xmm-newton and nustar data toconfirm that three thermal components and a power law are required to fit the0.3-20 kev emission of psr j0437-4715. adding a rosat-pspc spectrum furtherconfirmed this result and allowed us to better constrain the temperatures ofthe three thermal components. a phase-resolved analysis of the nustar datarevealed no significant change in the photon index of the high-energy emission.this nustar observation provides further impetus for future observations withthe nicer mission (neutron star interior composition explorer) whosesensitivity will provide much stricter constraints on the equation of state ofnuclear matter by combining model fits to the pulsar's phase-folded lightcurvewith the pulsar's well-defined mass and distance from radio timingobservations.

astro-ph;0010372	the beta problem: a study of abell 262	we present an investigation of the dynamical state of the cluster a262.existing optical line of sight velocities for select cluster galaxies have beenaugmented by new data obtained with the automated multi-object spectrograph atlick observatory. we find evidence for a virialized early-type populationdistinct from a late-type population infalling from the pisces-perseussupercluster ridge. we also report on a tertiary population of low luminositygalaxies whose velocity dispersion distinguishes them from both the early andlate-type galaxies. we supplement our investigation with an analysis ofarchival x-ray data. a temperature is determined using asca gis data and a gasprofile is derived from rosat hri data. the increased statistics of our sampleresults in a picture of a262 with significant differences from earlier work. apreviously proposed solution to the "beta-problem" in a262 in which the gastemperature is significantly higher than the galaxy temperature is shown toresult from using too low a velocity dispersion for the early-type galaxies.our data present a consistent picture of a262 in which there is no"beta-problem", and the gas and galaxy temperature are roughly comparable.there is no longer any requirement for extensive galaxy-gas feedback todrastically overheat the gas with respect to the galaxies. we also demonstratethat entropy-floor models can explain the recent discovery that the beta valuesdetermined by cluster gas and the cluster core radii are correlated.

astro-ph;0109463	a novel antimatter detector based on x-ray deexcitation of exotic atoms	we propose a novel antiparticle detector. the gaseous antiparticlespectrometer (gaps) effects particle identification through the characteristicx-rays emitted by antiparticles when they form exotic atoms in gases. gapsobtains particularly high grasp (effective area--solid angle product) at lowerparticle energies, where conventional schemes are most limited in theirutility. the concept is simple and lightweight, so it can be readily employedon balloon and space-based missions. an extremely powerful potentialapplication of gaps is a space-based search for the neutralino through thedetection of a neutralino annihilation by-product -- the antideuteron.paradoxically, this space-based search for the neutralino is capable ofachieving comparable sensitivity to as yet unrealized third generation,underground dark matter experiments. and gaps can obtain this performance in avery modest satellite experiment. gaps can also provide superior performance insearches for primary antiprotons produced via neutralino annihilation, blackhole evaporation and in probing subdominant contributions to the antiprotonflux at low energies. in a deep space mission gaps will obtain highersensitivity for a given weight and power than bgo calorimeters.
