0902.0064	the optical structure of the starburst galaxy m82 - i: dynamics of the  disk and inner-wind	[abridged] we present gemini-n gmos-ifu observations of the central starburstclumps and inner wind of m82, together with wiyn densepak ifu observations ofthe inner 2x0.9kpc of the disk. these cover the emission lines of h$\alpha$,[nii], [sii], and [siii]. we were able to accurately decompose the emissionline profiles into multiple narrow components (fwhm~30-130kms) superimposed ona broad (fwhm 150-350kms) feature. this paper is the first of a seriesexamining the optical structure of m82's disk and inner wind; here we focus onthe ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevantemission line properties.  our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of m82 isdynamically complex. localised line splitting of up to 100kms in the narrowcomponent is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionizedgas. we have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinctoutflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and wediscuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing windoutflow.  the broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasinglyimportant moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general withincreasing height above/below the plane. following our recent work on theorigins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clumpinterface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulentmixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasinglyimportant with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existenceof mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area.

0906.2006	a spectroscopic census of the m82 stellar cluster population	we present a spectroscopic study of the stellar cluster population of m82,the archetype starburst galaxy, based primarily on new gemini-northmulti-object spectroscopy of 49 star clusters. these observations constitutethe largest to date spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic young clusters,giving virtually continuous coverage across the galaxy; we use these data todeduce information about the clusters as well as the m82 post-starburst diskand nuclear starburst environments. spectroscopic age-dating places clusters inthe nucleus and disk between (7, 15) and (30, 270) myr, with distribution peaksat ~10 and ~140 myr respectively. we find cluster radial velocities in therange (-160, 220) km/s (wrt the galaxy centre) and line of sight na i dinterstellar absorption line velocities in (-75, 200) km/s, in many casesentirely decoupled from the clusters. as the disk cluster radial velocities lieon the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve, we conclude that they comprise aregularly orbiting system. our observations suggest that the largest part ofthe population was created as a result of the close encounter with m81 ~220 myrago. clusters in the nucleus are found in solid body rotation on the bar. thepossible detection of wr features in their spectra indicates that clusterformation continues in the central starburst zone. we also report the potentialdiscovery of two old populous clusters in the halo of m82, aged &gt;8 gyr. usingthese measurements and simple dynamical considerations, we derive a toy modelfor the invisible physical structure of the galaxy, and confirm the existenceof two dominant spiral arms.

0907.3162	the optical structure of the starburst galaxy m82. ii. nebular  properties of the disk and inner-wind	(abridged) in this second paper of the series, we present the results fromoptical gemini-north gmos-ifu and wiyn densepak ifu spectroscopic observationsof the starburst and inner wind zones of m82, with a focus on the state of thet~10^4 k ionized interstellar medium. our electron density maps show peaks of afew 1000 cm-3, local small spatial-scale variations, and a fall-off in theminor axis direction. we discuss the implications of these results with regardsto the conditions/locations that may favour the escape of individual clusterwinds. our findings imply that the starburst environment is highly fragmentedinto a range of clouds from small/dense clumps with low filling factors (&lt;1pc,n_e&gt;10^4 cm-3) to larger filling factor, less dense gas. the near-constantstate of the ionization state of the ~10^4 k gas throughout the starburst canbe explained as a consequence of the small cloud sizes, which allow the gasconditions to respond quickly to any changes. we have examined in more detailboth the broad (fwhm 150-350 km/s) line component found in paper i that weassociated with emission from turbulent mixing layers on the gas clouds, andthe discrete outflow channel identified within the inner wind. the channelappears as a coherent, expanding cylindrical structure of length &gt;120 pc andand width 35-50 pc and the walls maintain an approximately constant (butsubsonic) expansion velocity of ~60 km/s. we use the channel to examine furtherthe relationship between the narrow and broad component emitting gas within theinner wind. within the starburst energy injection zone, we find that turbulentmotions (as traced by the broad component) appear to play an increasing rolewith height.

1002.0288	vlt-mad observations of the core of 30 doradus	we present h- and ks-band imaging of three fields at the centre of 30 doradusin the large magellanic cloud, obtained as part of the science demonstrationprogramme with the multi-conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator (mad) at thevery large telescope. strehl ratios of 15-30% were achieved in the ks-band,yielding near-infrared images of this dense and complex region at unprecedentedangular resolution at these wavelengths. the mad data are used to construct anear-infrared luminosity profile for r136, the cluster at the core of 30 dor.using cluster profiles of the form used by elson et al., we find the surfacebrightness can be fit by a relatively shallow power-law function(gamma~1.5-1.7) over the full extent of the mad data, which extends to a radiusof ~40" (~10pc). we do not see compelling evidence for a break in theluminosity profile as seen in optical data in the literature, arguing thatcluster asymmetries are the dominant source, although extinction effects andstars from nearby triggered star-formation likely also contribute. theseresults highlight the need to consider cluster asymmetries and multiple spatialcomponents in interpretation of the luminosity profiles of distant unresolvedclusters. we also investigate seven candidate young stellar objects reported bygruendl &amp; chu from spitzer observations, six of which have apparentcounterparts in the mad images. the most interesting of these (gc09:053839.24-690552.3) appears related to a striking bow-shock--like feature,orientated away from both r136 and the wolf-rayet star brey 75, at distances of19.5" and 8" (4.7 and 1.9pc in projection), respectively.

1002.2894	on the fraction of star clusters surviving the embedded phase	in this paper we derive ages and masses for 276 clusters in the merger galaxyngc 3256. this was achieved by taking accurate photometry in four wavebandsfrom archival hst images. photometric measurements are compared to syntheticstellar population (ssp) models to find the most probable age, mass andextinction. the cluster population of ngc 3256 reveals an increase in the starformation rate over the last 100 million years and the initial cluster massfunction (icmf) is best described by a power law relation with slope $\alpha =1.85 \pm 0.12$. using the observed cluster population for ngc 3256 we calculatethe implied mass of clusters younger than 10 million years old, and convertthis to a cluster formation rate over the last 10 million years. comparison ofthis value with the star formation rate (sfr) indicates the fraction of starsfound within bound clusters after the embedded phase of cluster formation,$\gamma$, is $22.9% \pm^{7.3}_{9.8} $ for ngc 3256. we carried out an in-depthanalysis into the errors associated with such calculations showing that errorsintroduced by the ssp fitting must be taken into account and an unconstrainedmetallicity adds to these uncertainties. observational biases should also beconsidered. using published cluster population data sets we calculate $\gamma$for six other galaxies and examine how $\gamma$ varies with environment. weshow that $\gamma$ increases with the star formation rate density and can bedescribed as a power law type relation of the form $\gamma(%) = (29.0\pm{6.0})\sigma_{sfr}^{0.24\pm0.04} (\msol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2})$.

0707.4635	ionized and neutral gas in the peculiar star/cluster complex in ngc 6946	the characteristics of ionized and hi gas in the peculiar star/clustercomplex in ngc 6946, obtained with the 6-m telescope (bta) sao ras, the gemininorth telescope, and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt), arepresented. the complex is unusual as hosting a super star cluster, the mostmassive known in an apparently non-interacting giant galaxy. it contains anumber of smaller clusters and is bordered by a sharp c-shaped rim. we foundthat the complex is additionally unusual in having peculiar gas kinematics. thevelocity field of the ionized gas reveals a deep oval minimum, ~300 pc in size,centered 7" east of the supercluster. the vr of the ionized gas in the dipcenter is 100 km/s lower than in its surroundings, and emission lines withinthe dip appear to be shock excited. this dip is near the center of an hi holeand a semi-ring of hii regions. the hi (and less certainly, hii) velocityfields reveal expansion, with the velocity reaching ~30 km/s at a distanceabout 300 pc from the center of expansion, which is near the deep minimumposition. the super star cluster is at the western rim of the minimum. thesharp western rim of the whole complex is plausibly a manifestation of aregular dust arc along the complex edge. different hypotheses about the complexand the vr depression origins are discussed, including a hvc/dark mini-haloimpact, a bcd galaxy merging, and a gas outflow due to release of energy fromthe supercluster stars.

0708.0814	the young cluster population of m82 region b	we present observations obtained with the advanced camera for surveys onboard the hubble space telescope of the "fossil" starburst region b in thenearby starburst galaxy m82. by comparing ubvi photometry with models, wederive ages and extinctions for 35 u-band selected star clusters. we find thatthe peak epoch of cluster formation occurred ~ 150 myr ago, in contrast toearlier work that found a peak formation age of 1.1 gyr. the difference is mostlikely due to our inclusion of u-band data, which are essential for accurateage determinations of young cluster populations. we further show that thepreviously reported turnover in the cluster luminosity function is probably dueto the neglect of the effect of extended sources on the detection limit. themuch younger cluster ages we derive clarifies the evolution of the m82starburst. the m82-b age distribution now overlaps with the ages of: thenuclear starburst; clusters formed on the opposite side of the disk; and thelast encounter with m81, some 220 myr ago.

1009.1150	the spatial distribution of star formation in the solar neighbourhood:  do all stars form in clusters?	we present a global study of low mass, young stellar object (yso) surfacedensities in nearby (&lt; 500 pc) star forming regions based on a comprehensivecollection of spitzer space telescope surveys. we show that the distribution ofyso surface densities in the solar neighbourhood is a smooth distribution,being adequately described by a lognormal function from a few to 10^3 ysos perpc^2, with a peak at 22 stars/pc^2 and a dispersion of 0.85. we do not findevidence for multiple discrete modes of star-formation (e.g. clustered anddistributed). comparing the observed surface density distribution to previouslyreported surface density threshold definitions of clusters, we find that thefraction of stars in clusters is crucially dependent on the adopteddefinitions, ranging from 40 to 90%. however, we find that only a low fraction(&lt; 26%) of stars are formed in dense environments where theirformation/evolution (along with their circumstellar disks and/or planets) maybe affected by the close proximity of their low-mass neighbours.

1010.1837	the evolution of stellar structures in dwarf galaxies	we present a study of the variation of spatial structure of stellarpopulations within dwarf galaxies as a function of the population age. we usedeep hubble space telescope/advanced camera for surveys imaging of nearby dwarfgalaxies in order to resolve individual stars and create compositecolour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for each galaxy. using the obtained cmds, weselect blue helium burning stars (bhebs), which can be unambiguously age-datedby comparing the absolute magnitude of individual stars with stellarisochrones. additionally, we select a very young (&lt;10 myr) population of obstars for a subset of the galaxies based on the tip of the young main-sequence.by selecting stars in different age ranges we can then study how the spatialdistribution of these stars evolves with time. we find, in agreement withprevious studies, that stars are born within galaxies with a high degree ofsubstructure which is made up of a continuous distribution of clusters, groupsand associations from parsec to hundreds of parsec scales. these structuresdisperse on timescales of tens to hundreds of myr, which we quantify using thetwo-point correlation function and the q-parameter developed by cartwright &amp;whitworth (2004). on galactic scales, we can place lower limits on the time ittakes to remove the original structure (i.e., structure survives for at leastthis long), tevo, which varies between ~100~myr (ngc~2366) and ~350 myr(ddo~165). this is similar to what we have found previously for the smc(~80~myr) and the lmc (~175 myr). we do not find any strong correlationsbetween tevo and the luminosity of the host galaxy.

1101.5393	star clusters in the tidal tails of interacting galaxies: cluster  populations across a variety of tail environments	we have searched for compact stellar structures within 17 tidal tails in 13different interacting galaxies using f606w- and f814w- band images from thewide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) on the hubble space telescope (hst). thesample of tidal tails includes a diverse population of optical properties,merging galaxy mass ratios, hi content, and ages. combining our tail samplewith knierman et al. (2003), we find evidence of star clusters formed in situwith mv &lt; -8.5 and v-i &lt; 2.0 in 10 of 23 tidal tails; we are able to identifycluster candidates to mv = -6.5 in the closest tails. three tails offer clearexamples of "beads on a string" star formation morphology in v-i color maps.two tails present both tidal dwarf galaxy (tdg) candidates and clustercandidates. statistical diagnostics indicate that clusters in tidal tails maybe drawn from the same power-law luminosity functions (with logarithmic slopes~ -2 - -2.5) found in quiescent spiral galaxies and the interiors ofinteracting systems. we find that the tail regions with the largest number ofobservable clusters are relatively young (&lt; 250 myr old) and bright (v &lt; 24 magarcsec^(-2)), probably attributed to the strong bursts of star formation ininteracting systems soon after periapse. otherwise, we find no statisticaldifference between cluster-rich and cluster-poor tails in terms of manyobservable characteristics, though this analysis suffers from complex,unresolved gas dynamics and projection effects.

1103.5386	the vlt-flames tarantula survey i: introduction and observational  overview	the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts) is an eso large programme that hasobtained multi-epoch optical spectroscopy of over 800 massive stars in the 30doradus region of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). here we introduce ourscientific motivations and give an overview of the survey targets, includingoptical and near-infrared photometry and comprehensive details of the datareduction. one of the principal objectives was to detect massive binary systemsvia variations in their radial velocities, thus shaping the multi-epochobserving strategy. spectral classifications are given for the massiveemission-line stars observed by the survey, including the discovery of a newwolf-rayet star (vfts 682, classified as wn5h), 2' to the northeast of r136. toillustrate the diversity of objects encompassed by the survey, we investigatethe spectral properties of sixteen targets identified by gruendl &amp; chu fromspitzer photometry as candidate young stellar objects or stars with notablemid-infrared excesses. detailed spectral classification and quantitativeanalysis of the o- and b-type stars in the vfts sample, paying particularattention to the effects of rotational mixing and binarity, will be presentedin a series of future articles to address fundamental questions in both stellarand cluster evolution.

1105.1775	the vlt-flames tarantula survey iii: a very massive star in apparent  isolation from the massive cluster r136	vfts 682 is located in an active star-forming region, at a projected distanceof 29 pc from the young massive cluster r136 in the tarantula nebula of thelarge magellanic cloud. it was previously reported as a candidate young stellarobject, and more recently spectroscopically revealed as a hydrogen-richwolf-rayet (wn5h) star. our aim is to obtain the stellar properties, such asits intrinsic luminosity, and to investigate the origin of vfts 682. to thispurpose, we model optical spectra from the vlt-flames tarantula survey with thenon-lte stellar atmosphere code cmfgen, as well as the spectral energydistribution from complementary optical and infrared photometry. we find theextinction properties to be highly peculiar (rv ~4.7), and obtain asurprisingly high luminosity log(l/lsun) = 6.5 \pm 0.2, corresponding to apresent-day mass of ~150msun. the high effective temperature of 52.2 \pm 2.5kkmight be explained by chemically homogeneous evolution - suggested to be thekey process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. lightcurves of theobject show variability at the 10% level on a timescale of years. such changesare unprecedented for classical wolf-rayet stars, and are more reminiscent ofluminous blue variables. finally, we discuss two possibilities for the originof vfts 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profoundimplications for the formation mechanism of massive stars, or (ii) vfts 682 isa slow runaway star that originated from the dense cluster r136, which wouldmake it the most massive runaway known to date.

1105.5840	star clusters as tracers of interactions in stephan's quintet (hickson  compact group 92)	stephan's quintet (sq) is a compact group of galaxies that exhibits numeroussigns of interactions between its members. using high resolution images of sqin b438, v606, and i814 bands from the early release science project obtainedwith the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope, we identify 496star cluster candidates (sccs), located throughout the galaxies themselves aswell as in intergalactic regions. our photometry goes \sim2 mag deeper andcovers an additional three regions, the old tail, ngc 7317, and the southerndebris region, compared to previous work. through comparison of the b438 - v606and v606 - i814 colors of the star cluster candidates with simple stellarpopulation synthesis models we are able to constrain cluster ages. inparticular, the most massive galaxy of sq, ngc 7319, exhibits continuous starformation throughout its history, although at a lower rate over the past fewtens of myr. ngc 7318 a/b and the northern star burst region both show ongoingactive star formation; there are a number of star clusters that are youngerthan 10 myr. ngc 7318 a/b also features a peculiar gap in the colordistribution of the star clusters that can be used to date the onset of therecent burst. the majority of the sccs detected in the young tail were formed150-200 myr ago whereas the tight distribution of star cluster colors in theold tail, allow us to constrain its age of formation to \sim400 myr ago. thestar clusters in the southern debris region are seemingly divided into twogroups with ages of 50 and \sim500 myr and virtually all of the sccs detectedin ngc 7317 are over 2 gyr old. based on these ages, we estimate time intervalsfor the interactions between sq members that triggered the massive star clusterformation.

1106.2427	evidence for environmentally dependent cluster disruption in m83	using multi-wavelength imaging from the wide field camera 3 on the hubblespace telescope we study the stellar cluster populations of two adjacent fieldsin the nearby face-on spiral galaxy, m83. the observations cover the galacticcentre and reach out to ~6 kpc, thereby spanning a large range of environmentalconditions, ideal for testing empirical laws of cluster disruption. theclusters are selected by visual inspection to be centrally concentrated,symmetric, and resolved on the images. we find that a large fraction of objectsdetected by automated algorithms (e.g. sextractor or daofind) are not clusters,but rather are associations. these are likely to disperse into the field ontimescales of tens of myr due to their lower stellar densities and not due togas expulsion (i.e. they were never gravitationally bound). we split the sampleinto two discrete fields (inner and outer regions of the galaxy) and search forevidence of environmentally dependent cluster disruption. colour-colourdiagrams of the clusters, when compared to simple stellar population models,already indicate that a much larger fraction of the clusters in the outer fieldare older by tens of myr than in the inner field. this impression is quantifiedby estimating each cluster's properties (age, mass, and extinction) andcomparing the age/mass distributions between the two fields. our results areinconsistent with "universal" age and mass distributions of clusters, andinstead show that the ambient environment strongly affects the observedpopulations.

1106.4560	resolved photometry of extragalactic young massive star clusters	we present colour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for a sample of seven youngmassive clusters in the galaxies ngc 1313, ngc 1569, ngc 1705, ngc 5236 and ngc7793. the clusters have ages in the range 5-50 million years and masses of 10^5-10^6 msun. although crowding prevents us from obtaining photometry in thecentral regions of the clusters, we are still able to measure up to 30-100supergiant stars in each of the richest clusters, along with the brighter mainsequence stars. the resulting cmds and luminosity functions are compared withphotometry of artificially generated clusters, designed to reproduce thephotometric errors and completeness as realistically as possible. in agreementwith previous studies, our cmds show no clear gap between the h-burning mainsequence and the he-burning supergiant stars, contrary to predictions by commonstellar isochrones. in general, the isochrones also fail to match the observednumber ratios of red-to-blue supergiant stars, although the difficulty ofseparating blue supergiants from the main sequence complicates this comparison.in several cases we observe a large spread (1-2 mag) in the luminosities of thesupergiant stars that cannot be accounted for by observational errors. thisspread can be reproduced by including an age spread of 10-30 million years inthe models. however, age spreads cannot fully account for the observedmorphology of the cmds and other processes, such as the evolution ofinteracting binary stars, may also play a role.

0710.1028	gemini spectroscopy and hst imaging of the stellar cluster population in  region b of m82	we present new spectroscopic observations of the stellar cluster populationof region b in the prototype starburst galaxy m82 obtained with the gillettgemini-north 8.1-metre telescope. by coupling the spectroscopy with ubviphotometry acquired with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubblespace telescope (hst), we derive ages, extinctions and radial velocities forseven young massive clusters (ymcs) in region b. we find the clusters to haveages between 70 and 200 myr and velocities in the range 230 to 350 km/s, whileextinctions av vary between ~1-2.5 mag. we also find evidence of differentialextinction across the faces of some clusters which hinders the photometricdetermination of ages and extinctions in these cases. the cluster radialvelocities indicate that the clusters are located at different depths withinthe disk, and are on regular disk orbits. our results overall contradict thefindings of previous studies, where region b was thought to be a bound regionpopulated by intermediate-age clusters that formed in an independent, offsetstarburst episode that commenced 600 myr-1 gyr ago. our findings insteadsuggest that region b is optically bright because of low extinction patches,and this allows us to view the cluster population of the inner m82 disk, whichprobably formed as a result of the last encounter with m81. this study formspart of a series of papers aimed at studying the cluster population of m82using deep optical spectroscopy and multi-band photometry.

1109.6015	stellar clusters in m83: formation, evolution, disruption and the  influence of environment	we study the stellar cluster population in two adjacent fields in the nearby,face-on spiral galaxy, m83, using wfc3/hst imaging. the clusters are selectedthrough visual inspection to be centrally concentrated, symmetric, and resolvedon the images, which allows us to differentiate between clusters and likelyunbound associations. we compare our sample with previous studies and show thatthe differences between the catalogues are largely due to the inclusion oflarge numbers of diffuse associations within previous catalogues. theluminosity function of the clusters is well approximated by a power-law withindex, -2, over most of the observed range, however a steepening is seen at m_v= -9.3 and -8.8 in the inner and outer fields, respectively. additionally, weshow that the cluster population is inconsistent with a pure power-law massdistribution, but instead exhibits a truncation at the high mass end. ifdescribed as a schechter function, the characteristic mass is 1.6 and 0.5 *10^5 msun, for the inner and outer fields, respectively, in agreement withprevious estimates of other cluster populations in spiral galaxies. comparingthe predictions of the mass independent disruption (mid) and mass dependentdisruption (mdd) scenarios with the observed distributions, we find that bothmodels can accurately fit the data. however, for the mid case, the fraction ofclusters destroyed (or mass lost) per decade in age is dependent on theenvironment, hence, the age/mass distributions of clusters are not universal.in the mdd case, the disruption timescale scales with galactocentric distance(being longer in the outer regions of the galaxy) in agreement with analyticand numerical predictions. finally, we discuss the implications of our resultson other extragalactic surveys, focussing on the fraction of stars that form inclusters and the need (or lack thereof) for infant mortality.

1201.5149	gemini spectroscopic survey of young star clusters in  merging/interacting galaxies. iv. stephan's quintet	we present a spectroscopic survey of 21 young massive clusters and complexesand one tidal dwarf galaxy candidate (tdg) in stephan's quintet, an interactingcompact group of galaxies. all of the selected targets lie outside the maingalaxies of the system and are associated with tidal debris. we find clusterswith ages between a few and 125 myr and confirm the ages estimated through hstphotometry by fedotov et al. (2011), as well as their modelled interactionhistory of the quintet. many of the clusters are found to be relativelylong-lived, given their spectrosopically derived ages, while their high massessuggest that they will likely evolve to eventually become intergalacticclusters. one cluster, t118, is particularly interesting, given its age (\sim125 myr), high mass (\sim 2\times10^6 m\odot) and position in the extreme outerend of the young tidal tail. this cluster appears to be quite extended (reff\sim 12 - 15 pc) compared to clusters observed in galaxy disks (reff \sim 3 - 4pc), which confirms an effect we previously found in the tidal tails of ngc3256, where clusters are similarly extended. we find that star and clusterformation can proceed at a continuous pace for at least \sim 150 myr within thetidal debris of interacting galaxies. the spectrum of the tdg candidate isdominated by a young population (\sim 7 myr), and assuming a single age for theentire region, has a mass of at least 10^6 m\odot.

1203.5825	spectroscopic constraints on the form of the stellar cluster mass  function	this contribution addresses the question of whether the initial cluster massfunction (icmf) has a fundamental limit (or truncation) at high masses. theshape of the icmf at high masses can be studied using the most massive young(&lt;10 myr) clusters, however this has proven difficult due to low-numberstatistics. in this contribution we use an alternative method based on theluminosities of the brightest clusters, combined with their ages. if atruncation is present, a generic prediction (nearly independent of the clusterdisruption law adopted) is that the median age of bright clusters should beyounger than that of fainter clusters. in the case of an non-truncated icmf,the median age should be independent of cluster luminosity. here, we presentoptical spectroscopy of twelve young stellar clusters in the face-on spiralgalaxy ngc 2997. the spectra are used to estimate the age of each cluster, andthe brightness of the clusters is taken from the literature. the observationsare compared with the model expectations of larsen (2009) for various icmfforms and both mass dependent and mass independent cluster disruption. whilethere exists some degeneracy between the truncation mass and the amount of massindependent disruption, the observations favour a truncated icmf. for low ormodest amounts of mass independent disruption, a truncation mass of 5-6*10^5msun is estimated, consistent with previous determinations. additionally, weinvestigate possible truncations in the icmf in the spiral galaxy m83, theinteracting antennae galaxies, and the collection of spiral and dwarf galaxiespresent in larsen (2009) based on photometric catalogues taken from theliterature, and find that all catalogues are consistent with having a(environmentally dependent) truncation in the cluster mass functions.

1208.0825	the vlt-flames tarantula survey. vii. a low velocity dispersion for the  young massive cluster r136	detailed studies of resolved young massive star clusters are necessary todetermine their dynamical state and evaluate the importance of gas expulsionand early cluster evolution. in an effort to gain insight into the dynamicalstate of the young massive cluster r136 and obtain the first measurement of itsvelocity dispersion, we analyse multi-epoch spectroscopic data of the innerregions of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) obtained as part ofthe vlt-flames tarantula survey. following a quantitative assessment of thevariability, we use the radial velocities of non-variable sources to place anupper limit of 6 km/s on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of stars withina projected distance of 5 pc from the centre of the cluster. after accountingfor the contributions of undetected binaries and measurement errors throughmonte carlo simulations, we conclude that the true velocity dispersion islikely between 4 and 5 km/s given a range of standard assumptions about thebinary distribution. this result is consistent with what is expected if thecluster is in virial equilibrium, suggesting that gas expulsion has not alteredits dynamics. we find that the velocity dispersion would be ~25 km/s ifbinaries were not identified and rejected, confirming the importance of themulti-epoch strategy and the risk of interpreting velocity dispersionmeasurements of unresolved extragalactic young massive clusters.

1209.2136	can habitable planets form in clustered environments?	we present observational evidence of environmental effects on the formationand evolution of planetary systems. we combine catalogues of resolvedprotoplanetary discs (ppds) and young stellar objects in the solarneighbourhood to analyse the ppd size distribution as a function of ambientstellar density. by running kolmogorov-smirnov tests between the ppd radii atdifferent densities, we find empirical evidence, at the &gt;97% confidence level,for a change in the ppd radius distribution at ambient stellar densities \sigma&gt; 10^{3.5} pc^{-2}. this coincides with a simple theoretical estimate for thetruncation of ppds or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. if thisagreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of ppds and planetary systemslimits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorterlifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. therefore,habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters,and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound,free-floating planets. we conclude that, while highly suggestive, our resultsshould be verified through other methods. our simple model shows thattruncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the ppd mass function thatcan be detected with alma observations of the densest nearby and youngclusters.

1302.6598	the snapshot hubble u-band cluster survey (shucs). i. survey description  and first application to the mixed star cluster population of ngc 4041	we present the snapshot hubble u-band cluster survey (shucs), a project aimedat characterizing the star cluster populations of ten nearby galaxies (d&lt;23mpc, half within 12 mpc) through new f336w (u band equivalent) imaging fromwfc3, and archival bvi-equivalent data with hst. completing the ubvi baselinereduces the age-extinction degeneracy of optical colours, thus enabling themeasurement of reliable ages and masses for the thousands of clusters coveredby our survey. the sample consists chiefly of face-on spiral galaxies at lowinclination, in various degrees of isolation (isolated, in group, merging), andincludes two agn hosts. this first paper outlines the survey itself, theobservational datasets, the analysis methods, and presents a proof-of-conceptstudy of the large-scale properties and star cluster population of ngc 4041, amassive sabc galaxy at a distance of 23 mpc, and part of a small grouping ofsix giant members. we resolve two structural components with distinct stellarpopulations, a morphology more akin to merging and interacting systems. we alsofind strong evidence of a truncated, schechter-type mass function, and asimilarly segmented luminosity function. these results indicate that binningmust erase much of the substructure present in the mass and luminosityfunctions, and might account for the conflicting reports on the intrinsic shapeof these functions in the literature. we also note a tidal feature in theoutskirts of the galaxy in galex uv imaging, and follow it up with acomprehensive multi-wavelength study of ngc 4041 and its parent group. wededuce a minor merger as a likely cause of its segmented structure and theobserved pattern of a radially decreasing star formation rate. we propose thatcombining the study of star cluster populations with broad-band metrics is notonly advantageous, but often easily achievable through archival datasets.

1304.2397	candidate super star cluster progenitor gas clouds possibly triggered by  close passage to sgr a*	super star clusters are the end product of star formation under the mostextreme conditions. as such, studying how their final stellar populations areassembled from their natal progenitor gas clouds can provide strong constraintson star formation theories. an obvious place to look for the initial conditionsof such extreme stellar clusters are gas clouds of comparable mass and density,with no star formation activity. we present a method to identify suchprogenitor gas clouds and demonstrate the technique for the gas in the innerfew hundred pc of our galaxy. the method highlights three clouds in the regionwith similar global physical properties to the previously identified extremecloud, g0.253+0.016, as potential young massive cluster (ymc) precursors. thefact that four potential ymc progenitor clouds have been identified in theinner 100 pc of the galaxy, but no clouds with similar properties have beenfound in the whole first quadrant despite extensive observational efforts, hasimplications for cluster formation/destruction rates across the galaxy. we putforward a scenario to explain how such dense gas clouds can arise in thegalactic centre environment, in which ymc formation is triggered by gas streamspassing close to the minimum of the global galactic gravitational potential atthe location of the central supermassive black hole, sgr a*. if this triggeringmechanism can be verified, we can use the known time interval since closestapproach to sgr a* to study the physics of stellar mass assembly in an extremeenvironment as a function of absolute time.

1304.3414	under pressure: star clusters and the neutral hydrogen medium of tidal  tails	using archival data from atca, wsrt, and the vla, we have analyzed the hiemission of 22 tidal tail regions of the mullan et al. sample of pairwiseinteracting galaxies. we have measured the column densities, line-of-sightvelocity dispersions, and kinetic energy densities on ~kpc scales. we alsoconstructed a tracer of the line-of-sight velocity gradient over ~10 kpcscales. we compared the distributions of these properties between regions thatdo and do not contain massive star cluster candidates (m_v &lt; -8.5; ~10^4--10^6m_(sun) as observed in hst wfpc2 vi data). in agreement with maybhate et al.,we find that a local, ~kpc-scale column density of log n_(hi) = 20.6 cm^(-2) isfrequently required for detecting clustered star formation. this hi gas alsotends to be turbulent, with line-of-sight velocity dispersions ~10--75 km/s,implying high kinetic energy densities (&gt;46 erg pc^(-2)). thus, high hidensities and pressures, partly determined by the tail dynamical age and otherinteraction characteristics, are connected to large-scale cluster formation intidal tails overall. lastly, we find that the high mechanical energy densitiesof the gas are likely not generally due to feedback from star formation.rather, these properties are more likely to be a cause of star formation than aresult.

0801.2271	new results on the ages of star clusters in region b of m82	the post-starburst region b in m82 and its massive star cluster componenthave been the focus of multiple studies, with reports that there is a largepopulation of coeval clusters of age ~1 gyr, which were created with a gaussianinitial mass distribution. this is in disagreement with other studies of youngstar clusters, which invariably find a featureless power-law mass distribution.here, we present gemini-north optical spectra of seven star clusters in m82-band show that their ages are all between 10 and 300 myr (a factor of 3-100younger than previous photometric results) and that their extinctions rangebetween near-zero and 4 mag (av). using new hst acs-hrc u-band observations weage date an additional ~30 clusters whose ages/extinctions agree well withthose determined from spectroscopy. completeness tests show that the reported`turn-over' in the luminosity/mass distributions is most likely an artefact,due to the resolved nature of the clusters. we also show that the radialvelocities of the clusters are inconsistent with them belonging to a boundregion.

1309.3566	early disc accretion as the origin of abundance anomalies in globular  clusters	globular clusters (gcs), once thought to be well approximated as simplestellar populations (i.e. all stars having the same age and chemicalabundance), are now known to host a variety of anomalies, such as multiplediscrete (or spreads in) populations in colour-magnitude diagrams and abundancevariations in light elements (e.g., na, o, al). multiple models have been putforward to explain the observed anomalies, although all have seriousshortcomings (e.g., requiring a non-standard initial mass function of stars andgcs to have been initially 10-100 times more massive than observed today).these models also do not agree with observations of massive stellar clustersforming today, which do not display significant age spreads nor have gas/dustwithin the cluster. here we present a model for the formation of gcs, where lowmass pre-main sequence (pms) stars accrete enriched material released frominteracting massive binary and rapidly rotating stars onto their circumstellardiscs, and ultimately onto the young stars. as was shown in previous studies,the accreted material matches the unusual abundances and patterns observed ingcs. the proposed model does not require multiple generations ofstar-formation, conforms to known properties of massive clusters forming today,and solves the "mass budget problem" without requiring gcs to have beensignificantly more massive at birth. potential caveats to the model as well asmodel predictions are discussed.

1309.5092	constraining globular cluster formation through studies of young massive  clusters: i. a lack of ongoing star formation within young clusters	we present a survey of 130 galactic and extragalactic young massive clusters(ymcs, $10^4 &lt; m/\msun &lt; 10^8$, $10 &lt; t/{\rm myr} &lt; 1000$) with integratedspectroscopy or resolved stellar photometry (40 presented here and 90 from theliterature) and use the sample to search for evidence of ongoing star-formationwithin the clusters. such episodes of secondary (or continuous) star-formationare predicted by models that attempt to explain the observed chemical andphotometric anomalies observed in globular clusters as being due to theformation of a second stellar population within an existing first population.additionally, studies that have claimed extended star-formation historieswithin lmc/smc intermediate age clusters (1-2 gyr), also imply that many youngmassive clusters should show ongoing star-formation. based on visual inspectionof the spectra and/or the colour-magnitude diagrams, we do not find evidencefor ongoing star-formation within any of the clusters, and use this to placeconstraints on the above models. models of continuous star-formation withinclusters, lasting for hundreds of myr, are ruled out at high significance(unless stellar imf variations are invoked). models for the (nearlyinstantaneous) formation of a secondary population within an existing firstgeneration are not favoured, but are not formally discounted due to the finitesampling of age/mass-space.

1312.0706	shocks and star formation in stephan's quintet. i. gemini spectroscopy  of h{\alpha}-bright knots	we present a gemini-gmos spectroscopic study of hst-selectedh{\alpha}-emitting regions in stephan's quintet (hcg 92), a nearby compactgalaxy group, with the aim of disentangling the processes of shock-inducedheating and star formation in its intra-group medium. the $\approx$40 sourcesare distributed across the system, but most densely concentrated in the$\sim$kpc-long shock region. their spectra neatly divide them into narrow- andand broad-line emitters, and we decompose the latter into three or moreemission peaks corresponding to spatial elements discernible in hst imaging.the emission line ratios of the two populations of h{\alpha}-emitters confirmtheir nature as h ii regions (90% of the sample) or molecular gas heated by ashock-front propagating at $\lesssim$300 km/s. their redshift distributionreveals interesting three-dimensional structure with respect to gas-phasebaryons, with no h ii regions associated with shocked gas, no shocked regionsin the intruder galaxy ngc 7318b, and a sharp boundary between shocks and starformation. we conclude that star formation is inhibited substantially, if notentirely, in the shock region. attributing those h ii regions projected againstthe shock to the intruder, we find a lopsided distribution of star formation inthis galaxy, reminiscent of pile-up regions in models of interacting galaxies.the h{\alpha} luminosities imply mass outputs, star formation rates, andefficiencies similar to nearby star-forming regions. two large knots are anexception to this, being comparable in stellar output to the prolific 30doradus region. we also examine stephan's quintet in the context of compactgalaxy group evolution, as a paradigm for intermittent star formation historiesin the presence of a rich, x-ray emitting intra-group medium.

1402.3595	the age distribution of clusters in m83	in order to empirically determine the timescale and environmental dependenceof stellar cluster disruption, we have undertaken an analysis of theunprecedented multi-pointing (seven), multi-wavelength (u, b, v, h$\alpha$, andi) hubble space telescope imaging survey of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxym83. the images are used to locate stellar clusters and stellar associationsthroughout the galaxy. estimation of cluster properties (age, mass, andextinction) was done through a comparison of their spectral energydistributions with simple stellar population models. we constructed the largestcatalog of stellar clusters and associations in this galaxy to-date, with ~1800sources with masses above ~5000 m$_{\odot}$ and ages younger than ~300 myr. inthe present letter, we focus on the age distribution of the resulting clustersand associations. in particular, we explicitly test whether the agedistributions are related with the ambient environment. our results are inexcellent agreement with previous studies of age distributions in the centre ofthe galaxy, which gives us confidence to expand out to search for similaritiesor differences in the other fields which sample different environments. we findthat the age distribution of the clusters inside m83 varies strongly as afunction of position within the galaxy, indicating a strong correlation withthe galactic environment. if the age distributions are approximated as apower-law of the form $dn/dt \propto t^{\zeta}$, we find $\zeta$ values between0 and -0.62 ( $\zeta$~-0.40 for the whole galaxy), in good agreement withprevious results and theoretical predictions.

1408.4163	the effect of spatial resolution on optical and near-ir studies of  stellar clusters: implications for the origin of the red excess	recent ground based near-ir studies of stellar clusters in nearby galaxieshave suggested that young clusters remain embedded for 7-10myr in theirprogenitor molecular cloud, in conflict with optical based studies which findthat clusters are exposed after 1-3myr. here, we investigate the role thatspatial resolution plays in this apparent conflict. we use a recent catalogueof young ($&lt;10$~myr) massive ($&gt;5000$~\msun) clusters in the nearby spiralgalaxy, m83, along with hubble space telescope (hst) imaging in the optical andnear-ir, and ground based near-ir imaging, to see how the colours (and henceestimated properties such as age and extinction) are affected by the aperturesize employed, in order to simulate studies of differing resolution. we findthat the near-ir is heavily affected by the resolution, and when aperture sizes$&gt;40$~pc are used, all young/blue clusters move red-ward in colour space, whichresults in their appearance as heavily extincted clusters. however, this is dueto contamination from nearby sources and nebular emission, and is not anextinction effect. optical colours are much less affected by resolution. due tothe larger affect of contamination in the near-ir, we find that, in some cases,clusters will appear to show near-ir excess when large ($&gt;20$~pc) apertures areused. our results explain why few young ($&lt;6$~myr), low extinction ($\av &lt;1$~mag) clusters have been found in recent ground based near-ir studies ofcluster populations, while many such clusters have been found in higherresolution hst based studies. additionally, resolution effects appear to (atleast partially) explain the origin of the near-ir excess that has been foundin a number of extragalactic ymcs.

1409.0935	turbulence sets the initial conditions for star formation in  high-pressure environments	despite the simplicity of theoretical models of supersonically turbulent,isothermal media, their predictions successfully match the observed gasstructure and star formation activity within low-pressure (p/k &lt; 10^5 k cm^-3)molecular clouds in the solar neighbourhood. however, it is unknown if thesetheories extend to clouds in high-pressure (p/k &gt; 10^7 k cm^-3) environments,like those in the galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular zone (cmz) and in theearly universe. here we present alma 3mm dust continuum emission within acloud, g0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of thecmz. while the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density pdf isstrikingly similar to those of solar neighbourhood clouds, there is oneimportant quantitative difference: its mean column density is 1--2 orders ofmagnitude higher. both the similarity and difference in the pdf compared tothose derived from solar neighbourhood clouds match predictions of turbulentcloud models given the high-pressure environment of the cmz. the pdf shows asmall deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youthof g0.253+0.016. its lack of star formation is consistent with thetheoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold forstar formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solarneighbourhood clouds. our results provide the first empirical evidence that thecurrent theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from thesolar neighbourhood also holds in high-pressure environments. we thereforesuggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation inthe early universe.

1507.07561	apparent age spreads in clusters and the role of stellar rotation	we use the geneva syclist isochrone models that include the effects ofstellar rotation to investigate the role that rotation has on the resultingcolour-magnitude diagram (cmd) of young and intermediate age clusters. we findthat if a distribution of rotation velocities exists within the clusters,rotating stars will remain on the main sequence (ms) for longer, appearing tobe younger than non-rotating stars within the same cluster. this results in anextended main sequence turn-off (emsto) that appears at young ages($\sim30$~myr) and lasts beyond 1~gyr. if this emsto is interpreted as an agespread, the resulting age spread is proportional to the age of the cluster,i.e. young clusters ($&lt;100$~myr) appear to have small age spreads (10s of myr)whereas older clusters ($\sim1$~gyr) appear to have much larger spreads, up toa few hundred myr. we compare the predicted spreads for a sample of rotationrates to observations of young and intermediate age clusters, and find a strongcorrelation between the measured 'age spread' and the age of the cluster, ingood agreement with models of stellar rotation. this suggests that the 'agespreads' reported in the literature may simply be the result of a distributionof stellar rotation velocities within clusters.

0705.2726	the effects of spatially distributed ionisation sources on the  temperature structure of hii region	spatially resolved studies of star forming regions show that the assumptionof spherical geometry is not realistic in most cases, with a major complicationposed by the gas being ionised by multiple non-centrally located stars or starclusters. we try to isolate the effects of multiple non-centrally located starson the temperature and ionisation structure of hii regions, via theconstruction of 3d photoionisation models using the 3d monte carlophotoionisation code mocassin. we find that the true temperature fluctuationsdue to the stellar distribution (as opposed to the large-scale temperaturegradients due to other gas properties) are small in all cases and not asignificant cause of error in metallicity studies. strong emission lines fromhii regions are often used to study the metallicity of star-forming regions. wecompare integrated emission line spectra from our models and quantify anysystematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, centrallocation for all ionising sources. we find that the dependence of themetallicity indicators on the ionisation parameter causes a clear bias, due tothe fact that models with a fully distributed configuration of stars alwaysdisplay lower ionisation parameters than their fully concentrated counterparts.the errors found imply that the geometrical distribution of ionisation sourcesmay partly account for the large scatter in metallicities derived usingmodel-calibrated empirical methods.

1510.08476	controversial age spreads from the main sequence turn-off and red clump  in intermediate-age clusters in the lmc	most star clusters at an intermediate age (1-2 gyr) in the large and smallmagellanic clouds show a puzzling feature in their color-magnitude diagrams(cmd) that is not in agreement with a simple stellar population. the mainsequence turn-off of these clusters is much broader than would be expected fromphotometric uncertainties. one interpretation of this feature is that agespreads of the order 200-500 myr exist within individual clusters, althoughthis interpretation is highly debated. such large age spreads should affectother parts of the cmd, which are sensitive to age, as well. in this study, weanalyze the cmds of a sample of 12 intermediate-age clusters in the largemagellanic cloud that all show an extended turn-off using archival optical datataken with the hubble space telescope. we fit the star formation history of theturn-off region and the red clump region independently with two differenttheoretical isochrone models. we find that in most of the cases, the agespreads inferred from the red clumps are smaller than the ones resulting fromthe turn-off region. however, the age ranges resulting from the red clumpregion are broader than would be expected for a single age. only two out of 12clusters in our sample show a red clump which seems to be consistent with asingle age. as our results are not unambiguous, we can not ultimately tell ifthe extended main sequence turn-off feature is due to an age spread, or not, byfitting the star formation histories to the red clump regions. however, we findthat the width of the extended main sequence turn-off feature is correlatedwith the age of the clusters in a way which would be unexplained in the "agespread" interpretation, but which may be expected if stellar rotation is thecause of the spread at the turn-off.

0806.1460	the early expansion of cluster cores	the observed properties of young star clusters, such as the core radius andluminosity profile, change rapidly during the early evolution of the clusters.here we present observations of 6 young clusters in m51 where we derive theirsizes using hst imaging and ages using deep gemini-north spectroscopy. we findevidence for a rapid expansion of the cluster cores during the first 20 myr oftheir evolution. we confirm this trend by including data from the literature ofboth galactic and extra-galactic embedded and young clusters, and possiblemechanisms (rapid gas removal, stellar evolutionary mass-loss, and internaldynamical heating) are discussed. we explore the implications of this result,focussing on the fact that clusters were more concentrated in the past,implying that their stellar densities were much higher and relaxation timescorrespondingly shorter. thus, when estimating if a particular cluster isdynamically relaxed, (i.e. when determining if a cluster's mass segregation isdue to primordial or dynamical processes), the current relaxation time is onlyan upper-limit, with the relaxation time likely being significantly shorter inthe past.

1512.00691	the iron dispersion of the globular cluster m 2, revised	m 2 has been claimed to posses three distinct stellar components that areenhanced in iron relative to each other. we use equivalent width measurementsfrom 14 red giant branch stars from which yong et al. detect a $\sim$0.8 dexwide, trimodal iron distribution to redetermine the metallicity of the cluster.in contrast to yong et al., which derive atmospheric parameters following onlythe classical spectroscopic approach, we perform the chemical analysis usingthree different methods to constrain effective temperatures and surfacegravities. when atmospheric parameters are derived spectroscopically, wemeasure a trimodal metallicity distribution, that well resembles that by yonget al. we find that the metallicity distribution from fe ii lines stronglydiffers from the distribution obtained from fe i features when photometricgravities are adopted. the fe i distribution mimics the metallicitydistribution obtained using spectroscopic parameters, while the fe ii shows thepresence of only two stellar groups with metallicity [fe/h]$\simeq$-1.5 and-1.1 dex, which are internally homogeneous in iron. this finding, when coupledwith the high-resolution photometric evidence, demonstrates that m 2 iscomposed by a dominant population ($\sim$99%) homogeneous in iron and aminority component ($\sim$1%) enriched in iron with respect to the main clusterpopulation.

0807.4687	on the star formation rate - brightest cluster relation: estimating the  peak sfr in post-merger galaxies	we further the recent discussion on the relation between the star-formationrate (sfr) of a galaxy and the luminosity of its brightest star-cluster (sfrvs. m$_{v}^{brightest}$). we first show that the observed trend between sfr vs.m$_{v}^{brightest}$ is due to the brightest cluster in a galaxy beingpreferentially young (&lt;15 myr - for a constant sfr) and hence a good tracer ofthe current sfr, although we give notable exceptions to this rule. using aseries of monte carlo simulations we show that a pure power-law mass functionwith index, alpha=2, is ruled out by the current data. instead we find that aschechter function (i.e. a power-law with an exponential truncation at the highmass end) provides an excellent fit to the data. additionally, thesesimulations show that bound cluster formation (in msun/yr) represents only~8+-3% of the total star-formation within a galaxy, independent of thestar-formation rate. from this we conclude that there is only a single mode ofcluster formation which operates over at least six orders of magnitude in thesfr. using this relation, we can extrapolate backwards in time in order toestimate the peak sfr of major merger galaxies, such as ngc7252, ngc1316 andngc3610. the derived sfrs for these galaxies are between a few hundred and afew thousand solar masses per year. the inferred far infrared luminosity of thegalaxies, from the extrapolated sfr, places them well within the range ofultra-luminous galaxies (ulirgs) and for ngc 7252 within the hyper-luminousinfrared galaxy regime. thus, we provide evidence that these post mergergalaxies passed through a ulirg/hlirg phase and are now evolving passively.using the current and extrapolated past sfr of ngc 34, we infer that the ulirgphase of this galaxy has lasted for at least 150 myr.

astro-ph;0302286	star cluster formation and evolution in nearby starburst galaxies: i.  systematic uncertainties	(abbreviated:) the large majority of extragalactic star cluster studies doneto date have essentially used two or three-passband aperture photometry,combined with theoretical stellar population synthesis models, to obtain age,mass and extinction estimates, and sometimes also metallicities. the accuracyto which this can be done depends on the choice of passband combination and,crucially, also on the wavelength range covered. understanding the systematicuncertainties is of the utmost importance for a well-balanced interpretation ofthe properties of extragalactic star cluster systems. we simultaneously obtainages, metallicities and extinction values for ~300 clusters in the nearbystarburst galaxy ngc 3310, based on archival hubble space telescopeobservations from the ultraviolet (uv) to the near-infrared (nir). we showthat, for ages 6 &lt;= log(age/yr) &lt;= 9, and if one can only obtain partialcoverage of the spectral energy distribution (sed), an optical passbandcombination of at least four filters including both blue and red passbandsresults in the most representative age distribution. we find that whileblue-selected passband combinations lead to age distributions that are slightlybiased towards younger ages due to the age-metallicity degeneracy,red-dominated passband combinations should be avoided. ngc 3310 underwent aglobal burst of cluster formation ~3x10^7 yr ago. this coincides closely withthe last tidal interaction or merger with a low-metallicity galaxy that likelyinduced the formation of the large fraction of clusters with (significantly)subsolar metallicities. the observed cluster system has a median mass of&lt;log(m/msun)&gt; = 5.25 +- 0.1, obtained from scaling the appropriate model sedsfor known masses to the observed cluster seds.

astro-ph;0305184	star cluster formation and evolution in nearby starburst galaxies: ii.  initial conditions	we use the ages, masses and metallicities of the rich young star clustersystems in the nearby starburst galaxies ngc 3310 and ngc 6745 to derive theircluster formation histories and subsequent evolution. we further expand ouranalysis of the systematic uncertainties involved in the use of broad-bandobservations to derive these parameters by examining the effects of a prioriassumptions on the individual cluster metallicities. the age (and metallicity)distributions of both the clusters in the circumnuclear ring in ngc 3310 and ofthose outside the ring are statistically indistinguishable, but there is aclear and significant excess of higher-mass clusters in the ring compared tothe non-ring cluster sample; it is likely that the physical conditions in thestarburst ring may be conducive for the formation of higher-mass star clusters,on average, than in the relatively more quiescent environment of the maingalactic disc. for the ngc 6745 cluster system we derive a median age of ~10myr. ngc 6745 contains a significant population of high-mass "super starclusters", with masses in the range 6.5 &lt;= log(m_cl/m_sun) &lt;= 8.0. thisdetection supports the scenario that such objects form preferentially in theextreme environments of interacting galaxies. the age of the clusterpopulations in both ngc 3310 and ngc 6745 is significantly lower than theirrespective characteristic cluster disruption time-scales. this allows us toobtain an independent estimate of the initial cluster mass function slope,alpha = 2.04(+- 0.23)(+0.13)(-0.43) for ngc 3310, and 1.96(+- 0.15)(+- 0.19)for ngc 6745, respectively, for masses m_cl &gt;= 10^5 m_sun and m_cl &gt;= 4 x 10^5m_sun. these mass function slopes are consistent with those of other young starcluster systems in interacting and starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0311232	the dynamical mass of the young cluster w3 in ngc 7252: heavy-weight  globular cluster or ultra compact dwarf galaxy ?	we have determined the dynamical mass of the most luminous stellar clusterknown to date, i.e. object w3 in the merger remnant galaxy ngc 7252. thedynamical mass is estimated from the velocity dispersion measured with thehigh-resolution spectrograph uves on vlt. our result is the astonishingly highvelocity dispersion of sigma=45 +- 5 km/s. combined with the large cluster sizer_eff=17.5 +-1.8 pc, this translates into a dynamical virial mass for w3 of 8+- 2 x 10^7 msun. this mass is in excellent agreement with the value 7.2 x 10^7msun we previously estimated from the cluster luminosity m_v=-16.2 by means ofstellar m/l ratios predicted by simple stellar population models (with asalpeter imf) and confirms the heavy-weight nature of this object. this resultspoints out that the ngc 7252-type of mergers are able to form stellar systemswith masses up to ~ 10^8 msun. we find that w3, when evolved to ~ 10 gyr, liesfar from the typical milky way globular clusters, but appears to be alsoseparated from omegacen in the milky way and g1 in m31, the most massive oldstellar clusters of the local group, because it is too extended for a givenmass, and from dwarf elliptical galaxies because it is much more compact forits mass. instead the aged w3 is amazingly close to the compact objects namedultracompact dwarf galaxies (ucdgs) found in the fornax cluster (hilker et al.1999; drinkwater et al. 2000), and to a miniature version of the compactelliptical m32. these objects start populating a previously deserted region ofthe fundamental plane.

astro-ph;0408043	the star cluster population of m51: ii. age distribution and relations  among the derived parameters	we use archival {\it hubble space telescope} observations of broad-bandimages from the ultraviolet (f255w-filter) through the near infrared (nicmosf160w-filter) to study the star cluster population of the interacting spiralgalaxy m51. we obtain age, mass, extinction, and effective radius estimates for1152 star clusters in a region of $\sim 7.3 \times 8.1$ kpc centered on thenucleus and extending into the outer spiral arms. in this paper we present thedata set and exploit it to determine the age distribution and relationshipsamong the fundamental parameters (i.e. age, mass, effective radius). using thisdataset we find: {\it i}) that the cluster formation rate seems to have had alarge increase $\sim$ 50-70 myr ago, which is coincident with the suggested{\it second passage} of its companion, ngc 5195, {\it ii}) a large number ofextremely young ($&lt;$ 10 myr) star clusters, which we interpret as a populationof unbound clusters of which a large majority will disrupt within the next$\sim$10 myr, and {\it iii)} that the distribution of cluster sizescan be wellapproximated by a power-law with exponent, $ -\eta = -2.2 \pm 0.2$, which isvery similar to that of galactic globular clusters, indicating that clusterdisruption is largely independent of cluster radius. in addition, we have usedthis dataset to search for correlations among the derived parameters. inparticular, we do not find any strong trends between the age and mass, mass andeffective radius, nor between the galactocentric distance and effective radius.there is, however, a strong correlation between the age of a cluster and itsextinction, with younger clusters being more heavily reddened than olderclusters.

astro-ph;0502289	systematic uncertainties in the analysis of star cluster parameters  based on broad-band imaging observations	(abridged) we assess the systematic uncertainties in (young) cluster age,mass, and - to a lesser extent - extinction and metallicity determinations,based on broad-band imaging observations with the hubble space telescope. ouraim here is to intercompare the results obtained using a variety of commonlyused modelling techniques, specifically with respect to our own extensivelytested multi-dimensional approach. any significant differences among theresulting parameters are due to the details of the various, independentlydeveloped modelling techniques used, rather than to the stellar populationmodels themselves. despite the model uncertainties and the selection effectsinherent to most methods used, we find that the peaks in the relative age andmass distributions of a given young (&lt;= 10^9 yr) cluster system can be derivedrelatively robustly and consistently, to accuracies of sigma_t = delta &lt;log(age/ yr)&gt; &lt;= 0.35 and sigma_m = delta &lt;log(m_cl / msun)&gt; &lt;= 0.14, respectively,assuming gaussian distributions in cluster ages and masses for reasons ofsimplicity. the peaks in the relative mass distributions can be obtained with ahigher degree of confidence than those in the relative age distributions, asexemplified by the smaller spread among the peak values of the massdistributions derived. this implies that mass determinations are mostlyinsensitive to the approach adopted. we reiterate that as extensive awavelength coverage as possible is required to obtain robust and internallyconsistent age and mass estimates for the individual objects, with reasonableuncertainties. finally, we conclude that the actual filter systems used for theobservations should be used for constructing model colours, instead of usingconversion equations, to achieve more accurate derivations of ages and masses.

astro-ph;0502561	the star cluster population in the tidal tails of ngc 6872	we present a photometric analysis of the rich star cluster population in thetidal tails of ngc 6872. we find star clusters with ages between 1 - 100 myrdistributed in the tidal tails, while the tails themselves have an age of lessthan 150 myr. most of the young massive ($10^{4} \le m/m_{\odot} \le 10^{7}$)clusters are found in the outer regions of the galactic disk or the tidaltails. the mass distribution of the cluster population can be well described bypower-law of the form $n(m) \propto m^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha = 1.85 \pm0.11$, in very good agreement with other young cluster populations found in avariety of different environments. we estimate the star formation rate forthree separate regions of the galaxy, and find that the eastern tail is formingstars at $\sim 2$ times the rate of the western tail and $\sim 5$ times therate of the main body of the galaxy. by comparing our observations withpublished n-body models of the fate of material in tidal tails in a galaxycluster potential, we see that many of these young clusters will be lost intothe intergalactic medium. we speculate that this mechanism may also be at workin larger galaxy clusters such as fornax, and suggest that the so-calledultra-compact dwarf galaxies could be the most massive star clusters that haveformed in the tidal tails of an ancient galactic merger.

astro-ph;0511033	dynamical mass estimates for two luminous star clusters in galactic  merger remnants	we present high-dispersion spectra of two extremely massive star clusters ingalactic merger remnants. one cluster, w30, is located in the ~500 myr oldmerger remnant ngc 7252 and has a velocity dispersion and effective radius ofsigma=27.5+-2.5 km/s and r_eff=9.3+-1.7 pc, respectively. the other cluster,g114, located in the ~3 gyr old merger remnant ngc 1316, is much more compact,r_eff=4.08+-0.55 pc, and has a velocity dispersion of sigma=42.1+-2.8 km/s.these measurements allow an estimate of the virial mass of the two clusters,yielding m_dyn(w30)=1.59(+-0.26) * 10^7 msun and m_dyn(g114)=1.64(+-0.13) *10^7msun. both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavierthan the most massive globular clusters in the galaxy. for both clusters wemeasure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population(ssp) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a kroupa-type stellarmass function. using measurements from the literature we find a strong agedependence on how well ssp models (with underlying kroupa or salpeter-typestellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. based on thisresult we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of theyoungest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar massfunction, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of youngclusters. finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, youngmassive clusters (ymcs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) and dwarf-globulartransition objects (dgtos) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) ucds and dgtosare consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) ymcs occupy amuch larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with theidea of preferential disruption of star clusters.

astro-ph;0604464	dynamical masses of young star clusters: constraints on the stellar imf  and star-formation efficiency	many recent works have attempted to constrain the stellar initial massfunction (imf) inside massive clusters by comparing their dynamical massestimates to the measured light. these studies have come to differentconclusions, with some claiming standard kroupa-type imfs, while others haveclaimed extreme non-standard imfs. however, the results appear to be correlatedwith the age of the clusters, as older clusters (&gt;80 myr) all appear to be wellfit by a kroupa-type imf whereas younger clusters display significant scatterin their best fitting imf. here we show that this is likely due to the factthat young clusters are out of virial equilibrium and therefore cannot be usedfor such studies. hence only the older clusters are suitable for imf studies.using only these clusters we find that the imf does not vary significantly. theyoungest clusters can be used instead to constrain the star-formationefficiency (sfe) within clusters. we find that the sfe varies between 20 and60% and we conclude that approximately 60% of young clusters are unbound andwill not survive for more than a few 10's of myr (i.e. "infant mortality").

astro-ph;0604578	the maximum mass of star clusters	when an universal untruncated star cluster initial mass function (cimf)described by a power-law distribution is assumed, the mass of the most massivestar cluster in a galaxy (m_max) is the result of the size-of-sample (sos)effect. this implies a dependence of m_max on the total number of star clusters(n). the sos effect also implies that m_max within a cluster populationincreases with equal logarithmic intervals of age. this is because the numberof clusters formed in logarithmic age intervals increases (assuming a constantcluster formation rate). this effect has been observed in the smc and lmc.based on the maximum pressure (p_int) inside molecular clouds, it has beensuggested that a physical maximum mass (m_max[phys]) should exist. the theorypredicts that m_max[phys] should be observable, i.e. lower than m_max thatfollows from statistical arguments, in big galaxies with a high star formationrate. we compare the sos relations in the smc and lmc with the ones in m51 andmodel the integrated cluster luminosity function (clf) for two cases: 1) m_maxis determined by the sos effect and 2) m_max=m_max[phys]=constant. the observedclf of m51 and the comparison of the sos relations with the smc and lmc bothsuggest that there exists a m_max[phys] of 5*10^5 m_sun in m51. the clf of m51looks very similar to the one observed in the ``antennae'' galaxies. a directcomparison with our model suggests that there m_max[phys]=2*10^6 m_sun.

0809.1943	the spatial evolution of stellar structures in the lmc/smc	we present an analysis of the spatial distribution of various stellarpopulations within the large and small magellanic clouds. we use opticallyselected stellar samples with mean ages between ~9 and ~1000 myr, and existingstellar cluster catalogues to investigate how stellar structures form andevolve within the lmc/smc. we use two statistical techniques to study theevolution of structure within these galaxies, the $q$-parameter and thetwo-point correlation function (tpcf). in both galaxies we find the stars areborn with a high degree of substructure (i.e. are highly fractal) and that thestellar distribution approaches that of the 'background' population ontimescales similar to the crossing times of the galaxy (~80/150 myr for thesmc/lmc respectively). by comparing our observations to simple models ofstructural evolution we find that 'popping star clusters' do not significantlyinfluence structural evolution in these galaxies. instead we argue that generalgalactic dynamics are the main drivers, and that substructure will be erased inapproximately the crossing time, regardless of spatial scale, from smallclusters to whole galaxies. this can explain why many young galactic clustershave high degrees of substructure, while others are smooth and centrallyconcentrated. we conclude with a general discussion on cluster 'infantmortality', in an attempt to clarify the time/spatial scales involved.

0706.0495	hierarchical star-formation in m33: fundamental properties of the  star-forming regions	star-formation within galaxies appears on multiple scales, from spiralstructure, to ob associations, to individual star clusters, and oftensub-structure within these clusters. this multitude of scales calls forobjective methods to find and classify star-forming regions, regardless ofspatial size. to this end, we present an analysis of star-forming groups in thelocal group spiral galaxy m33, based on a new implementation of the minimumspanning tree (mst) method. unlike previous studies which limited themselves toa single spatial scale, we study star-forming structures from the effectiveresolution limit (~20pc) to kpc scales. we find evidence for a continuum ofstar-forming group sizes, from pc to kpc scales. we do not find acharacteristic scale for ob associations, unlike that found in previousstudies, and we suggest that the appearance of such a scale was caused byspatial resolution and selection effects. the luminosity function of the groupsis found to be well represented by a power-law with an index, -2, similar tothat found for clusters and gmcs. additionally, the groups follow a similarmass-radius relation as gmcs. the size distribution of the groups is bestdescribed by a log-normal distribution and we show that within a hierarchicaldistribution, if a scale is selected to find structure, the resulting sizedistribution will have a log-normal distribution. we find an abrupt drop of thenumber of groups outside a galactic radius of ~4kpc, suggesting a change in thestructure of the star-forming ism, possibly reflected in the lack of gmcsbeyond this radius.

0706.0543	a detailed study of the enigmatic cluster m82f	we present a detailed study of the stellar cluster m82f, using multi-bandhigh resolution hst imaging and deep ground based optical slit and integralfield spectroscopy. using the imaging we create colour maps of the cluster andsurrounding region in order to search for substructure. we find a large amountof substructure, which we interpret as the result of differential extinctionacross the projected face of the cluster. with this interpretation, we are ableto construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which isused to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. fitting cluster profiles (kingand eff) to the intrinsic images we find that the cluster is 15-30% larger thanprevious estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in thiscluster exists. using the optical spectra, we find that the age of m82f is60-80 myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physicallyassociated with a large hii region that it is projected upon, both in agreementwith previous studies. the reconstructed integral field maps show that thatmajority of the line emission comes from a nearby hii region. the spatialdependence of the line widths (implying the presence of multiplecomponents)measured corresponds to the extinction map derived from photometry,indicating that the gas/dust clouds responsible for the extinction are alsopartially ionised. even with the wealth of observations presented here, we donot find a conclusive solution to the problem of the high light-to-mass ratiopreviously found for this cluster and its possible top-heavy stellar imf.
