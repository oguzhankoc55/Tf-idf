0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0901.4100	near-infrared follow-up to the may 2008 activation of sgr 1627-41	on 28 may 2008, the swift satellite detected the first reactivation of sgr1627-41 since its discovery in 1998.  following this event we began an observing campaign in near infraredwavelengths to search for a possible counterpart inside the error circle ofthis sgr, which is expected to show flaring activity simultaneous to the highenergy flares or at least some variability as compared to the quiescent state.  for the follow-up we used the 0.6m rem robotic telescope at la sillaobservatory, which allowed a fast response within 24 hours and, throughdirector discretionary time, the 8.2m very large telescope at paranalobservatory. there, we observed with naco to produce high angular resolutionimaging with the aid of adaptive optics.  these observations represent the fastest near infrared observations after anactivation of this sgr and the deepest and highest spatial resolutionobservations of the chandra error circle.  5 sources are detected in the immediate vicinity of the most precise x-raylocalisation of this source. for 4 of them we do not detect variability,although the x-ray counterpart experimented a significant decay during ourobservation period. the 5th source is only detected in one epoch, where we havethe best image quality, so no variability constrains can be imposed and remainsas the only plausible counterpart. we can impose a limit of ks &gt; 21.6magnitudes to any other counterpart candidate one week after the onset of theactivity. our adaptive optics imaging, with a resolution of 0.2" provides areference frame for subsequent studies of future periods of activity.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0911.3150	unveiling the origin of grb 090709a: lack of periodicity in a reddened  cosmological long-duration gamma-ray burst	we present broadband (gamma-ray, x-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)observations of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 090709a and its afterglow in aneffort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. previous analysessuggested that grb 090709a exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a periodof 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration grbs but typical of flares fromsoft gamma-ray repeaters. when properly accounting for the underlying shape ofthe power-density spectrum of grb 090709a, we find no conclusive (&gt; 3 sigma)evidence for the reported periodicity. in conjunction with the location of thetransient (far from the galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in thelocal universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the galacticvalue, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. a long-duration grb,however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of thissource. grb 090709a is distinguished from other long-duration grbs primarily bythe large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (a_k,obs &gt;~ 2 mag).

0707.4541	gaw - an imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope with large field of  view	gaw, acronym for gamma air watch, is a research and development experiment inthe tev range, whose main goal is to explore the feasibility of large field ofview imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes. gaw is an array of threerelatively small telescopes (2.13 m diameter) which differs from the existingand presently planned projects in two main features: the adoption of arefractive optics system as light collector and the use of single photoelectroncounting as detector working mode. the optics system allows to achieve a largefield of view (24x24 squared degrees) suitable for surveys of large skyregions. the single photoelectron counting mode in comparison with the chargeintegration mode improves the sensitivity by permitting also the reconstructionof events with a small number of collected cherenkov photons. gaw, which is acollaboration effort of research institutes in italy, portugal and spain, willbe erected in the calar alto observatory (sierra de los filabres - andalucia,spain), at 2150 m a.s.l.). the first telescope will be settled within autumn2007. this paper shows the main characteristics of the experiment and itsexpected performance.

1006.4469	searching for differences in swift's intermediate grbs	gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emissioninto short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect twodifferent types of progenitors. however, it has been shown on statisticalgrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classificationscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so farnot been done. the large amount of follow-up studies generated during the swiftera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this thirdpopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and theirafterglows. our study is focused on a sample of grbs observed by swift duringits first four years of operation. the sample contains those bursts withmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than longgrbs, especially when considering the x-ray light curves, which are on averageone order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. there is a less significanttrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer thanlong bursts. except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties tolong bursts. in particular, they follow the epeak vs. eiso correlation andhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that oflong bursts. like long grbs, they normally have an associated supernova,although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. this studyshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite ofsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences betweenthem as well. we suggest that the physical difference between intermediate andlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while forthe latter they are thick shells.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1111.0283	panchromatic observations of the textbook grb 110205a: constraining  physical mechanisms of prompt emission and afterglow	we present a comprehensive analysis of a bright, long duration (t90 ~ 257 s)grb 110205a at redshift z= 2.22. the optical prompt emission was detected byswift/uvot, rotse-iiib and bootes telescopes when the grb was still radiatingin the gamma-ray band. nearly 200 s of observations were obtainedsimultaneously from optical, x-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of theexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. by fitting thetime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, aninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard grbsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. although the promptoptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit x/gamma-rayspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation tothe prompt high energy emission. the synchrotron + ssc scenario is disfavoredby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having twoemission regions can interpret the data well. shortly after prompt emission (~1100 s), a bright (r = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.it is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component hasbeen closely observed. the full optical and x-ray afterglow lightcurves can beinterpreted within the standard reverse shock (rs) + forward shock (fs) model.in general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us toapply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information aboutthe grb including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission r, initiallorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as thecollimation angle and the total energy budget.

1202.0347	the shallow-decay phase in both optical and x-ray afterglows of swift  grb 090529a: energy injection into a wind-type medium?	the energy injection model is usually proposed to interpret the shallow-decayphase in swift grb x-ray afterglows. however, very few grbs have simultaneoussignatures of energy injection in their optical and x-ray afterglows. here, wereport optical observations of grb 090529a from 2000 sec to $\sim10^6$ secafter the burst, in which an achromatic decay is seen at both wavelengths. theoptical light curve shows a decay from 0.37 to 0.99 with a break at $\sim10^5$sec. in the same time interval, the decay indices of the x-ray light curvechanged from 0.04 to 1.2. comparing these values with the closure relations,the segment after 3$\times10^{4}$ sec is consistent with the prediction of theforward shock in an ism medium without any energy injection. the shallow-decayphase between 2000 to 3$\times10^{4}$ sec could be due to the external shock ina wind-type-like medium with an energy injection under the condition of $\nu_o&lt; \nu_c &lt; \nu_x$. however, the constraint of the spectral region is not wellconsistent with the multi-band observations. for this shallow-decay phase,other models are also possible, such as energy injection with evolvingmicrophysical parameters, or a jet viewed off-axis,etc.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1206.5532	the optical sn 2012bz associated with the long grb 120422a	the association of type ic sne with long-duration grbs is well established.we endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, tocharacterize these sne at increasingly high redshifts. we obtained a series ofoptical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ic sn2012bzassociated with the swift long-duration grb120422a (z=0.283) using the 3.6-mtng and the 8.2-m vlt telescopes. the peak times of the light curves ofsn2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the b-band and i'-band lightcurves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. thebolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometricmeasurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in thenear-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. therefore, the presentlight curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual uv-optical-irbolometric light curve. this pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (mbol= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape andluminosity to the bolometric light curves of the sne associated with z&lt;0.2 grbsand more luminous than those of sne associated with xrfs. a comparison with themodel generated for the bolometric light curve of sn2003dh suggests thatsn2012bz produced only about 15% less 56ni than sn2003dh, about 0.35 msol.similarly the vlt spectra of sn2012bz, after correction for galactic extinctionand for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosionparameters with those observed in sn2003dh (ek~3.5 x 10^52 erg, mej~7 msol) anda similar progenitor mass (~25-40 msol). grb120422a is consistent with theepeak-eiso and the ex,iso-egamma,iso-e_peak relations. grb120422a/sn2012bzshows the grb-sn connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitoredboth photometrically and spectroscopically.

1207.3003	comprehensive multi-wavelength modelling of the afterglow of grb050525a	the swift era has posed a challenge to the standard blast-wave model of gammaray burst (grb) afterglows. the key observational features expected within themodel are rarely observed, such as the achromatic steepening (`jet-break') ofthe light curves. the observed afterglow light curves showcase additionalcomplex features requiring modifications within the standard model. here wepresent optical/nir observations, millimeter upper limits and comprehensivebroadband modelling of the afterglow of the bright grb 0505025a, detected byswift. this afterglow cannot be explained by the simplistic form of thestandard blast-wave model. we attempt modelling the multi-wavelength lightcurves using (i) a forward-reverse shock model, (ii) a two-component outflowmodel and (iii) blast-wave model with a wind termination shock. theforward-reverse shock model cannot explain the evolution of the afterglow. thetwo component model is able to explain the average behaviour of the afterglowvery well but cannot reproduce the fluctuations in the early x-ray light curve.the wind termination shock model reproduces the early light curves well butdeviates from the global behaviour of the late-time afterglow.

1210.3699	searching for galactic sources in the swift grb catalog	since the early 1990s gamma ray bursts have been accepted to be ofextra-galactic origin due to the isotropic distribution observed by batse andthe redshifts observed via absorption line spectroscopy. nevertheless, uponfurther examination at least one case turned out to be of galactic origin. thisparticular event presented a fast rise, exponential decay (fred) structurewhich leads us to believe that other fred sources might also be galactic. thisstudy was set out to estimate the most probable degree of contamination bygalactic sources that certain samples of freds have. in order to quantify thedegree of anisotropy the average dipolar and quadripolar moments of each sampleof grbs with respect to the galactic plane were calculated. this was thencompared to the probability distribution of simulated samples comprised of acombination of isotropically generated sources and galactic sources. we observethat the dipolar and quadripolar moments of the selected subsamples of fredsare found more than two standard deviations outside those of randomisotropically generated samples.the most probable degree of contamination bygalactic sources for the fred grbs of the swift catalog detected until february2011 that do not have a known redshift is about 21 out of 77 sources which isroughly equal to 27%. furthermore we observe, that by removing from this samplethose bursts that may have any type of indirect redshift indicator and multiplepeaks gives the most probable contamination increases up to 34% (17 out of 49sources). it is probable that a high degree of contamination by galacticsources occurs among the single peak freds observed by swift.

1307.4401	the afterglow of grb 130427a from 1 to 10^16 ghz	we present multiwavelength observations of the afterglow of grb 130427a, thebrightest (in total fluence) gamma-ray burst of the past 29 years. opticalspectroscopy from gemini-north reveals the redshift of the grb to be z=0.340,indicating that its unprecedented brightness is primarily the result of itsrelatively close proximity to earth; the intrinsic luminosities of both the grband its afterglow are not extreme in comparison to other bright grbs. wepresent a large suite of multiwavelength observations spanning from 300 s to130 d after the burst and demonstrate that the afterglow shows relativelysimple, smooth evolution at all frequencies with no significant late-timeflaring or rebrightening activity. the entire dataset from 1 ghz to 10 gev canbe modeled as synchrotron emission from a combination of reverse and forwardshocks in good agreement with the standard afterglow model, providing strongsupport to the applicability of the underlying theory and clarifying the natureof the gev emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other verybright grbs. a tenuous, wind-stratified circumburst density profile is requiredby the observations, suggesting a massive-star progenitor with a low mass-lossrate, perhaps due to low metallicity. grbs similar in nature to grb 130427a,inhabiting low-density media and exhibiting strong reverse shocks, are probablynot uncommon but may have been difficult to recognize in the past due to theirrelatively faint late-time radio emission; more such events should be found inabundance by the new generation of sensitive radio and millimeter instruments.

1309.6465	the geminid meteoroid stream as a potential meteorite dropper: a case  study	a geminid fireball with an absolute magnitude of -13 was observed over thesouth of spain on dec. 15, 2009. this extraordinarily bright event (thebrightest geminid ever recorded by our team) was imaged from two meteorobserving stations operated by the spanish meteor network (spmn). the bolideexhibited fast and quasi-periodic variations in brightness, a behaviourtypically associated to the rotation of the parent meteoroid. the inferredtensile strength of this particle was found to be significantly higher that thetypical values obtained for geminid meteoroids. the fireball penetrated in theatmosphere till a final height of about 25 km above the ground level and anon-zero terminal mass was calculated at the ending point of the luminoustrajectory. in this way, the observational evidence points to the existence ofa population of meteoroids in the higher end of the geminid mass distributioncapable of producing meteorites. from the relative chemical abundances inferredfrom the emission spectrum of this bolide we conclude that the geminid-formingmaterials are similar to some primitive carbonaceous chondrite groups. then, weconclude that in meteorite collections from cold deserts, capable to preservemeteorites of few tens of grams, some rare groups of carbonaceous chondritescould be coming from the geminid parent body: (3200) phaeton.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1403.4079	grb 130925a: an ultra-long gamma ray burst with a dust-echo afterglow,  and implications for the origin of the ultra-long grbs	grb 130925a was an unusual grb, consisting of 3 distinct episodes ofhigh-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposedcategory of `ultra-long' bursts. it was also unusual in that its late-timex-ray emission observed by swift was very soft, and showed a stronghard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. this evolution, rarely seen in grbafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the promptemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow(i.e. external shock) emission. we consider and reject the possibility that grb130925a was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if thecircumburst density around grb 130925a is low, the long duration of the burstand faint external shock emission are naturally explained. indeed, we suggestthat the ultra-long grbs as a class can be explained as those with lowcircumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point thematerial ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburstmedium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal longgrbs. the increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shellscan interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both theincreased duration of grb 130925a, the duration of its prompt pulses, and thefainter-than-normal afterglow.

1404.0939	the dark nature of grb 130528a and its host galaxy	we study the dark nature of grb 130528a through multi-wavelength observationsand conclude that the main reason for the optical darkness is local extinctioninside of the host galaxy. automatic observations were performed atbootes-4/met robotic telescope. we also triggered target of opportunity (too)observation at the osn, iram pdbi and the gtc+osiris. the host galaxyphotometric observations in optical to near-infrared (nir) wavelengths wereachieved through large ground-based aperture telescopes, such as the 10.4m gtc,the 4.2m wht, 6m bta, and the 2m lt. based on these observations, spectralenergy distributions (sed) for the host galaxy and afterglow were constructed.thanks to mm observations at pdbi, we confirm the presence of a mm sourcewithin the xrt error circle that faded over the course of our observations andidentify the host galaxy. however, we do not find any credible optical sourcewithin early observations with bootes-4/met and 1.5m osn telescopes.spectroscopic observation of this galaxy by gtc showed a single faint emissionline that likely corresponds to [oii] 3727\{aa} at a redshift of 1.250+/-0.001implying a sfr(m_sun/yr) &gt; 6.18 m_sun/yr without correcting for dustextinction. the probable extinction was revealed through analysis of theafterglow sed, resulting in a value of av &gt;= ~ 0.9 at the rest frame, this iscomparable to extinction levels found among other dark grbs. the sed of thehost galaxy is explained well (chi2/d.o.f.=0.564) by a luminous (mb=-21.16),low-extinction (av =0, rest frame), and aged (2.6 gyr) stellar population. wecan explain this apparent contradiction in global and line-of-sight extinctionif the grb birth place happened to lie in a local dense environment. in lightof having relatively small specific sfr (ssfr) ~ 5.3 m_sun/yr (l/l_star)-1,this also could explain the age of the old stellar population of host galaxy.

0705.1705	on the nature of the short duration grb 050906	we present deep optical and infrared observations of the short duration grb050906. although no x-ray or optical/ir afterglow was discovered to deeplimits, the error circle of the grb (as derived from the swift bat) is unusualincontaining the relatively local starburst galaxy ic328. this makes grb 050906a candidate burst from a soft-gamma repeater, similar to the giant flare fromsgr 1806-20. the probability of chance alignment of a given bat position withsuch a galaxy is small (&lt;1%), although the size of the error circle (2.6arcminute radius) is such that a higher-z origin can't be ruled out. indeed,the error circle also includes a moderately rich galaxy cluster at z=0.43,which is a plausible location for the burst given the apparent preference thatshort grbs have for regions of high mass density. no residual optical orinfrared emission has been observed, either in the form of an afterglow orlater time emission from any associated supernova-like event. we discuss theconstraints these limits place on the progenitor of grb 050906 based on theexpected optical signatures from both sgrs and merging compact object systems.

0804.1727	multiwavelength analysis of the intriguing grb 061126: the reverse shock  scenario and magnetization	we present a detailed study of the prompt and afterglow emission from swiftgrb 061126 using bat, xrt, uvot data and multi-color optical imaging from tenground-based telescopes. grb 061126 was a long burst (t_90=191 s) with fouroverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. the x-ray afterglow, observedfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay withalpha_x=1.290 \pm 0.008. optical observations presented here cover the timerange from 258 s (faulkes telescope north) to 15 days (gemini north) after theburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallowtransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately13 min after the burst. we suggest the early, steep component is due to areverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times largerthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. the ejecta might beendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. the opticallight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, whilethere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the x-ray light curve. wemodel the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (thesteeper decay in x-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to x-ray)are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. thismight imply that the x-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shockemission. the possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would givesupport to the additional emission scenario.

1508.06567	exploring the canonical behaviour of long gamma-ray bursts using an  intrinsic multi-wavelength afterglow correlation	in this paper we further investigate the relationship, reported by oates etal., 2012, between the optical/uv afterglow luminosity (measured at restframe200s) and average afterglow decay rate (measured from restframe 200s onwards)of long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we extend the analysis by examiningthe x-ray light curves, finding a consistent correlation. we therefore explorehow the parameters of these correlations relate to the prompt emission phaseand, using a monte carlo simulation, explore whether these correlations areconsistent with predictions of the standard afterglow model. we findsignificant correlations between: $\rm log\;l_{o,200\rm{s}}$ and $\rmlog\;l_{x,200\rm{s}}$; $\alpha_{o,&gt;200\rm{s}}$ and $\alpha_{x,&gt;200\rm{s}}$,consistent with simulations. the model also predicts relationships between $\rmlog\;e_{iso}$ and $\rm log\;l_{200\rm{s}}$, however, while we find suchrelationships in the observed sample, the slope of the linear regression isshallower than that simulated and inconsistent at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$.simulations also do not agree with correlations observed between $\rmlog\;l_{200\rm{s}}$ and $\alpha_{&gt;200\rm{s}}$, or $\rm log\;e_{iso}$ and$\alpha_{&gt;200\rm{s}}$. overall, these observed correlations are consistent witha common underlying physical mechanism producing grbs and their afterglowsregardless of their detailed temporal behaviour. however, a basic afterglowmodel has difficulty explaining all the observed correlations. this leads us tobriefly discuss alternative more complex models.

1509.03099	limits on optical polarization during the prompt phase of grb 140430a	gamma-ray burst grb 140430a was detected by the swift satellite and observedpromptly with the imaging polarimeter ringo3 mounted on the liverpooltelescope, with observations beginning while the prompt $\gamma$-ray emissionwas still ongoing. in this paper, we present densely sampled (10-secondtemporal resolution) early optical light curves in 3 optical bands and limitsto the degree of optical polarization. we compare optical, x-ray and gamma-rayproperties and present an analysis of the optical emission during a period ofhigh-energy flaring. the complex optical light curve cannot be explained merelywith a combination of forward and reverse shock emission from a standardexternal shock, implying additional contribution of emission from internalshock dissipation. we estimate an upper limit for time averaged opticalpolarization during the prompt phase to be as low as p &lt; 12% (1$\sigma$). thissuggests that the optical flares and early afterglow emission in this grb arenot highly polarized. alternatively, time averaging could mask the presence ofotherwise polarized components of distinct origin at different polarizationposition angles.

1509.09234	the central engine of grb 130831a and the energy breakdown of a  relativistic explosion	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most luminous explosions in the universe, yetthe nature and physical properties of their energy sources are far fromunderstood. very important clues, however, can be inferred by studying theafterglows of these events. we present optical and x-ray observations of grb130831a obtained by swift, chandra, skynet, ratir, maidanak, ison, not, lt andgtc. this burst shows a steep drop in the x-ray light-curve at $\simeq 10^5$ safter the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\alpha \sim 6$. such a rarebehaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (fs) model andindicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of"internal origin", produced by a dissipation process within anultrarelativistic outflow. we propose that the source of such an outflow, whichmust produce the x-ray flux for $\simeq 1$ day in the cosmological rest frame,is a newly born magnetar or black hole. after the drop, the faint x-rayafterglow continues with a much shallower decay. the optical emission, on theother hand, shows no break across the x-ray steep decrease, and the late-timedecays of both the x-ray and optical are consistent. using both the x-ray andoptical data, we show that the emission after $\simeq 10^5$ s can be explainedwell by the fs model. we model our data to derive the kinetic energy of theejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a grb withemission of internal origin visible for a long time. furthermore, we break downthe energy budget of this grb into the prompt emission, the late internaldissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it withthe energy of the associated supernova, sn 2013fu.

astro-ph;0005609	the afterglow of the short/intermediate-duration gamma-ray burst grb  000301c: a jet at z=2.04	we present ulysses and near data from the detection of the short orintermediate duration (2 s) gamma-ray burst grb000301c (2000 march 1.41 ut).the gamma-ray burst (grb) was localised by the inter planetary network (ipn)and rxte to an area of 50 arcmin^2. a fading optical counterpart wassubsequently discovered with the nordic optical telescope (not) about 42h afterthe burst. the grb lies at the border between the long-soft and the short-hardclasses of grbs. if grb000301c belongs to the latter class, this would be thefirst detection of an afterglow to a short-hard burst. we present ubri and jhkphotometry from the time of the discovery until 11 days after the burst.finally, we present spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglowobtained with the eso vlt antu telescope 4 and 5 days after the burst. theoptical light curve is consistent with being achromatic from 2 to 11 days afterthe burst and exhibits a break. a broken power-law fit yields a shallowpre-break decay power-law slope of a_1=-0.72+-0.06, a break time oft_b=4.39+-0.26 days after the burst, and a post-break slope of a_2=-2.29+-0.17,which is best explained by a sideways expanding jet in an ambient medium ofconstant mean density. in the optical spectrum we find absorption features thatare consistent with feii, civ, cii, siii and ly-a at a redshift of2.0404+-0.0008. we find evidence for a curved shape of the spectral energydistribution of the observed afterglow. it is best fitted with a power-lawspectral distribution with index b ~ -0.7 reddened by an smc-like extinctionlaw with a_v~0.1 mag. based on the ly-a absorption line we estimate the hicolumn density to be log(n(hi))=21.2+-0.5. this is the first direct indicationof a connection between grb host galaxies and damped ly-a absorbers.

astro-ph;0006201	the bright gamma-ray burst 991208 - tight constraints on afterglow  models from observations of the early-time radio evolution	the millimeter wavelength emission from grb 991208 is the second brightestever detected, yielding a unique data set. we present here well-sampled spectraand light curves over more than two decades in frequency for a two-week period.this data set has allowed us for the first time to trace the evolution of thecharacteristic synchrotron self-absorption frequency nu_a and peak frequencynu_m, and the peak flux density f_m: we obtain nu_a \propto t^{-0.15 +- 0.12},nu_m \propto t^{-1.7 +- 0.4}, and $_m \propto t^{-0.47 +- 0.11}. from the radiodata we find that models of homogeneous or wind-generated ambient media with aspherically symmetric outflow can be ruled out. a model in which therelativistic outflow is collimated (a jet) can account for the observedevolution of the synchrotron parameters, the rapid decay at opticalwavelengths, and the observed radio to optical spectral flux distributions thatwe present here, provided that the jet transition has not been fully completedin the first two weeks after the event. these observations provide additionalevidence that rapidly decaying optical/x-ray afterglows are due to jets andthat such transitions either develop very slowly or perhaps never reach thepredicted asymptotic decay f(t) \propto t^{-p}.

astro-ph;0102158	the optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb000926	we present the discovery of the optical transient (ot) of the long-durationgamma-ray burst grb000926. the optical transient was detected independentlywith the nordic optical telescope and at calar alto 22.2 hours after the burst.at this time the magnitude of the transient was r = 19.36. the transient fadedwith a decay slope of about 1.7 during the first two days after which the slopeincreased abruptly (within a few hours) to about 2.4. the light-curve startedto flatten off after about a week indicating the presence of an underlyingextended object. this object was detected in a deep image obtained one monthafter the grb at r=23.87+-0.15 and consists of several compact knots withinabout 5 arcsec. one of the knots is spatially coincident with the position ofthe ot and hence most likely belongs to the host galaxy. higher resolutionimaging is needed to resolve whether all the compact knots belong to the hostgalaxy or to several independent objects. in a separate paper we present adiscussion of the optical spectrum of the ot, and its inferred redshift (molleret al. in prep.).

astro-ph;0102177	the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow of grb 991208 and its host  galaxy	observations of the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow (oa) of grb991208 started 2.1 d after the event. the flux decay constant of the oa in ther-band is -2.30 +/- 0.07 up to 5 d, which is very likely due to the jet effect,and after that it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 +/-0.2, the fastest one ever seen in a grb oa. a negative detection in severalall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previousadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the grb (as expected fromthe jet effect). the existence of a second break might indicate a steepening inthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. once the afterglowemission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying sn is found, but thelight curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echoexplanation. our determination of z = 0.706 indicates that grb 991208 is at 3.7gpc, implying an isotropic energy release of 1.15 x 10e53 erg which may berelaxed by beaming by a factor &gt; 100. precise astrometry indicates that the grbcoincides within 0.2" with the host galaxy, thus given support to a massivestar origin. the absolute magnitude is m_b = -18.2, well below the knee of thegalaxy luminosity function and we derive a star-forming rate of 11.5 +/- 7.1mo/yr. the quasi-simultaneous broad-band photometric spectral energydistribution of the afterglow is determined 3.5 day after the burst (dec 12.0)implying a cooling frequency below the optical band, i.e. supporting a jetmodel with p = -2.30 as the index of the power-law electron distribution.

astro-ph;0211108	optical observations of the bright long duration peculiar grb 021004  afterglow	the ccd magnitudes in johnson $b,v$ and cousins $r$ and $i$ photometricpassbands are determined for the bright long duration grb 021004 afterglow from2002 october 4 to 16 starting $\sim$ 3 hours after the $\gamma-$ray burst.light curves of the afterglow emission in $b$,$v$,$r$ and $i$ passbands areobtained by combining these measurements with other published data. theearliest optical emission appears to originate in a revese shock. flux decay ofthe afterglow shows a very uncommon variation relative to other well-observedgrbs. rapid light variations, especially during early times ($\delta t &lt; 2$days) is superposed on an underlying broken power law decay typical of a jettedafterglow. the flux decay constants at early and late times derived from leastsquare fits to the light curve are $0.99\pm0.05$ and $2.0\pm0.2$ respectively,with a jet break at around 7 day. comparison with a standard fireball modelindicates a total extinction of $e(b-v)=0.20$ mag in the direction of theburst. our low-resolution spectra corrected for this extinction provide aspectral slope $\beta = 0.6\pm0.02$. this value and the flux decay constantsagree well with the electron energy index $p\sim 2.27$ used in the model. thederived jet opening angle of about $7^{\circ}$ implies a total emittedgamma-ray energy $e_{\gamma} = 3.5\times10^{50}$ erg at a cosmological distanceof about 20 gpc. multiwavelength observations indicate association of this grbwith a star forming region, supporting the case for collapsar origin of longduration grbs.

astro-ph;0212334	a multi-colour study of the dark grb 000210 host galaxy and its  environment	we present ubvrizjshks broad band photometry of the host galaxy of the darkgamma-ray burst (grb) of february 10, 2000. these observations represent themost exhaustive photometry given to date of any grb host galaxy. a grid ofspectral templates have been fitted to the spectral energy distribution (sed)of the host. the derived photometric redshift is z=0.842^+0.054_-0.042, whichis in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic redshift (z=0.8463+/-0.0002)proposed by piro et al. (2002) based on a single emission line. furthermore, wehave determined the photometric redshift of all the galaxies in an area of6'x6' around the host galaxy, in order to check for their overdensity in theenvironment of the host. we find that the grb 000210 host galaxy is asubluminous galaxy (l ~ 0.5+/-0.2 l*), with no companions above our detectionthreshold of 0.18+/-0.06 l*. based on the restframe ultraviolet flux a starformation rate of 2.1+/-0.2 solar masses per year is estimated. the best fit tothe sed is obtained for a starburst template with an age of 0.181^+0.037_-0.026gyr and a very low extinction (av~0). we discuss the implications of theinferred low value of av and the age of the dominant stellar population for thenon detection of the grb 000210 optical afterglow.

astro-ph;0304481	optical afterglow of the not so dark grb 021211	we determine johnson $b,v$ and cousins $r,i$ photometric ccd magnitudes forthe afterglow of grb 021211 during the first night after the grb trigger. theafterglow was very faint and would have been probably missed if no promptobservation had been conducted. a fraction of the so-called ``dark'' grbs maythus be just ``optically dim'' and require very deep imaging to be detected.the early-time optical light curve reported by other observers shows promptemission with properties similar to that of grb 990123. following this, theafterglow emission from $\sim 11$ min to $\sim 33$ days after the burst ischaracterized by an overall power-law decay with a slope $1.1\pm0.02$ in the$r$ passband. we derive the value of spectral index in the optical to near-irregion to be 0.6$\pm$0.2 during 0.13 to 0.8 day after the burst. the flux decayconstant and the spectral slope indicate that optical observations within a dayafter the burst lies between cooling frequency and synchrotron maximumfrequency.

astro-ph;0305227	variable polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 021004	we present polarimetric observations of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 021004, obtained with the nordic optical telescope (not) and the verylarge telescope (vlt) between 8 and 17 hours after the burst. comparison amongthe observations shows a 45 degree change in the position angle from 9 hoursafter the burst to 16 hours after the burst, and comparison with published datafrom later epochs even shows a 90 degree change between 9 and 89 hours afterthe burst. the degree of linear polarization shows a marginal change, but isalso consistent with being constant in time. in the context of currentlyavailable models for changes in the polarization of grbs, a homogeneous jetwith an early break time of t_b ~ 1 day provides a good explanation of ourdata. the break time is a factor 2 to 6 earlier than has been found from theanalysis of the optical light curve. the change in the position angle of thepolarization rules out a structured jet model for the grb.

astro-ph;0307153	the blue host galaxy of the red grb 000418	we report on multi-band (ubvrizjsks) observations of the host galaxy of theapril 18, 2000 gamma-ray burst. the spectral energy distribution (sed) isanalysed by fitting empirical and synthetic spectral templates. we find that:(i) the best sed fit is obtained with a starburst template, (ii) thephotometric redshift is consistent with the spectroscopic redshift, (iii) thecolours of the host are inconsistent with an old stellar population, and (iv)the global extinction is constrained to be in the range av=0.12-0.61 mag. thederived global extinction agrees with the one reported for the afterglow(av=0.4-0.9 mag), suggesting a homogeneous distribution of the interstellarmedium (ism) in the host galaxy. these findings are supplemented bymorphological information from hubble space telescope (hst) imaging: thesurface brightness profile is smooth, symmetric and compact with no underlyingstructures (like dust lanes, spiral arms or disks). a natural scenario whichaccounts of all the above results is a nuclear starburst that harbours a youngpopulation of stars from which the grb originated.

astro-ph;0309748	grb 020813: polarization in the case of a smooth optical decay	we present the results of a vlt polarimetric monitoring campaign of the grb020813 optical afterglow carried out in three nights, from 0.88 to 4.20 daysafter the gamma-ray event. the mean values of the degree of linear polarization(p) and its position angle (theta) resulting from our campaign are&lt;p&gt;=1.18+/-0.10% and theta = 148.7+/-2.3 deg after correcting for galacticinterstellar polarization. our vlt data set is most naturally described by aconstant degree of linear polarization and position angle, nonetheless a slowtheta evolution cannot be entirely ruled out by our data. the vlt monitoringcampaign did not reveal either a significant theta rotation respect to the keckspectropolarimetric observations performed ~0.25 days after the grb (barth etal. 2003). however, &lt;p&gt; is a factor of two lower than the polarization degreemeasured from keck. additionally, the vlt polarization data allowed us toconstruct an accurate v-band light curve. the v-band photometric data revealeda smooth light curve with a break located between the last keck and our firstvlt polarimetric measurement, 0.33 &lt; t_(break, v) &lt; 0.88 days after the grb.the typical magnitude fluctuations of the vlt v-band lightcurve are 0.003 mag,0.010 mag and 0.016 mag for our three observing nights, respectively. wespeculate that the stability of theta might be related to the smoothness of thelight curve.

astro-ph;0312359	earliest spectroscopy of the grb030329 optical transient	we present the earliest bta (sao ras 6-m telescope) spectroscopicobservations of the grb030329 optical transient (ot), which almost coincide intime with the first "break" (t ~ 0.5 day after the grb) of the ot light curve.the bta/mpfs (multi pupil fiber spectrograph) spectra are clearly not smooth:the ot spectra showed a continuum with several broad spectral features at about4000, 4450, 5900aa. the ot spectrum showed some evolution starting from thefirst night after the burst, and the beginning of spectral changes are seen asearly as ~10-12 hours after the grb. the onset of the spectral changes for t &lt;1 day indicates that the contribution from type ic supernova (sn) into the otoptical flux can be detected earlier. so, summarizing our and otherspectroscopic data on the ot we confirm the evolution of the ot spectrum andcolor pointed also by other authors (hjorth et al. 2003; matheson et al.2003b). the early spectra of grb030329/sn2003dh properties can be consistentwith a shock moving into a stellar wind formed from the pre-sn. such a behavior(similar to one near the uv shock breakout in sne) can be explained by theexistence of a dense matter in the immediate surroundings of grb/sn progenitor.

astro-ph;0402240	on the afterglow of the x-ray flash of july 23 2003: photometric  evidence for an off-axis gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova?	we present optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of the x-rayflash (xrf) of july 23 2003. our observations in the r-band cover the temporalrange from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. we also present theresults of multicolor imaging extending to the k-band on three epochs. thelightcurve of the r-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar tothe lightcurve for long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a brokenpower-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (f_nu propto t^alpha).furthermore, the spectral energy distribution (sed) has a power-law (f_nupropto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. however, the decay slope at t&lt;1 dayis shallow, consistent with zero. this is in qualitative agreement with theprediction that xrfs are off-axis classical grbs. after the first week there isa strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. the sed afterthe peak becomes significantly redder. we discuss the possible interpretationsof this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likelyexplanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of thesed. finally, we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglowand in the bump phase. a firm upper limit of z=2.3 is placed on the redshift ofxrf030723 from the lack of ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum of theafterglow. the lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either ofthe two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination.

astro-ph;0403080	the host of grb 030323 at z=3.372: a very high column density dla system  with a low metallicity	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow of grb 030323. vltspectra of the afterglow show damped lya (dla) absorption and low- andhigh-ionization lines at a redshift z=3.3718+-0.0005. the inferred neutralhydrogen column density, log n(hi)=21.90+-0.07, is larger than any (grb- orqso-) dla hi column density inferred directly from lya in absorption. from theafterglow photometry, we derive a conservative upper limit to the host-galaxyextinction: a(v)&lt;0.5 mag. the iron abundance is [fe/h]=-1.47+-0.11, while themetallicity of the gas as measured from sulphur is [s/h]=-1.26+-0.20. we derivean upper limit on the h2 molecular fraction of 2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(hi))&lt;~10^-6. inthe lya trough, a lya emission line is detected, which corresponds to astar-formation rate (not corrected for dust extinction) of roughly 1 msun peryear. all these results are consistent with the host galaxy of grb 030323consisting of a low metallicity gas with a low dust content. we detectfine-structure lines of silicon, siii*, which have never been clearly detectedin qso-dlas; this suggests that these lines are produced in the vicinity of thegrb explosion site. under the assumption that these fine-structure levels arepopulated by particle collisions, we estimate the hi volume density to ben_hi=100-10000 cm^-3. hst/acs imaging 4 months after the burst shows anextended ab(f606w)=28.0+-0.3 mag object at a distance of 0.14" (1kpc) from theearly afterglow location, which presumably is the host galaxy of grb 030323.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0604093	physics of the grb 030328 afterglow and its environment	we report on the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric, monitoring ofthe optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (grb) 030328 detected by hete-2.photometry, collected at 7 different telescopes, shows that a smoothly brokenpowerlaw decay, with indices alpha_1 = 0.76 +/- 0.03, alpha_2 = 1.50 +/- 0.07and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 days after the grb, provides the best fit ofthe optical afterglow decline. this shape is interpreted as due to collimatedemission, for which we determine a jet opening angle theta_{jet} of about 3.2degrees. an achromatic bump starting around 0.2 d after the grb is possiblymarginally detected in the optical light curves. optical spectroscopy shows thepresence of two rest-frame ultraviolet metal absorption systems at z = 1.5216+/- 0.0006 and at z = 1.295 +/- 0.001, the former likely associated with thegrb host galaxy. analysis of the absorption lines at z = 1.5216 suggests thatthe host of this grb may be a damped lyman-alpha absorber. the optical v-bandafterglow appears polarized, with p= (2.4 +/- 0.6) % and theta = (170 +/- 7)degrees, suggesting an asymmetric blastwave expansion. an x-ray-to-opticalspectral flux distribution of the grb 030328 afterglow was obtained at 0.78days after the grb and fitted using a broken powerlaw, with an optical spectralslope beta_{opt} = 0.47 +/- 0.15, and an x-ray slope beta_{x} = 1.0 +/- 0.2.the discussion of these results in the context of the "fireball model" showsthat the preferred scenario for this afterglow is collimated structured jetwith fixed opening angle in a homogeneous medium.

astro-ph;0605516	grb 060121: implications of a short/intermediate duration gamma-ray  burst at high redshift	since the discovery of the first short-hard gamma-ray burst afterglows in2005, the handful of observed events have been found to be embedded in nearby(z &lt; 1), bright underlying galaxies. we present multiwavelength observations ofthe short-duration burst grb 060121, which is the first observed to clearlyoutshine its host galaxy (by a factor &gt;10^2). a photometric redshift for thisevent places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a lessprobable scenario of z = 1.7. in either case, grb 060121 could be thefarthermost short-duration grb detected to date and implies anisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays comparable to that seen inlong-duration bursts. we discuss the implications of the released energy on thenature of the progenitor. these results suggest that grb 060121 may belong to afamily of energetic short-duration events, lying at z &gt; 1 and whose opticalafterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short-durationgrbs observed in 2005. the possibility of grb 060121 being an intermediateduration burst is also discussed.

astro-ph;0607471	multi-wavelength afterglow observations of the high redshift grb 050730	grb 050730 is a long duration high-redshift burst (z=3.967) discovered byswift. the afterglow shows variability and is well monitored over a widewavelength range. we present comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis ofthe afterglow of grb 050730 including observations from the millimeter tox-rays. we use multi-wavelength afterglow data to understand the temporal andspectral decay properties with superimposed variability of this high redshiftburst. five telescopes were used to study the decaying afterglow of grb 050730in the b, v, r', r, i', i, j and k photometric pass bands. a spectral energydistribution was constructed at 2.9 hours post-burst in the k, j, i, r, v and bbands. x-ray data from the satellites swift and xmm-newton were used to studythe afterglow evolution at higher energies. the early afterglow showsvariability at early times and shows a steepening at ~0.1 days (8.6 ks) in theb, v, r', r, i', i, j and k passbands. the early afterglow light curve decayedwith alpha_1 = -0.60+/-0.07 and alpha_2 = -1.71+/-0.06 based on r and i banddata. a millimeter detection of the afterglow around 3 days after the burstshows an excess in comparison to predictions. the early x-ray light curveobserved by swift is complex and contains flares. at late times the x-ray lightcurve can be fit by a powerlaw alpha_x = -2.5+/-0.15 which is steeper than theoptical light curve. a spectral energy distribution (sed) was constructed at\~2.9 hours after the burst. an electron energy index, p, of ~ 2.3 wascalculated using the sed and the photon index from the x-ray afterglow spectraand indicates that the synchrotron cooling frequency nu_c is above observedfrequencies.

astro-ph;0609654	grb 051028: an intrinsically faint grb at high redshift?	we present multiwavelength observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 051028detected by hete-2 in order to derive its afterglow emission parameters and todetermine the reason for its optical faintness when compared to other events.observations were taken in the optical (2.0m himalayan chandra telescope, 1.34mtautenburg, 4.2m william herschel telescope) and in x-rays (swift/xrt) between2.7 hours and 10 days after the onset of the event. the data can be interpretedby collimated emission in a jet with a typical value of $p$ = 2.4 which ismoving in an homogeneous interstellar medium and with a cooling frequencynu_{c} still above the x-rays at 0.5 days after the burst onset. grb 051028 canbe classified as a ``gray'' or ``potentially dark'' grb. on the basis of thecombined optical and swift/xrt data, we conclude that the reason for theoptical dimness is not extra absorption in the host galaxy, but rather the grbtaking place at high-redshift.we also notice the very striking similarity withthe optical lightcurve of grb 050730, a burst with a spectroscopic redshift of3.967, although grb 051028 is about 3 mag fainter. we suggest that the bumpcould be explained by multiple energy injection episodes and that the burst isintrinsically faint when compared to the average afterglows detected since1997. the non-detection of the host galaxy down to r = 25.1 is also consistentwith the burst arising at high redshift, compatible with the published pseudo-zof 3.7 +/- 1.8.

astro-ph;9710322	evidence for diverse optical emission from gamma-ray burst sources	optical transients from gamma-ray burst sources, in addition to offering adistance determination, convey important information on the physics of theemission mechanism, and perhaps also about the underlying energy source. as thegamma-ray phenomenon is extremely diverse, with time scales spanning severalorders of magnitude, some diversity in optical counterpart signatures appearsplausible. we have studied the optical transient, which accompanied thegamma-ray burst of may 8, 1997 (grb 970508). observations conducted at the2.5-m nordic optical telescope (not) and the 2.2-m telescope at thegerman-spanish calar alto observatory (caha) cover the time interval starting 3hours 5 minutes to 96 days after the high energy event. this brackets all otherpublished observations, including radio. when analyzed in conjunction withoptical data from other observatories, evidence emerges for a composite lightcurve. the first interval, from 3 to 8 hours after the event was characterizedby a constant, or slowly declining brightness. at a later moment the brightnessstarted increasing rapidly, and reached a maximum approximately 40 hours afterthe grb. from that moment the grb brightness decayed approximately as apower-law of index -1.21. the last observation, after 96 days, m_r =24.28+-0.10, is brighter than the extrapolated power-law, and hints that aconstant component, m_r = 25.50+-0.40 is present. the ot is unresolved (fwhm0.83") at the faintest magnitude level. the brightness of the opticaltransient, its duration and the general shape of the light curve sets thissource apart from the single other optical transient known, that of thefebruary 28, 1997 event.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.
