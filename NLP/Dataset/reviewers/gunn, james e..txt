0904.0002	the propagation of uncertainties in stellar population synthesis  modeling ii: the challenge of comparing galaxy evolution models to  observations	models for the formation and evolution of galaxies readily predict physicalproperties such as the star formation rates, metal enrichment histories, and,increasingly, gas and dust content of synthetic galaxies. such predictions arefrequently compared to the spectral energy distributions of observed galaxiesvia the stellar population synthesis (sps) technique. substantial uncertaintiesin sps exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolutionmodels to observations has received little attention. in the present work webegin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties instellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (imf), and dust andinterstellar medium (ism) properties on the translation from models toobservations. we demonstrate that these uncertainties translate intosubstantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colorsof synthetic galaxies. aspects that carry significant uncertainties include thelogarithmic slope of the imf above 1 msun, dust attenuation law, molecularcloud disruption timescale, clumpiness of the ism, fraction of unobscuredstarlight, and treatment of advanced stages of stellar evolution including bluestragglers, the horizontal branch, and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giantbranch. the interpretation of the resulting uncertainties in the derived colorsis highly non-trivial because many of the uncertainties are likely systematic,and possibly correlated with the physical properties of galaxies. we thereforeurge caution when comparing models to observations.

0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al. (2008) supernova sample, we find \omega_{tot} = 1.011 +/- 0.009and w = -0.99 +/- 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equationof state w.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0910.4611	light curve templates and galactic distribution of rr lyrae stars from  sloan digital sky survey stripe 82	we present an improved analysis of halo substructure traced by rr lyrae starsin the sdss stripe 82 region. with the addition of sdss-ii data, a revisedselection method based on new ugriz light curve templates results in a sampleof 483 rr lyrae stars that is essentially free of contamination. the mainresult from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars atgalactocentric distances 5--100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. at least 20% ofhalo stars within 30 kpc from the galactic center can be statisticallyassociated with substructure. we present strong direct evidence, based on bothrr lyrae stars and main sequence stars, that the halo stellar number densityprofile significantly steepens beyond a galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, anda larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. by using anovel method that simultaneously combines data for rr lyrae and main sequencestars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main sequence starsderived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of thesagittarius dsph tidal stream (trailing arm) towards r.a.2h-3h and dec~0 deg tobe 0.3 dex higher ([fe/h]=-1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars.together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, themonoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an earlyforming, smooth inner halo, is metal poor compared to high surface brightnessmaterial that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. the meanmetallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectableclumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as hasbeen argued from other data sets.

0911.3151	the propagation of uncertainties in stellar population synthesis  modeling iii: model calibration, comparison, and evaluation	stellar population synthesis (sps) provides the link between the stellar anddust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. inthe present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible sps(fsps) model against a suite of data. several public sps models areintercompared, including the models of bruzual &amp; charlot (bc03), maraston (m05)and fsps. the relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated,with the following conclusions: 1) the fsps and bc03 models compare favorablywith mc data at all ages, whereas m05 colors are too red and the age-dependenceis incorrect; 2) all models yield similar optical and near-ir colors for oldmetal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated j-kand v-k colors of both mw and m31 star clusters; 4) all models predict ugrcolors too red, d4000 strengths too strong and hdelta strengths too weakcompared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that suchgalaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) fsps and, to a lesserextent, bc03 can reproduce the optical and near-ir colors of post-starburstgalaxies, while m05 cannot. reasons for these discrepancies are explored. thefailure at predicting the ugr colors, d4000, and hdelta strengths can beexplained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars,young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not byappealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres orcanonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). we emphasizethat due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of themetallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue tosuffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

1002.3701	photometric response functions of the sdss imager	the monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situmeasurements of the response function of the mosaicked ccd imager used in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). the system is outlined and the results of themeasurements, mostly during the first 6 years of the sdss, are described. wepresent the reference response functions for the five colour passbands derivedfrom these measurements, and discuss column to column variations and variationsin time, and also their effects on photometry. we also discuss the effectarising from various, slightly different response functions of the associateddetector systems that were used to give sdss photometry. we show that thecalibration procedures of sdss remove these variations reasonably well with theresulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to belarger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of thesurvey. the considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the responsefunction showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength sideduring the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error inphotometry. the aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumentalsensitivity in u-band, which is calibrated out. the expected colour variationis consistent with measured colour variation in the catalog of repeatedphotometry. the colour variation is delta (u-g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and atmost delta (u-g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colours. we verified in thefinal catalogue that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag aredetected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonaleffects except for the secular u-g colour variation for stars with extremecolours.

1003.2185	confirmation of general relativity on large scales from weak lensing and  galaxy velocities	although general relativity underlies modern cosmology, its applicability oncosmological length scales has yet to be stringently tested. such a test hasrecently been proposed, using a quantity, eg, that combines measures oflarge-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate.the combination is insensitive to 'galaxy bias' (the difference between theclustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust tothe uncertainty in this parameter. modified theories of gravity generallypredict values of eg different from the general relativistic predictionbecause, in these theories, the 'gravitational slip' (the difference betweenthe two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) isnon-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure and the strength ofthe gravitational lensing effect3. here we report that eg = 0.39 +/- 0.06 onlength scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the generalrelativistic prediction of eg $\approx$ 0.4. the measured value excludes amodel within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies bothnewtonian and einstein gravity. however, the relatively large uncertainty stillpermits models within f(r) theory, which is an extension of general relativity.a fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models.

1004.1167	the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalog v. seventh data release	we present the fifth edition of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) quasarcatalog, which is based upon the sdss seventh data release. the catalog, whichcontains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, represents the conclusionof the sdss-i and sdss-ii quasar survey. the catalog consists of the sdssobjects that have luminosities larger than m_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with h_0= 70 km/s/mpc omega_m = 0.3, and omega_lambda = 0.7) have at least one emissionline with fwhm larger than 1000 km/s or have interesting/complex absorptionfeatures, are fainter than i &gt; 15.0 and have highly reliable redshifts. thecatalog covers an area of 9380 deg^2. the quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars atredshifts greater than four, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than five.the catalog contains 9210 quasars with i &lt; 18; slightly over half of theentries have i&lt; 19. for each object the catalog presents positions accurate tobetter than 0.1" rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) ccd-based photometrywith typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology andselection method. the catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and x-rayemission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-areasurveys. the calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200ang. at a spectral resolution r = 2000 the spectra can be retrieved from thesdss public database using the information provided in the catalog. over 96% ofthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the sdss. we also include asupplemental list of an additional 207 quasars with sdss spectra whose archivephotometric information is incomplete.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1008.0510	characterisation of sloan digital sky survey stellar photometry	we study the photometric properties of stars in the data archive of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), the prime aim being to understand the photometriccalibration over the entire data set. it is confirmed that the photometriccalibration for point sources has been made overall tightly against the sdssstandard stars. we have also confirmed that photometric synthesis of the sdssspectrophotometric data gives broad band fluxes that agree with broad bandphotometry with errors no more than 0.04 mag and little tilt along the widerange of colours, verifying that the response functions of the sdss 2.5 mtelescope system are well characterised. we locate stars in the sdssphotometric system, so that stars can roughly be classified into spectralclasses from the colour information. we show how metallicity and surfacegravity affect colours, and that stars contained in the sdss general catalogue,plotted in colour space, show the distribution that matches well with what isanticipated from the variations of metallicity and surface gravity. thecolour-colour plots are perfectly consistent among the three samples, stars inthe sdss general catalogue, sdss standard stars and spectrophotometric stars ofgunn &amp; stryker, especially when some considerations are taken into account ofthe differences (primarily metallicity) of the samples. we show that the g-r -inverse temperature relation is tight and can be used as a good estimator ofthe effective temperature of stars over a fairly wide range of effectivetemperatures. we also confirm that the colours of g2v stars in the sdssphotometric system match well with the sun.

0709.0759	optical cluster-finding with an adaptive matched-filter technique:  algorithm and comparison with simulations	we present a modified adaptive matched filter algorithm designed to identifyclusters of galaxies in wide-field imaging surveys such as the sloan digitalsky survey. the cluster-finding technique is fully adaptive to imaging surveyswith spectroscopic coverage, multicolor photometric redshifts, no redshiftinformation at all, and any combination of these within one survey. it workswith high efficiency in multi-band imaging surveys where photometric redshiftscan be estimated with well-understood error distributions. tests of thealgorithm on realistic mock sdss catalogs suggest that the detected sample is~85% complete and over 90% pure for clusters with masses above 1.0*10^{14}h^{-1} m_solar and redshifts up to z=0.45. the errors of estimated clusterredshifts from maximum likelihood method are shown to be small (typically lessthat 0.01) over the whole redshift range with photometric redshift errorstypical of those found in the sloan survey. inside the spherical radiuscorresponding to a galaxy overdensity of delta=200, we find the derived clusterrichness lambda_{200} a roughly linear indicator of its virial mass m_{200},which well recovers the relation between total luminosity and cluster mass ofthe input simulation.

1110.4107	optical-to-virial velocity ratios of local disk galaxies from combined  kinematics and galaxy-galaxy lensing	in this paper, we measure the optical-to-virial velocity ratios vopt/v200c ofdisk galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) at a mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;= 0.07 and with stellar masses 10^9 m_sun &lt; m_* &lt; 10^11 m_sun. vopt/v200c, theratio of the circular velocity measured at the virial radius of the dark matterhalo (\sim150 kpc) to that at the optical radius of the disk (\sim10 kpc), is apowerful observational constraint on disk galaxy formation. it links galaxiesto their dark matter haloes dynamically and constrains the total mass profileof disk galaxies over an order of magnitude in length scale. for thismeasurement, we combine vopt derived from the tully-fisher relation (tfr) fromreyes et al. with v200c derived from halo masses measured with galaxy-galaxylensing. in anticipation of this combination, we use similarly-selected galaxysamples for both the lensing and tfr analysis. for three m_* bins withlensing-weighted mean stellar masses of 0.6, 2.7, and 6.5 x 10^10 m_sun, wefind halo-to-stellar mass ratios m_vir/m_* = 41, 23, and 26, with 1-sigmastatistical uncertainties of around 0.1 dex, and vopt/v200c = 1.27\pm0.08,1.39\pm0.06, 1.27\pm0.08 (1{\sigma}). our results suggest that the dark matterand baryonic contributions to the mass within the optical radius arecomparable, if the dark matter halo profile has not been significantly modifiedby baryons. the results obtained in this work will serve as inputs to andconstraints on disk galaxy formation models, which will be explored in futurework. finally, we note that this paper presents a new and improved galaxy shapecatalogue for weak lensing that covers the full sdss dr7 footprint.

1111.4985	milky way tomography iv: dissecting dust	we use sdss photometry of 73 million stars to simultaneously obtain best-fitmain-sequence stellar energy distribution (sed) and amount of dust extinctionalong the line of sight towards each star. using a subsample of 23 millionstars with 2mass photometry, whose addition enables more robust results, weshow that sdss photometry alone is sufficient to break degeneracies betweenintrinsic stellar color and dust amount when the shape of extinction curve isfixed. when using both sdss and 2mass photometry, the ratio of the total toselective absorption, $r_v$, can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.1for most stars in high-extinction regions. these fits enable detailed studiesof the dust properties and its spatial distribution, and of the stellar spatialdistribution at low galactic latitudes. our results are in good agreement withthe extinction normalization given by the schlegel et al. (1998, sfd) dust mapsat high northern galactic latitudes, but indicate that the sfd extinction mapappears to be consistently overestimated by about 20% in the southern sky, inagreement with schlafly et al. (2010). the constraints on the shape of the dustextinction curve across the sdss and 2mass bandpasses support the models byfitzpatrick (1999) and cardelli et al. (1989). for the latter, we find an$r_v=3.0\pm0.1$(random) $\pm0.1$(systematic) over most of the high-latitudesky. at low galactic latitudes (|b|&lt;5), we demonstrate that the sfd map cannotbe reliably used to correct for extinction as most stars are embedded in dust,rather than behind it. we introduce a method for efficient selection ofcandidate red giant stars in the disk, dubbed "dusty parallax relation", whichutilizes a correlation between distance and the extinction along the line ofsight. we make these best-fit parameters, as well as all the input sdss and2mass data, publicly available in a user-friendly format.

1408.2829	volume phase holographic gratings for the subaru prime focus  spectrograph: performance measurements of the prototype grating set	the prime focus spectrograph (pfs) is a major instrument under developmentfor the 8.2 m subaru telescope. four identical spectrograph modules are locatedin a room above one nasmyth focus. a 55~m fiber optic cable feeds light to thespectrographs from a robotic positioner at the prime focus, behind thewide-field corrector developed for hyper suprime-cam. the positioner contains2400 fibers and covers a 1.3~degree hexagonal field of view.  the spectrograph optical design consists of a schmidt collimator, twodichroic beamsplitters to split the light into three channels, and for eachchannel a volume phase holographic (vph) grating and a dual-corrector, modifiedschmidt reimaging camera. this design provides a 275~mm collimated beamdiameter, wide simultaneous wavelength coverage from 380~nm to 1.26~\textmu m,and good imaging performance at the fast f/1.05 focal ratio required from thecameras to avoid oversampling the fibers. the three channels are designated asthe blue, red, and near-infrared (nir), and cover the bandpasses 380--650~nm(blue), 630--970~nm (red), and 0.94--1.26~\textmu m (nir). a mosaic of twohamamatsu 2k$\times$4k, 15~\textmu m pixel ccds records the spectra in the blueand red channels, while the nir channel employs a 4k$\times$4k,substrate-removed hawaii-4rg array from teledyne, with 15~\textmu m pixels anda 1.7~\textmu m wavelength cutoff.  vph gratings were an obvious choice for pfs and a set of three prototype vphgratings (one each of the blue, red, and nir designs) was ordered and has beenrecently delivered. in this paper we present the design and specifications forthe pfs gratings, the plan and setups used for testing both the prototype andfinal gratings, and results from recent optical testing of the prototypegrating set.

1408.2848	slit device for foccos, pfs, subaru	the fiber optical cable and connector system, foccos, subsystem of the primefocus spectrograph, pfs, for subaru telescope, is responsible to feed fourspectrographs with a set of optical fibers cables. the light injection for eachspectrograph is assured by a convex curved slit with a linear array of 616optical fibers. in this paper we present a design of a slit that ensures theright direction of the fibers by using masks of micro holes. this kind of maskis made by a technique called electroforming, which is able to produce a nickelplate with holes in a linear sequence. the precision error is around 1micron inthe diameter and 1 micron in the positions of the holes. this nickel plate maybe produced with a thickness between 50 and 200 microns, so it may be veryflexible. this flexibility allows the mask to be bent into the shape necessaryfor a curved slit. the concept requires two masks, which we call front mask,and rear mask, separated by a gap that defines the thickness of the slit. thepitch and the diameter of the holes define the linear geometry of the slit; thecurvature of each mask defines the angular geometry of the slit. obviously,this assembly must be mounted inside a structure rigid and strong enough to besupported inside the spectrograph. this structure must have a cte optimized toavoid displacement of the fibers or increased frd of the fibers when the deviceis submitted to temperatures around 3 degrees celsius, the temperature ofoperation of the spectrograph. we have produced two models. both are mountedinside a very compact invar case, and both have their front surfaces covered bya dark composite, to reduce stray light. furthermore, we have conductedexperiments with two different internal structures to minimize effects causedby temperature gradients.

1408.3284	the near infrared camera for the subaru prime focus spectrograph	we present the detailed design of the near infrared camera for the sumire(subaru measurement of images and redshifts) prime focus spectrograph (pfs)being developed for the subaru telescope. the pfs spectrograph is designed tocollect spectra from 2394 objects simultaneously, covering wavelengths thatextend from 380 nm - 1.26 um. the spectrograph is comprised of four identicalspectrograph modules, with each module collecting roughly 600 spectra from arobotic fiber positioner at the telescope prime focus. each spectrograph modulewill have two visible channels covering wavelength ranges 380 nm - 640 nm and640 nm - 955 nm, and one near infrared (nir) channel with a wavelength range955 nm - 1.26 um. dispersed light in each channel is imaged by a 300 mm focallength, f/1.07, vacuum schmidt camera onto a 4k x 4k, 15 um pixel, detectorformat. for the nir channel a hgcdte substrate-removed teledyne 1.7 um cutoffdevice is used. in the visible channels, ccds from hamamatsu are used. thesecameras are large, having a clear aperture of 300 mm at the entrance window,and a mass of ~ 250 kg.  like the two visible channel cameras, the nir camera contains just fouroptical elements: a two-element refractive corrector, a mangin mirror, and afield flattening lens. this simple design produces very good imagingperformance considering the wide field and wavelength range, and it does so inlarge part due to the use of a mangin mirror (a lens with a reflecting rearsurface) for the schmidt primary. in the case of the nir camera, the rearreflecting surface is a dichroic, which reflects in-band wavelengths andtransmits wavelengths beyond 1.26 um. this, combined with a thermal rejectionfilter coating on the rear surface of the second corrector element, greatlyreduces the out-of-band thermal radiation that reaches the detector.

1408.3401	ccd readout electronics for the subaru prime focus spectrograph	we present details of the design for the ccd readout electronics for thesubaru telescope prime focus spectrograph (pfs). the spectrograph is comprisedof four identical spectrograph modules, each collecting roughly 600 spectra.the spectrograph modules provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over theentire band from 380 nm to 1260 nm through the use of three separate opticalchannels: blue, red, and near infrared (nir). a camera in each channel imagesthe multi-object spectra onto a 4k x 4k, 15 um pixel, detector format. the twovisible cameras use a pair of hamamatsu 2k x 4k ccds with readout provided bycustom electronics, while the nir camera uses a single teledyne hgcdte 4k x 4kdetector and asic sidecar to read the device.  the ccd readout system is a custom design comprised of three electricalsubsystems: the back end electronics (bee), the front end electronics (fee),and a pre-amplifier. the bee is an off-the-shelf pc104 computer, with anauxiliary xilinx fpga module. the computer serves as the main interface to thesubaru messaging hub and controls other peripheral devices associated with thecamera, while the fpga is used to generate the necessary clocks and transferimage data from the ccds. the fee board sets clock biases, substrate bias, andcds offsets. it also monitors bias voltages, offset voltages, power railvoltage, substrate voltage and ccd temperature. the board translates lvds clocksignals to biased clocks and returns digitized analog data via lvds. monitoringand control messages are sent from the bee to the fee using a standard serialinterface. the pre-amplifier board resides behind the detectors and acts as aninterface to the two hamamatsu ccds. the pre-amplifier passes clocks and biasesto the ccds, and analog ccd data is buffered and amplified prior to beingreturned to the fee.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1412.1482	overview of the sdss-iv manga survey: mapping nearby galaxies at apache  point observatory	we present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey calledmanga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory), one of three coreprograms in the fourth-generation sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iv) that beganon 2014 july 1. manga will investigate the internal kinematic structure andcomposition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearbygalaxies. we summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and surveydesign in the context of manga's key science goals and present prototypeobservations to demonstrate manga's scientific potential. manga employsdithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary indiameter from 12" (19 fibers) to 32" (127 fibers). two dual-channelspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 a atr~2000. with a typical integration time of 3 hr, manga reaches a target r-bandsignal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per a, per 2" fiber) at 23 ab mag per sq. arcsec,which is typical for the outskirts of manga galaxies. targets are selected withstellar mass greater than 1e9 msun using sdss-i redshifts and i-band luminosityto achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, anapproximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a widerange of environments. analysis of our prototype observations demonstratesmanga's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formationand quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, andmap the composition of stellar populations. manga's spatially resolved spectrawill enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies inthe coming 6 yr.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1507.00725	prime focus spectrograph for the subaru telescope: massively multiplexed  optical and near-infrared fiber spectrograph	the prime focus spectrograph (pfs) is an optical/near-infrared multifiberspectrograph with 2394 science fibers distributed across a 1.3-deg diameterfield of view at the subaru 8.2-m telescope. the wide wavelength coverage from0.38 {\mu}m to 1.26 {\mu}m, with a resolving power of 3000, simultaneouslystrengthens its ability to target three main survey programs: cosmology,galactic archaeology and galaxy/agn evolution. a medium resolution mode with aresolving power of 5000 for 0.71 {\mu}m to 0.89 {\mu}m will also be availableby simply exchanging dispersers. we highlight some of the technological aspectsof the design. to transform the telescope focal ratio, a broad-band coatedmicrolens is glued to each fiber tip. a higher transmission fiber is selectedfor the longest part of the cable system, optimizing overall throughput; afiber with low focal ratio degradation is selected for the fiber-positioner andfiber-slit components, minimizing the effects of fiber movements and fiberbending. fiber positioning will be performed by a positioner consisting of twostages of piezo-electric rotary motors. the positions of these motors aremeasured by taking an image of artificially back-illuminated fibers with themetrology camera located in the cassegrain container; the fibers are placed inthe proper location by iteratively measuring and then adjusting the positionsof the motors. target light reaches one of the four identical fast-schmidtspectrograph modules, each with three arms. the pfs project has passed severalproject-wide design reviews and is now in the construction phase.

1511.01496	sdss-iv/manga: spectrophotometric calibration technique	mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory (manga), one of threecore programs in the sloan digital sky survey-iv (sdss-iv), is anintegral-field spectroscopic (ifs) survey of roughly 10,000 nearby galaxies. itemploys dithered observations using 17 hexagonal bundles of 2 arcsec fibers toobtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3,600-10,300a. tomap the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate{\it spectral surface photometry}, which is to calibrate the specific intensityat every spatial location sampled by each individual aperture element of theintegral field unit. the calibration must correct only for the flux loss due toatmospheric throughput and the instrument response, but not for losses due tothe finite geometry of the fiber aperture. this requires the use of standardstar measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughputversus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopytechniques due to various practical limitations. therefore, we developed atechnique for spectral surface photometry using multiple small fiber-bundlestargeting standard stars simultaneously with galaxy observations. we discussthe principles of our approach and how they compare to previous efforts, and wedemonstrate the precision and accuracy achieved. manga's relative calibrationbetween the wavelengths of h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ has a root-mean-square (rms)of 1.7%, while that between [nii] $\lambda$6583a and [oii] $\lambda$3727a hasan rms of 4.7%. using extinction-corrected star formation rates and gas-phasemetallicities as an illustration, this level of precision guarantees that fluxcalibration errors will be sub-dominant when estimating these quantities. theabsolute calibration is better than 5% for more than 89% of manga's wavelengthrange.

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0110259	detecting clusters of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i : monte  carlo comparison of cluster detection algorithms	we present a comparison of three cluster finding algorithms from imaging datausing monte carlo simulations of clusters embedded in a 25 deg^2 region ofsloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data: the matched filter (mf; postmanet al. 1996), the adaptive matched filter (amf; kepner et al. 1999) and acolor-magnitude filtered voronoi tessellation technique (vtt). among the twomatched filters, we find that the mf is more efficient in detecting faintclusters, whereas the amf evaluates the redshifts and richnesses moreaccurately, therefore suggesting a hybrid method (hmf) that combines the two.the hmf outperforms the vtt when using a background that is uniform, but it ismore sensitive to the presence of a non-uniform galaxy background than is thevtt; this is due to the assumption of a uniform background in the hmf model. wethus find that for the detection thresholds we determine to be appropriate forthe sdss data, the performance of both algorithms are similar; we present theselection function for each method evaluated with these thresholds as afunction of redshift and richness. for simulated clusters generated with aschechter luminosity function (m_r^* = -21.5 and alpha = -1.1) both algorithmsare complete for abell richness &gt;= 1 clusters up to z ~ 0.4 for a samplemagnitude limited to r = 21. while the cluster parameter evaluation shows amild correlation with the local background density, the detection efficiency isnot significantly affected by the background fluctuations, unlike previousshallower surveys.

astro-ph;0110383	the alignment effect of brightest cluster galaxies in the sdss	one of the most vital observational clues for unraveling the origin ofbrightest cluster galaxies (bcg) is the observed alignment of the bcgs withtheir host cluster and its surroundings. we have examined the bcg-clusteralignment effect, using clusters of galaxies detected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we find that the bcgs are preferentially aligned with theprincipal axis of their hosts, to a much higher redshift (z &gt;~ 0.3) than probedby previous studies (z &lt;~ 0.1). the alignment effect strongly depends on themagnitude difference of the bcg and the second and third brightest clustermembers: we find a strong alignment effect for the dominant bcgs, while lessdominant bcgs do not show any departure from random alignment with respect tothe cluster. we therefore claim that the alignment process originates from thesame process that makes the bcg grow dominant, be it direct mergers in theearly stage of cluster formation, or a later process that resembles thegalactic cannibalism scenario. we do not find strong evidence for (or against)redshift evolution between 0&lt;z&lt;0.45, largely due to the insufficient samplesize (&lt; 200 clusters). however, we have developed a framework by which we canexamine many more clusters in an automated fashion for the upcoming sdsscluster catalogs, which will provide us with better statistics for systematicinvestigations of the alignment with redshift, richness and morphology of boththe cluster and the bcg.

astro-ph;0111058	higher order moments of the angular distribution of galaxies from early  sdss data	we present initial results for counts in cells statistics of the angulardistribution of galaxies in early data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we analyze a rectangular stripe $2.5^\circ$ wide, coveringapproximately 160 sq. degrees, containing over $10^6$ galaxies in the apparentmagnitude range $18 &lt; r^\prime &lt; 22$, with areas of bad seeing, contaminationfrom bright stars, ghosts, and high galactic extinction masked out. this surveyregion, which forms part of the sdss early data release, is the same as thatfor which two-point angular clustering statistics have recently been computed.the third and fourth moments of the cell counts, $s_3$ (skewness) and $s_4$(kurtosis), constitute the most accurate measurements to date of thesequantities (for $r^\prime &lt; 21$) over angular scales $0.015^\circ-0.3^\circ$.they display the approximate hierarchical scaling expected from non-linearstructure formation models and are in reasonable agreement with the predictionsof $\lambda$-dominated cold dark matter models with galaxy biasing thatsuppresses higher order correlations at small scales. the results are ingeneral consistent with previous measurements in the apm, edsgc, and deeprangesurveys. these results suggest that the sdss imaging data are free ofsystematics to a high degree and will therefore enable determination of theskewness and kurtosis to 1% and less then 10%, as predicted by colombi,szapudi, &amp; szalay (1998).

astro-ph;0202251	spectroscopic target selection in the sloan digital sky survey: the  quasar sample	we describe the algorithm for selecting quasar candidates for opticalspectroscopy in the sloan digital sky survey. quasar candidates are selectedvia their non-stellar colors in "ugriz" broad-band photometry, and by matchingunresolved sources to the first radio catalogs. the automated algorithm issensitive to quasars at all redshifts lower than z=5.8. extended sources arealso targeted as low-redshift quasar candidates in order to investigate theevolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) at the faint end of the luminosityfunction. nearly 95% of previously known quasars are recovered (based on 1540quasars in 446 square degrees). the overall completeness, estimated fromsimulated quasars, is expected to be over 90%, whereas the overall efficiency(quasars:quasar candidates) is better than 65%. the selection algorithm targetsultraviolet excess quasars to i^*=19.1 and higher-redshift (z&gt;3) quasars toi^*=20.2, yielding approximately 18 candidates per square degree. in additionto selecting ``normal'' quasars, the design of the algorithm makes it sensitiveto atypical agn such as broad absorption line quasars and heavily reddenedquasars.

astro-ph;0205243	estimating fixed frame galaxy magnitudes in the sdss	broad-band measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measuredifferent regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. certain astronomicalquestions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies,require transforming these magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. toprepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail insubsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (seds) to broad bandphotometric observations, in the context of the optical observations of thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). linear combinations of four spectral templatescan reproduce the five sdss magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of thephotometry. expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of thecoefficients multiplying the templates is planar, and in fact nearly linear.the resulting reconstructed seds can be used to recover fixed frame magnitudesover a range of redshifts. this process yields consistent results, in the sensethat within each sample the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies arenearly constant with redshift. we compare our results to simpler interpolationmethods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the sdss. the software that generatesthese results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide rangeof galaxy observations.

astro-ph;0212087	average spectra of massive galaxies in the sdss	we combine sloan digital sky survey spectra of 22,000 luminous, red,bulge-dominated galaxies to get high s/n average spectra in the rest-frameoptical and ultraviolet (2600a to 7000a). the average spectra of these massive,quiescent galaxies are early-type with weak emission lines and with absorptionlines indicating an apparent excess of alpha elements over solar abundanceratios. we make average spectra of subsamples selected by luminosity,environment and redshift. the average spectra are remarkable in theirsimilarity. what variations do exist in the average spectra as a function ofluminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family inspectrum space. we present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of thevariation. we measure the properties of the variation with a modified versionof the lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar populationsyntheses. the variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundancedifferences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the dataconsiderably exceeds the current state of the models.

astro-ph;0301019	a catalog of broad absorption line quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey early data release	we present a catalog of 224 broad absorption line quasars (balqsos) from thesloan digital sky survey's early data release quasar catalog, including arelatively complete and homogeneous subsample of 131 balqsos. since theidentification of balqsos is subject to considerable systematic uncertainties,we attempt to create a complete sample of sdss balqsos by combining the resultsof two automated selection algorithms and a by-eye classification scheme. oneof these automated algorithms finds broad absorption line troughs by comparisonwith a composite quasar spectrum. we present the details of this algorithm andcompare this method to that which uses a power-law fit to the continuum. thebalqsos in our sample are further classified as high-ionization balqsos(hibals), low-ionization balqsos (lobals), and balqsos with excited ironabsorption features (felobals); composite spectra of each type are presented.we further present a study of the properties of the balqsos in terms of thebalnicity distribution, which rises with decreasing balnicity. thisdistribution of balnicities suggests that the fraction of quasars withintrinsic outflows may be significantly underestimated.

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0501113	an empirical calibration of the completeness of the sdss quasar survey	spectra of nearly 20000 point-like objects to a galactic reddening correctedmagnitude of i=19.1 have been obtained to test the completeness of the sdssquasar survey. the spatially-unresolved objects were selected from all regionsof color space, sparsely sampled from within a 278 sq. deg. area of sky coveredby this study. only ten quasars were identified that were not targeted ascandidates by the sdss quasar survey (including both color and radio sourceselection). the inferred density of unresolved quasars on the sky that aremissed by the sdss algorithm is 0.44 per sq. deg, compared to 8.28 per sq. deg.for the selected quasar density, giving a completeness of 94.9(+2.6,-3.8) tothe limiting magnitude. omitting radio selection reduces the color-onlyselection completeness by about 1%. of the ten newly identified quasars, threehave detected broad absorption line systems, six are significantly redder thanother quasars at the same redshift, and four have redshifts between 2.7 and 3.0(the redshift range where the sdss colors of quasars intersect the stellarlocus). the fraction of quasars missed due to image defects and blends isapproximately 4%, but this number varies by a few percent with magnitude.quasars with extended images comprise about 6% of the sdss sample, and thecompleteness of the selection algorithm for extended quasars is approximately81%, based on the sdss galaxy survey. the combined end-to-end completeness forthe sdss quasar survey is approximately 89%. the total corrected density ofquasars on the sky to i=19.1 is estimated to be 10.2 per sq. deg.

astro-ph;0504510	detection of cosmic magnification with the sloan digital sky survey	we present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by thevariation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground largescale structure. to make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees ofphotometric observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containing\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. our measurement of the galaxy-quasarcross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence andchange in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number countsthat is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. weshow that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, galactic dustextinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are wellcontrolled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. by weighting thequasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation ofquasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at &gt;4 sigmain all five sdss filters. our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scalesranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions based on the wmap concordance cosmology. as with galaxy-galaxylensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide usefulconstraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.

astro-ph;0505334	the uv, optical, and ir properties of sdss sources detected by galex	we discuss the uv, optical, and ir properties of the sdss sources detected bygalex as part of its all-sky imaging survey early release observations.virtually all of the galex sources in the overlap region are detected by sdss.galex sources represent ~2.5% of all sdss sources within these fields and abouthalf are optically unresolved. most unresolved galex/sdss sources are brightblue turn-off thick disk stars and are typically detected only in the galexnear-uv band. the remaining unresolved sources include low-redshift quasars,white dwarfs, and white dwarf/m dwarf pairs, and these dominate the opticallyunresolved sources detected in both galex bands.  almost all the resolved sdss sources detected by galex are fainter than thesdss 'main' spectroscopic limit. these sources have colors consistent withthose of blue (spiral) galaxies (u-r&lt;2.2), and most are detected in both galexbands. measurements of their uv colors allow much more accurate and robustestimates of star-formation history than are possible using only sdss data.indeed, galaxies with the most recent (&lt;20 myr) star formation can be robustlyselected from the galex data by requiring that they be brighter in the far-uvthan in the near-uv band. however, older starburst galaxies have uv colorssimilar to agn, and thus cannot be selected unambiguously on the basis of galexfluxes alone.  with the aid of 2mass data, we construct and discuss median 10 banduv-optical-ir spectral energy distributions for turn-off stars, hot whitedwarfs, low-redshift quasars, and spiral and elliptical galaxies. we point outthe high degree of correlation between the uv color and the contribution of theuv flux to the uv-optical-ir flux of galaxies detected by galex.

astro-ph;0506022	the sdss view of the palomar-green bright quasar survey	we investigate the extent to which the palomar-green (pg) bright quasarsurvey (bqs) is complete and representative of the general quasar population bycomparing with imaging and spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey. acomparison of sdss and pg photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the needto apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the pg data. using the sdssphotometric catalog, we define the pg's parent sample of objects that are notmain-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parentsample using the pg photometric criteria and errors. this simulation shows thatthe effective u-b cut in the pg survey is u-b &lt; -0.71 (rather than the intendedu-b &lt; -0.44), implying a color-related incompleteness. as the colordistribution of bright quasars peaks near u-b=-0.7 and the 2-sigma error in u-bis comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the colorincompleteness of the bqs is approximately 50% and essentially random withrespect to u-b color for z&lt;0.5. there is, however, a bias against brightquasars at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation ofquasars (although quasars at z&gt;0.5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in anycase). we find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness whencomparing the distributions in color, redshift, and first radio properties ofthe bqs and a bqs-like subsample of the sdss quasar sample. however, theapplication of a bright magnitude limit biases the bqs toward the inclusion ofobjects which are blue in g-i, in particular compared to the full range of g-icolors found among the i-band limited sdss quasars, and even at i-bandmagnitudes comparable to those of the bqs objects.

astro-ph;0512082	constraining the evolution of the ionizing background and the epoch of  reionization with z ~ 6 quasars ii: a sample of 19 quasars	we study the evolution of the ionization state of the igm at the end of thereionization epoch using spectra of a sample of nineteen quasars at 5.74&lt;z&lt;6.42discovered in the sdss. three methods are used to trace igm properties: (a) theevolution of the gunn-peterson optical depth in the ly alpha,beta, and gamma;(b) the distribution of dark absorption gaps, and (c) the size of hii regionsaround quasars. we find that the evolution of the igm accelerated at z&gt;5.7: theoptical depth evolution changes from tau ~ (1+z)^{4.3} to (1+z)^{&gt;11}, and theaverage length of dark gaps with tau&gt;3.5 increases from &lt;10 to &gt;80 comovingmpc. the dispersion of igm properties along different lines of sight alsoincreases rapidly, implying fluctuations by a factor of &gt;4 in the uv backgroundat z&gt;6, when the mean free path of uv photons is comparable to the correlationlength of galaxies. the mean length of dark gaps shows the most dramaticincrease at z~6, as well as the largest varianace. we suggest using dark gapstatistics as a powerful probe of the ionization state of the igm at yet higherredshift. the sizes of hii regions around quasars decrease rapidly towardshigher redshift, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the igm has increasedby a factor of &gt;10 from z=5.7 to 6.4. the mass-averaged neutral fraction is1-4% at z~6.2 based on the gp optical depth and hii region sizes. theobservations suggest that z~6 is the the end of the overlapping stage ofreionization, and are inconsistent with a neutral igm at z~6, as indicated bythe finite length of dark absorption gaps.

astro-ph;9708241	a study of quasar clustering at z&gt;2.7 from the palomar transit grism  survey	the quest for structure indicators at earlier and earlier times in theevolution of the universe has led to the search for objects with ever higherredshifts. the palomar transit grism survey has produced a large sample of highredshift quasars ($z&gt;2.7$), allowing statistical analysis of correlationbetween quasar positions. in this study, clustering is identified throughcomparison with $100 000$ monte carlo generated, randomly populated volumes,which are identical to the observed region in spatial coordinates, redshiftdistribution, and number of quasars. three pairs have been observed withcomoving separations of 11.34, 12.97, and 24.13 h_{50}^{-1}mpc (assuming$q_0=0.5$), smaller separations than would be expected to arise by chance in anunclustered distribution. selection effects are ruled out as a false source ofclustering by scrambling the observed quasar coordinates and redshifts, whichgives a pair separation distribution nearly identical to that of the montecarlo distribution. tests using the distribution of pair separations andnearest neighbor distances show that the observed pairs have a probability lessthan 0.1% of arising in an unclustered distribution. using a maximum likelihoodtechnique to estimate the correlation length $r_0$, assuming $\xi(r) =(r/r_0)^{-1.8}$, we find $r_0 = 35\pm15 h_{50}^{-1}mpc$ (comoving, $q_0=0.5$,1$\sigma$ errors), a value much larger than the correlation length ofpresent-day galaxies.

0809.4261	the propagation of uncertainties in stellar population synthesis  modeling i: the relevance of uncertain aspects of stellar evolution and the  imf to the derived physical properties of galaxies	the stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories ofgalaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (sps)techniques. sps relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequenceto stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, andstellar initial mass functions (imfs). the present work is the first in aseries that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellarevolution and the imf on the derived physical properties of galaxies and theexpected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. amonte-carlo markov-chain approach is taken to fit near-uv through near-irphotometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies withthis new sps model. significant results include the following: 1) includinguncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z~0 carry errors of ~0.3dex at 95% cl with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z~2, themasses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level; 2) eithercurrent stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, orboth, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of thethermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates onthe uncertainty of the slope of the imf in the solar neighborhood imply thatluminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level inthe k-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting theevolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) the more plausible assumptionof a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as isusually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colorsblueward of the v-band.
