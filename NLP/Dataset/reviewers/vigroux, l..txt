1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1071	herschel and scuba-2 imaging and spectroscopy of a bright, lensed  submillimetre galaxy at z = 2.3	we present a detailed analysis of the far-ir properties of the bright,lensed, z = 2.3, smg, smm j2135-0102, using new observations with herschel,scuba-2 and the vla. these data allow us to constrain the galaxy's sed and showthat it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000um luminosity, l(bol), of (2.3 +/-0.2) x 10^12 l(sun) and a likely sfr of ~400 m(sun)/yr. the galaxy sits on thefar-ir/radio correlation for far-ir-selected galaxies. at ~&gt;70um, the sed canbe described adequately by dust components with t(d) ~ 30 and 60k. usingspire's fourier transform spectrometer we report a detection of the [cii] 158umcooling line. if the [cii], co and far-ir continuum arise in photo-dissociationregions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and a far-uvradiation field, g_0, 10^3x stronger than the milky way. l([cii])/l(bol) issignificantly higher than in local ulirgs but similar to the values found inlocal star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. this is consistent with smmj2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc,evidence that smgs are not simply scaled-up ulirgs. our results show thatspire's fts has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscuredgalaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not becompetitive with ground-based co-line searches. it will, however, allowdetailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as wellas the chemistry of their ism, once more suitably bright candidates have beenfound.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.1658	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: source extraction and  cross-identifications in confusion-dominated spire images	we present the cross-identification and source photometry techniques used toprocess herschel spire imaging taken as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). cross-identifications are performed in map-spaceso as to minimise source blending effects. we make use of a combination oflinear inversion and model selection techniques to produce reliablecross-identification catalogues based on spitzer mips 24 micron sourcepositions. testing on simulations and real herschel observations show that thisapproach gives robust results for even the faintest sources s250~10 mjy. weapply our new technique to hermes spire observations taken as part of thescience demostration phase of herschel. for our real spire observations we showthat, for bright unconfused sources, our flux density estimates are in goodagreement with those produced via more traditional point source detectionmethods (sussextractor; savage &amp; oliver et al. 2006) by smith et al. 2010. whencompared to the measured number density of sources in the spire bands, we showthat our method allows the recovery of a larger fraction of faint sources thanthese traditional methods. however this completeness is heavily dependant onthe relative depth of the existing 24 micron catalogues and spire imaging.using our deepest multi-wavelength dataset in goods-n, we estimate that the useof shallow 24 micron in our other fields introduces an incompleteness at faintlevels of between 20-40 per cent at 250 micron.

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

astro-ph;0005376	mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish agns from starbursts	we present new mid-infrared (mir) diagnostics to distinguish emission ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) from that originating in starburst regions. ourmethod uses empirical spectroscopic criteria based on the fact that miremission from star forming or active galaxies arises mostly from hii regions,photo-dissociation regions (pdrs) and agns. the analysis of the strength of the6.2micron unidentified infrared band (uib) and the mir continuum shows thatuibs are very faint or absent in regions harboring the intense and hardradiation fields of agns and pure hii regions, where the uib carriers could bedestroyed. the mir signature of agns is the presence of an important continuumin the 3-10micron band which originates from very hot dust heated by theintense agn radiation field. using these two distinct spectral properties foundin our mir templates, we build diagnostic diagrams which provide quantitativeestimates of the agn, pdr and hii region contribution in a given mir spectrum.this new mir classification can be used to reveal the presence of agns highlyobscured by large columns of dust.

astro-ph;0101038	mid-infrared observations of ngc 1068 with isocam	we report on mid-infrared (mir) observations of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068, obtained with isocam in low-resolution spectro-imaging mode. the spatialresolution (around 5 arcsec) allows us to disentangle the circumnuclearstarburst regions from the emission of the active galactic nucleus (agn). theglobal spatial distribution of the unidentified infrared bands (uibs) issimilar to the cold dust component, traced by the 450 microns emission and thegaseous component obtained from the co(1-0) map. however, a shift between themaximum of the uib and 450 microns emission is clearly seen in our maps. theuibs in the mir (5-16 microns) originate almost exclusively from the starburstregions in the galactic disk with an emission peaking at the extremity of thestellar/ gaseous bar at a distance of 1 kpc from the agn. the spectrum of thenucleus is characterized over the whole 5-16 microns range by a strongcontinuum which can be fitted with a power law of index -1.7. moreover, thehigh [neiii]/[neii] ratio (&gt;2.5) in the nuclear region argues for a hardradiation field from the agn. observations indicate that the agn in ngc 1068contributes less than 5% to the total integrated uib emission even though itshot dust continuum contributes as much as 75% to the total mir flux. on thecontrary, the nuclear contribution to the cold dust emission decreasesconsiderably at submillimeter wavelengths and does not represent more than 25%of the total integrated emission at 450 microns.

astro-ph;0104087	the impact of bars on the mid-infrared dust emission of spiral galaxies:  global and circumnuclear properties	we study the mid-infrared properties of a sample of 69 nearby spiralgalaxies, selected to avoid seyfert activity contributing a significantfraction of the central energetics, or strong tidal interaction, and to havenormal infrared luminosities. these observations were obtained with isocam,which provides an angular resolution of the order of 10 arcsec (half-powerdiameter of the point spread function) and low-resolution spectro-imaginginformation. between 5 and 18 microns, we mainly observe two dust phases,aromatic infrared bands and very small grains, both out of thermal equilibrium.on this sample, we show that the global f15/f7 colors of galaxies are veryuniform, the only increase being found in early-type strongly barred galaxies,consistent with previous iras studies. the f15/f7 excesses are unambiguouslydue to galactic central regions where bar-induced starbursts occur. however,the existence of strongly barred early-type galaxies with normal circumnuclearcolors indicates that the relationship between a distortion of thegravitational potential and a central starburst is not straightforward. as thephysical processes at work in central regions are in principle identical inbarred and unbarred galaxies, and since this is where the mid-infrared activityis mainly located, we investigate the mid-infrared circumnuclear properties ofall the galaxies in our sample. we show how surface brightnesses and colors arerelated to both the available molecular gas content and the mean age of stellarpopulations contributing to dust heating. therefore, the star formation historyin galactic central regions can be constrained by their position in acolor-surface brightness mid-infrared diagram.

astro-ph;0104088	the relationship between star formation rates and mid-infrared emission  in galactic disks	the halpha and mid-infrared mean disk surface brightnesses are compared in asample of nearby spirals observed by isocam. this shows that, in spiral disks,dust emission at 7 and 15 microns provides a reasonable star formation tracer.the fact that the 15 to 7 micron flux ratio is nearly constant in variousglobal exciting conditions indicates a common origin, namely the aromaticinfrared band carriers, and implies that at these wavelengths, dust emissionfrom the disks of normal galaxies is dominated by photodissociation regions andnot by hii regions themselves. we use this newly-found correlation between themid-infrared and the halpha line to investigate the nature of the link betweenthe far-infrared (60 and 100 microns) and halpha. although the separation ofthe central regions from the disk is impossible to achieve in the far-infrared,we show that a circumnuclear contribution to the dust emission, having noequivalent counterpart in halpha, is most likely responsible for the well-knownnon-linearity between far-infrared and halpha fluxes in spiral galaxies. wederive a calibration of 7 and 15 micron fluxes in terms of star formation ratesfrom a primary calibration of halpha in the literature, and also outline theapplicability limits of the proposed conversion, which should not be blindlyextrapolated to objects whose nature is unknown.

astro-ph;0205401	extended mid-infrared emission from vv 114: probing the birth of a ulirg	we present our 5-16 micron spectro-imaging observations of vv114, an infraredluminous early-stage merger, taken with the isocam camera on-board iso. we findthat only 40% of the mid-infrared (mir) flux is associated with a compactnuclear region, while the rest of the emission originates from a rather diffusecomponent extended over several kpc. this is in stark contrast with the verycompact mir starbursts usually seen in luminous infrared galaxies. a secondarypeak of mir emission is associated with an extra-nuclear star forming regionwhich displays the largest halpha equivalent width in the whole system.comparing our data with the distribution of the molecular gas and cold dust, aswell as with radio observations, it becomes evident that the conversion ofmolecular gas into stars can be triggered over large areas at the very firststages of an interaction. the presence of a very strong continuum at 5 micronsin one of the sources indicates that an enshrouded active galactic nucleus maycontribute to 40% of its mir flux. we finally note that the relative variationsin the uv to radio spectral properties between the merging galaxies provideevidence that the extinction-corrected star formation rate of similar objectsat high z, such as those detected in optical deep surveys, can not beaccurately derived from their rest-frame uv properties.

astro-ph;0206150	mid-infrared observations of the ultraluminous galaxies iras14348-1447,  iras19254-7245, and iras23128-5919	we present a study of the three ultraluminous infrared galaxiesiras14348-1447, iras19254-7245, and iras23128-5919, based on mid-infrared (mir)spectro-imaging (5-18microns) observations performed with isocam. we find thatthe mir emission from each system, which consists of a pair of interacting latetype galaxies, is principally confined to the nuclear regions with diameters of1-2kpc and can account for more than 95% of their iras 12micron flux. in eachinteracting system, the galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (agn)dominates the total spectrum and shows stronger dust continuum (12-16microns)relative to the unidentified infrared band (uib) emission (6-9microns),suggestive of its enhanced radiation field. the mir dominant galaxy alsoexhibits elevated 15micron/halpha and 15micron/k ratios which trace the highextinction due to the large quantities of molecular gas and dust present in itscentral regions. using only diagnostics based on our mid-infrared spectra, wecan establish that the seyfert galaxy iras19254-7245 exhibits mir spectralfeatures of an agn while the mir spectrum of the seyfert (or liner) member ofiras23128-5919 is characteristic of dust emission principally heated by starforming regions.

astro-ph;0311154	dust enshrouded star-forming activity in arp 299	we present mid-infrared spectro-imaging (5 - 16 microns) observations of theinfrared luminous interacting system arp 299 (=mrk171 =ic694+ngc3690) obtainedwith the isocam instrument aboard iso. our observations show that nearly 40% ofthe total emission at 7 and 15 microns is diffuse, originating from theinteracting disks of the galaxies. moreover, they indicate the presence oflarge amounts of hot dust in the main infrared sources of the system and largeextinctions toward the nuclei. while the observed spectra have an overallsimilar shape, mainly composed of unidentified infrared bands (uib) in theshort wavelength domain, a strong continuum at ~ 13 microns and a deep silicateabsorption band at 10 microns, their differences reveal the varying physicalconditions of each component. for each source, the spectral energy distribution(sed) can be reproduced by a linear combination of a uib "canonical" spectraltemplate and a hot dust continuum due to a 230-300 k black body, afterindependently applying an extinction correction to both of them. we find thatthe uib extinction does not vary much throughout the system (a_v ~ 5 mag)suggesting that most uibs originate from less enshrouded regions. ic694 appearsto dominate the infrared emission of the system and our observations supportthe interpretation of a deeply embedded nuclear starburst located behind anabsorption of about 40 mag. the central region of ngc3690 displays a hardradiation field characterized by a [neiii]/[neii] ratio &gt; 1.8. it also hosts astrong continuum from 5 to 16 microns which can be explained as thermalemission from a deeply embedded (a_v ~ 60 mag) compact source, consistent withthe mid-infrared signature of an active galactic nucleus (agn), and inagreement with recent x-ray findings.

astro-ph;0312029	dust emission in early-type galaxies: the mid-infrared view	we present mid-infrared (mir) maps for a sample of 18 early-type galaxiesobserved at 4.5, 6.7 and 15 microns with the isocam instrument on board the isosatellite with a 6'' spatial resolution. we model the spectral energydistribution (sed) of these galaxies using the stellar evolutionary synthesismodel pegase and we derive the mir excess over the stellar component. we thenexplore the nature of this excess in terms of dust and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon molecules (pahs). we find that out of 18 galaxies, 10 show excessat 6.7 microns (due to the presence of pah features) and 14 show excess at 15microns (due to the presence of warm dust). in two galaxies, where a morecomplete wavelength coverage exists, an excess around 9.7 microns is seen(presumably due to silicate dust emission), while two other galaxies aretotally devoid of dust. we also examine the morphology of the galaxies in thesewavelengths by plotting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles as well as themir color profiles. we find that for the majority of the galaxies the 4.5micron emission is well described by a de vaucouleurs profile. the 6.7 and 15micron emission is smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy while only a fewgalaxies show mir emission which is more concentrated close to the center. twodwarf galaxies in our sample show patchy distributions of the mir emissionwhile two other galaxies show edge-on disks. with color-color diagrams wedelineate the regions occupied by late-type and early-type galaxies. finally weshow that the mir excess found in strong radio galaxies like ngc 4486 (m87) canbe explained by synchrotron emission.

astro-ph;0508027	dissecting the spiral galaxy m83: mid-infrared emission and comparison  with other tracers of star formation	we present a detailed mid-infrared study of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxym83 based on isocam data. m83 is a unique case study, since a wide variety ofmir broad-band filters as well as spectra, covering the wavelength range of 4to 18\mu m, were observed and are presented here. emission maxima trace thenuclear and bulge area, star-formation regions at the end of the bar, as wellas the inner spiral arms. the fainter outer spiral arms and interarm regionsare also evident in the mir map. spectral imaging of the central 3'x3' (4 kpc x4 kpc) field allows us to investigate five regions of different environments.the various mir components (very small grains, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) molecules, ionic lines) are analyzed for different regions throughout thegalaxy. in the total 4\mu m to 18\mu m wavelength range, the pahs dominate theluminosity, contributing between 60% in the nuclear and bulge regions and 90%in the less active, interarm regions. throughout the galaxy, the underlyingcontinuum emission from the small grains is always a smaller contribution inthe total mir wavelength regime, peaking in the nuclear and bulge components.the implications of using broad-band filters only to characterize themid-infrared emission of galaxies, a commonly used isocam observation mode, arediscussed. we present the first quantitative analysis of new h-alpha and 6cmvla+effelsberg radio continuum maps of m83. the distribution of the miremission is compared with that of the co, hi, r band, h-alpha and 6cm radio. astriking correlation is found between the intensities in the two mid-infraredfilter bands and the 6cm radio continuum. to explain the tightmid-infrared-radio correlation we propose the anchoring of magnetic field linesin the photoionized shells of gas clouds.

astro-ph;0607207	limits on the macho content of the galactic halo from the eros-2 survey  of the magellanic clouds	the eros-2 project was designed to test the hypothesis that massive compacthalo objects (the so-called ``machos'') could be a major component of the darkmatter halo of the milky way galaxy. to this end, eros-2 monitored over 6.7years $33\times10^6$ stars in the magellanic clouds for microlensing eventscaused by such objects. in this work, we use only a subsample of $7\times10^6$bright stars spread over $84 \deg^2$ of the lmc and $9 \deg^2$ of the smc. thestrategy of using only bright stars helps to discriminate against backgroundevents due to variable stars and allows a simple determination of the effectsof source confusion (blending). the use of a large solid angle makes the surveyrelatively insensitive to effects that could make the optical depth stronglydirection dependent. using this sample of bright stars, only one candidateevent was found, whereas $\sim39$ events would have been expected if the halowere entirely populated by objects of mass $m\sim0.4m_{\odot}$. combined withthe results of eros-1, this implies that the optical depth toward the largemagellanic cloud (\object{lmc}) due to such lenses is $\tau&lt;0.36\times10^{-7}$(95%cl), corresponding to a fraction of the halo mass of less than 8%. thisoptical depth is considerably less than that measured by the machocollaboration in the central region of the lmc. more generally, machos in themass range $0.6\times10^{-7}m_\odot&lt;m&lt;15m_{\odot}$ are ruled out as the primaryoccupants of the milky way halo.

astro-ph;9505063	eros variable stars : fundamental-mode and first overtone cepheids in  the bar of the large magellanic cloud	we present ccd phase-binned light curves at 490 nm for 97 cepheid variablestars in the bar of the lmc. the photometry was obtained as part of the frencheros project and has excellent phase coverage, permitting accuratedecomposition into fourier components. we identify as `sinusoidal' ors-cepheids those stars with periods less than 5.5 d and small second-harmoniccomponents. these stars comprise $\sim$30% of our sample and most form asequence $\sim$1 mag brighter than the lmc classical cepheids in theperiod-luminosity diagram. they are also generally bluer and havelower-amplitude light curves. we infer that the s-cepheids are first-overtonepulsators because, when their periods are converted to expectedfundamental-mode values, they obey a common period-luminosity-colour relationwith classical cepheids. this also confirms the reality of the colour term inthe cepheid period-luminosity-colour relation. further, the blue edge of theclassical cepheid instability strip agrees well with the theoreticalcalculations for the fundamental mode made by chiosi et al. (1993) for thehertzsprung-russell and period-luminosity diagrams, but we find that ourobserved s-cepheids are $&gt;0.2$ mag brighter and bluer than the chiosi et al.\predictions for the first-overtone. we identify a number of features in plotsof our stars' fourier-component amplitude ratios and phase differences. thesefeatures have been identified with resonances between different pulsationmodes. in the lmc we find these features seem to occur at periods very similarto galactic ones for classical cepheids, but at different periods fors-cepheids. we discover a double-mode cepheid in the lmc, for which $p({\rmfirst overtone})/p({\rm fundamental}) = 0.710 \pm 0.001$, very similar toobserved ratios for galactic double-mode cepheids.

astro-ph;9612215	the effect of metallicity on the cepheid distance scale and its  implications for the hubble constant ($h_0$) determination	recent hst determinations of the expansion's rate of the universe (the hubbleconstant, h_0) assumed that the cepheid period-luminosity relation at v and iare independent of metallicity (freedman, et al., 1996, saha et al., 1996,tanvir et al., 1995). the three groups obtain different vales for h_0. we notethat most of this discrepancy stems from the asumption (by both groups) thatthe period-luminosity relation is independent of metallicity. we come to thisconclusion as a result of our study of the period-luminosity relation of 481cepheids with 3 millions two colour measurements in the large magellanic cloudand the small magellanic cloud obtained as a by-product of the erosmicrolensing survey. we find that the derived interstellar absorptioncorrections are particularly sensitive to the metallicity and when our resultis applied to recent estimates based on hst cepheids observations it makes thelow-h_0 values higher and the high-h_0 value lower, bringing those discrepantestimates into agrement around $h_0 \approx 70 km/s mpc^{-1}$.

astro-ph;9612216	metallicity effects on the cepheid extragalactic distance scale from  eros photometry in lmc and smc	this is an investigation of the period-luminosity relation of classicalcepheids in samples of different metallicity. it is based on 481 cepheids inthe large and small magellanic clouds from the blue and red filter ccdobservations (most similar to v_j &amp; r_j) of the french eros microlensingproject. the data-set is complete and provides an excellent basis for adifferential analysis between lmc and smc. in comparison to previous studies ofeffects on the pl-relation, the eros data-set offers extremely well-sampledlight curves and well-filled instability strips. this allows reliableseparation of cepheids pulsating in the fundamental and the first overtone modeand derivation of differential reddening. our main result concerns thedetermination of distances to galaxies which are inferred by using the lmc as abase and using two color photometry to establish the amount of reddening. wefind a zero-point offset between smc and lmc which amounts to a differencebetween inferred and true distance modulus of 0.14 \pm 0.06 mag in the vi_csystem. the offset is exactly the same in both sets of pl-relations - of thefundamental and of the first overtone mode cepheids. no effect is seen on theslopes of the pl-relations, although the fundamental and the first overtonemode cepheids have different pl slopes. we attribute the color and thezero-point offset to the difference in metallicity between the smc and lmccepheids. a metallicity effect of that small magnitude still has importantconsequencies for the inferred cepheid distances and the determination of h_0.when applied to recent estimates based on hst cepheid observations, ourmetallicity dependence makes the low-h_0 values (sandage et al. 1994) higherand the high-h_0 values (freedman et al. 1994b) lower, thus bringing those

astro-ph;9804020	mid--ir emission of galaxies in the virgo cluster: ii. integrated  properties	we analyse the integrated properties of the mid-ir emission of a complete,optically selected sample of galaxies in the virgo cluster observed with theisocam instrument on board the iso satellite. the analysis shows that themid-ir emission up to 15 mic of optically-selected, normal early-type galaxies(e, s0 and s0a) is dominated by the rayleigh-jeans tail of the cold stellarcomponent. the mid-ir emission of late-type galaxies is instead dominated bythe thermal emission from dust. the small dust grains emitting in the mid-irhave an excess of emission if compared to big grains emitting in the far-ir.while the far-ir emission increases with the intensity of the interstellarradiation field, their mid-ir emission is non--linearly related to the uvradiation field. the spectral energy distributions of the target galaxiesindicate that there is a linear relationship between the uv radiation field andthe mid-ir emission of galaxies for low or intermediate activities of starformation, while the emission from the hot dust seems to drop for strong uvfields. the mid-ir colour of late-type galaxies is not related to theiractivity of star formation. the properties of the dust emission in the mid-irseem more related to the mass than to the morphological type of the targetgalaxy. since the activity of star formation is anticorrelated to the mass ofgalaxies, this reflects a relationship between the emission of dust in themid-ir and the uv radiation field: galaxies with the lowest mid-ir emission fora given uv field are low mass, dwarf galaxies. these observational evidencesare easily explained if the carriers of the unidentified infrared bands thatdominate the 6.75 mic emission are destroyed by the intense uv radiation fieldof dwarf galaxies, although abundance effects can also play a role.
