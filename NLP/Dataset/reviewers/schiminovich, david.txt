0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0903.5331	eso 381-47, an early-type galaxy with extended hi and a star forming  ring	eso 381-47 is an early type galaxy with an extended hi disk. galex and verydeep optical images reveal a distinct stellar ring far outside the optical bodywith a diameter of ~30 kpc, which has undergone recent star formation at 1.8 x10^-4 msun/yr/kpc^-2, consistent with other new results which detect low levelstar formation below the traditional kennicutt relation in the outer parts ofspiral galaxies. the morphology of this galaxy resembles the recentlyidentified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, orxuv-disks. new hi observations of this galaxy taken at the atca and in the cnbarray at the vla show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)ring around the central s0 galaxy. the hi data cube can be well modeled by awarped ring. the faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy iskinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibitvelocities consistent with the rotation of the hi ring at larger radius. thepeak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and uv, is slightly displacedto the inside relative to the peak of the hi ring. we discuss the manner inwhich this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wavethrough an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision atthe center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up atearly times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. gas accretion andresonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered toexplain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the galex and deepoptical data.

0904.1596	luminous thermal flares from quiescent supermassive black holes	a dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will berevealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, anda flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of thestellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. here we presentthe third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the galex deep imagingsurvey: a 1.6x10^{43} erg s^{-1} uv/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy atz=0.1855. the uv/optical sed during the peak of the flare measured by galex andpalomar lfc imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody witht_{bb}=1.7x10^{5} k and a bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{45} erg s^{-1},assuming an internal extinction with e(b-v)_{gas}=0.3. the chandra upper limiton the x-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, l_{x}(2-10 kev)&lt; 10^{41}erg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios ofuv to x-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. we compare the lightcurves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidatesdiscovered by galex, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by thepower-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disruptedsolar-type star, and (2) the uv/optical seds can be attributed to thermalemission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidaldisruption radius of a ~10^{7} m_sun central black hole. we use the observedpeak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5 &gt; m_{g} &gt; -18.9) topredict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.(abridged)

0905.0162	mid-ir luminosities and uv/optical star formation rates at z&lt;1.4	uv continuum and mid-ir emission constitute two widely used star formationindicators at intermediate and high redshifts. we study 2430 galaxies withz&lt;1.4 in the extended groth strip with mips 24 mic observations from fidel,spectroscopy from deep2, and uv, optical, and near-ir photometry from aegis.the data are coupled with stellar population models and bayesian sed fitting toestimate dust-corrected sfrs. in order to probe the dust heating from stellarpopulations of various ages, the derived sfrs were averaged over varioustimescales--from 100 myr for "current" sfr to 1--3 gyr for long-timescale sfrs.these sed-based uv/optical sfrs are compared to total infrared luminositiesextrapolated from 24 mic observations. we find that for the blue, actively starforming galaxies the correlation between the ir luminosity and the uv/opticalsfr shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer sfr-averagingtimescales. we interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellarpopulations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. this holds overthe entire redshift range. many so-called green valley galaxies are simplydust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. however, there exist 24mic-detected galaxies, some with l&gt;10^11 l_sun, yet with little current starformation. for them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light issufficient to produce the observed levels of ir. in our sample optical andx-ray agns do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-irluminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "ir excess"galaxies (abridged).

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0906.1012	an osiris study of the gas kinematics in a sample of uv-selected  galaxies: evidence of "hot and bothered" starbursts in the local universe	we present data from integral field spectroscopy for 3 supercompactuv-luminous galaxies (scuvlgs). as nearby (z~0.2), compact (r_50~1-2 kpc),bright paschen-alpha sources, with unusually high star formation rates(sfr=3-100 m_sun/yr), scuvlgs are an ideal population for studying detailedkinematics and dynamics in actively star-forming galaxies. in addition, scuvlgsappear to be excellent analogs to high redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs) andour results may offer additional insight into the dynamics of lbgs. previouswork by our team has shown that the morphologies of these galaxies exhibittidal features and companions, and in this study we find that the dynamics ofscuvlgs are dominated by disturbed kinematics of the emission line gas--suggestive that these galaxies have undergone recent feedback, interactions ormergers. while 2 of the 3 galaxies do display rotation, v/sigma &lt; 1 --suggesting dispersion dominated kinematics rather than smooth rotation. we alsosimulate how these observations would appear at z~2. lower resolution and lossof low surface brightness features causes some apparent discrepancies betweenthe low-z (observed) and high-z (simulated) interpretations and quantitativelygives different values for v/sigma, yet simulations of these low-z analogsmanage to detect the brightest regions well and resemble actual high-zobservations of lbgs.

0906.2602	probing the intermediate-age globular clusters in ngc 5128 from  ultraviolet observations	we explore the age distribution of the globular cluster (gc) system of thenearby elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 using ultraviolet (uv) photometry from galaxyevolution explorer (galex) observations, with uv - optical colors used as theage indicator. most gcs in ngc 5128 follow the general trends of gcs in m31 andmilky way in uv - optical color-color diagram, which indicates that themajority of gcs in ngc 5128 are old similar to the age range of old gcs in m31and milky way. a large fraction of spectroscopically identifiedintermediate-age gc (iagc) candidates with ~ 3-8 gyr are not detected in thefuv passband. considering the nature of intermediate-age populations beingfaint in the far-uv (fuv) passband, we suggest that many of thespectroscopically identified iagcs may be truly intermediate in age. this is incontrast to the case of m31 where a large fraction of spectroscopicallysuggested iagcs are detected in fuv and therefore may not be genuine iagcs butrather older gcs with developed blue horizontal branch stars. our uv photometrystrengthens the results previously suggesting the presence of gc and stellarsubpopulation with intermediate age in ngc 5128. the existence of iagcsstrongly indicates the occurrence of at least one more major star formationepisode after a starburst at high redshift.

0909.2279	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in galaxies at z~0.1: the effect of  star formation and agn	we present the analysis of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) spectraof a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 observed withthe spitzer irs. we compare the relative strengths of pah emission featureswith sdss optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between pah grainproperties and star formation and agn activity. short-to-long wavelength pahratios, and in particular the 7.7-to-11.3 micron feature ratio, are stronglycorrelated with the star formation diagnostics d_n(4000) and h-alpha equivalentwidth, increasing with younger stellar populations. this ratio also shows asignificant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the activegalaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 micron emission. a hard radiation field asmeasured by [oiii]/h-beta and [neiii]_15.6/[neii]_12.8 affects pah ratiosdifferently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity oran agn. our results are consistent with a picture in which larger pah moleculesgrow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller pah molecules arepreferentially destroyed by agn.

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

0912.1610	the galex arecibo sdss survey. i. gas fraction scaling relations of  massive galaxies and first data release	we introduce the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass), an on-going large programthat is gathering high quality hi-line spectra using the arecibo radiotelescope for an unbiased sample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greaterthan 10^10 msun and redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05, selected from the sdssspectroscopic and galex imaging surveys. the galaxies are observed untildetected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5-5%) is reached. this paperpresents the first data release, consisting of ~20% of the final gass sample.we use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of hi gas fractionwith galaxy structure and nuv-r colour. a large fraction (~60%) of the galaxiesin our sample are detected in hi. we find that the atomic gas fractiondecreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and nuv-rcolour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (asmeasured by the concentration index of the r-band light). we also find that thefraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) hi decreasessharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10^8.5 msunkpc^-2. the fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly withstellar mass. one of the key goals of gass is to identify and quantify theincidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-formingcloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. likely transitioncandidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relationsbetween gas fraction and other galaxy properties.

1003.2202	dust attenuation in disk-dominated galaxies: evidence for the 2175a dust  feature	the attenuation of starlight by interstellar dust is investigated in a sampleof low redshift, disk-dominated star-forming galaxies using photometry fromgalex and sdss. by considering broadband colors as a function of galaxyinclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasingdust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellarpopulations do not correlate with inclination. all commonly employed dustattenuation curves (such as the calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-lawcurve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highlyinclined galaxies. this conclusion rests on the fact that the average fuv-nuvcolor varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors suchas nuv-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. after considering a number ofmodel variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dustextinction feature at 2175a seen in the milky way (mw) extinction curve isresponsible for the observed trends. independent of our interpretation, theseresults imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet issignificantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. these results alsoimply a very weak dependence of the fuv-nuv color on total fuv attenuation, andwe conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observeduv spectral slope to infer the total uv dust attenuation, as is commonly done.we propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grainpopulation responsible for the 2175a feature.

1003.4985	ngc 404, a rejuvenated lenticular galaxy on a merger-induced, blueward  excursion into the green valley	we have discovered recent star formation in the outermost portion (1-4x r_25)of the nearby lenticular (s0) galaxy ngc 404 using galex uv imaging. fuv-brightsources are strongly concentrated within the galaxy's hi ring (formed by amerger event according to del rio et al.), even though the average gas densityis dynamically subcritical. archival hst imaging reveals resolved upper mainsequence stars and conclusively demonstrates that the uv light originates fromrecent star formation activity. we present fuv, nuv radial surface brightnessprofiles and integrated magnitudes for ngc 404. within the ring, the averagestar formation rate surface density (sigma_{sfr}) is 2.2x10^-5 msun/yr/kpc^2.of the total fuv flux, 70% comes from the hi ring which is forming stars at arate of 2.5x10^-3 msun/yr. the gas consumption timescale, assuming a constantsfr and no gas recycling, is several times the age of the universe. in thecontext of the uv-optical galaxy cmd, the presence of the sf hi ring places ngc404 in the green valley separating the red and blue sequences. the rejuvenatedlenticular galaxy has experienced a merger-induced, disk-building excursionaway from the red sequence toward bluer colors, where it may evolve quiescentlyor (if appropriately triggered) experience a burst capable of placing it on theblue/star-forming sequence for up to ~1 gyr. the green valley galaxy populationis heterogeneous, with most systems transitioning from blue to red but othersevolving in the opposite sense due to acquisition of fresh gas through variouschannels.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1006.5447	the galex arecibo sdss survey ii: the star formation efficiency of  massive galaxies	we use measurements of the hi content, stellar mass and star formation ratesin ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun, obtainedfrom the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) described in paper i (catinella etal. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with thebin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the hi mass, which we callthe hi-based star formation efficiency (sfe). unlike the mean specific starformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surfacedensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across thesample with a value close to sfe = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gasconsumption timescale of ~3 gyr). specifically, we find little variation in sfewith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, nuv-r color and concentration.we interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedbackmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating starformation in massive galaxies. an investigation into the detailed distributionof sfes reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencieswith sfe &gt; 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to adeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. conversely,we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich fortheir given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both ahigher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formationrate. both of these populations are plausible candidates for "transition"galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in theirspecific star formation rate in the near future. we also find that 36+/-5% ofthe total hi mass density and 47+/-5% of the total sfr density is found ingalaxies with stellar mass greater than 10^10 msun.

1008.3160	optical vs. infrared studies of dusty galaxies and agn: (i) nebular  emission lines	optical nebular emission lines are commonly used to estimate the starformation rate of galaxies and the black hole accretion rate of their centralactive nucleus. the accuracy of the conversion from line strengths to physicalproperties depends upon the accuracy to which the lines can be corrected fordust attenuation. for studies of single galaxies with normal amounts of dust,most dust corrections result in the same derived properties within the errors.however, for statistical studies of populations of galaxies, or for studies ofgalaxies with higher dust contents such as might be found in some classes of"transition" galaxies, significant uncertainty arises from the dust attenuationcorrection. we compare the strength of the predominantly unobscured mid-ir[neii]15.5um + [neiii]12.8um emission lines to the optical h alpha emissionlines in four samples of galaxies: (i) ordinary star forming galaxies, (ii)optically selected dusty galaxies, (iii) ulirgs, (iv) seyfert 2 galaxies. weshow that a single dust attenuation curve applied to all samples can correct halpha emission for dust attenuation to a factor better than 2. similarly, wecompare mid-ir [oiv] and optical [oiii] luminosities to find that [oiii] can becorrected to a factor better than 3. this shows that the total dust attenuationsuffered by the agn narrow line region is not significantly different to thatsuffered by the starforming hii regions in the galaxy. we provide explicit dustattenuation corrections, together with errors, for [oii], [oiii] and h alpha.the best-fit average attenuation curve is slightly greyer than the milky-wayextinction law, indicating either that external galaxies have slightlydifferent typical dust properties to the milky way, or that there is asignificant contribution from scattering. finally, we uncover an intriguingcorrelation between silicate absorption and balmer decrement.

1009.0279	westerbork ultra-deep survey of hi at z=0.2	in this contribution, we present some preliminary observational results fromthe completed ultra-deep survey of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen atredshifts z=0.164-0.224 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope. in twoseparate fields, a total of 160 individual galaxies has been detected inneutral hydrogen, with hi masses varying from 1.1x10^9 to 4.0x10^10 msun. thelargest galaxies are spatially resolved by the synthesized beam of 23x37arcsec^2 while the velocity resolution of 19 km/s allowed the hi emission linesto be well resolved. the large scale structure in the surveyed volume is tracedwell in hi, apart from the highest density regions like the cores of galaxyclusters. all significant hi detections have obvious or plausible opticalcounterparts which are usually blue late-type galaxies that are uv-bright. oneof the observed fields contains a massive butcher-oemler cluster but none ofthe associated blue galaxies has been detected in hi. the data suggest that thelower-luminosity galaxies at z=0.2 are more gas-rich than galaxies of similarluminosities at z=0, pending a careful analysis of the completeness near thedetection limit. optical counterparts of the hi detected galaxies are mostlylocated in the 'blue cloud' of the galaxy population although several galaxieson the 'red sequence' are also detected in hi. these results hold great promisefor future deep 21cm surveys of neutral hydrogen with meerkat, apertif, askap,and ultimately the square kilometre array.

1009.4309	alfalfa hi data stacking i. does the bulge quench ongoing star formation  in early-type galaxies?	we have carried out an hi stacking analysis of a volume-limited sample of~5000 galaxies with imaging and spectroscopic data from galex and the sloandigital sky survey, which lie within the current footprint of the arecibolegacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. our galaxies are selected to have stellarmasses greater than 10^10 msun and redshifts in the range 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. weextract a sub-sample of 1833 "early-type" galaxies with inclinations less than70deg, with concentration indices c&gt;2.6 and with light profiles that are wellfit by a de vaucouleurs model. we then stack hi line spectra extracted from thealfalfa data cubes at the 3-d positions of the galaxies from these two samplesin bins of stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, central velocitydispersion, and nuv-r colour. we use the stacked spectra to estimate theaverage hi gas fractions m_hi/m_* of the galaxies in each bin.  our main result is that the hi content of a galaxy is not influenced by itsbulge. the average hi gas fractions of galaxies in both our samples correlatemost strongly with nuv-r colour and with stellar surface density. the relationbetween average hi fraction and these two parameters is independent ofconcentration index c. we have tested whether the average hi gas content ofbulge-dominated galaxies on the red sequence, differs from that of late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find no evidence that galaxies with asignificant bulge component are less efficient at turning their available gasreservoirs into stars. this result is in contradiction with the "morphologicalquenching" scenario proposed by martig et al. (2009).

1009.4934	the kinematics of ionized gas in lyman-break analogs at z ~ 0.2	we present results for 19 "lyman break analogs" (lbas) observed withkeck/osiris with an ao-assisted spatial resolution of less than 200 pc. wedetect satellites/companions, diffuse emission and velocity shear, all withhigh signal-to-noise ratios. these galaxies present remarkably high velocitydispersion along the line of sight(- 70 km s-1), much higher than standardstar-forming spirals in the low-redshift universe. we artificially redshift ourdata to z - 2.2 to allow for a direct comparison with observations of high-zlbgs and find striking similarities between both samples. this suggests thateither similar physical processes are responsible for their observedproperties, or, alternatively, that it is very difficult to distinguish betweendifferent mechanisms operating in the low versus high redshift starburstgalaxies based on the available data. the comparison between morphologies inthe uv/optical continuum and our kinemetry analysis often shows that neither isby itself sufficient to confirm or completely rule out the contribution fromrecent merger events. we find a correlation between the kinematic propertiesand stellar mass, in that more massive galaxies show stronger evidence for adisk-like structure. this suggests a co-evolutionary process between thestellar mass build-up and the formation of morphological and dynamicalsub-structure within the galaxy.

1011.3512	the extreme hosts of extreme supernovae	we use galex ultraviolet (uv) and optical integrated photometry of the hostsof seventeen luminous supernovae (lsne, having peak m_v &lt; -21) and compare themto a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the sdss dr4 spectralcatalog and galex interim release 1.1. we place the lsne hosts on the galaxynuv-r versus m_r color magnitude diagram (cmd) with the larger sample toillustrate how extreme they are. the lsn hosts appear to favor low-densityregions of the galaxy cmd falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward thelow luminosity end. from the uv-optical photometry, we estimate the starformation history of the lsn hosts. the hosts have moderately low starformation rates (sfrs) and low stellar masses (m_*) resulting in high specificstar formation rates (ssfr). compared with the larger sample, the lsn hostsoccupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting ssfr versus m_* in the areahaving higher ssfr and lower m_*. this preference for low m_*, high ssfr hostsimplies the lsne are produced by an effect having to do with their localenvironment. the correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhapswind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents lsne from arising inhigher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. the massive progenitors of the lsne(&gt;100 m_sun), by appearing in low-sfr hosts, are potential tests for theoriesof the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on thesfr.

1011.6098	dust attenuation in uv-selected starbursts at high redshift and their  local counterparts: implications for the cosmic star formation rate density	we present a new analysis of the dust obscuration in starburst galaxies atlow and high redshift. this study is motivated by our unique sample of the mostextreme uv-selected starburst galaxies in the nearby universe (z&lt;0.3), found tobe good analogs of high-redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in most of theirphysical properties. we find that the dust properties of the lyman breakanalogs (lbas) are consistent with the relation derived previously by meurer etal. (m99) that is commonly used to dust-correct star formation ratemeasurements at a very wide range of redshifts. we directly compare our resultswith high redshift samples (lbgs, bzk, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having irdata either from spitzer or herschel. the attenuation in typical lbgs at z=2-3and lbas is very similar. because lbas are much better analogs to lbgs comparedto previous local star-forming samples, including m99, the practice ofdust-correcting the sfrs of high redshift galaxies based on the localcalibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. we illustrate theimportance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relationbetween uv measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated,dust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.

0709.0730	the star formation and extinction co-evolution of uv-selected galaxies  over 0.05&lt;z&lt;1.2	we use a new stacking technique to obtain mean mid ir and far ir to far uvflux ratios over the rest near-uv/near-ir color-magnitude diagram. we employcombo-17 redshifts and combo-17 optical, galex far and near uv, spitzer iracand mips mid ir photometry. this technique permits us to probe infrared excess(irx), the ratio of far ir to far uv luminosity, and specific star formationrate (ssfr) and their co-evolution over two orders of magnitude of stellar massand redshift 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2. we find that the ssfr and the characteristic mass (m_0)above which the ssfr drops increase with redshift (downsizing). at any givenepoch, irx is an increasing function of mass up to m_0. above this mass irxfalls, suggesting gas exhaustion. in a given mass bin below m_0 irx increaseswith time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. we interpret these trendsusing a simple model with a schmidt-kennicutt law and extinction that tracksgas density and enrichment. we find that the average irx and ssfr follows agalaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and timesince formation. we conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties whichshow simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-upof heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and theexhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. the irxrepresents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.

1012.2161	characterizing ultraviolet excesses in the outskirts of a local  early-type sample	we present an analysis of ultraviolet (uv) emission in the outer regions of alocal, volume-limited sample of 56 early-type galaxies, where h{\alpha}emission from massive star formation is typically absent. we find excess faintnuv emission in the environments of our early-type galaxies compared to blanksky measured in the same tiles, indicating that the excesses are not due tobackground contamination. we do not observe corresponding faint fuv excesses.faint nuv excesses increase with galaxy luminosity and are not correlated withthe presence or absence of hi in the environments of these galaxies. the faintnuv excesses in the outskirts of early-type galaxies can be interpreted asbeing due to star formation at or above a few \times 10-5 m\odot yr-1 kpc-2;star formation at this rate can create a few percent of the mass of anearly-type galaxy in a gyr. faint early types (with mb &gt; -21.3) have on averagefour times as many bright uv sources within 30 kpc compared to bright earlytypes (with mb &lt; -21.3). the peak of the source distribution detected aroundfaint early types is less luminous and slightly bluer than the peak of thesources detected around bright early types, indicating that early types with mb&gt; -21.3 are more actively building up their mass with young stars. the spatialdistribution of bright sources around all early types increases approximatelylinearly out to 20 kpc and subsequently flattens.

1101.4219	extreme feedback and the epoch of reionization: clues in the local  universe	the source responsible for reionizing the universe at z &gt; 6 remainsuncertain. while an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxiesmay be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of theirionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. attempts tomeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lowerredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. in this paper we present new hstcos and archival fuse far-uv spectroscopy of a sample of eleven lyman breakanalogs (lbas), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble thehigh-z lyman break galaxies. we combine these data with sdss optical spectraand spitzer photometry. we also analyze archival fuse observations of fifteentypical uv-bright local starbursts. we find evidence of small covering factorsfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. this is based on two independentpieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of thestrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratioof extinction-corrected h-alpha to uv plus far-ir luminosities. these objectsrepresent three of the four lbas that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),and highly massive (~10^9 mo) dominant central object (dco). these threeobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount ofblueshifted ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factorof neutral gas. all four lbas with dcos in our sample show extremely highvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. we show thatthese properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburstthat is exceptionally compact. we speculate that such extreme feedback may berequired to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.

1101.6051	the recent star formation in ngc 6822: an ultraviolet study	we characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy ngc 6822over the past few hundred million years, using galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 a)and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 a) imaging, and ground-based ha imaging. from galexfuv image, we define 77 star-forming (sf) regions with area &gt;860 pc^2, andsurface brightness &lt;=26.8 mag(ab)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of thecenter of the galaxy. we estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in eachsf region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: e(b-v) rangesfrom the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. theintegrated fuv and nuv photometry, compared with stellar population models,yields ages of the sf complexes up to a few hundred myr, and masses from 2x10^2msun to 1.5x10^6 msun. the derived ages and masses strongly depend on theassumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary acrossthe galaxy. the total mass of the fuv-defined sf regions translates into anaverage star formation rate (sfr) of 1.4x10^-2 msun/yr over the past 100 myr,and sfr=1.0x10^-2 msun/yr in the most recent 10 myr. the latter is in agreementwith the value that we derive from the ha luminosity, sfr=0.008 msun/yr. thesfr in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the sfr=0.02 msun/yrinferred from far-ir measurements, which trace star formation still embedded indust (age &lt;= a few myr).

1103.1642	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  i. relations between h2, hi, stellar content and structural properties	we are conducting cold gass, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearbygalaxies. using the iram 30m telescope, we measure the co(1-0) line in a sampleof ~350 nearby (d=100-200 mpc), massive galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10.0). thesample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides anunbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. by combining the iram datawith sdss photometry and spectroscopy, galex imaging and high-quality arecibohi data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars,atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10l* galaxies. in this paper, we present columinosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. theoverall co detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence ofsharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surfacedensity and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurablecold gas component but above which the detection rate of the co line dropssuddenly. the mean molecular gas fraction mh2/m* of the co detections is0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is astrong function of nuv-r colour. through stacking, we set a firm upper limit ofmh2/m*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with nuv-r&gt;5.0. the averagemolecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, withsignificant scatter from one galaxy to the next. the existence of strongdetection thresholds in both the hi and co lines suggests that "quenching"processes have occurred in these systems. intriguingly, atomic gas stronglydominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie abovethese thresholds. this suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still bepossible following the quenching event.

1104.0019	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  ii. the non-universality of the molecular gas depletion timescale	we study the relation between molecular gas and star formation in avolume-limited sample of 222 galaxies from the cold gass survey, withmeasurements of the co(1-0) line from the iram 30m telescope. the galaxies areat redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05 and have stellar masses in the range10.0&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;11.5. the iram measurements are complemented by deep arecibohi observations and homogeneous sdss and galex photometry. a reference samplethat includes both uv and far-ir data is used to calibrate our estimates ofstar formation rates from the seven optical/uv bands. the mean molecular gasdepletion timescale, tdep(h2), for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 gyr,however tdep(h2) increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ~0.5 gyr forgalaxies with stellar masses of 10^10 msun to ~3 gyr for galaxies with massesof a few times 10^11 msun. in contrast, the atomic gas depletion timescaleremains contant at a value of around 3 gyr. this implies that in high massgalaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales are comparable, but inlow mass galaxies, molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly thanatomic gas. the strongest dependences of tdep(h2) are on the stellar mass ofthe galaxy (parameterized as log tdep(h2)= (0.36+/-0.07)(log m* -10.70)+(9.03+/-0.99)), and on the specific star formation rate. a singletdep(h2) versus ssfr relation is able to fit both "normal" star-forminggalaxies in our cold gass sample, as well as more extreme starburst galaxies(lirgs and ulirgs), which have tdep(h2) &lt; 10^8 yr. normal galaxies at z=1-2 aredisplaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the tdep(h2) versusssfr plane and have molecular gas depletion times that are a factor of 3-5times longer at a given value of ssfr due to their significantly larger gasfractions.

0709.3304	hst morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs i: evidence for  starbursts triggered by merging	heckman et al. (2005) used the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv imagingsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compactuv-luminous galaxies (uvlgs) that closely resembles high redshift lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). we present hst images in the uv, optical, and ha, andresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the goods/udf fields to showthat the morphologies of uvlgs are also similar to those of lbgs. our sample of8 lbg analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between starformation and lbg morphology. faint tidal features or companions can be seen inall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are theresult of a merger or interaction. the uv/optical light is dominated byunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (ssbs). a detailed comparisonwith the galaxies haro 11 and vv 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the ssbsthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. the structuralfeatures revealed by the new hst images occur on very small physical scales andare thus not detectable in images of high redshift lbgs, except in a few caseswhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. we propose, therefore, thatlbgs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 msun) systems, andthat the mergers trigger the formation of ssbs. if galaxies at high redshiftsare dominated by ssbs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function ispredicted to have slope alpha~2. our results are the most direct confirmationto date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in theearly universe was highly collisional.

1104.4501	the space density of extended ultraviolet (xuv) disks in the local  universe and implications for gas accretion on to galaxies	we present results of the first unbiased search for extended uv (xuv)-diskgalaxies undertaken to determine the space density of such galaxies. our samplecontains 561 local (0.001 &lt; z &lt; 0.05) galaxies that lie in the intersection ofavailable galex deep imaging (exposure time &gt; 1.5 x 10^4 s) and sdss dr7footprints. we explore modifications to the standard classification scheme forour sample that includes both disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies. visualclassification of each galaxy in the sample reveals an xuv-disk frequency of upto 20% for the most nearby portion of our sample. on average over the entiresample (out to z=0.05) the frequency ranges from a hard limit of 4% to 14%. thegalex imaging allows us to detect xuv-disks beyond 100 mpc. the xuv regionsaround xuv-disk galaxies are consistently bluer than the main bodies. we find asurprisingly high frequency of xuv emission around luminous red (nuv-r &gt; 5) andgreen valley (3 &lt; nuv-r &lt; 5) galaxies. the xuv-disk space density in the localuniverse is &gt; 1.5-4.2 x 10^-3 mpc^-3. using the xuv emission as an indicator ofrecent gas accretion, we estimate that the cold gas accretion rate onto thesegalaxies is &gt; 1.7-4.6 x 10^-3 msun mpc^-3 yr^-1. the number of xuv-disks in thegreen valley and the estimated accretion rate onto such galaxies points to theintriguing possibility that 7%-18% of galaxies in this population aretransitioning away from the red sequence.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.3975	photometric redshifts and quasar probabilities from a single,  data-driven generative model	we describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating theredshift of quasars. it can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshiftranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, andnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelengthphotometry. we build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying theextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. byintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities indifferent redshift ranges. this approach allows for efficient, consistent, andfast classification and photometric redshift estimation. this is achieved bycombining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basisof our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through theuse of many simple components with many parameters. we show that this techniqueis competitive with the best photometric quasar classificationtechniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and highsignal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniqueswhen applied to broadband optical data. we demonstrate that the inclusion of uvand nir data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation andessentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent tothe ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noiseratio. for quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the sdss 84 and 97 percent ofthe objects with galex uv and ukidss nir data have photometric redshifts within0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to abouta factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. our codeto calculate quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions ispublicly available.

1110.4226	the galex arecibo sdss survey. iv. baryonic mass-velocity-size relations  of massive galaxies	we present dynamical scaling relations for a homogeneous and representativesample of ~500 massive galaxies, selected only by stellar mass (&gt;10^10 msun)and redshift (0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05) as part of the ongoing galex arecibo sdss survey.we compare baryonic tully-fisher (btf) and faber-jackson (bfj) relations forthis sample, and investigate how galaxies scatter around the best fits obtainedfor pruned subsets of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated systems. the bfjrelation is significantly less scattered than the btf when the relations areapplied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclinationproblems that plague the btf. disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematicallydeviate from the bfj relation defined by the spheroids. we demonstrate that byapplying a simple correction to the stellar velocity dispersions that dependsonly on the concentration index of the galaxy, we are able to bring disks andspheroids onto the same dynamical relation -- in other words, we obtain ageneralized bfj relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample,regardless of morphology, inclination or gas content, and has a scatter smallerthan 0.1 dex. we find that disks and spheroids are offset in the stellardispersion-size relation, and that the offset is removed when correcteddispersions are used instead. the generalized bfj relation represents afundamental correlation between the global dark matter and baryonic content ofgalaxies, which is obeyed by all (massive) systems regardless of morphology.[abridged]

1112.1084	the galex arecibo sdss survey v: the relation between the hi content of  galaxies and metal enrichment at their outskirts	we have obtained long-slit spectra of 174 star-forming galaxies with stellarmasses greater than 10^10 m_\odot from the galex arecibo sdss (gass) survey.these galaxies have both hi and h_2 mass measurements. the average metallicityprofile is strikingly flat out to r_90, the radius enclosing 90% of the r-bandlight. metallicity profiles which decline steadily with radius are foundprimarily for galaxies in our sample with low stellar mass (log(m_*)&lt;10.2),concentration, and/or mean stellar mass density. beyond ~r_90, however, around10 percent of the galaxies in our sample exhibit a sharp downturn inmetallicity. remarkably, we find that the magnitude of the outer metallicitydrop is well correlated with the total hi content of the galaxy (measured asf_hi=m_hi/m_*). we examine the radial profiles of stellar population ages andstar formation rate densities, and conclude that the galaxies with largestouter metallicity drops are actively growing their stellar disks, with massdoubling times across the whole disk only one third as long as a typical gassgalaxy. we also describe a correlation between local stellar mass density andmetallicity, which is valid across all galaxies in our sample. we argue thatmuch of the recent stellar mass growth at the edges of these galaxies can belinked to the accretion or radial transport of relatively pristine gas frombeyond the galaxies' stellar disks.

1202.2857	the clustering of galaxies as a function of their  photometrically-estimated atomic gas content	we introduce a new photometric estimator of the hi mass fraction (m_hi/m_*)in local galaxies, which is a linear combination of four parameters: stellarmass, stellar surface mass density, nuv-r colour, and g-i colour gradient. itis calibrated using samples of nearby galaxies (0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05) with hi linedetections from the gass and alfalfa surveys, and it is demonstrated to provideunbiased m_hi/m_* estimates even for hi-rich galaxies. we apply this estimatorto a sample of ~24,000 galaxies from the sdss/dr7 in the same redshift range.we then bin these galaxies by stellar mass and hi mass fraction and computeprojected two point cross-correlation functions with respect to a referencegalaxy sample. results are compared with predictions from current semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation. the agreement is good for galaxies with stellarmasses larger than 10^10 m_sun, but not for lower mass systems. we then extendthe analysis by studying the bias in the clustering of hi-poor or hi-richgalaxies with respect to galaxies with normal hi content on scales between 100kpc and ~5 mpc. for the hi-deficient population, the strongest bias effectsarise when the hi-deficiency is defined in comparison to galaxies of the samestellar mass and size. this is not reproduced by the semi-analytic models,where the quenching of star formation in satellites occurs by "starvation" anddoes not depend on their internal structure. hi-rich galaxies with massesgreater than 10^10 m_sun are found to be anti-biased compared to galaxies with"normal" hi content. interestingly, no such effect is found for lower massgalaxies.

(2010),which track the evolution of the radial profiles of atomic and molecular gas ingalaxies, with gas fraction scaling relations derived from the cold gass survey(saintonge et al 2011). the models provide a good description of how condensedbaryons in galaxies with gas are partitioned into stars, atomic and moleculargas as a function of galaxy stellar mass and surface density. the models do notreproduce the tight observed relation between stellar surface density andbulge-to-disk ratio for this population. we then turn to an analysis ofthe"quenched" population of galaxies without detectable cold gas. the currentimplementation of radio-mode feedback in the models disagrees strongly with thedata. in the models, gas cooling shuts down in nearly all galaxies in darkmatter halos above a mass of 10**12 m_sun. as a result, stellar mass is theobservable that best predicts whether a galaxy has little or no neutral gas. incontrast, our data show that quenching is largely independent of stellar mass.instead, there are clear thresholds in bulge-to-disk ratio and in stellarsurface density that demarcate the location of quenched galaxies. we proposethat processes associated with bulge formation play a key role in depleting theneutral gas in galaxies and that further gas accretion is suppressed followingthe formation of the bulge, even in dark matter halos of low mass.

1205.0932	quantifying the role of bars in the build-up of central mass  concentrations in disk galaxies	we analyze the role of bars in the build-up of central mass concentrations inmassive, disk galaxies. our parent sample consists of 3757 face-on diskgalaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identifiedusing position angle and ellipticity profiles of the $i$-band light. we comparethe ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc centralregion of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. galaxies withstrong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancementdepends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar, and not on the size of the baror on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. the fraction of galaxies withstrong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than $3 \times 10^{10}m_{\odot}$, stellar surface densities less than $3 \times 10^8 m_{\odot}$ andconcentration indices less than 2.5. in this region of parameter space,galaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, orstar formation that is {\em suppressed} compared to the mean. this suggeststhat bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation ingalaxies. only 50% of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation havestrong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions alsoinduce central star-bursts. we also find that the ratio of the size of the barto that of the disk depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting thatthe growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggestedby simulations.

1206.3059	the galex arecibo sdss survey. vi. second data release and updated gas  fraction scaling relations	we present the second data release from the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass),an ongoing large arecibo program to measure the hi properties for an unbiasedsample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun andredshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. gass targets are selected from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) spectroscopic and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) imagingsurveys, and are observed until detected or until a gas mass fraction limit ofa few per cent is reached. this second data installment includes new areciboobservations of 240 galaxies, and marks the 50% of the complete survey. wepresent catalogs of the hi, optical and ultraviolet parameters for thesegalaxies, and their hi-line profiles. having more than doubled the size of thesample since the first data release, we also revisit the main scaling relationsof the hi mass fraction with galaxy stellar mass, stellar mass surface density,concentration index, and nuv-r color, as well as the gas fraction planeintroduced in our earlier work.

1206.5552	demographics and physical properties of gas out/inflows at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4	we present keck/lris spectra of over 200 galaxies with well-determinedredshifts between 0.4 and 1.4. we combine new measurements of near-ultraviolet,low-ionization absorption lines with previously measured masses, luminosities,colors, and star formation rates to describe the demographics and properties ofgalactic flows. among star-forming galaxies with blue colors, we find a netblueshift of the feii absorption greater than 200 km/s (100 km/s) towards 2.5%(20%) of the galaxies. the fraction of blueshifted spectra does not varysignificantly with stellar mass, color, or luminosity but does decline atspecific star formation rates less than roughly 0.8 gyr^{-1}. the insensitivityof the blueshifted fraction to galaxy properties requires collimated outflowsat these redshifts, while the decline in outflow fraction with increasingblueshift might reflect the angular dependence of the outflow velocity. the lowdetection rate of infalling gas, 3 to 6% of the spectra, suggests an origin in(enriched) streams favorably aligned with our sightline. we find 4 of these 9infalling streams have projected velocities commensurate with the kinematics ofan extended disk or satellite galaxy. the strength of the mgii absorptionincreases with stellar mass, b-band luminosity, and u-b color, trends arisingfrom a combination of more interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity andless emission filling in more massive galaxies. our results provides a newquantitative understanding of gas flows between galaxies and the circumgalacticmedium over a critical period in galaxy evolution.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

0711.4823	the uv-optical color magnitude diagram ii: physical properties and  morphological evolution on and off of a star-forming sequence	we use the uv-optical color magnitude diagram in combination withspectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the sdss spectroscopicsample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z&lt;0.25)and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate(ssfr) and stellar mass. throughout this study our emphasis is on theproperties of galaxies on and off of a local "star-forming sequence." wediscuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence arerelated to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of differentmorphological types. we find, among other trends that our measure of the starformation rate surface density is nearly constant along this sequence. wediscuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. for thefirst time, we report on measurements of the local uv luminosity functionversus galaxy structural parameters as well as inclination. we also split oursample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-bandsersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus inssfr vs. stellar mass space while bulge-dominated galaxies display a muchlarger spread of ssfr at fixed stellar mass. a significant fraction of galaxieswith ssfr and sf surface density above those on the "star-forming sequence" arebulge-dominated. we can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether asignificant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode ofstar formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to bequenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate ofthe non-star-forming galaxies on the "red sequence."

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

1303.1183	the impact of starbursts on the circumgalactic medium	we present a study exploring the impact of a starburst on the properties ofthe surrounding circum-galactic medium (cgm): gas located beyond the galaxy'sstellar body and extending out to the virial radius (200 kpc). we obtainedultraviolet spectroscopic data from the cosmic origin spectrograph (cos)probing the cgm of 20 low-redshift foreground galaxies using background qsos.our sample consists of starburst and control galaxies. the latter comprisesnormal star-forming and passive galaxies with similar stellar masses and impactparameters as the starbursts. we used optical spectra from the sloan digitalsky survey(sdss) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferringaverage ages of 200 myrs and burst fractions involving ~10% of their stellarmass. the cos data reveal highly ionized gas traced by civ in 80%(4/5) of thestarburst and in 17%(2/12) of the control sample. the two control galaxies withciv absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiplelow-ionization transitions and strong saturated lyman-alpha lines. theytherefore appear to be physically different systems. we show that the civabsorbers in the starburst cgm represent a significant baryon repository. thehigh detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggeststhat starburst-driven winds can affect the cgm out to radii as large as 200kpc. this is plausible given the inferred properties of the starbursts and theknown properties of starburst-driven winds. this would represent the firstdirect observational evidence of local starbursts impacting the bulk of theirgaseous halos, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kindof feedback in the evolution of galaxies.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1306.0906	evidence for elevated x-ray emission in local lyman break galaxy analogs	in this paper, we study the relationship between the 2-10 kev x-rayluminosity (l_x), assumed to originate from x-ray binaries (xrbs), and starformation rate (sfr) in uv-selected z&lt;0.1 lyman break analogs (lbas). wepresent chandra observations for four new galex-selected lbas. includingpreviously studied lbas, haro 11 and vv 114, we find that lbas demonstratel_x/sfr ratios that are elevated by ~1.5sigma compared to local galaxies,similar to the ratios found for stacked lbgs in the early universe (z&gt;2). weshow that these lbas are unlikely to harbor agn, based on their optical andx-ray spectra and the spatial distribution of the x-rays in three spatiallyextended cases. we expect that high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) dominate thex-ray emission in these galaxies, based on their high specific sfrs(ssfrs=sfr/m* &gt; 10^{-9}/yr), which suggest the prevalence of young stellarpopulations. since both lbas and lbgs have lower dust attenuations andmetallicities compared to similar samples of more typical local galaxies, weinvestigate the effects of dust extinction and metallicity on the l_x/sfr forthe broader population of galaxies with high ssfrs (&gt;10^{-10}/yr). theestimated dust extinctions (corresponding to column densities ofn_h&lt;10^{22}/cm^2) are expected to have insignificant effects on observedl_x/sfr ratio for the majority of galaxy samples. we find that the observedrelationship between l_x/sfr and metallicity appears consistent withtheoretical expectations from x-ray binary population synthesis models.therefore, we conclude that lower metallicities, related to more luminous hmxbssuch as ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs), drive the elevated l_x/sfr observedin our sample of z&lt;0.1 lbas. the relatively metal-poor, active mode of starformation in lbas and distant z&gt;2 lbgs may yield higher total hmxb luminositythan found in typical galaxies in the local universe.

1308.1676	the galex arecibo sdss survey. viii. final data release -- the effect of  group environment on the gas content of massive galaxies	we present the final data release from the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass),a large arecibo program that measured the hi properties for an unbiased sampleof ~800 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun and redshifts0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. this release includes new arecibo observations for 250 galaxies.we use the full gass sample to investigate environmental effects on the coldgas content of massive galaxies at fixed stellar mass. the environment ischaracterized in terms of dark matter halo mass, obtained by cross-matching oursample with the sdss group catalog of yang et al. our analysis provides, forthe first time, clear statistical evidence that massive galaxies located inhalos with masses of 10^13-10^14 msun have at least 0.4 dex less hi thanobjects in lower density environments. the process responsible for thesuppression of gas in group galaxies most likely drives the observed quenchingof the star formation in these systems. our findings strongly support theimportance of the group environment for galaxy evolution, and have profoundimplications for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, which currently donot allow for stripping of the cold interstellar medium in galaxy groups.

1309.0653	maximizing kepler science return per telemetered pixel: detailed models  of the focal plane in the two-wheel era	kepler's immense photometric precision to date was maintained throughsatellite stability and precise pointing. in this white paper, we argue thatimage modeling--fitting the kepler-downlinked raw pixel data--can vastlyimprove the precision of kepler in pointing-degraded two-wheel mode. we arguethat a non-trivial modeling effort may permit continuance of photometry at10-ppm-level precision. we demonstrate some baby steps towards precise modelsin both data-driven (flexible) and physics-driven (interpretably parameterized)modes. we demonstrate that the expected drift or jitter in positions in thetwo-weel era will help with constraining calibration parameters. in particular,we show that we can infer the device flat-field at higher than pixelresolution; that is, we can infer pixel-to-pixel variations in intra-pixelsensitivity. these results are relevant to almost any scientific goal for therepurposed mission; image modeling ought to be a part of any two-wheelrepurpose for the satellite. we make other recommendations for kepleroperations, but fundamentally advocate that the project stick with its coremission of finding and characterizing earth analogs.

0804.1123	probing shock breakout with serendipitous galex detections of two snls  type ii-p supernovae	we report the serendipitous detection by galex of fast (&lt;1 day) rising (&gt;1mag) uv emission from two type ii plateau (ii-p) supernovae (sne) at z=0.185and 0.324 discovered by the supernova legacy survey. optical photometry and vltspectroscopy 2 weeks after the galex detections link the onset of uv emissionto the time of shock breakout. using radiation hydrodynamics and non-lteradiative transfer simulations, and starting from a standard red supergiant(rsg; type ii-p sn progenitor) star evolved self-consistently from the mainsequence to iron core collapse, we model the shock breakout phase and the 55 hrthat follow. the small scale height of our rsg atmosphere model suggests thatthe breakout signature is a thermal soft x-ray burst (lambda_peak ~ 90\aa) witha duration of &lt;~ 2000 s. longer durations are possible but require either anextended and tenuous non-standard envelope, or an unusually dense rsg wind with\dot{m} ~ 10^(-3) msun yr^(-1). the galex observations miss the peak of theluminous (m_fuv ~ -20) uv burst but unambiguously capture the rise of theemission and a subsequent 2 day long plateau. the postbreakout, uv-brightplateau is a prediction of our model in which the shift of the peak of thespectral energy distribution (sed) from ~100 to ~1000\aa and the ejectaexpansion both counteract the decrease in bolometric luminosity from ~10^11 to~10^9 l_sun over that period. based on the observed detection efficiency of ourstudy we make predictions for the breakout detection rate of the galex timedomain survey.

1507.04779	from cosmic birth to living earths: the future of uvoir space astronomy	for the first time in history, humans have reached the point where it ispossible to construct a revolutionary space-based observatory that has thecapability to find dozens of earth-like worlds, and possibly some with signs oflife. this same telescope, designed as a long-lived facility, would alsoproduce transformational scientific advances in every area of astronomy andastrophysics from black hole physics to galaxy formation, from star and planetformation to the origins of the solar system. the association of universitiesfor research in astronomy (aura) commissioned a study on a next-generationuvoir space observatory with the highest possible scientific impact in the erafollowing jwst. this community-based study focuses on the future space-basedoptions for uv and optical astronomy that significantly advance ourunderstanding of the origin and evolution of the cosmos and the life within it.the committee concludes that a space telescope equipped with a 12-meter classprimary mirror can find and characterize dozens of earth-like planets and makefundamental advances across nearly all fields of astrophysics. the concept iscalled the high definition space telescope (hdst). the telescope would belocated at the sun-earth l2 point and would cover a spectral range that, at aminimum, runs from 0.1 to 2 microns. unlike jwst, hdst will not need to operateat cryogenic temperatures. hdst can be made to be serviceable on orbit but doesnot require servicing to complete its primary scientific objectives. we presentthe scientific and technical requirements for hdst and show that it could allowus to determine whether or not life is common outside the solar system. we donot propose a specific design for such a telescope, but show that designing,building and funding such a facility is feasible beginning in the next decade -if the necessary strategic investments in technology begin now.

1509.04301	relativistic boost as the cause of periodicity in a massive black-hole  binary candidate	because most large galaxies contain a central black hole, and galaxies oftenmerge, black-hole binaries are expected to be common in galactic nuclei.although they cannot be imaged, periodicities in the light curves of quasarshave been interpreted as evidence for binaries, most recently in pg~1302-102,with a short rest-frame optical period of 4 years. if the orbital periodmatches this value, then for the range of estimated black hole masses thecomponents would be separated by 0.007-0.017 pc, implying relativistic orbitalspeeds. there has been much debate over whether black hole orbits could besmaller than 1 pc. here we show that the amplitude and the sinusoid-like shapeof the variability of pg~1302-102 can be fit by relativistic doppler boostingof emission from a compact, steadily accreting, unequal-mass binary. we predictthat brightness variations in the ultraviolet light curve track those in theoptical, but with a 2-3 times larger amplitude. this prediction is relativelyinsensitive to the details of the emission process, and is consistent witharchival uv data. follow-up uv and optical observations in the next few yearscan test this prediction and confirm the existence of a binary black hole inthe relativistic regime.

astro-ph;0411302	the galaxy evolution explorer: a space ultraviolet survey mission	we give an overview of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex), a nasa explorermission launched on april 28, 2003. galex is performing the first space uvsky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750angstroms and 1750-2750 angstroms). the surveys include an all-sky imagingsurvey (m[ab] ~ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[ab] ~23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[ab] ~ 25), and a nearbygalaxy survey. spectroscopic grism surveys (r=100-200) are underway withvarious depths and sky coverage. many targets overlap existing or plannedsurveys. we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies, along withcorollary observations, to calibrate the uv-global star formation raterelationship in local galaxies. we will apply this calibration to distantgalaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map thehistory of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. the galex missionincludes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programsmade possible by the first uv sky survey.

astro-ph;0411319	uv emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we present the first galex uv images of the well known interacting group ofgalaxies, stephan's quintet (sq). we detect widespread uv emission throughoutthe group. however, there is no consistent coincidence between uv structure andemission in the optical, h\alpha, or hi. excluding the foreground galaxyngc7320 (sd), most of the uv emission is found in regions associated with thetwo spiral members of the group, ngc7319 and ngc7318b, and the intragroupmedium starburst sq-a. the extinction corrected uv data are analyzed toinvestigate the overall star formation activity in sq. it is found that thetotal star formation rate (sfr) of sq is 6.69+-0.65 m_\sun/yr. among this,1.34+-0.16 m_sun/yr is due to sq-a. this is in excellent agreement with thatderived from extinction corrected h\alpha luminosity of sq-a. the sfr inregions related to ngc 7319 is 1.98+-0.58 m_\sun/yr, most of which(68%) iscontributed by the disk. the contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. inthe uv, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-likestructure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic hii regions recentlydiscovered in h\alpha, and other uv emission regions discovered for the firsttime. the uv and optical colors of the 'old tail' are consistent with a singlestellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. the uv emission associated withngc 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net sfr of 3.37+-0.25m_sun/yr. several large uv emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from thenucleus of ngc7318b. although both ngc7319 and ngc7318b show peculiar uvmorphology, their sfr is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies,indicating that the strength of star formation activity is not enhenced byinteractions.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0504489	the galex ultraviolet variability (guvv) catalog	we present version 1.0 of the nasa galaxy evolution explorer (galex)ultraviolet variability catalog (guvv) that contains information on 84time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and farultraviolet photometric observations. these time-variable sources wereserendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently beingsurveyed by the galex satellite in two ultraviolet bands (nuv 1750-2750a, fuv1350-1750a) with limiting ab magnitudes of 23-25. the largest-amplitudevariable objects presently detected by galex are m-dwarf flare stars, which canbrighten by 5-10 mag in both the nuv and fuv bands during short duration (&lt;500s) outbursts. other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objectsinclude ab-type rr lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in thegalex fuv band. this first guvv catalog lists galactic positions and possiblesource identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with alist of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at otherwavelengths. we expect the total number of time-variable source detections toincrease as the galex mission progresses, such that later version numbers ofthe guvv catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.

astro-ph;0507396	galex observations of an energetic ultraviolet flare on the dm4e star gj  3685a	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite has obtained high timeresolution ultraviolet photometry during a large flare on the m4 dwarf star gj3685a. simultaneous nuv (1750 - 2800a) and fuv (1350 - 1750a) time-taggedphotometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overallbrightness in the fuv band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. under theassumption that the nuv emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and thatthe fuv flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, then thereis evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. the first flaretype is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or noincrease in temperature. the other involves rapid increases in both temperatureand flux. while the decay time for the first flare component may be severalhours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting thatthere was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.

astro-ph;0604058	uv and fir selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and  overlaps	we study two samples of local galaxies, one is uv (galex) selected and theother fir (iras) selected, to address the question whether uv and fir surveyssee the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the samepopulation of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.no significant difference between the l$_{tot}$ ($=l_{60}+l_{fuv}$) luminosityfunctions of the uv and fir samples is found. also, after the correction forthe `malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the fir-to-uv ratio v.s.l$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. in therange of $9 \la \log(l_{tot}/l_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by asimple linear relation of $\log (l_{60}/l_{fuv})=\log(l_{tot}/l_\sun)-9.66$.these are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent thesame population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differencesin l$_{tot}$ and in fir-to-uv ratio are due only to the selection effect. acomparison between the uv luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for apopulation of faint uv galaxies missing in the fir selected sample. thecontribution from these 'fir-quiet' galaxies to the overall uv population isinsignificant, given that the k-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellarmass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.

astro-ph;0604557	minkowski's object: a starburst triggered by a radio jet, revisited	we present neutral hydrogen, ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging,and optical spectroscopy, of minkowski's object (mo), a star forming peculiargalaxy near ngc 541. the observations strengthen evidence that star formationin mo was triggered by the radio jet from ngc 541. key new results are thediscovery of a 4.9e8 solar mass double hi cloud straddling the radio jetdownstream from mo, where the jet changes direction and decollimates; strongdetections of mo, also showing double structure, in uv and h-alpha; andnumerous hii regions and associated clusters in mo. in uv, mo resembles theradio-aligned, rest-frame uv morphologies in many high redshift radio galaxies(hzrgs), also thought to be caused by jet-induced star formation. mo's stellarpopulation is dominated by a 7.5 myr-old, 1.9e7 solar mass instantaneous burst,with current star formation rate 0.52 solar masses per year (concentratedupstream from where the hi column density is high). this is unlike thejet-induced star formation in centaurus a, where the jet interacts withpre-existing cold gas; in mo the hi may have cooled out of a warmer, clumpyintergalactic or interstellar medium as a result of jet interaction, followedby collapse of the cooling clouds and subsequent star formation (consistentwith numerical simulations). since the radio source that triggered starformation in mo is much less luminous, and therefore more common, than powerfulhzrgs, and because the environment around mo is not particularly special interms of abundant dense, cold gas, jet-induced star formation in the earlyuniverse might be even more prevalent than previously thought.

astro-ph;0605328	the detection of m-dwarf uv flare events in the galex data archives	we present the preliminary results from implementing a new software tool thatenables inspection of time-tagged photon data for the astronomical sourcescontained within individual galex ultraviolet images of the sky. we haveinspected the photon data contained within 1802 galex images to reveal rapid,short-term (&lt;500 sec) uv source variability in the form of stellar flares. themean associated change in nuv magnitude due to this flaring activity is2.7+/-0.3 mag. a list of 49 new uv variable-star candidates is presented,together with their associated sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometricmagnitudes. from these data we can associate the main source of these uv flareevents with magnetic activity on m-dwarf stars. photometric parallaxes havebeen determined for 32 of these sources, placing them at distances ranging fromapproximately 25 to 1000pc. the average uv flare energy for these flare eventsis 2.5e30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of u-band, x-ray and euvflares observed on many local m-dwarf stars. we have found that stars ofclasses m0 to m5 flare with energies spanning a far larger range and with anenergy approximately 5 times greater than those of later (m6 to m8) spectraltype.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

0706.0003	infrared spectral energy distributions of z~0.7 star-forming galaxies	we analyze the infrared (ir) spectral energy distributions (seds) for10micron &lt; lambda(rest) &lt; 100micron for ~600 galaxies at z~0.7 in the extendedchandra deep field south by stacking their spitzer 24, 70 and 160micron images.we place interesting constraints on the average ir sed shape in two bins: thebrightest 25% of z~0.7 galaxies detected at 24micron, and the remaining 75% ofindividually-detected galaxies. galaxies without individual detections at24micron were not well-detected at 70micron and 160micron even throughstacking. we find that the average ir seds of z~0.7 star-forming galaxies fallwithin the diversity of z~0 templates. while dust obscuration lir/luv seems tobe only a function of star formation rate (sfr; ~ lir+luv), not of redshift,the dust temperature of star-forming galaxies (with sfr ~ 10 solar mass peryear) at a given ir luminosity was lower at z~0.7 than today. we suggest aninterpretation of this phenomenology in terms of dust geometry: intenselystar-forming galaxies at z~0 are typically interacting, and host densecentrally-concentrated bursts of star formation and warm dust temperatures. atz~0.7, the bulk of intensely star-forming galaxies are relatively undisturbedspirals and irregulars, and we postulate that they have large amounts ofwidespread lower-density star formation, yielding lower dust temperatures for agiven ir luminosity. we recommend what ir seds are most suitable for modelingintermediate redshift galaxies with different sfrs.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
