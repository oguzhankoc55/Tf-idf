0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0906.4786	the evolving relations between size, mass, surface density, and star  formation in 3x10^4 galaxies since z=2	the presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z&gt;2 presents a majorchallenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. using oneof the deepest large public near-ir surveys to date, we investigate in detailthe correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size,stellar mass, and surface density) from z=2 to the present. at all redshifts,massive quiescent galaxies (i.e. those with little or no star formation) occupythe extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tightmass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of bothdensities and sizes. conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densitiescomprise a nearly-homogeneous population with little or no ongoing starformation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star-formation rates andvarying levels of dust obscuration. both the sizes and surface densities ofquiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z=2-0; we parameterize this evolutionfor both populations with simple power law functions and present best-fitparameters for comparison to future theoretical models. higher-mass quiescentgalaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results.interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at ratessimilar to those of quiescent galaxies. it is therefore possible that the samephysical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations,suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this sizeevolution.

0909.0111	a spatially resolved map of the kinematics, star-formation and stellar  mass assembly in a star-forming galaxy at z=4.9	we present a detailed study of the spatially resolved kinematics,star-formation and stellar mass in a highly amplified galaxy at z=4.92 behindthe lensing cluster ms1358+62. we use the observed optical, near- andmid-infrared imaging from hst acs &amp; nicmos and spitzer irac to derive thestellar mass and the gemini/nifs ifu to investigate the velocity structure ofthe galaxy from the nebular [oii] emission. using a detailed gravitational lensmodel, we account for lensing amplification factor 12.+/-2.0 and find that thisintrinsically l* galaxy has a stellar mass of m*=7+/-2x10^8mo, a dynamical massof mdyn=3+/-1x10^9csc^2(i)mo (within of 2kpc) and a star-formation rate of42+/-8mo/yr. the source-plane uv/optical morphology of this galaxy is dominatedby five discrete star-forming regions. exploiting the dynamical information wederive masses for individual star-forming regions of mcl~10^(8-9)mo with sizesof ~200pc. we find that, at a fixed size, the star-formation rate densitywithin these hii regions is approximately two orders of magnitude greater thanthose observed in local spiral/starburst galaxies, but consistent with the mostmassive hii regions in the local universe such as 30dor. finally, we comparethe spatially resolved nebular emission line velocity with the ly-alpha anduv-ism lines and find that this galaxy is surrounded by a galactic scaleoutflow in which the ly-alpha appears redshifted by ~150km/s and the uv-ismlines blue-shifted by -200km/s from the (systemic) nebular emission. thevelocity structure of the outflow mirrors that of the nebular emissionsuggesting the outflow is young (~15myr), and has yet to burst out of thesystem. taken together, these results suggest that this young galaxy isundergoing its first major epoch of mass assembly.

0909.5182	how massive are massive compact galaxies?	using a sample of nine massive compact galaxies at z ~ 2.3 with rest-frameoptical spectroscopy and comprehensive u through 8um photometry we investigatehow assumptions in sed modeling change the stellar mass estimates of thesegalaxies, and how this affects our interpretation of their size evolution. theseds are fit to tau-models with a range of metallicities, dust laws, as well asdifferent stellar population synthesis codes. these models indicate massesequal to, or slightly smaller than our default masses. the maximum differenceis 0.16 dex for each parameter considered, and only 0.18 dex for the mostextreme combination of parameters. two-component populations with a maximallyold stellar population superposed with a young component provide reasonablefits to these seds using the models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003); however, usingmodels with updated treatment of tp-agb stars the fits are poorer. thetwo-component models predict masses that are 0.08 to 0.22 dex larger than thetau-models. we also test the effect of a bottom-light imf and find that itwould reduce the masses of these galaxies by 0.3 dex. considering the range ofallowable masses from the tau-models, two-component fits, and imf, we concludethat on average these galaxies lie below the mass-size relation of galaxies inthe local universe by a factor of 3-9, depending on the sed models used.

0704.1760	galaxy evolution and environment	the properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with their environment,with red galaxies dominating galaxy clusters and blue galaxies dominating thegeneral field. however, not all field galaxies are young: studies of thecolors, line strengths, and m/l ratios of massive early-type galaxies at0&lt;z&lt;1.3 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about theirsurroundings, and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment.there is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longerin the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of alreadyold galaxies. these results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxyformation models, which incorporate agn feedback to suppress star formation inthe most massive halos. systematic studies of the relation of galaxies withtheir environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory.intriguingly both the deep2 and vvds surveys find that the color-densityrelation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where bothsurveys become highly incomplete. on the other hand, clustering studies atz~2.5 have shown that red galaxies cluster more strongly than blue galaxies,implying that the color-density relation was already in place at that redshift.

1003.1706	z~7 galaxy candidates from nicmos observations over the hdf south and  the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields	we use ~88 arcmin**2 of deep (&gt;~26.5 mag at 5 sigma) nicmos data over the twogoods fields and the hdf south to conduct a search for bright z&gt;~7 galaxycandidates. this search takes advantage of an efficient preselection over 58arcmin**2 of nicmos h-band data where only plausible z&gt;~7 candidates arefollowed up with nicmos j-band observations. ~248 arcmin**2 of deepground-based near-infrared data (&gt;~25.5 mag, 5 sigma) is also considered in thesearch. in total, we report 15 z-dropout candidates over this area -- 7 ofwhich are new to these search fields. two possible z~9 j-dropout candidates arealso found, but seem unlikely to correspond to z~9 galaxies. the present z~9search is used to set upper limits on the prevalence of such sources. rigoroustesting is undertaken to establish the level of contamination of our selectionsby photometric scatter, low mass stars, supernovae (sne), and spurious sources.the estimated contamination rate of our z~7 selection is ~24%. through carefulsimulations, the effective volume available to our z&gt;~7 selections is estimatedand used to establish constraints on the volume density of luminous (l*(z=3),or -21 mag) galaxies from these searches. we find that the volume density ofluminous star-forming galaxies at z~7 is 13_{-5}^{+8}x lower than at z~4 and&gt;25x lower (1 sigma) at z~9 than at z~4. this is the most stringent constraintyet available on the volume density of &gt;~l* galaxies at z~9. the presentwide-area, multi-field search limits cosmic variance to &lt;20%. the evolution wefind at the bright end of the uv lf is similar to that found from recent subarusuprime-cam, hawk-i or ers wfc3/ir searches. the present paper also includes acomplete summary of our final z~7 z-dropout sample (18 candidates) identifiedfrom all nicmos observations to date (over the two goods fields, the hudf,galaxy clusters).

1003.3479	well-sampled far-infrared spectral energy distributions of z ~ 2  galaxies: evidence for scaled up cool galaxies	we present an analysis of the far-infrared (fir) spectral energydistributions (seds) of two massive k-selected galaxies at z = 2.122 and z =2.024 detected at 24um, 70um, 160um by spitzer, 250um, 350um, 500um by blast,and 870um by apex. the large wavelength range of these observations and theavailability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify thepeak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um. the seds of bothgalaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies withl_ir ~ 10^{11} l_{sun} -- 10^{12} l_{sun} yet both galaxies have l_{ir} ~10^{13} l_{sun}. this suggests that these galaxies are not high redshiftanalogues of the hyper-lirgs/ulirgs used in local templates, but are instead"scaled up" versions of local ulirgs/lirgs. for both galaxies the starformation rate determined from the best-fit fir seds (sfr(l_{ir})) agrees withthe sfr determined from the dust corrected h-alpha luminosity (sfr(h-alpha)) towithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the sfr of these galaxies is estimatedusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependenttemplate method (sfr(24um)), it systematically overestimates the sfr by as muchas a factor of 6. a larger sample of 24 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3 drawnfrom the kriek et al. (2008) gnirs sample shows the same trend betweensfr(24um) and sfr(h-alpha). using that sample we show that sfr(24um) andsfr(h-alpha) are in better agreement when sfr(24um) is estimated using the logaverage of local templates rather than selecting a single luminosity-dependenttemplate, because this incorporates lower luminosity templates. the betteragreement between sfrs from lower luminosity templates suggests that the firseds of the blast-detected galaxies may be typical for massive galaxies at z ~2, and that the majority are scaled up versions of lower luminosity localgalaxies.

1008.4357	the spectral energy distribution of post-starburst galaxies in the  newfirm medium-band survey: a low contribution from tp-agb stars	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are a key ingredient of many galaxyevolution studies. unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated forcertain stellar evolution stages. of particular concern is the treatment of thethermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase, as differentimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as tp-agb stars arethought to be most prominently visible during this phase. here, we usepost-starburst galaxies in the newfirm medium-band survey to assess differentsps models. the available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous andwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0, from which weconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (sed) over therange 1200-40 000 angstrom. the sed is well-fit by the bruzual &amp; charlot spsmodels, while the maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical andnear-infrared parts of the sed simultaneously. when the fitting is restrictedto lambda &lt; 6000 angstrom, the maraston models overpredict the near-infraredluminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to tp-agb stars.using the flexible sps models by conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,we find that the contribution of tp-agb stars to the integrated sed is a factorof ~3 lower than predicted by the latest padova tp-agb models. whether this isdue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dustobscuration of tp-agb stars remains to be addressed. altogether, our datademand a low contribution from tp-agb stars to the sed of post-starburstgalaxies.

1009.5992	a substantial population of low mass stars in luminous elliptical  galaxies	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the mass distribution ofstars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for manyareas of astrophysics. the imf is reasonably well constrained in the disk ofthe milky way but we have very little direct information on the form of the imfin other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. here we investigate the stellarmass function in elliptical galaxies by measuring the strength of the na idoublet and the wing-ford molecular feh band in their spectra. these lines arestrong in stars with masses &lt;0.3 msun and weak or absent in all other types ofstars. we unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previousstudies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. the directdetection of the light of low mass stars implies that they are very abundant inelliptical galaxies, making up &gt;80% of the total number of stars andcontributing &gt;60% of the total stellar mass. we infer that the imf in massivestar-forming galaxies in the early universe produced many more low mass starsthan the imf in the milky way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than thesalpeter form in the mass range 0.1 - 1 msun.

0709.0946	the warm spitzer mission: prospects for studies of the distant universe	irac excels at detecting distant objects. due to a combination of the shapesof the spectral energy distributions of galaxies and the low backgroundachieved from space, irac reaches greater depth in comparable exposure time at3.6 and 4.5 micron than any ground- or space-based facility currently can at2.2 micron. furthermore, the longer wavelengths probed by irac enable studiesof the rest-frame optical and near-infrared light of galaxies and agn to muchhigher redshift than is possible from the ground. this white paper explores themerits of different survey strategies for studying the distant universe duringthe warm mission. a three-tiered approach serves a wide range of science goalsand uses the spacecraft effectively: 1) an ultra-deep survey of ~0.04 squaredegrees to a depth of ~250 hrs (in conjunction with an hst/wfc3 program), tostudy the universe at 7&lt;z&lt;14; 2) a survey of ~2 square degrees to the goodsdepth of 20 hrs, to identify luminous galaxies at z&gt;6 and characterize therelation between the build-up of dark matter halos and their constituentgalaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;6, and 3) a 500 square degree survey to the swire depth of 120s, to systematically study large scale structure at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and characterize highredshift agn. one or more of these programs could conceivably be implemented bythe ssc, following the example of the hubble deep field campaigns. aspriorities in this field continuously shift it is also crucial that a fractionof the exposure time remains unassigned, thus enabling science that willreflect the frontiers of 2010 and beyond rather than those of 2007.

1102.3431	confirmation of enhanced dwarf-sensitive absorption features in the  spectra of massive elliptical galaxies: further evidence for a non-universal  initial mass function	we recently found that massive cluster elliptical galaxies have strong na i8183,8195 and feh 9916 wing-ford band absorption, indicating the presence of avery large population of stars with masses &lt;~ 0.3 m_sun. here we test thisresult by comparing the elliptical galaxy spectra to those of luminous globularclusters associated with m31. these globular clusters have similarmetallicities, abundance ratios and ages as massive elliptical galaxies buttheir low dynamical mass-to-light ratios rule out steep stellar initial massfunctions (imfs). from high quality keck spectra we find that thedwarf-sensitive absorption lines in globular clusters are significantly weakerthan in elliptical galaxies, and consistent with normal imfs. the differencesin the na i and wing-ford indices are 0.027 +- 0.007 mag and 0.017 +- 0.006 magrespectively. we directly compare the two classes of objects by subtracting theaveraged globular cluster spectrum from the averaged elliptical galaxyspectrum. the difference spectrum is well fit by the difference between astellar population synthesis model with a bottom-heavy imf and one with abottom-light imf. we speculate that the slope of the imf may vary with velocitydispersion, although it is not yet clear what physical mechanism would beresponsible for such a relation.

1102.4330	the faint stellar halos of massive red galaxies from stacks of more than  42000 sdss lrg images	we study the properties of massive galaxies at an average redshift of z~0.34through stacking more than 42000 images of luminous red galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey. this is the largest dataset ever used for such an analysisand it allows us to explore the outskirts of massive red galaxies atunprecedented physical scales. our image stacks extend farther than 400 kpc,where the r-band profile surface brightness reaches 30 mag arcsec-2. thisanalysis confirms that the stellar bodies of luminous red galaxies follow asimple sersic profile out to 100 kpc. at larger radii the profiles deviate fromthe best-fit sersic models and exhibit extra light in the g, r, i and z-bandstacks. this excess light can probably be attributed to unresolved intragroupor intracluster light or a change in the light profile itself. we further showthat standard analyses of sdss-depth images typically miss 20% of the totalstellar light and underestimate the size of lrgs by 10% compared to our bestfit r-band sersic model of n=5.5 and r_e=13.1 kpc. if the excess light at r&gt;100kpc is considered to be part of the galaxy, the best fit r-band sersicparameters are n=5.8 and r_e=13.6 kpc. in addition we study the radiallydependent stack ellipticity and find an increase with radius from e=0.25 atr=10 kpc to e=0.3 at r=100 kpc. this provides support that the stellar lightthat we trace out to at least 100 kpc is physically associated with thegalaxies themselves and may confirm that the halos of individual lrgs havehigher ellipticities than their central parts. lastly we show that thebroadband color gradients of the stacked images are flat beyond roughly 40 kpc,suggesting that the stellar populations do not vary significantly with radiusin the outer parts of massive ellipticals.

0710.0875	evidence of cosmic evolution of the stellar initial mass function	theoretical arguments and indirect observational evidence suggest that thestellar initial mass function (imf) may evolve with time, such that it is moreweighted toward high mass stars at higher redshift. here we test this idea bycomparing the rate of luminosity evolution of massive early-type galaxies inclusters at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.83 to the rate of their color evolution. a combined fit tothe rest-frame u-v color evolution and the previously measured evolution of them/l_b ratio gives x~-0.3 for the logarithmic slope of the imf in the regionaround 1 solar mass, flatter than the present-day value in the milky way diskof x=1.3. the best-fitting luminosity-weighted formation redshift of the starsin massive cluster galaxies is ~3.7, and a possible interpretation is that thecharacteristic mass m_c had a value of ~2 solar masses at z~4 (compared tom_c~0.1 solar masses today), in qualitative agreement with models in which thecharacteristic mass is a function of the jeans mass in molecular clouds. such a``bottom-light'' imf for massive cluster galaxies has significant implicationsfor the interpretation of measurements of galaxy formation and evolution.applying a simple form of imf evolution to literature data, we find that thevolume-averaged star formation rate at high redshift may have beenoverestimated (by a factor of 3-4 at z&gt;4), and the cosmic star formationhistory may have a fairly well-defined peak at z~1.5. the m/l_v ratios ofgalaxies are less affected than their star formation rates, and future data onthe stellar mass density at z&gt;3 will provide further constraints on imfevolution. the formal errors likely underestimate the uncertainties, andconfirmation of thes results requires a larger sample of clusters and theinclusion of redder rest-frame colors in the analysis.

1109.0007	counting low-mass stars in integrated light	low-mass stars (m&lt;0.4msun) are thought to comprise the bulk of the stellarmass of galaxies but they constitute only of order a percent of the bolometricluminosity of an old stellar population. directly estimating the number oflow-mass stars from integrated flux measurements of old stellar systems istherefore possible but very challenging given the numerous variables that canaffect the light at the percent level. here we present a new populationsynthesis model created specifically for the purpose of measuring the low-massinitial mass function (imf) down to ~0.1msun for metal-rich stellar populationswith ages in the range 3-13.5 gyr. our fiducial model is based on the synthesisof three separate isochrones and a combination of optical and near-ir empiricalstellar libraries in order to produce integrated light spectra over thewavelength interval 0.35mu&lt;lambda&lt;2.4mu at a resolving power of r~2000. newsynthetic stellar atmospheres and spectra have been computed in order to modelthe spectral variations due to changes in individual elemental abundancesincluding c, n, na, mg, si, ca, ti, fe, and generic alpha elements. wedemonstrate the power of combining blue spectral features with surfacegravity-sensitive near-ir features in order to simultaneously constrain thelow-mass imf, stellar population age, metallicity, and abundance pattern fromintegrated light measurements. finally, we show that the shape of the low-massimf can also be directly constrained by employing a suite of surfacegravity-sensitive spectral features, each of which is most sensitive to aparticular mass interval.

1112.2691	first results from z-fourge: discovery of a candidate cluster at z = 2.2  in cosmos	we report the first results from the z-fourge survey: the discovery of acandidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensitieswith red galaxies detected at &gt;20{\sigma} above the mean surface density. thediscovery was made possible by a new deep (ks &lt; 24.8 ab 5{\sigma})magellan/fourstar near-ir imaging survey with 5 custom medium-bandwidthfilters. the filters pinpoint the location of the balmer/4000\aa\ break inevolved stellar populations at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, yielding significantly moreaccurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. theoverdensities are within 1' of each other in the cosmos field and appear to beembedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additionaloverdensity (\sim10{\sigma}). considering the global properties of theoverdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of agalaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. a comparison to a large{\lambda}cdm simulation suggests that the system may consist of mergingsubclusters, with properties in between those of z &gt; 2 protoclusters with morediffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusterswith prominent red sequences. the structure is completely absent in publicoptical catalogs in cosmos and only weakly visible in a shallower near-irsurvey. the discovery showcases the potential of deep near-ir surveys withmedium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxyevolution at z &gt; 1.5.

1112.3655	the gemini cluster astrophysics spectroscopic survey (gclass): the role  of environment and self-regulation in galaxy evolution at z ~ 1	we evaluate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxy propertiesat 0.85 &lt; z &lt; 1.20 using a 3.6um-selected spectroscopic sample of 797 clusterand field galaxies drawn from the gclass survey. we confirm that for galaxieswith logm* &gt; 9.3 the well-known correlations between environment and propertiessuch as star-forming fraction (f_sf), sfr, ssfr, d(4000), and color are alreadyin place at z ~ 1. we separate the effects of environment and stellar mass ongalaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies atfixed environment, and fixed stellar mass. the ssfr of star-forming galaxies atfixed environment is correlated with stellar mass; however, at fixed stellarmass it is independent of environment. the same trend exists for the d(4000)measures of both the star-forming and quiescent galaxies and shows that theirproperties are determined primarily by their stellar mass, not by theirenvironment. instead, it appears that environment's primary role is to controlthe fraction of star-forming galaxies. using the spectra we identify candidatepoststarburst galaxies and find that those with 9.3 &lt; logm* &lt; 10.7 are 3.1 +/-1.1 times more common in high-density regions compared to low-density regions.the clear association of poststarbursts with high-density regions as well asthe lack of a correlation between the ssfrs and d(4000)s of star-forminggalaxies with their environment suggests that at z ~ 1 theenvironmental-quenching timescale must be rapid. lastly, we construct a simplequenching model which demonstrates that the lack of a correlation between thed(4000) of quiescent galaxies and their environment results naturally if selfquenching dominates over environmental quenching at z &gt; 1, or if the evolutionof the self-quenching rate mirrors the evolution of the environmental-quenchingrate at z &gt; 1, regardless of which dominates.

1203.1317	a nearby analog of z~2 compact quiescent galaxies with a rotating disk	recent studies have identified a population of compact quiescent galaxies atz\sim2. these galaxies are very rare today and establishing the existence of anearby analog could allow us to study its structure in greater detail than ispossible at high redshift. here we present such a local analog, ngc 5845, whichhas a dynamical mass of m_dyn = 4.3\pm0.6\times10^10 m_sun and an effectiveradius of only r_e = 0.45\pm0.05kpc. we study the structure and kinematics withhst/wfpc2 data and previously published spatially resolved kinematics. we findthat ngc 5845 is similar to compact quiescent galaxies at z\sim2 in terms ofsize versus dynamical mass (r_e-m_dyn), effective velocity dispersion versussize (sigma_e-r_e), and effective velocity dispersion versus dynamical mass(sigma_e-m_dyn). the galaxy has a prominent rotating disk evident in both thephotometry and the kinematics: it extends to well beyond \geq1/3 effectiveradius and contribute to \geq1/4 of the total light of the galaxy. our resultslend support to the idea that a fraction of z\sim2 compact galaxies haveprominent disks and positive mass-to-light ratio gradients, although we cautionthat ngc 5845 may have had a different formation history than the more massivecompact quiescent galaxies at z\sim2.

1204.2829	3d-hst: a wide-field grism spectroscopic survey with the hubble space  telescope	we present 3d-hst, a near-infrared spectroscopic treasury program with thehubble space telescope for studying the processes that shape galaxies in thedistant universe. 3d-hst provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of~7000 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, the epoch when 60% of all star formation took place,the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars,and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged.3d-hst will cover 3/4 (625 sq.arcmin) of the candels survey area with twoorbits of primary wfc3/g141 grism coverage and two to four parallel orbits withthe acs/g800l grism. in the ir these exposure times yield a continuumsignal-to-noise of ~5 per resolution element at h~23.1 and a 5sigma emissionline sensitivity of 5x10-17 erg/s/cm2 for typical objects, improving by afactor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. thewfc3/g141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1-1.6 um at aspatial resolution of ~0."13, which, combined with their depth, makes them aunique resource for studying galaxy evolution. we present the preliminaryreduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission line andredshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra andphotometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. the present analysisyields redshift estimates with a precision of sigma(z)=0.0034(1+z), orsigma(v)~1000 km/s. we illustrate how the generalized nature of the surveyyields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types ofobjects, including a quasar at z=4.7, quiescent galaxies at z~2, and the mostdistant t-type brown dwarf star known. the candels and 3d-hst surveys combinedwill provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic dataset for studies ofthe 1&lt;z&lt;3.5 universe until the launch of the james webb space telescope.

1205.6471	the stellar initial mass function in early-type galaxies from absorption  line spectroscopy. i. data and empirical trends	the strength of gravity-sensitive absorption lines in the integrated light ofold stellar populations is one of the few direct probes of the stellar initialmass function (imf) outside of the milky way. owing to the advent of fullydepleted ccds with little or no fringing it has recently become possible toobtain accurate measurements of these features. here we present spectracovering the wavelength ranges 0.35 - 0.55 micron and 0.72 - 1.03 micron forthe bulge of m31 and 34 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample, obtainedwith the low resolution imaging spectrometer on keck. the signal-to-noise ratiois &gt;200 per angstrom out to 1 micron, which is sufficient to measuregravity-sensitive features for individual galaxies and to determine how theydepend on other properties of the galaxies. combining the new data withpreviously obtained spectra for globular clusters in m31 and the most massiveelliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster we find that the dwarf-sensitive na idoublet and the feh wing-ford band increase systematically with velocitydispersion, while the giant-sensitive ca ii triplet decreases with dispersion.these trends are consistent with a varying imf, such that galaxies with deeperpotential wells have more dwarf-enriched mass functions. in a companion paper(conroy &amp; van dokkum 2012) we use a comprehensive stellar population synthesismodel to demonstrate that imf effects can be separated from age and abundancevariations and quantify the imf variation among early-type galaxies.

1205.6473	the stellar initial mass function in early-type galaxies from absorption  line spectroscopy. ii. results	the spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth ofinformation regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history,and stellar initial mass function (imf) of the underlying stellar population.using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect ofvariable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high qualityabsorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of m31.these data extend to 1um and they therefore include the imf-sensitive spectralfeatures nai, caii, and feh at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. themodels fit the data well, with typical rms residuals ~1%. strong constraints onthe imf and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (m/l)_stars, are derivedfor individual galaxies. we find that the imf becomes increasingly bottom-heavywith increasing velocity dispersion and [mg/fe]. at the lowest dispersions and[mg/fe] values the derived imf is consistent with the milky way imf, while atthe highest dispersions and [mg/fe] values the derived imf contains morelow-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a salpeter imf. our best-fit(m/l)_stars values do not exceed dynamically-based m/l values. we also applyour models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in m31 andfind an (m/l)_stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a milky way imf,again agreeing with dynamical constraints. we discuss other possibleexplanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the imf isthe simplest and most plausible.

1206.2645	halpha equivalent widths from the 3d-hst survey: evolution with redshift  and dependence on stellar mass	we investigate the evolution of the halpha equivalent width, ew(halpha), withredshift and its dependence on stellar mass, taking advantage of the first datafrom the 3d-hst survey, a large spectroscopic treasury program with the hubblespace telescope wfc3. combining our halpha measurements of 854 galaxies at0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5 with those of ground based surveys at lower and higher redshift, wecan consistently determine the evolution of the ew(halpha) distribution fromz=0 to z=2.2. we find that at all masses the characteristic ew(halpha) isdecreasing towards the present epoch, and that at each redshift the ew(halpha)is lower for high-mass galaxies. we measure a slope of ew(halpha) ~ (1+z)^(1.8)with little mass dependence. qualitatively, this measurement is amodel-independent confirmation of the evolution of star forming galaxies withredshift. a quantitative conversion of ew(halpha) to ssfr is very modeldependent, because of differential reddening corrections between the continuumsed and the balmer lines. the observed ew(halpha) can be reproduced with asimple model in which the sfr for galaxies rises to the epoch of z~2.5 and thendecreases with time to z = 0. the model implies that the ew(halpha) rises to400 a at z=8. the ssfr evolves faster than ew(halpha), as the mass-to-lightratio also evolves with redshift. in this context, we find that the ssfrevolves as (1+z)^(3.2), nearly independent of mass, consistent with previousreddening insensitive estimates. we confirm previous results that the observedslope of the ssfr-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, butmodels and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

1207.7077	large-scale star formation-driven outflows at 1&lt;z&lt;2 in the 3d-hst survey	we present evidence of large-scale outflows from three low-mass(log(m/m_sun)~9.75) star-forming (sfr &gt;4 m_sun/yr) galaxies observed at z=1.24,z=1.35 and z=1.75 in the 3d-hst survey. each of these galaxies is locatedwithin a projected physical distance of 60 kpc around the sight line to thequasar sdss j123622.93+621526.6, which exhibits well-separated strong(w_r&gt;0.8a) mg ii absorption systems matching precisely to the redshifts of thethree galaxies. we derive the star formation surface densities from the h-alphaemission in the wfc3 g141 grism observations for the galaxies and find that ineach case the star formation surface density well-exceeds 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2,the typical threshold for starburst galaxies in the local universe. from asmall but complete parallel census of the 0.65&lt;z&lt;2.6 galaxies with h_140&lt;24proximate to the quasar sight line, we detect mg ii absorption associated withgalaxies extending to physical distances of 130 kpc. we determine that thew_r&gt;0.8a mg ii covering fraction of star-forming galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 may be aslarge as unity on scales extending to at least 60 kpc, providing earlyconstraints on the typical extent of starburst-driven winds around galaxies atthis redshift. our observations additionally suggest that the azimuthaldistribution of w_r&gt;0.4a mg ii absorbing gas around star-forming galaxies mayevolve from z~2 to the present, consistent with recent observations of anincreasing collimation of star formation-driven outflows with time from z~3.

1210.0009	evolution of quiescent and star-forming galaxies since z~1.5 as a  function of their velocity dispersions	we measure stellar masses and structural parameters for 5,500 quiescent and20,000 star-forming galaxies at 0.3&lt;z\leq1.5 in the newfirm medium band surveycosmos and ukidss uds fields. we combine these measurements to infer velocitydispersions and determine how the number density of galaxies at fixed inferreddispersion, or the velocity dispersion function (vdf), evolves with time foreach population. we show that the number of galaxies with high velocitydispersions appears to be surprisingly stable with time, regardless of theirstar formation history. furthermore, the overall vdf for star-forming galaxiesis constant with redshift, extending down to the lowest velocity dispersionsprobed by this study. the only galaxy population showing strong evolution arequiescent galaxies with low inferred dispersions, whose number densityincreases by a factor of ~4 since z=1.5. this build-up leads to an evolution inthe quiescent fraction of galaxies such that the threshold dispersion abovewhich quiescent galaxies dominate the counts moves to lower velocity dispersionwith time. we show that our results are qualitatively consistent with a simplemodel in which star-forming galaxies quench and are added to the quiescentpopulation. in order to compensate for the migration into the quiescentpopulation, the velocity dispersions of star-forming galaxies must increase,with a rate that increases with dispersion.

1210.7236	massive and newly dead: discovery of a significant population of  galaxies with high velocity dispersions and strong balmer lines at z~1.5 from  deep keck spectra and hst/wfc3 imaging	we present deep keck/lris spectroscopy and hst/wfc3 imaging in the rest-frameoptical for a sample of eight galaxies at z~1.5 with highphotometrically-determined stellar masses. the data are combined withvlt/xshooter spectra of five galaxies from van de sande et al. (2011, 2012 tobe submitted). we find that these thirteen galaxies have high velocitydispersions, with a median of sigma=301 km s^{-1}. this high value isconsistent with their relatively high stellar masses and compact sizes. westudy their stellar populations using the strength of balmer absorption lines,which are not sensitive to dust absorption. we find a large range in balmerabsorption strength, with many galaxies showing very strong lines indicatingyoung ages. the median hdelta_a equivalent width, determined directly orinferred from the h10 line, is 5.4 angstroms, indicating a luminosity-weightedage of ~1 gyr. although this value may be biased towards higher values becauseof selection effects,high-dispersion galaxies with such young ages areextremely rare in the local universe. interestingly we do not find a simplecorrelation with rest-frame u-v color: some of the reddest galaxies have verystrong balmer absorption lines. these results demonstrate that manyhigh-dispersion galaxies at z~1.5 were quenched recently. this implies thatthere must be a population of star-forming progenitors at z~2 with highvelocity dispersions or linewidths, which are notoriously absent from co/halphaselected surveys.

1211.0280	a strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy at z ~ 2.4 in  the cosmos/ultravista field	we report the discovery of a massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy that hasbeen strongly-lensed into multiple images by a foreground galaxy at z = 0.960.this system was serendipitously discovered as a set of extremely ks-brighthigh-redshift galaxies with red j - ks colors using new data from theultravista yjhks near-infrared survey. the system was also previouslyidentified as an optically-faint lens/source system using the cosmos acsimaging by faure et al. (2008, 2011). photometric redshifts for the threebrightest images of the source galaxy determined from twenty-seven bandphotometry place the source at z = 2.4 +/- 0.1. we provide an updated lensmodel for the system which is a good fit to the positions and morphologies ofthe galaxies in the acs image. the lens model implies that the magnification ofthe three brightest images is a factor of 4 - 5. we use the lens model,combined with the ks-band image to constrain the size and sersic profile of thegalaxy. the best-fit model is an ultra-compact galaxy (re =0.64^{+0.08}_{-0.18} kpc, lensing-corrected), with a sersic profile that isintermediate between a disk and bulge profile (n = 2.2^{+2.3}_{-0.9}). wepresent aperture photometry for the source galaxy images which have beencorrected for flux contamination from the central lens. the best-fit stellarpopulation model is a massive galaxy (log(m_{star}/m_{sol}) =10.8^{+0.1}_{-0.1}, lensing-corrected) with an age of 1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.4} gyr,moderate dust extinction (av = 0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6}), and a low specific starformation rate (log(ssfr) &lt; -11.0 yr^{-1}). this is typical of massive"red-and-dead" galaxies at this redshift and confirms that this source is thefirst bona fide strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy to bediscovered. we conclude with a discussion of the prospects of finding a largersample of these galaxies.

1301.0320	the radial distribution of star formation in galaxies at z~1 from the  3d-hst survey	the assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their starformation as a function of cosmic time. thanks to the wfc3 grism on hst it isnow possible to measure this beyond the local universe. here we present thespatial distribution of halpha emission for a sample of 54 stronglystar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3d-hst treasury survey. by stacking thehalpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximatelyexponential distributions at z~1, with median sersic index of n=1.0+-0.2. thestacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a=0.58+-0.09 in halpha,consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. keckspectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence forrotation, with inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. the moststraightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation instrongly star-forming galaxies at z~1 generally occurred in disks. the disksappear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they haveew(halpha)~100 angstroms out to the solar orbit and they have star formationsurface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.

1301.0321	strontium and barium in early-type galaxies	the detailed abundance patterns of the stars within galaxies provide a uniquewindow into the history of star formation (sf) at early times. two widely used`chronometers' include the alpha and iron-peak elements, which are created onshort and long timescales, respectively. these two clocks have been widely usedto estimate sf timescales from moderate-resolution spectra of early-typegalaxies. elements formed via s-process neutron captures (e.g., sr and ba)comprise a third type of chronometer, as the site of the main s-process isbelieved to be intermediate and low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. the[alpha/ba] ratio in particular should provide a powerful new constraint on thesf histories of galaxies, in part because it is insensitive to the uncertaindistribution of type ia sne detonation times and the overall ia rate. here wepresent new measurements of the abundance of sr and ba in nearby early-typegalaxies by applying stellar population synthesis tools to high s/n opticalspectra. we find a strong anti-correlation between [mg/fe] and [ba/fe], and astrong positive correlation between [mg/ba] and galaxy velocity dispersion.these trends are consistent with the idea that more massive galaxies formedtheir stars on shorter timescales compared to less massive galaxies, and ruleout several other proposed explanations for the observed super-solar [mg/fe]values in massive galaxies. in contrast, [sr/fe]~0, with no strong variationacross the sample. it is difficult to interpret the sr trends without detailedchemical evolution models owing to the multiplicity of proposed nucleosyntheticsites for sr.

1301.2330	the velocity function of dark matter halos at r=20 kpc: remarkably  little evolution since z ~ 4	we investigate the evolution in the dark matter halo circular velocityfunction, measured at a fixed physical radius of 20 kpc (v_20), which is likelyto be a good proxy for galaxy circular velocity, in the millennium-iisimulation. we find that the v_20 function evolves remarkably little since z ~4. we analyze the histories of the main progenitors of halos, and we find thatthe dark matter distribution within the central 20 kpc of massive halos hasbeen in place since early times. this provides evidence for the inside-outgrowth of haloes. the constancy of the central circular velocity of halos mayoffer a natural explanation for the observational finding that the galaxycircular velocity is an excellent predictor of various galaxy properties. ourresults also indicate that we can expect a significant number of galaxies withhigh circular velocities already at z=4 (more than one per 10^6 (mpc/h)^3 withcircular velocities in excess of 450 km/s, and more than one per 10^4.5(mpc/h)^3 with circular velocities in excess of 350 km/s). finally, addingbaryonic mass and using a simple model for halo adiabatic contraction, we findremarkable agreement with the velocity dispersion functions inferredobservationally by bezanson et al. (2011) up to z ~ 1 and down to about 220km/s.

1302.1195	tracing galaxies through cosmic time with number density selection	a central challenge in observational studies of galaxy formation is how toassociate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. onepromising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density, rather thanfixed luminosity or mass. this method is effective if stellar mass rank orderis broadly conserved through cosmic time. in this paper, we use the guo et al.(2011) semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances thisassumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. specifically,we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare thestellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constantnumber density. the median stellar mass of the descendants increases by afactor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. constant number density selectionreproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities.we show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar massgrowth rates and merging. after applying simple, observationally-basedcorrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex).we conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the mediandescendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. the main uncertainty inthis study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed massevolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of starformation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhatuncertain.

1303.3584	the spatial extent and distribution of star formation in 3d-hst mergers  at z~1.5	we present an analysis of the spatial distribution of star formation in asample of 60 visually identified galaxy merger candidates at z&gt;1. our sample,drawn from the 3d-hst survey, is flux-limited and was selected to have highstar formation rates based on fits of their broad-band, low spatial resolutionspectral energy distributions. it includes plausible pre-merger (close pairs)and post-merger (single objects with tidal features) systems, with totalstellar masses and star formation rates derived from multi-wavelengthphotometry. here we use near-infrared slitless spectra from 3d-hst whichproduce halpha or [oiii] emission line maps as proxies for star-formation maps.this provides a first comprehensive high-resolution, empirical picture of wherestar formation occurred in galaxy mergers at the epoch of peak cosmic starformation rate. we find that detectable star formation can occur in one or bothgalaxy centres, or in tidal tails. the most common case (58%) is that starformation is largely concentrated in a single, compact region, coincident withthe centre of (one of) the merger components. no correlations between starformation morphology and redshift, total stellar mass, or star formation rateare found. a restricted set of hydrodynamical merger simulations betweensimilarly massive and gas-rich objects implies that star formation should bedetectable in both merger components, when the gas fractions of the individualcomponents are the same. this suggests that z~1.5 mergers typically occurbetween galaxies whose gas fractions, masses, and/or star formation rates aredistinctly different from one another.

1308.4132	how dead are dead galaxies? mid-infrared fluxes of quiescent galaxies at  redshift 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5: implications for star formation rates and dust  heating	we investigate the star formation rates of quiescent galaxies at highredshift (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5) using 3d-hst wfc3 grism spectroscopy and spitzermid-infrared data. we select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely useduvj color-color criteria. spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frameoptical and near-ir) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescentgalaxies (ssfr ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). however, sed fitting can miss star formation ifit is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emittedin the mid-infrared. it is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscuredsfrs with a mid-ir indicator. we stack the mips-24um images of quiescentobjects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 andperform aperture photometry. including direct 24um detections, we find ssfr ~10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. these values are higher than those indicated by sedfitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typicalstar forming galaxies. the true sfrs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower,as we show that the mid-ir fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoingstar formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations andcircumstellar dust. our measurements show that star formation quenching is veryefficient at every redshift. the measured sfr values are at z &gt; 1.5 marginallyconsistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass lossfrom evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lowerredshifts.

1310.7582	tracing the mass growth and star formation rate evolution of massive  galaxies from z~6 to z~1 in the hubble ultra-deep field	we present an analysis of $\sim$1500 h160-selected photometric galaxiesdetected to a limiting magnitude of 27.8 in the hudf, using imaging from thehst wfc3/ir camera in combination with archival uv, optical, and nir imaging.we fit photometric redshifts and stellar population estimates for all galaxieswith well-determined spitzer irac fluxes, allowing for the determination of thecumulative mass function within the range $1&lt;z&lt;6$. by selecting samples ofgalaxies at a constant cumulative number density, we explore the co-evolutionof stellar masses and star formation rates from z$\sim$6. we find a steadyincrease in the sfrs of galaxies at constant number density from z$\sim$6 toz$\sim$3. the peak epoch of star formation is found to shift to later times forgalaxies with increasing number densities, in agreement with the expectationsfrom cosmic downsizing. the observed sfrs can fully account for the mass growthto z$\sim$2 amongst galaxies with cumulative number densities greater than10$^{-3.5}$ mpc$^{-3}$. for galaxies with a lower constant number density wefind the observed stellar masses are $\sim$3 times greater than that which maybe accounted for by the observed star formation alone at late times, implyingthat growth from mergers plays an important role at $z&lt;2$. we additionallyobserve a decreasing ssfr, equivalent to approximately one order of magnitude,from z$\sim$6 to z$\sim$2 amongst galaxies with number densities less than10$^{-3.5}$ mpc$^{-3}$ along with significant evidence that at any redshift thessfr is higher for galaxies at higher number density. the combination of thesefindings can qualitatively explain the previous findings of a ssfr plateau athigh redshift. tracing the evolution of the fraction of quiescent galaxies forsamples matched in cumulative number density over this redshift range, we findno unambiguous examples of quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;4$.

1312.4952	a substantial population of massive quiescent galaxies at z~4 from  zfourge	we report the likely identification of a substantial population of massivem~10^11m_sun galaxies at z~4 with suppressed star formation rates (sfrs),selected on rest-frame optical to near-ir colors from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey. the observed spectral energy distributions show pronouncedbreaks, sampled by a set of near-ir medium-bandwidth filters, resulting intightly constrained photometric redshifts. fitting stellar population modelssuggests large balmer/4000aa breaks, relatively old stellar populations, largestellar masses and low sfrs, with a median specific sfr of 2.9+/-1.8 x10^-11/yr. ultradeep herschel/pacs 100micron, 160micron and spitzer/mips24micron data reveal no dust-obscured sfr activity for 15/19 (79%) galaxies.two far-ir detected galaxies are obscured qsos. stacking the far-ir undetectedgalaxies yields no detection, consistent with the sed fit, indicatingindependently that the average specific sfr is at least 10x smaller than oftypical star-forming galaxies at z~4. assuming all far-ir undetected galaxiesare indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8+/-0.7 x 10^-5mpc^-3 to a limitof log10m/m_sun&gt;10.6, which is 10x and 80x lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1.they comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z~4 massive galaxies,suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very highredshift. given the average stellar age of 0.8gyr and stellar mass of0.8x10^11m_sun, the galaxies likely started forming stars before z =5, withsfrs well in excess of 100m_sun/yr, far exceeding that of similarly abundantuv-bright galaxies at z&gt;4. this suggests that most of the star-formation in theprogenitors of quiescent z~4 galaxies was obscured by dust.

1401.5467	first results from the dragonfly telephoto array: the apparent lack of a  stellar halo in the massive spiral galaxy m101	we use a new telescope concept, the dragonfly telephoto array, to study thelow surface brightness outskirts of the spiral galaxy m101. the radial surfacebrightness profile is measured down to mu_g ~ 32 mag/arcsec^2, a depth thatapproaches the sensitivity of star count studies in the local group. we convertsurface brightness to surface mass density using the radial g-r color profile.the mass density profile shows no significant upturn at large radius and iswell-approximated by a simple bulge + disk model out to r = 70 kpc,corresponding to 18 disk scale lengths. fitting a bulge + disk + halo model wefind that the best-fitting halo mass m_halo ~ 1.7 x 10^8 m_sun. the totalstellar mass of m101 is m_tot,* ~ 5.3 x 10^10 msun, and we infer that the halomass fraction f_halo = m_halo / m_tot,* ~ 0.003. this mass fraction is lowerthan that of the milky way (f_halo ~ 0.02) and m31 (f_halo ~ 0.04). all threegalaxies fall below the f_halo - m_tot,* relation predicted by recentcosmological simulations that trace the light of disrupted satellites, withm101's halo mass a factor of ~10 below the median expectation. however, thepredicted scatter in this relation is large, and more galaxies are needed tobetter quantify this possible tension with galaxy formation models. dragonflyis well suited for this project: as integrated-light surface brightness isindependent of distance, large numbers of galaxies can be studied in a uniformway.

1401.5473	ultra low surface brightness imaging with the dragonfly telephoto array	we describe the dragonfly telephoto array, a robotic imaging system optimizedfor the detection of extended ultra low surface brightness structures. thearray consists of eight canon 400mm f/2.8 telephoto lenses coupled to eightscience-grade commercial ccd cameras. the lenses are mounted on a commonframework and are co-aligned to image simultaneously the same position on thesky. the system provides an imaging capability equivalent to a 0.4m aperturef/1.0 refractor with a 2.6 deg x 1.9 deg field of view. the system has noobstructions in the light path, optimized baffling, and internal opticalsurfaces coated with a new generation of anti-reflection coatings based onsub-wavelength nanostructures. as a result, the array's point spread functionhas a factor of ~10 less scattered light at large radii than well-baffledreflecting telescopes. the dragonfly telephoto array is capable of imagingextended structures to surface brightness levels below 30 mag/arcsec^2 in 10hintegrations (without binning or foreground star removal). this is considerablydeeper than the surface brightness limit of any existing wide-field telescope.at present no systematic errors limiting the usefulness of much longerintegration times has been identified. with longer integrations (50-100h),foreground star removal and modest binning the dragonfly telephoto array iscapable of probing structures with surface brightnesses below 32 mag/arcsec^2.detection of structures at these surface brightness levels may hold the key tosolving the "missing substructure" and "missing satellite" problems ofconventional hierarchical galaxy formation models. the dragonfly telephotoarray is therefore executing a fully-automated multi-year imaging survey of acomplete sample of nearby galaxies in order to undertake the first census ofultra-faint substructures in the nearby universe.

0802.4094	confirmation of the remarkable compactness of massive quiescent galaxies  at z~2.3: early-type galaxies did not form in a simple monolithic collapse	using deep near-infrared spectroscopy kriek et al. (2006) found that ~45% ofmassive galaxies at z~2.3 have evolved stellar populations and little or noongoing star formation. here we determine the sizes of these quiescent galaxiesusing deep, high-resolution images obtained with hst/nic2 and laser guidestar-assisted keck/ao. considering that their median stellar mass is 1.7x10^11solar masses the galaxies are remarkably small, with a median effective radiusof 0.9 kpc. galaxies of similar mass in the nearby universe have sizes of ~5kpc and average stellar densities which are two orders of magnitude lower thanthe z~2.3 galaxies. these results extend earlier work at z~1.5 and confirmprevious studies at z&gt;2 which lacked spectroscopic redshifts and imaging ofsufficient resolution to resolve the galaxies. our findings demonstrate thatfully assembled early-type galaxies make up at most ~10% of the population ofk-selected quiescent galaxies at z~2.3, effectively ruling out simplemonolithic models for their formation. the galaxies must evolve significantlyafter z~2.3, through dry mergers or other processes, consistent withpredictions from hierarchical models.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

1405.1048	exploring the z=3-4 massive galaxy population with zfourge: the  prevalence of dusty and quiescent galaxies	our understanding of the redshift $z&gt;3$ galaxy population relies largely onsamples selected using the popular "dropout" technique, typically consisting ofuv-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent lyman breaks. as it iscurrently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxypopulation, we here use the fourstar galaxy evolution (zfourge) survey tocreate a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. uniquely, zfourge uses deepnear-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshiftsand stellar population properties. the mass-complete sample consists of 57galaxies with log m $&gt;10.6$, reaching below $m^{\star}$ at $z=3-4$.  on average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observedoptical with median $r_{tot}^{ab}=27.48\pm0.41$ (restframe$m_{1700}=-18.05\pm0.37$). they lie far below the uv luminosity-stellar massrelation for lyman break galaxies and are about $\sim100\times$ fainter at thesame mass. the massive galaxies are red ($r-ks_{ab}=3.9\pm0.2$; restframeuv-slope $\beta=-0.2\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. we classifythe galaxy seds by their restframe $u-v$ and $v-j$ colors and find a diversepopulation: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming lyman break galaxies.this study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies athigher redshift than previously known. furthermore,we uncover a reservoir ofdusty star-forming galaxies with $4\times$ lower specific star-formation ratescompared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z&gt;3$. with $5\times$ highernumbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formationcompared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

1406.2315	the discovery of seven extremely low surface brightness galaxies in the  field of the nearby spiral galaxy m101	dwarf satellite galaxies are a key probe of dark matter and of galaxyformation on small scales and of the dark matter halo masses of their centralgalaxies. they have very low surface brightness, which makes it difficult toidentify and study them outside of the local group. we used a low surfacebrightness-optimized telescope, the dragonfly telephoto array, to search fordwarf galaxies in the field of the massive spiral galaxy m101. we identifyseven large, low surface brightness objects in this field, with effective radiiof \(10 - 30\) arcseconds and central surface brightnesses of \(\mu_{g} \sim25.5 - 27.5\) mag arcsec\(^{-2}\). given their large apparent sizes and lowsurface brightnesses, these objects would likely be missed by standard galaxysearches in deep fields. assuming the galaxies are dwarf satellites of m101,their absolute magnitudes are in the range \(-11.6 \lesssim m_{v} \lesssim-9.3\) and their effective radii are \(350\) pc \(-\) \(1.3\) kpc. their radialsurface brightness profiles are well fit by sersic profiles with a very lowsersic index (\(n \sim 0.3 - 0.7\)). the properties of the sample are similarto those of well-studied dwarf galaxies in the local group, such as sextans iand phoenix. distance measurements are required to determine whether thesegalaxies are in fact associated with m101 or are in its foreground orbackground.

1406.3026	preventing star formation in early-type galaxies with late-time stellar  heating	we revisit previous suggestions that the heating provided by the winds ofdying low-mass stars plays an important role in preventing star formation inquiescent galaxies. at the end of their asymptotic giant branch phase,intermediate and low-mass stars eject their envelopes rapidly in a super-windphase, usually giving rise to planetary nebulae. in spheroidal galaxies withhigh stellar velocity dispersions, the interaction of these ejected envelopeswith the ambient diffuse gas can lead to significant, isotropic andsteady-state heating that scales as $\dot{m}_\ast\sigma_\ast^2$. we show thatcooling of the central regions of the hot diffuse halo gas can be delayed for ahubble time for halos more massive than $\sim10^{12.5}m_{\odot}$ at $0&lt;z&lt;2$,although stellar heating alone is unlikely to forestall cooling in the mostmassive clusters at $z=0$. this mechanism provides a natural explanation forthe strong trend of galaxy quiescence with stellar surface density and velocitydispersion. in addition, since the ejected material will thermalize to$kt\sim\sigma_\ast^2$, this mechanism provides an explanation for the observedsimilarity between the central temperature of the hot diffuse gas and$\sigma_\ast^2$, a result which is not trivial in light of the short inferredcooling times of the hot gas. the main uncertainty in this analysis is theultimate fate of the stellar ejecta. preventing accumulation of the ejecta inthe central regions may require energy input from another source, such as typeia supernovae. detailed simulations of the interaction of the stellar wind withthe ambient gas are required to better quantify the net effect of agb heating.

1406.3350	a massive galaxy in its core formation phase three billion years after  the big bang	most massive galaxies are thought to have formed their dense stellar cores atearly cosmic epochs. however, cores in their formation phase have not yet beenobserved. previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocitydispersions or small apparent sizes but so far no objects have been identifiedwith both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. here wepresent a candidate core in formation 11 billion years ago, at z=2.3.goods-n-774 has a stellar mass of 1.0x10^11 msun, a half-light radius of 1.0kpc, and a star formation rate of 90[+45-20]msun/yr. the star forming gas has avelocity dispersion 317+-30 km/s, amongst the highest ever measured. it issimilar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants ofgoods-n-774, compact quiescent galaxies at z~2 and giant elliptical galaxies inthe nearby universe. galaxies such as goods-n-774 appear to be rare; however,from the star formation rate and size of the galaxy we infer that many starforming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical andnear-infrared surveys.

1406.3351	the nature of extreme emission line galaxies at z=1-2: kinematics and  metallicities from near-infrared spectroscopy	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 22 extreme emission linegalaxies at redshifts 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, confirming that these are low-mass (m* =10^8 - 10^9 m_sun) galaxies undergoing intense starburst episodes (m*/sfr ~10-100 myr). the sample is selected by [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line fluxand equivalent width using near-infrared grism spectroscopy from the 3d-hstsurvey. high-resolution nir spectroscopy is obtained with lbt/luci andvlt/x-shooter. the [o iii]/h{\beta} line ratio is high (&gt; 5) and [nii]/h{\alpha} is always significantly below unity, which suggests a lowgas-phase metallicity. we are able to determine gas-phase metallicities for 7of our objects using various strong-line methods, with values in the range0.05-0.30 z_sun and with a median of 0.15 z_sun; for 3 of these objects wedetect [o iii]{\lambda}4363 which allows for a direct constraint on themetallicity. the velocity dispersion, as measured from the nebular emissionlines, is typically ~50 km/s. combined with the observed star-forming activity,the jeans and toomre stability criteria imply that the gas fraction must belarge (&gt; 2/3), consistent with the difference between our dynamical and stellarmass estimates. the implied gas depletion time scale (several hundred myr) issubstantially longer than the inferred mass-weighted ages (~50 myr), whichfurther supports the emerging picture that most stars in low-mass galaxies formin short, intense bursts of star formation.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.1842	reconciling the observed star-forming sequence with the observed stellar  mass function	we examine the connection between the observed star-forming sequence (sfr$\propto$ $m^{\alpha}$) and the observed evolution of the stellar mass functionbetween $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$. we find the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope$\alpha$ $\lesssim$ 0.9 at all masses and redshifts, as this would result in amuch higher number density at $10 &lt; \log(\mathrm{m/m_{\odot}}) &lt; 11$ by $z=1$than is observed. we show that a transition in the slope of the star-formingsequence, such that $\alpha=1$ at $\log(\mathrm{m/m_{\odot}})&lt;10.5$ and$\alpha=0.7-0.13z$ ({whitaker} {et~al.} 2012) at$\log(\mathrm{m/m_{\odot}})&gt;10.5$, greatly improves agreement with theevolution of the stellar mass function. we then derive a star-forming sequencewhich reproduces the evolution of the mass function by design. thisstar-forming sequence is also well-described by a broken-power law, with ashallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. at $z=2$, it isoffset by $\sim$0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistentwith the mild disagreement between the cosmic sfr and recent observations ofthe growth of the stellar mass density. it is unclear whether this problemstems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in sfrs, or other effects.we show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistentmodels of galaxy evolution, including semi-analytical, hydrodynamical, andabundance-matching models. as part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neithermergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile theevolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence. these results aresupported by observations from {whitaker} {et~al.} (2014).

1410.0007	fluctuation spectroscopy: a new probe of old stellar populations	we introduce a new method to determine the relative contributions ofdifferent types of stars to the integrated light of nearby early-type galaxies.as is well known, the surface brightness of these galaxies shows pixel-to-pixelfluctuations due to poisson variations in the number of giant stars.differential spectroscopy of pixels as a function of fluctuation strength("fluctuation spectroscopy") effectively measures the spectral variation ofstars as a function of their luminosity, information that is otherwisedifficult to obtain for individual stars outside of the local group. we applythis technique to the elliptical galaxy ngc 4472, using hst/acs imaging in sixnarrow-band ramp filters tuned to spectral features in the range 0.8-1.0micron. pixels with +- 5% broad-band variations show differential colorvariations of 0.1% - 1.0% in the narrow-band filters. these variations areprimarily due to the systematic increase in tio absorption strength withincreasing luminosity on the upper giant branch. the data are very wellreproduced by the same conroy &amp; van dokkum (2012) stellar population synthesismodel that is the best fit to the integrated light, with residuals in the range0.03% - 0.09%. models with ages or metallicities that are significantlydifferent from the integrated-light values do not yield good fits. we can alsorule out several modifications to the underlying model, including the presenceof a significant (&gt;3% of the light) population of late m giants. the currentobservations constitute a powerful test of the expected luminosities andtemperatures of metal-rich giants in massive early-type galaxies. studies ofpixels with much larger (negative) fluctuations will provide unique informationon main sequence stars and the stellar initial mass function.

1410.5818	one plane for all: massive star-forming and quiescent galaxies lie on  the same mass fundamental plane at z~0 and z~0.7	scaling relations between galaxy structures and dynamics have been studiedextensively for early and late-type galaxies, both in the local universe and athigh redshifts. the abundant differences between the properties of disky andelliptical, or star-forming and quiescent, galaxies seem to be characteristicof the local universe; such clear distinctions begin to disintegrate asobservations of massive galaxies probe higher redshifts. in this paper, weinvestigate the existence the mass fundamental plane of all massive galaxies($\sigma\gtrsim$ 100 km/s). this work includes local galaxies (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.07)from the sdss, in addition to 31 star-forming and 72 quiescent massive galaxiesat intermediate redshift (z~0.7) with absorption line kinematics from deepkeck-deimos spectra and structural parameters from hst imaging. in twoparameter scaling relations, star-forming and quiescent galaxies differstructurally and dynamically. however, we show that massive star-forming andquiescent galaxies lie on nearly the same mass fundamental plane, or therelationship between stellar mass surface density, stellar velocity dispersion,and effective radius. the scatter in this relation (measured about$\log\sigma$) is low: 0.072 dex (0.055 dex intrinsic) at z~0 and 0.10 dex (0.08dex intrinsic) at z~0.7. this three dimensional surface is not unique: virialrelations, with or without a dependence on luminosity profile shapes, canconnect galaxy structures and stellar dynamics with similar scatter. thisresult builds on the recent finding that mass fundamental plane has been stablefor early-type galaxies since z~2 (bezanson et al. 2013). as we now find thisalso holds for star-forming galaxies to z~0.7, this implies that these scalingrelations of galaxies will be minimally susceptible to progenitor biases due tothe evolving stellar populations, structures, and dynamics of galaxies throughcosmic time.

1411.0667	the formation of massive, compact galaxies at z=2 in the illustris  simulation	massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshift have been found to beconsiderably more compact than galaxies of similar mass in the local universe.how these compact galaxies formed has yet to be determined, though severalprogenitor populations have been proposed. here we investigate the formationprocesses and quantify the assembly histories of such galaxies in illustris, asuite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations encompassing a sufficientlylarge volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously resolving theinternal structure of galaxies. we select massive (~10^11 solar masses) andcompact (stellar half-mass radius &lt; 2 kpc) galaxies from the simulation at z=2.within the illustris suite, we find that these quantities are not perfectlyconverged, but are reasonably reliable for our purposes. the resultingpopulation is composed primarily of quiescent galaxies, but we also findseveral star-forming compact galaxies. the simulated compact galaxies aresimilar to observed galaxies in star formation activity and appearance. wefollow their evolution at high redshift in the simulation and find that thereare multiple pathways to form these compact galaxies, dominated by twomechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally triggeredby gas-rich major mergers between z~2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radiiby a factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times whenthe universe was much denser; the galaxies formed compact and remained so untilz~2.

1504.03320	spectroscopic confirmation of the existence of large, diffuse galaxies  in the coma cluster	we recently identified a population of low surface brightness objects in thefield of the z=0.023 coma cluster, using the dragonfly telephoto array. here wepresent keck spectroscopy of one of the largest of these "ultra-diffusegalaxies" (udgs), confirming that it is a member of the cluster. the galaxy hasprominent absorption features, including the ca ii h+k lines and the g-band,and no detected emission lines. its radial velocity of cz=6280 +- 120 km/s iswithin the 1 sigma velocity dispersion of the coma cluster. the galaxy has aneffective radius of 4.3 +- 0.3 kpc and a sersic index of 0.89 +- 0.06, asmeasured from keck imaging. we find no indications of tidal tails or otherdistortions, at least out to a radius of ~2 r_e. we show that udgs are locatedin a previously sparsely populated region of the size - magnitude plane ofquiescent stellar systems, as they are ~6 magnitudes fainter than normalearly-type galaxies of the same size. it appears that the luminositydistribution of large quiescent galaxies is not continuous, although this couldlargely be due to selection effects. dynamical measurements are needed todetermine whether the dark matter halos of udgs are similar to those ofgalaxies with the same luminosity or to those of galaxies with the same size.

1506.01380	the sizes of massive quiescent and star forming galaxies at z~4 with  zfourge and candels	we study the rest-frame ultra-violet sizes of massive (~0.8 x 10^11 m_sun)galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.2, selected from the fourstar galaxy evolution survey(zfourge), by fitting single sersic profiles to hst/wfc3/f160w images from thecosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels).massive quiescent galaxies are very compact, with a median circularizedhalf-light radius r_e = 0.63 +/- 0.18 kpc. removing 5/16 (31%) sources withsigns of agn activity does not change the result. star-forming galaxies haver_e = 2.0 +/- 0.60 kpc, 3.2 +/- 1.3 x larger than quiescent galaxies. quiescentgalaxies at z~4 are on average 6.0 +\- 0.17 x smaller than at z~0 and 1.9 +/-0.7 x smaller than at z~2. star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass are2.4 +/- 0.7 x smaller than at z~0. overall, the size evolution at 0&lt;z&lt;4 is welldescribed by a powerlaw, with r_e = 5.08 +/- 0.28 (1+z)^(-1.44+/-0.08) kpc forquiescent and r_e = 6.02 +/- 0.28 (1+z)^(-0.72+/-0.05) kpc for star-forminggalaxies. compact star-forming galaxies are rare in our sample: we find only1/14 (7%) with r_e / (m / 10^11 m_sun)^0.75 &lt; 1.5, whereas 13/16 (81%) of thequiescent galaxies is compact. the number density of compact quiescent galaxiesat z~4 is 1.8 +/- 0.8 x 10^-5 mpc^-3 and increases rapidly, by &gt;5 x, between2&lt;z&lt;4. the paucity of compact star-forming galaxies at z~4 and their largerest-frame ultra-violet median sizes suggest that the formation phase ofcompact cores is very short and/or highly dust obscured.

0806.0625	detection of quiescent galaxies in a bicolor sequence from z=0-2	we investigate the properties of quiescent and star-forming galaxypopulations to z~2 with purely photometric data, employing a novel rest-framecolor selection technique. from the ukidss ultra-deep survey data release 1,with matched optical and mid-ir photometry taken from the subaru xmm deepsurvey and spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic survey respectively, weconstruct a k-selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts.excluding stars, objects with uncertain z_phot solutions, those that fall inbad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-framecolors could not be derived, 30108 galaxies with k&lt;22.4 (ab) and z&lt;2.5 remain.the galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in therest-frame u-v vs. v-j color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies(analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extendingfrom blue to red u-v colors. this bimodal behavior is seen up to z~2. due to acombination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-colordiagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z&gt;2 for thissample, but we show that mips 24um data suggest that a significant populationof quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. at z=1-2, the mostluminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-formingand quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxiesare quiescent. moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clusteredmore strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies withearly-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos.this suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhapsbrought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.

1511.01100	episodic molecular outflow in the very young protostellar cluster  serpens south	the loss of mass from protostars, in the form of a jet or outflow, is anecessary counterpart to protostellar mass accretion. outflow ejection eventsprobably vary in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. such`episodic' ejection events have been observed during the class 0 protostellarphase (the early accretion stage), and continue during the subsequent class iphase that marks the first one million years of star formation. previouslyobserved episodic-ejection sources were relatively isolated; however, the mostcommon sites of star formation are clusters. outflows link protostars withtheir environment and provide a viable source of turbulence that is necessaryfor regulating star formation in clusters, but it is not known how anaccretion-driven jet or outflow in a clustered environment manifests itself inits earliest stage. this early stage is important in establishing the initialconditions for momentum and energy transfer to the environment as the protostarand cluster evolve. here we report that an outflow from a very young class 0protostar, at the hub of the very active and filamentary serpens southprotostellar cluster, shows unambiguous episodic events. the $^{12}$co (j=2-1)emission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct features of outflow ejecta, themost recent having the highest velocity. the outflow forms bipolar lobes ---one of the first detectable signs of star formation --- which originate fromthe peak of 1-mm continuum emission. emission from the surrounding c$^{18}$oenvelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation and an infall of materialonto the protostar. the data suggest that episodic accretion-driven outflowbegins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, and that the outflowremains intact in a very clustered environment, probably providing efficientmomentum transfer for driving turbulence.

1511.02862	satellite quenching and galactic conformity at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5	we measure the evolution of the quiescent fraction and quenching efficiencyof satellites around star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with stellarmass $\log(m_{\mathrm{cen}}/m_{\odot})&gt;10.5$ at $0.3&lt;z&lt;2.5$. we combine imagingfrom three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (zfourge/candels, uds, andultravista), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample ofsatellites with $\log(m_{\mathrm{sat}}/m_{\odot})&gt;9.3$. satellites for bothstar-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractionscompared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. we alsoobserve "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are morelikely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals.in our sample, this conformity signal is significant at $\gtrsim3\sigma$ for$0.6&lt;z&lt;1.6$, whereas it is only weakly significant at $0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6$ and$1.6&lt;z&lt;2.5$. therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has beenpresent for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. the satellitequenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, butdoes not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the masslimit of our sample. when we compare the satellite quenching efficiency ofstar-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescentcentrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformitysignal decreases, but remains statistically significant at $0.6&lt;z&lt;0.9$. this isevidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation propertiesof the central as well as to the mass of the halo. we discuss physical effectsthat may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allowfor continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites arequenched.

1511.04086	ubiquitous time variability of integrated stellar populations	long period variable stars arise in the final stages of the asymptotic giantbranch phase of stellar evolution. they have periods of up to ~1000d andamplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the i-band flux. these starspulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of massand radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of theunderlying stellar population. the overall number of long period variables in apopulation is directly related to their lifetime, which is difficult to predictfrom first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellarmass-loss and convective mixing. the time variability of these stars has notbeen previously taken into account when modeling the spectral energydistributions of galaxies. here we construct time-dependent stellar populationmodels that include the effects of long period variable stars, and report theubiquitous detection of this expected `pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-richgalaxy m87. the pixel light curves display a variety of behaviors, includinglinearly rising and falling curves, semi-periodic curves, and sudden increasesor decreases in the flux level. the observed variation of 0.1-1% is very wellmatched to the predictions of our models. the data provide a strong and novelconstraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellarpopulation, and we infer that the lifetime of long period variables in m87 isshorter by approximately 30% compared to predictions from the latest stellarevolution models.

0808.0911	a confirmation of the strong clustering of distant red galaxies at 2 &lt; z  &lt;3	recent studies have shown that distant red galaxies (drgs), which dominatethe high-mass end of the galaxy population at z~2.5, are more stronglyclustered than the population of blue star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. however these studies have been severely hampered by the small sizesof fields having deep near-infrared imaging. here we use the large ukidss ultradeep survey to study the clustering of drgs. the size and depth of this surveyallows for an unprecedented measurement of the angular clustering of drgs at2&lt;z_phot&lt;3 and k&lt;21. the correlation function shows the expected power lawbehavior, but with an apparent upturn at theta&lt;~10". we deproject the angularclustering to infer the spatial correlation length, finding 10.6+-1.6 h^-1 mpc.we use the halo occupation distribution framework to demonstrate that theobserved strong clustering of drgs is not consistent with standard models ofgalaxy clustering, confirming previous suggestions that were based on smallersamples. inaccurate photometric redshifts could artificially enhance theobserved clustering, however significant systematic redshift errors would berequired to bring the measurements into agreement with the models. anotherpossibility is that the underlying assumption that galaxies interact with theirlarge-scale environment only through halo mass is not valid, and that otherfactors drive the evolution of the oldest, most massive galaxies at z~2.

astro-ph;0309460	the nature of e+a galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters	[abridged] combining hst/wfpc2 mosaics with extensive ground-basedspectroscopy, we study the nature of e+a galaxies in three intermediateredshift clusters (z=0.33, 0.58, &amp; 0.83). from a sample of ~500 confirmedcluster members, we isolate 46 e+a candidates to determine the e+a fraction andstudy their physical properties. we find e+a's comprise a non-negligiblecomponent (~7-13%) of the cluster population at these redshifts, and theirdiverse nature indicates a heterogeneous parent population. cluster e+a's spanthe range in hubble type and cover a wide range in luminosity, internalvelocity dispersion, and half-light radius. from their velocity dispersions andhalf-light radii, we infer that the descendants of e+a's in our highestredshift cluster are massive early-type galaxies. we find a decrease in thecharacteristic e+a mass similar to the decrease in luminosity of rapidlystar-forming field galaxies since z~1, i.e. galaxy ``down-sizing.'' inaddition, we argue our statistics imply that &gt;30% of the e-s0 members haveundergone an e+a phase; the true fraction could be 100% if the effects of e+adown-sizing, an increasing e+a fraction with redshift, and the conversion ofspirals into early-types are also considered. thus, the e+a phase may indeed bean important stage in the transformation of star-forming galaxies intoearly-type cluster members.

astro-ph;0404471	stellar populations and kinematics of red galaxies at z&gt;2: implications  for the formation of massive galaxies	we recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z&gt;2 with redrest-frame optical colors. these distant red galaxies (drgs) are efficientlyselected by the simple observed color criterion j-k&gt;2.3. in this paper wepresent nir spectroscopy with keck/nirspec of six drgs at 2.4&lt;z&lt;3.2. we detectcontinuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. equivalentwidths of h alpha are 20-30 ang, smaller than measured for lbgs and nearbylirgs, and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. the modest equivalent widthsimply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate, or thatthey are very dusty. fitting both the photometry and the h alpha lines, we findcontinuum extinction a_v=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 gyr, star formation rates 200-400solar masses/yr, and stellar masses 1-5x10^11 solar masses for models withconstant star formation rates. from [nii]/h alpha ratios we infer that themetallicities are high, 1-1.5 x solar. for four galaxies we can determine linewidths from the optical emission lines. the widths are high, ranging from130-240 km/s, and by combining data for lbgs and drgs we find significantcorrelations between linewidth and restframe u-v color, and between linewidthand stellar mass. the latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the``baryonic tully-fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. the median dynamicalmass is ~2x10^11 solar masses, supporting the high stellar masses inferred fromthe photometry. we find that the median m/l_v ~ 0.8, a factor of ~5 higher thanmeasured for lbgs. we infer from our small sample that drgs are dustier, moremetal rich, more massive, and have higher ages than z=3 lbgs of the samerest-frame v-band luminosity. their high m/l ratios imply that they contributesignificantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0603063	direct measurements of the stellar continua and balmer/4000 angstrom  breaks of red z&gt;2 galaxies: redshifts and improved constraints on stellar  populations	we use near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini,nirspec on keck, and isaac on the vlt to study the rest-frame optical continuaof three `distant red galaxies' (having js - ks &gt; 2.3) at z&gt;2. all three galaxyspectra show the balmer/4000 angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. thespectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum withan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. these redshifts agree well withthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with halpha emission. thistechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in therest-frame uv, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selectedin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. furthermore, weuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of halpha together withevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. inclusionof the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range ofpossible solutions for stellar population properties. we find that the stellarpopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dustystarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxywith a strong break and no detected line emission. the dusty starburst galaxyhas an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 msun. the spectra of thetwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 gyr and stellar masses of4*10^11 msun. the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthensour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry. largersamples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starburstsand (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0610484	the rest-frame optical luminosity functions of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5	we present the rest-frame optical (b, v, and r band) luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5, measured from a k-selected sample constructedfrom the deep nir musyc, the ultradeep fires, and the goods-cdfs. this sampleis unique for its combination of area and range of luminosities. the faint-endslopes of the lfs at z&gt;2 are consistent with those at z~0. the characteristicmagnitudes are significantly brighter than the local values (e.g., ~1.2 mag inthe r band), while the measured values for phi_star are typically ~5 timessmaller. the b-band luminosity density at z~2.3 is similar to the local value,and in the r band it is ~2 times smaller than the local value. we present thelf of distant red galaxies (drgs), which we compare to that of non-drgs. whiledrgs and non-drgs are characterized by similar lfs at the bright end, thefaint-end slope of the non-drg lf is much steeper than that of drgs. thecontribution of drgs to the global densities down to the faintest probedluminosities is 14%-25% in number and 22%-33% in luminosity. from the derivedrest-frame u-v colors and stellar population synthesis models, we estimate themass-to-light ratios (m/l) of the different subsamples. the m/l ratios of drgsare ~5 times higher (in the r and v bands) than those of non-drgs. the globalstellar mass density at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 appears to be dominated by drgs, whosecontribution is of order ~60%-80% of the global value. qualitatively similarresults are obtained when the population is split by rest-frame u-v colorinstead of observed j-k color.

0705.4283	assessing the predictive power of galaxy formation models: a comparison  of predicted and observed rest-frame optical luminosity functions at  2.0&lt;z&lt;3.3	recent galaxy formation models successfully reproduce the local luminosityfunction (lf) of galaxies by invoking mechanisms to suppress star formation inlow- and high-mass galaxies. as these models are optimized to fit the lf at lowredshift, a crucial question is how well they predict the lf at earlier times.here we compare recently measured rest-frame v-band lfs of galaxies atredshifts 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.3 to predictions of semianalytic models by de lucia &amp; blaizotand bower et al. and hydrodynamic simulations by dave et al.. the modelssucceed for some luminosity and redshift ranges and fail for others. a notablesuccess is that the bower et al. model provides a good match to the observed lfat z~3. however, all models predict an increase with time of the rest-framev-band luminosity density, whereas the observations show a decrease. the modelsalso have difficulty matching the observed rest-frame colors of galaxies. inall models the luminosity density of red galaxies increases sharply from z~3 toz~2.2, whereas it is approximately constant in the observations. conversely, inthe models the luminosity density of blue galaxies is approximately constant,whereas it decreases in the observations. these discrepancies cannot beentirely remedied by changing the treatment of dust and suggest that currentmodels do not yet provide a complete description of galaxy formation andevolution since z~3.

astro-ph;0612612	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): deep near-infrared  imaging and the selection of distant galaxies	we present deep near-infrared jhk imaging of four 10'x10' fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with ispi on the ctio 4m telescope. the typical point sourcelimiting depths are j~22.5, h~21.5, and k~21 (5sigma; vega). the effectiveseeing in the final images is ~1.0". we combine these data with musyc ubvrizimaging to create k-selected catalogs that are unique for their uniform size,depth, filter coverage, and image quality. we investigate the rest-frameoptical colors and photometric redshifts of galaxies that are selected usingcommon color selection techniques, including distant red galaxies (drgs),star-forming and passive bzks, and the rest-frame uv-selected bm, bx, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs). these techniques are effective at isolating largesamples of high redshift galaxies, but none provide complete or uniform samplesacross the targeted redshift ranges. the drg and bm/bx/lbg criteria identifypopulations of red and blue galaxies, respectively, as they were designed todo. the star-forming bzks have a very wide redshift distribution, a wide rangeof colors, and may include galaxies with very low specific star formationrates. in comparison, the passive bzks are fewer in number, have a differentdistribution of k magnitudes, and have a somewhat different redshiftdistribution. by combining these color selection criteria, it appears possibleto define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit overspecific redshift ranges. however, the redshift dependence of both thecompleteness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit tothe usefulness of these techniques.

astro-ph;0702271	a keck spectroscopic survey of ms1054-03 (z=0.83): forming the red  sequence	using a magnitude-limited, spectroscopic survey of the x-ray luminous galaxycluster ms1054-03, we isolate 153 cluster galaxies and measure ms1054'sredshift and velocity dispersion to be z=0.8307 and sigma_z=1156 km/s. theabsorption-line, post-starburst (``e+a''), and emission-line galaxiesrespectively make up 63%, 15%, and 23% of the cluster population. withphotometry from hst/acs, we find that the absorption-line members define anexceptionally tight red sequence over a span of ~3.5 magnitudes in i775: theirintrinsic scatter in (v-i) color is only 0.048, corresponding to a (u-b)_zscatter of 0.041. their color scatter is comparable to that of the ellipticals(sigma_vi=0.055), but measurably smaller than that of the combined e+s0 sample(sigma_vi=0.072). the color scatter of ms1054's absorption-line population isapproximately twice that of the ellipticals in coma; this difference isconsistent with passive evolution where most of the absorption-line members(&gt;75%) formed by z~2, and all of them by z~1.2. for red members, we find atrend (&gt;95% confidence) of weakening hdelta absorption with redder colors thatwe conclude is due to age: in ms1054, the color scatter on the red sequence isdriven by differences in mean stellar age of up to ~1.5 gyr. we also generatecomposite spectra and estimate that the average s0 in ms1054 is ~0.5-1 gyryounger than the average elliptical; this difference in mean stellar age ismainly due to a number of s0s that are blue (18%) and/or are post-starburstsystems (21%).

astro-ph;9603029	measuring the evolution of the m/l ratio from the fundamental plane in  cl 0024+16 at z=0.39	the existence of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies implies thatthe m/l ratios of early-types are well behaved. it provides therefore animportant tool to measure the evolution of the m/l ratio with redshift. thesemeasurements, in combination with measurements of the evolution of theluminosity function, can be used to constrain the mass evolution of galaxies.  we present the fundamental plane relation measured for galaxies in the richcluster cl 0024+16 at z=0.391. the galaxies satisfy a tight fundamental plane,with relatively low scatter (15 %). the m/l is 31 +- 12 % lower than the m/lmeasured in coma, which is consistent with simple evolutionary models. hence,galaxies with very similar dynamical properties existed at a z=0.4.  more, and deeper data are needed to measure the evolution of the slope andthe scatter of the fundamental plane to higher accuracy. furthermore, data onthe richest nearby clusters would be valuable to test the hypothesis that thefundamental plane is independent of cluster environment.

astro-ph;9603063	the fundamenal plane in cl0024 at z=0.4: implications for the evolution  of the mass-to-light ratio	we present results on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies in therich cluster cl 0024+16 at z=0.391. the galaxies satisfy a tight fundamentalplane relation which is similar to that at low redshift. the scatter is 15 % inlog re. the data show that massive early-type galaxies existed at z=0.4.  the evolution of the m/l ratio is derived from the fundamental plane, by acomparison with coma. the m/l ratio increases by 31 +- 12 % between z=0.391,and z=0.023. the evolution is low when compared to models for stellarpopulations. the expected evolution depends on the imf, q0, and the formationredshift of the galaxies. the data are in agreement with high formationredshifts. the most serious bias in the modeling may be the progenitor bias: ifthe progenitors of some current day early-types are spirals at z=0.4, theywould not be included in the sample, and the sample would be biased towards theoldest galaxies.  more data are needed to measure the evolution of the fundamental plane moreprecisely, and its scatter. there is a hint that the form of the fundamentalplane changes with redshift, and this needs to be determined better.

astro-ph;9902349	the velocity dispersion of ms1054-03: a massive galaxy cluster at high  redshift	we present results from a dynamical study of the high redshift, massive,x-ray luminous galaxy cluster ms1054--03. we significantly increase the numberof confirmed cluster members by adding 20 to an existing set of twelve; usingthe confirmed members, we estimate ms1054--03's redshift, velocity dispersion,and mass. we find that z=0.8329 +/- 0.0017, sigma = 1170 +/- 150 km/s, and thecentral mass is approximately 1.9 +/- 0.5 x 10^{15} h^{-1} m_{odot} (within r=1h^{-1} mpc; h_0 =100h km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}, q_0=0.5). ms1054--03 is one of ahandful of high redshift (z&gt;0.5) clusters known that also has x-ray andweak-lensing observations (donahue et al. 1998; luppino &amp; kaiser 1997); we findour dynamical mass agrees with mass estimates from both studies. theconfirmation of ms1054--03 as a massive cluster at z~0.8 is consistent with anopen (omega_m~0.3) or flat, lambda-dominated (omega_m+omega_{lambda}=1)universe. in addition, we compare ms1054--03's velocity dispersion and x-raytemperature to a sample of low and intermediate redshift galaxy clusters totest for evolution in the sigma - t_x relation; we find no evidence forevolution in this relation to z~0.8.
