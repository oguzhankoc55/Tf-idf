0706.1731	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: evolution of surface n  abundances and effective temperature scales in the galaxy and magellanic  clouds	we present an analysis of high resolution vlt-flames spectra of 61 b-typestars with relatively narrow-lined spectra located in 4 fields centered on themilky way clusters; ngc3293 &amp; ngc4755 and the large and small magellanic cloudclusters; ngc2004 and ngc330. for each object a quantitative analysis wascarried out using the non-lte model atmosphere code tlusty; resulting in thedetermination of their atmospheric parameters and photospheric abundances ofthe dominant metal species (c, n, o, mg, si, fe). the results are discussed inrelation to our earlier work on 3 younger clusters in these galaxies; ngc6611,n11 and ngc346 paying particular attention to the nitrogen abundances which arean important probe of the role of rotation in the evolution of stars. this workalong with that of the younger clusters provides a consistent dataset ofabundances and atmospheric parameters for over 100 b-type stars in the threegalaxies. we provide effective temperature scales for b-type dwarfs in allthree galaxies and for giants and supergiants in the smc and lmc. in eachgalaxy a dependence on luminosity is found between the three classes with theunevolved dwarf objects having significantly higher effective temperatures. ametallicity dependence is present between the smc and galactic dwarf objects,and whilst the lmc stars are only slightly cooler than the smc stars, they aresignificantly hotter than their galactic counterparts.

0901.3853	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: constraints on stellar evolution  from the chemical compositions of rapidly rotating galactic and magellanic  cloud b-type stars	we have previously analysed the spectra of 135 early b-type stars in the lmcand found several groups of stars that have chemical compositions that conflictwith the theory of rotational mixing. here we extend this study to galactic andsmc metallicities with the analysis of ~50 galactic and ~100 smc early b-typestars with rotational velocities up to ~300km/s. the surface nitrogenabundances are utilised as a probe of the mixing process.  in the smc, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich starsamongst the early b type core-hydrogen burning stars, similar to the lmc. inthe galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the corehydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectationfrom both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. however, onlya small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce asignificant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enrichedrapid rotators previously found in the lmc sample. finally, in each metallicityregime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannotbe the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. their abundancesare, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous redsupergiant phase. together, these observations paint a complex picture of thenitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellaratmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. whether rotationalmixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at thistime, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction in thosegroups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models(abridged).

0704.1113	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: wind properties and evolution of  hot massive stars in the lmc	[abridged] we have studied the optical spectra of 28 o- and early b-typestars in the large magellanic cloud, 22 of which are associated with the youngstar-forming region n11. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code fastwind with thegenetic-algorithm optimisation routine pikaia. results for stars in the lh9 andlh10 associations of n11 are consistent with a sequential star formationscenario, in which activity in lh9 triggered the formation of lh10. our samplecontains four stars of spectral type o2, of which the hottest is found to be~49-54 kk (cf. ~45-46 kk for o3 stars). the masses of helium-enriched dwarfsand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotatingevolutionary tracks. we interpret this as evidence for efficientrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and toan increase of the stellar luminosity. this result is consistent with findingsfor smc stars by mokiem et al. for bright giants and supergiants no suchmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly(or non-)rotating objects. stellar mass-loss properties were found to beintermediate to those found in massive stars in the galaxy and the smc, andcomparisons with theoretical predictions at lmc metallicity yielded goodagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 &lt; log l/l(sun) &lt;6.1.

0903.2049	sub-surface convection zones in hot massive stars and their observable  consequences	we study the convection zones in the outer envelope of hot massive starswhich are caused by opacity peaks associated with iron and helium ionization.we determine the occurrence and properties of these convection zones asfunction of the stellar parameters. we then confront our results withobservations of ob stars. a stellar evolution code is used to compute a grid ofmassive star models at different metallicities. in these models, the mixinglength theory is used to characterize the envelope convection zones. we findthe iron convection zone (fecz) to be more prominent for lower surface gravity,higher luminosity and higher initial metallicity. it is absent for luminositiesbelow about $10^{3.2}\lsun$, $10^{3.9}\lsun$, and $10^{4.2}$\lsun$ for thegalaxy, lmc and smc, respectively. we map the strength of the fecz on thehertzsprung-russell diagram for three metallicities, and compare this with theoccurrence of observational phenomena in o stars: microturbulence, non-radialpulsations, wind clumping, and line profile variability. the confirmation ofall three trends for the fecz as function of stellar parameters by empiricalmicroturbulent velocities argues for a physical connection betweensub-photospheric convective motions and small scale stochastic velocities inthe photosphere of o- and b-type stars. we further suggest that clumping in theinner parts of the winds of ob stars could be caused by the same mechanism, andthat magnetic fields produced in the fecz could appear at the surface of obstars as diagnosed by discrete absorption components in ultraviolet absorptionlines.

0905.1328	spitzer sage infrared photometry of massive stars in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the large magellanic cloud,with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometriccatalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring theirinfrared properties. the photometric catalog consists of stars with infraredcounterparts in the spitzer sage survey database, for which we present uniformphotometry from 0.3-24 microns in the ubvijhks+irac+mips24 bands. the resultinginfrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant b[e], redsupergiant and luminous blue variable (lbv) stars are among the brightestinfrared point sources in the large magellanic cloud, due to their intrinsicbrightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. we detect infrared excessesdue to free-free emission among ~900 ob stars, which correlate with luminosityclass. we confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant b[e] stars, findingthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (seds) to be very similar, incontrast to the variety of sed shapes among the spectrally variable lbvs. thesimilar luminosities of b[e] supergiants (log l/lo&gt;=4) and the rare, dustyprogenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. sn 2008s and ngc 300ot), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests acommon origin for them. we find the infrared colors for wolf-rayet stars to beindependent of spectral type and their seds to be flatter than what modelspredict. the results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap forinterpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxiesat infrared wavelengths.

1003.0875	the nature of v39: an lbv candidate or lbv impostor in the very low  metallicity galaxy ic 1613?	[abridged]  context: very few examples of luminous blue variable (lbv) stars or lbvcandidates (lbvc) are known, particularly at metallicities below the smc. thelbv phase is crucial for the evolution of massive stars, and its behavior withmetallicity is poorly known. v39 in ic 1613 is a well-known photometricvariable, with b-band changes larger than 1mag. over its period. the star,previously proposed to be a projection of a galactic w virginis and an ic 1613red supergiant, shows features that render it a possible lbvc.  method: we investigate mid-resolution blue and red vlt-vimos spectra of v39,covering a time span of 40 days, and perform a quantitative analysis of thecombined spectrum using the model atmosphere code cmfgen.  results: we identify strong balmer and feii p-cygni profiles, and a hybridspectrum resembling a b-a supergiant in the blue and a g-star in the red. nosignificant vrad variations are detected, and the spectral changes are smallover the photometric period. our analysis places v39 in the low-luminosity partof the lbv and lbvc region, but it is also consistent with a sgb[e] star.  conclusions: the radial velocity indicates that v39 belongs to ic 1613. thelack of vrad changes and spectroscopic variations excludes binary scenarios.the features observed are not consistent with a w virginis star, and thispossibility is also discarded. we propose that the star is a b-a lbvc or sgb[e]star surrounded by a thick disk precessing around it.  if confirmed, v39 would be the lowest metallicity resolved lbv candidateknown to date. alternatively, it could represent a new transient phase ofmassive star evolution, an lbv impostor.

0708.2042	the empirical metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate of o- and  early b-type stars	[abridged] we present a comprehensive study of the metallicity dependence ofthe mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. assuminga power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, mdot \propto z^{m}, andadopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity,v_inf \propto z^{0.13} (leitherer et al.), we find m = 0.83 +/- 0.16 fornon-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation(wlr) for stars more luminous than 10^{5.2} lsun. within the errors, thisresult agrees with the prediction of m = 0.69 +/- 0.10 from vink et al. for thehigh luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than thepredictions, implying wind clumping factors in their line-forming regions of~4. for lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengthscannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis ofuv lines. in the low-luminosity domain the galactic wlr is found to be muchsteeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between uvmass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of l ~10^{4.75} lsun, the origin of which is unknown. we emphasize that even if thecurrent mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result ofwind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent ofmetallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remaincorrect.

1104.2928	blue luminous stars in nearby galaxies - uit005: a possible link to the  luminous blue variable stage	(abridged) a detailed study of the blue supergiant uit005 (b2-2.5ia+) in m33is presented. the results of our quantitative spectral analysis indicate thatthe star is a very luminous, log(l/lsun)~5.9 dex, and massive, m~50 msun,object, showing a very high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio in its surface (n/o~8, bymass). based on the derived mg and si abundances, we argue that this high n/oratio cannot be the result of an initial low o content due to its location onthe disk of m33, known to present a steep metallicity gradient. in combinationwith the he abundance, the most plausible interpretation is that uit005 is inan advanced stage of evolution, showing in its surface n enrichment and odepletion resulting from mixing with cno processed material from the stellarinterior. a comparison with the predictions of current stellar evolutionarymodels indicates that there are significant discrepancies, in particular withregard to the degree of chemical processing, with the models predicting a muchlower degree of o depletion than observed. at the same time, the mass-loss ratederived in our analysis is an order of magnitude lower than the valuesconsidered in the evolutionary calculations. based on a study of thesurrounding stellar population and the nearby cluster ngc588, using wfpc2photometry, we suggest that uit005 could be in fact a runaway star from thiscluster.

1105.1775	the vlt-flames tarantula survey iii: a very massive star in apparent  isolation from the massive cluster r136	vfts 682 is located in an active star-forming region, at a projected distanceof 29 pc from the young massive cluster r136 in the tarantula nebula of thelarge magellanic cloud. it was previously reported as a candidate young stellarobject, and more recently spectroscopically revealed as a hydrogen-richwolf-rayet (wn5h) star. our aim is to obtain the stellar properties, such asits intrinsic luminosity, and to investigate the origin of vfts 682. to thispurpose, we model optical spectra from the vlt-flames tarantula survey with thenon-lte stellar atmosphere code cmfgen, as well as the spectral energydistribution from complementary optical and infrared photometry. we find theextinction properties to be highly peculiar (rv ~4.7), and obtain asurprisingly high luminosity log(l/lsun) = 6.5 \pm 0.2, corresponding to apresent-day mass of ~150msun. the high effective temperature of 52.2 \pm 2.5kkmight be explained by chemically homogeneous evolution - suggested to be thekey process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. lightcurves of theobject show variability at the 10% level on a timescale of years. such changesare unprecedented for classical wolf-rayet stars, and are more reminiscent ofluminous blue variables. finally, we discuss two possibilities for the originof vfts 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profoundimplications for the formation mechanism of massive stars, or (ii) vfts 682 isa slow runaway star that originated from the dense cluster r136, which wouldmake it the most massive runaway known to date.

0711.2264	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: atmospheric parameters and  rotational velocity distributions for b-type stars in the magellanic clouds	we provide atmospheric parameters and rotational velocities of a large sample(~400) of o- and early b-type stars, analysed in a homogeneous and consistentmanner, for use in constraining theoretical models. comparison of therotational velocities with evolutionary tracks suggest that the end of corehydrogen burning occurs later than currently predicted. we also show that thelarge number of the luminous blue supergiants observed in the fields areunlikely to have directly evolved from main-sequence massive o-type stars asneither their low rotational velocities or position on the h-r diagram arepredicted. we suggest that blue-loops or mass-transfer binary systems maypopulate the blue supergiant regime. by comparing the rotational velocitydistributions of the magellanic cloud stars to a similar galactic sample wefind that (at 3sigma confidence level) massive stars (above 8msun) in the smcrotate faster than those in the solar neighbourhood. however there appears tobe no significant difference between the rotational velocity distributions inthe galaxy and the lmc. we find that the vsini distributions in the smc and lmccan modelled with an intrinsic rotational velocity distribution which is agaussian peaking at 175km/s (smc) and 100km/s (lmc). we find that in ngc346 inthe smc, the 10-25msun main-sequence stars appear to rotate faster than theirhigher mass counterparts. recently yoon et al. (2006) have determined rates ofgrbs by modelling rapidly rotating massive star progenitors. our measuredrotational velocity distribution for the 10-25msun stars is peaked at slightlyhigher velocities than they assume, supporting the idea that grbs could comefrom rapid rotators with initial masses as low as 14msun at low metallicities.(abridged).

0711.2267	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: rotation and nitrogen enrichment  as the key to understanding massive star evolution	rotation has become an important element in evolutionary models of massivestars, specifically via the prediction of rotational mixing. here, we study asample of stars, including rapid rotators, to constrain such models and usenitrogen enrichments as a probe of the mixing process. chemical compositions(c, n, o, mg and si) have been estimated for 135 early b-type stars in thelarge magellanic cloud with projected rotational velocities up to ~300km/susing a non-lte tlusty model atmosphere grid. evolutionary models, includingrotational mixing, have been generated attempting to reproduce theseobservations by adjusting the overshooting and rotational mixing parameters andproduce reasonable agreement with 60% of our core hydrogen burning sample. wefind (excluding known binaries) a significant population of highly nitrogenenriched intrinsic slow rotators vsini less than 50km/s incompatible with ourmodels ~20% of the sample). furthermore, while we find fast rotators withenrichments in agreement with the models, the observation of evolved (log gless than 3.7dex) fast rotators that are relatively unenriched (a further ~20%of the sample) challenges the concept of rotational mixing. we also find that70% of our blue supergiant sample cannot have evolved directly from thehydrogen burning main-sequence. we are left with a picture where invokingbinarity and perhaps fossil magnetic fields are required to understand thesurface properties of a population of massive main sequence stars.

1303.1367	broad-band spectroscopy of the ongoing large eruption of the luminous  blue variable r71	the luminous blue variable (lbv) r71 is currently undergoing an eruption,which differs photometrically and spectroscopically from its last outburst inthe 1970s. valuable information on the physics of lbv eruptions can be gainedby analyzing the spectral evolution during this eruption and by comparing r71'spresent appearance to its previous outburst and its quiescent state. here wepresent the first spectra of an ongoing monitoring program with vlt/x-shooterand compare them to archival vlt/uves and mpg/eso-2.2m/feros spectra from2002-2011. the discussed data include pre-eruption spectra in 2002 and 2005, aspectrum of the transitionary phase between quiescent and eruptive state in2007, and spectra of the eruption in 2011-2012. the 2011-2012 spectra aredominated by strong neutral and singly ionized metal absorption lines likelyformed in a large "pseudo-photosphere." we find an unusually low apparenttemperature of r71 of only ~6650 k; the star resembles a late f supergiant.r71's visual lightcurve had a maximum in 2012 with mv ~ 8.7 mag. given theuncertainty in the extinction towards r71, this corresponds to a bolometricluminosity of -9.8 mag to -10.3 mag. r71's 2011-2012 spectra do not show h iand fe ii p cyg profiles, which were present during its last outburst in the1970s and which are normally observed during lbv outbursts. the rise in r71'svisual magnitude and the low apparent temperature of its pseudo-photosphereduring the current eruption are unprecedented for this star. r71 most likelyincreased its bolometric luminosity by 0.4-1.3 mag compared to its quiescentstate. the very low temperature of its pseudo-photosphere implies a veryhigh-mass loss rate, a factor of 1000 higher than during the quiescence state.no fast-moving material indicative of an explosion is observed (abridged).

1304.6747	hubble tarantula treasury project: unraveling tarantula's web. i.  observational overview and first results	the hubble tarantula treasury project (http) is an ongoing panchromaticimaging survey of stellar populations in the tarantula nebula in the largemagellanic cloud that reaches into the sub-solar mass regime (&lt; 0.5 mo). httputilizes the capability of hst to operate the advanced camera for surveys (acs)and the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) in parallel to study this remarkable regionin the near-ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared spectral regions, includingnarrow band h$\alpha$ images. the combination of all these bands provides aunique multi-band view. the resulting maps of the stellar content of thetarantula nebula within its main body provide the basis for investigations ofstar formation in an environment resembling the extreme conditions found instarburst galaxies and in the early universe. access to detailed properties ofindividual stars allows us to begin to reconstruct the evolution of the stellarskeleton of the tarantula nebula over space and time with parcsec-scaleresolution. in this first paper we describe the observing strategy, thephotometric techniques, and the upcoming data products from this survey andpresent preliminary results obtained from the analysis of the initial set ofnear-infrared observations.

1309.2929	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xii. rotational velocities of the single  o-type stars	aims. using ground based multi-object optical spectroscopy obtained in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we aim to establish the(projected) rotational velocity distribution for a sample of 216 presumablysingle o-type stars in 30 doradus (30 dor).  methods. we measured projected rotational velocities, \vrot, by means of afourier transform method and a profile fitting method applied on a set ofisolated spectral lines. we also used an iterative deconvolution procedure toinfer the probability density, $\rm{p(\veq)}$, of the equatorial rotationalvelocity, \veq.  results. the distribution of \vrot\ shows a two-component structure: a peakaround 80 \kms\ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 \kms. thisstructure is also present in the inferred distribution $\rm{p(\veq)}$ witharound 80% of the sample having 0 $&lt;$ \veq\, $\leq\, 300$ \kms\ and the other20% distributed in the high-velocity region.  conclusions. most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than20%\ of their break-up velocity. for the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in astellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantlyspin down these stars within the first few myr of evolution. the presence of asizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent populationsynthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution onthe rotation rate of massive stars. despite the fact that we have excludedstars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may haveremained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. the fact that thehigh-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively),populated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications forthe evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts.

1309.7250	rotational properties of the o-type star population in the tarantula  region	the 30 doradus (30\,dor) region in the large magellanic cloud (also known asthe tarantula nebula) is the nearest massive starburst region, containing therichest sample of massive stars in the local group. it is the best possiblelaboratory to investigate aspects of the formation and evolution of massivestars. here, we focus on rotation which is a key parameter in the evolution ofthese objects. we establish the projected rotational velocity, $v_{e}\sin i$,distribution of an unprecedented sample of 216 radial velocity constant($\rm{\delta rv\, \leq\, 20 \,km s^{-1}}$) o-type stars in 30\,dor observed inthe framework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts). the distribution of$v_{e}\sin i$ shows a two-component structure: a peak around 80 $\rm{kms^{-1}}$ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 $\rm{km s^{-1}}$.around 75% of the sample has 0 $\leq\, v_{e}\sin i \leq$ 200 $\rm{km s^{-1}}$with the other 25% distributed in the high-velocity tail. the presence of thelow-velocity peak is consistent with that found in other studies of late-o andearly-b stars. the high-velocity tail is compatible with expectations frombinary interaction synthesis models and may be predominantly populated bypost-binary interaction, spun-up, objects and mergers. this may have importantimplications for the nature of progenitors of long-duration gamma ray bursts.

1402.6969	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xiv. the o-type stellar content of 30  doradus	detailed spectral classifications are presented for 352 o-b0 stars in thevlt-flames tarantula survey, of which 213 o-type are of sufficient quality forfurther morphological analysis. among them, six subcategories of specialinterest are distinguished. (1) several new examples of the earliest spectraltypes o2-o3 have been found. (2) a group of extremely rapidly rotatingmain-sequence objects has been isolated, including the largest $v\sin i$ valuesknown, the spatial and radial-velocity distributions of which suggest ejectionfrom the two principal ionizing clusters. (3) several new examples of theevolved, rapidly rotating onfp class show similar evidence. (4) no fewer than48 members of the vz category, hypothesized to be on or near the zams, arefound in this sample; in contrast to the rapid rotators, they are stronglyconcentrated to the ionizing clusters, supporting their interpretation as veryyoung objects, as do their relatively faint absolute magnitudes. (5) asurprisingly large fraction of the main-sequence spectra belong to the recentlyrecognized v((fc)) class, with c iii emission lines of similar strength to theusual n iii in v((f)) spectra; there are also six objects with veryhigh-quality data but no trace of either mission feature, presenting newchallenges to physical interpretations. (6) five spectra with morphologicallyenhanced nitrogen lines have been detected. absolute visual magnitudes havebeen derived for each star with individual extinction laws, and composite hrdsprovide evidence of the multiple generations present in this field.associations with x-ray sources are noted. further analyses of this uniquedataset underway will provide new insights into the evolution of massive starsand starburst clusters.

1409.1822	rotational velocities of single and binary o-type stars in the tarantula  nebula	rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars, affectingtheir evolution, chemical yields, ionizing photon budget, and final fate. wedetermined the projected rotational velocity, $v_e\sin i$, of $\sim$330 o-typeobjects, i.e. $\sim$210 spectroscopic single stars and $\sim$110 primaries inbinary systems, in the tarantula nebula or 30 doradus (30\,dor) region. theobservations were taken using vlt/flames and constitute the largest homogeneousdataset of multi-epoch spectroscopy of o-type stars currently available. themost distinctive feature of the $v_e\sin i$ distributions of thepresumed-single stars and primaries in 30 dor is a low-velocity peak at around100\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$. stellar winds are not expected to have spun-down thebulk of the stars significantly since their arrival on the main sequence andtherefore the peak in the single star sample is likely to represent the outcomeof the formation process. whereas the spin distribution of presumed-singlestars shows a well developed tail of stars rotating more rapidly than300\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$, the sample of primaries does not feature such ahigh-velocity tail. the tail of the presumed-single star distribution isattributed for the most part -- and could potentially be completely due -- tospun-up binary products that appear as single stars or that have merged. thiswould be consistent with the lack of such post-interaction products in thebinary sample, that is expected to be dominated by pre-interaction systems. thepeak in this distribution is broader and is shifted toward somewhat higher spinrates compared to the distribution of presumed-single stars. systems displayinglarge radial velocity variations, typical for short period systems, appearmostly responsible for these differences.

0803.4262	the blue supergiant sher 25 and its intriguing hourglass nebula	the blue supergiant sher 25 is surrounded by an asymmetric, hourglass-shapedcircumstellar nebula. its structure and dynamics have been studied previouslythrough high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, and it appears dynamicallysimilar to the ring structure around sn 1987a. here we present long-slitspectroscopy of the circumstellar nebula around sher 25, and of the backgroundnebula of the host cluster ngc 3603. we perform a detailed nebular abundanceanalysis to measure the gas-phase abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neonand argon. the oxygen abundance in the circumstellar nebula (12 + log[o/h] =8.61 +/- 0.13 dex) is similar to that in the background nebula (8.56 +/- 0.07),suggesting the composition of the host cluster is around solar. however, weconfirm that the circumstellar nebula is very rich in nitrogen, with anabundance of 8.91 +/- 0.15, compared to the background value of 7.47 +/- 0.18.a new analysis of the stellar spectrum with the fastwind model atmosphere codesuggests that the photospheric nitrogen and oxygen abundances in sher 25 areconsistent with the nebular results. while the nitrogen abundances are high,when compared to stellar evolutionary models they do not unambiguously confirmthat the star has undergone convective dredge-up during a previous redsupergiant phase. we suggest that the more likely scenario is that the nebulawas ejected from the star while it was in the blue supergiant phase. the star'sinitial mass was around 50 m_sun, which is rather too high for it to have had aconvective envelope stage as a red supergiant. rotating stellar models thatlead to mixing of core-processed material to the stellar surface during coreh-burning can quantitatively match the stellar results with the nebulaabundances.

1412.2705	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xix. b-type supergiants - atmospheric  parameters and nitrogen abundances to investigate the role of binarity and  the width of the main sequence	tlusty non-lte model atmosphere calculations have been used to determineatmospheric parameters and nitrogen (n) abundances for 34 single and 18 binaryb-type supergiants (bsgs). the effects of flux contribution from an unseensecondary were considered for the binary sample. we present the firstsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of bsgs across thetheoretical terminal age main sequence (tams). to account for the distributionof effective temperatures of the bsgs it may be necessary to extend the tams tolower temperatures. this is consistent with the derived distribution of massdiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and n abundances,provided that stars cooler than this temperature are post rsg objects. for thebsgs in the tarantula and previous flames surveys, most have small vsini. about10% have larger vsini (&gt;100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no nenhancement. all the cooler bsgs have low vsini of &lt;70km/s and high n abundanceestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blueloop may be important. a lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the smallsample size. single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, canaccount for the n enhancement in both the single and binary samples. thedetailed distribution of n abundances in the single and binary samples may bedifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. thefirst comparative study of single and binary bsgs has revealed that the mainsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending toteff=20000k. some marginal differences in single and binary atmosphericparameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standardevolution for some of the sample. this sample as a whole has implications forseveral aspects of our understanding of the evolution of bsgs. full abstract inpaper

astro-ph;0207031	more nitrogen rich b-type stars in the smc cluster, ngc 330	high resolution spectra of seven early b-type giant/supergiant stars in thesmc cluster ngc330 are analysed to obtain their chemical compositions relativeto smc field and galactic b-type stars. it is found that all seven stars arenitrogen rich with an abundance approximately 1.3 dex higher than an smcmain-sequence field b-type star, av304. they also display evidence fordeficiencies in carbon, but other metals have abundances typical of the smc.given the number of b-type stars with low rotational projected velocities inngc330 (all our targets have vsini &lt; 50 km/s), we suggest that it is unlikelythat the stars in our sample are seen almost pole-on, but rather that they areintrinsically slow rotators. furthermore, none of our objects displays anyevidence of significant balmer emission excluding the possibility that theseare be stars observed pole-on. comparing these results with the predictions ofstellar evolution models including the effects of rotationally induced mixing,we conclude that while the abundance patterns may indeed be reproduced by thesemodels, serious discrepancies exist. most importantly, models including theeffects of initially large rotational velocities do not reproduce the observedrange of effective temperatures of our sample, nor the currently observedrotational velocities. binary models may be able to produce stars in theobserved temperature range but again may be incapable of producing suitableanalogues with low rotational velocities. we also discuss the clear need forstellar evolution calculations employing the correct chemical mix of carbon,nitrogen and oxygen for the smc.

astro-ph;0207198	chemical composition of b-type supergiants in the ob8, ob10, ob48, ob78  associations of m31	absolute and differential chemical abundances are presented for the largestgroup of massive stars in m31 studied to date. these results were derived fromintermediate resolution spectra of seven b-type supergiants, lying within fourob associations covering a galactocentric distance of 5 - 12 kpc. the resultsare mainly based on an lte analysis, and we additionally present a fullnon-lte, unified model atmosphere analysis of one star (ob78-277) todemonstrate the reliability of the differential lte technique. a comparison ofthe stellar oxygen abundance with that of previous nebular results shows thatthere is an offset of between ~0.15 - 0.4 dex between the two methods which iscritically dependent on the empirical calibration adopted for the r23 parameterwith [o/h]. however within the typical errors of the stellar and nebularanalyses (and given the strength of dependence of the nebular results on thecalibration used) the oxygen abundances determined in each method are fairlyconsistent. we determine the radial oxygen abundance gradient from these stars,and do not detect any systematic gradient across this galactocentric range. wefind that the inner regions of m31 are not, as previously thought, very 'metalrich'. our abundances of c, n, o, mg, si, al, s and fe in the m31 supergiantsare very similar to those of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood.

astro-ph;0306160	the chemical composition of two supergiants in the dwarf irregular  galaxy wlm	[abridged] the chemical composition of two stars in wlm has been determinedfrom high quality uves data obtained at the vlt ut2 (program 65.n-0375). themodel atmospheres analysis shows that they have the same metallicity, [fe/h] =-0.38 +/-0.20, and [mg/fe] = -0.24 +/-0.16. this result suggests that the[alpha(mg)/fe] ratio in wlm may be suppressed relative to solar abundances(also supported by differential abundances relative to similar stars in ngc6822and the smc). the absolute mg abundance, [mg/h] = -0.62 is high relative towhat is expected from the nebulae though, where two independent spectroscopicanalyses of the hii regions in wlm yield [o/h] = -0.89. intriguingly, theoxygen abundance determined from the oi 6158 feature in one wlm star is [o/h] =-0.21 +/-0.10, corresponding to five times higher than the nebular oxygenabundance. this is the first time that a significant difference between youngstellar and nebular oxygen abundances has been found, and presently, there isno simple explanation for this difference. if the stellar abundances reflectthe true composition of wlm, then this galaxy lies well above themetallicity-luminosity relationship for dwarf irregular galaxies. it alsosuggests that wlm is more chemically evolved than currently interpreted fromits color-magnitude diagram.

astro-ph;0501228	understanding b-type supergiants in the low metallicity environment of  the smc ii	despite a resurgence of effort over the last decade in the area of massivestars there is still ambiguity over their evolutionary path, contamination oftheir surface abundances and the behaviour of their stellar winds. here 10 smcb-type supergiants are analysed applying a unified model atmosphere codefastwind to intermediate resolution spectra from the eso multi mode instrument(emmi) on the ntt telescope. combined with the 8 targets analysed in paper 1,this work provides observational results on the properties of the winds andchemical compositions of b-type supergiants in the smc. this paper emphasizesand substantiates the implications for stellar evolution from paper 1; thatcurrent theoretical models need to produce larger degrees of surface nitrogenenhancements at lower rotational velocities. in addition a significantdiscrepancy between theoretical and observed mass-loss rates is discussed whichwill have important implications for the rotational velocities obtained fromstellar evolution calculations. furthermore, an initial calibration of thewind-momentum luminosity relationship for b-type supergiants in a lowmetallicity environment (z = 0.004) is presented.

astro-ph;0511758	b-type supergiants in the smc: rotational velocities and implications  for evolutionary models	high-resolution spectra for 24 smc and galactic b-type supergiants have beenanalysed to estimate the contributions of both macroturbulence and rotation tothe broadening of their metal lines. two different methodologies areconsidered, viz. goodness-of-fit comparisons between observed and theoreticalline profiles and identifying zeros in the fourier transforms of the observedprofiles. the advantages and limitations of the two methods are brieflydiscussed with the latter techniques being adopted for estimated projectedrotational velocities (\vsini) but the former being used to estimatemacroturbulent velocities. only one smc supergiant, sk 191, shows a significantdegree of rotational broadening (\vsini $\simeq$ 90 \kms). for the remainingtargets, the distribution of projected rotational velocities are similar inboth our galactic and smc samples with larger values being found at earlierspectral types. there is marginal evidence for the projected rotationalvelocities in the smc being higher than those in the galactic targets but anydifferences are only of the order of 5-10 \kms, whilst evolutionary modelspredict differences in this effective temperature range of typically 20 to 70\kms. the combined sample is consistent with a linear variation of projectedrotational velocity with effective temperature, which would imply rotationalvelocities for supergiants of 70 \kms at an effective temperature of 28 000 k(approximately b0 spectral type) decreasing to 32 \kms at 12 000 k (b8 spectraltype). for all targets, the macroturbulent broadening would appear to beconsistent with a gaussian distribution (although other distributions cannot bediscounted) with an $\frac{1}{e}$ half-width varying from approximately 20 \kmsat b8 to 60 \kms at b0 spectral types.

astro-ph;0511840	massive stars in the smc	in this paper we review the observational data for ob stars in the smcconcentrating on those aspects of their spectra which provide information onprocesses which may strongly influence their evolution, namely mass-loss,rotational mixing and mass-transfer. we illustrate the very weak winds nowthought to pertain to late o-dwarfs in the smc, using hst/stis observations ofthe main sequence in the very young cluster ngc346, briefly discussing thequantitative results for these stars, and the difficulties involved in theirdetermination. we show how stars with similar luminosities can have differentluminosity classes while stars with similar spectral types and luminosityclasses can have significantly different luminosities. while the weak winds ofthe dwarfs present serious difficulties for the determination of wind terminalvelocities we show that the supergiants have terminal velocities comparable toob supergiants in the milky way, agreement with theory. we also summarizerecent work demonstrating that the temperature dependence of wind terminalvelocities does not follow the widely adopted step-like approximation. finallywe review surface compositons of ob stars in the smc finding that 42 out of 45ob stars with detailed surface abundances are enriched in nitrogen by a factor\~10 or more. while these enhancements are consistent with those produced bymodels with rotational mixing the rotational velocities of the sample aresignificantly lower than the values predicted by the modesls, indicating apossible problem with the evolution of angular momentum in the models orpossibly in the efficiency of mixing.

astro-ph;0606403	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: mass loss and rotation of  early-type stars in the smc	we have studied the optical spectra of a sample of 31 o- and early b-typestars in the small magellanic cloud, 21 of which are associated with the youngmassive cluster ngc 346. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method. comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that accountfor stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars arebest represented by an age of 1-3 myr. the present day v_sini distribution ofthe 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotationalvelocity (v_r) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity ofabout 160-190 km/s and an effective half width of 100-150 km/s. the v_rdistribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. ifpredictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive starswithin the environment of the smc are correct, the young age of the clusterimplies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initialrotational velocity distribution. the location in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement withevolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring v_r.the mass loss rates of the smc objects having luminosities of log l/l_sun &gt; 5.4are in excellent agreement with predictions. however, for lower luminositystars the winds are too weak to determine m_dot accurately from the opticalspectrum. two of three spectroscopically classified vz stars from our sampleare located close to the theoretical zero age main sequence, as expected.
