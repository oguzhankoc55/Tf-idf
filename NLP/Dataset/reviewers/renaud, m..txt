0910.3074	discovery of a highly energetic pulsar associated with igr j14003-6326  in a young uncataloged galactic supernova remnant g310.6-1.6	we report the discovery of 31.18 ms pulsations from the integral source igrj14003-6326 using the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). this pulsar is mostlikely associated with the bright chandra x-ray point source lying at thecenter of g310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised galactic composite supernovaremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and x-ray nebula, taken to bethe pulsar wind nebula (pwn). psr j1400-6325 is amongst the most energeticrotation-powered pulsars in the galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of edot =5.1e+37 erg.s-1. in the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magneticfield strength is b_s = 1.1e+12 g and the characteristic age tau_c = p/2pdot =12.7 kyr. the high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indicesof the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,and a 2-10 kev flux ratio f_pwn/f_psr ~ 8. follow-up parkes observationsresulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from psr j1400-6325at a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively largedistance of 10 +/- 3 kpc. however, the resulting location off the galacticplane of ~ 280 pc would be much larger than the typical thickness of themolecular disk, and we argue that g310.6-1.6 lies at a distance of ~ 7 kpc.there is no gamma-ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the fermi datapublished so far. a multi-wavelength study of this new composite supernovaremnant, from radio to very-high energy gamma-rays, suggests a young (&lt; 1000yr) system, formed by a sub-energetic (~ 1e+50 ergs), low ejecta mass (m_ej ~ 3msun) sn explosion that occurred in a low-density environment (n_0 ~ 0.01cm-3).

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1207.6285	constraints on cosmic-ray efficiency in the supernova remnant rcw 86  using multi-wavelength observations	several young supernova remnants (snrs) have recently been detected in thehigh-energy and very-high-energy gamma-ray domains. as exemplified by rxj1713.7-3946, the nature of this emission has been hotly debated, and directevidence for the efficient acceleration of cosmic-ray protons at the snr shocksstill remains elusive. we analyzed more than 40 months of data acquired by thelarge area telescope (lat) on-board the fermi gamma-ray space telescope in thehe domain, and gathered all of the relevant multi-wavelength (from radio to vhegamma-rays) information about the broadband nonthermal emission from rcw 86.for this purpose, we re-analyzed the archival x-ray data from the asca/gasimaging spectrometer (gis), the xmm-newton/epic-mos, and the rxte/proportionalcounter array (pca). beyond the expected galactic diffuse background, nosignificant gamma-ray emission in the direction of rcw 86 is detected in any ofthe 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 gev fermi-lat maps. in the hadronic scenario, thederived he upper limits together with the hess measurements in the vhe domaincan only be accommodated by a spectral index gamma &lt;= 1.8, i.e. a valuein-between the standard (test-particle) index and the asymptotic limit oftheoretical particle spectra in the case of strongly modified shocks. theinterpretation of the gamma-ray emission by inverse compton scattering of highenergy electrons reproduces the multi-wavelength data using a reasonable valuefor the average magnetic field of 15-25 mug. for these two scenarios, weassessed the level of acceleration efficiency. we discuss these results in thelight of existing estimates of the magnetic field strength, the effectivedensity and the acceleration efficiency in rcw 86.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1209.0582	gamma-ray signatures of cosmic ray acceleration, propagation, and  confinement in the era of cta	galactic cosmic rays are commonly believed to be accelerated at supernovaremnants via diffusive shock acceleration. despite the popularity of this idea,a conclusive proof for its validity is still missing. gamma-ray astronomyprovides us with a powerful tool to tackle this problem, because gamma rays areproduced during cosmic ray interactions with the ambient gas. the detection ofgamma rays from several supernova remnants is encouraging, but still does notconstitute a proof of the scenario, the main problem being the difficulty indisentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the emission. oncereleased by their sources, cosmic rays diffuse in the interstellar medium, andfinally escape from the galaxy. the diffuse gamma-ray emission from thegalactic disk, as well as the gamma-ray emission detected from a few galaxiesis largely due to the interactions of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.on much larger scales, cosmic rays are also expected to permeate theintracluster medium, since they can be confined and accumulated within clustersof galaxies for cosmological times. thus, the detection of gamma rays fromclusters of galaxies, or even upper limits on their emission, will allow us toconstrain the cosmic ray output of the sources they contain, such as normalgalaxies, agns, and cosmological shocks. in this paper, we describe the impactthat the cherenkov telescope array, a future ground-based facility forvery-high energy gamma-ray astronomy, is expected to have in this field ofresearch.

1212.4156	a new nearby pulsar wind nebula overlapping the rx j0852.0-4622  supernova remnant	energetic pulsars can be embedded in a nebula of relativistic leptons whichis powered by the dissipation of the rotational energy of the pulsar. theobject psr j0855-4644 is an energetic and fast-spinning pulsar (edot =1.1x10^36 erg/s, p=65 ms) discovered near the south-east rim of the supernovaremnant (snr) rx j0852.0-4622 (aka vela jr) by the parkes multibeam survey. theposition of the pulsar is in spatial coincidence with an enhancement in x-raysand tev gamma-rays, which could be due to its putative pulsar wind nebula(pwn).  the purpose of this study is to search for diffuse non-thermal x-ray emissionaround psr j0855-4644 to test for the presence of a pwn and to estimate thedistance to the pulsar. an x-ray observation was carried out with thexmm-newton satellite to constrain the properties of the pulsar and its nebula.the absorption column density derived in x-rays from the pulsar and fromdifferent regions of the rim of the snr was compared with the absorptionderived from the atomic (hi) and molecular (12co) gas distribution along thecorresponding lines of sight to estimate the distance of the pulsar and of thesnr.  the observation has revealed the x-ray counterpart of the pulsar togetherwith surrounding extended emission thus confirming the existence of a pwn. thecomparison of column densities provided an upper limit to the distance of thepulsar psr j0855-4644 and the snr rx j0852.0-4622 (d&lt;900 pc). although bothobjects are at compatible distances, we rule out that the pulsar and the snrare associated. with this revised distance, psr j0855-4644 is the second mostenergetic pulsar, after the vela pulsar, within a radius of 1 kpc and couldtherefore contribute to the local cosmic-ray e-/e+ spectrum.

1404.1613	tev {\gamma}-ray observations of the young synchrotron-dominated snrs  g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 with h.e.s.s	the non-thermal nature of the x-ray emission from the shell-type supernovaremnants (snrs) g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 is an indication of intense particleacceleration in the shock fronts of both objects. this suggests that the snrsare prime candidates for very-high-energy (vhe; e $&gt;$ 0.1 tev) {\gamma}-rayobservations. g1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known snr in thegalaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of snrevolution in the vhe domain. the purpose of this work is to probe the level ofvhe {\gamma}-ray emission from both snrs and use this to constrain theirphysical properties. observations were conducted with the h.e.s.s. (high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1506.02307	study of tev shell supernova remnants at gamma-ray energies	the breakthrough developments of cherenkov telescopes in the last decade haveled to angular resolution of 0.1{\deg} and an unprecedented sensitivity. thishas allowed the current generation of cherenkov telescopes to discover apopulation of supernova remnants (snrs) radiating in very-high-energy (vhe,e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rays. a number of those vhe snrs exhibit a shell-typemorphology spatially coincident with the shock front of the snr. the members ofthis vhe shell snr club are rx j1713.7-3946, vela jr, rcw 86, sn 1006, and hessj1731-347. the latter two objects have been poorly studied in high-energy (he,0.1&lt;e&lt;100 gev) gamma-rays and need to be investigated in order to draw theglobal picture of this class of snrs and constrain the characteristics of theunderlying population of accelerated particles. using 6 years of fermi p7reprocessed data, we studied the he counterpart of the snrs hess j1731-347 andsn 1006. the two snrs are not detected in the data and given that there is nohint of detection, we do not expect any detection in the coming years from thesnrs. however in both cases, we derived upper limits that significantlyconstrain the gamma-ray emission mechanism and can rule out a standard hadronicscenario with a confidence level &gt; 5 sigma. with this fermi analysis, we nowhave a complete view of the he to vhe gamma-ray emission of tev shell snrs. allfive sources have a hard he photon index (&lt;1.8) suggesting a common scenariowhere the bulk of the emission is produced by accelerated electrons radiatingfrom radio to vhe gamma-rays through synchrotron and inverse compton processes.in addition when correcting for the distance, all snrs show a surprisinglysimilar gamma-ray luminosity supporting the idea of a common emissionmechanism. while the gamma-ray emission is likely to be leptonic dominated,this does not rule out efficient hadron acceleration in those snrs.

1509.00879	probing efficient cosmic-ray acceleration in young supernovae	the formation of a core collapse supernovae (sne) results in a fast (but non-or mildly-relativistic) shock wave expanding outwards into the surroundingmedium. the medium itself is likely modified due to the stellar mass-loss fromthe massive star progenitor, which may be wolf-rayet stars (for type ib/c sne),red supergiant stars (for type iip and perhaps iib and iil sne), or some otherstellar type. the wind mass-loss parameters determine the density structure ofthe surrounding medium. combined with the velocity of the sn shock wave, thisregulates the shock acceleration process. in this article we discuss theessential parameters that control the particle acceleration and gamma-rayemission in sne, with particular reference to the type iib sn 1993j. the shockwave expanding into the high density medium leads to fast particleacceleration, giving rise to rapidly-growing plasma instabilities driven by theacceleration process itself. the instabilities grow over intraday timescales.this growth, combined with the interplay of non-linear processes, results inthe amplification of the magnetic field at the shock front, which canadequately account for the magnetic field strengths deduced from radiomonitoring of the source. the maximum particle energy can reach, and perhapsexceed, 1 pev, depending on the dominant instability. the gamma-ray signal isfound to be heavily absorbed by pair production process during the first weekafter the outburst. we derive the time dependent particle spectra andassociated hadronic signatures of secondary particles (gamma-ray, leptons andneutrinos) arising from proton proton interactions. we find that the cherenkovtelescope array (cta) should be able to detect objects like sn 1993j above 1tev. we predict a low neutrino flux above 10 tev, implying a detectabilityhorizon with current or planned neutrino telescopes of 1 mpc.

astro-ph;0505191	integral igr j18135-1751=hess j1813-178: a new cosmic high energy  accelerator from kev to tev	we report the discovery of a soft gamma ray source, namely igr j18135-1751,detected with the ibis imager on board the integral satellite. the source ispersistent and has a 20-100 kev luminosity of $\sim$5.7 $\times$ 10$^{34}$ ergs$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 4kpc). this source is coincident with one ofthe eight unidentified objects recently reported by the hess collaboration aspart of the first tev survey of the inner part of the galaxy. two of these newsources found along the galactic plane, hess j1813-178 and hess j1614-518, haveno obvious lower energy counterpart, a fact that motivated the suggestion thatthey might be dark cosmic ray accelerators. hess j1813-178 has a stronglyabsorbed x-ray counterpart, the asca source agps273.4-17.8, showing a power lawspectrum with photon index $\sim$ 1.8 and a total (galactic plus intrinsic)absorption corresponding to n$_h$ $\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. wehypothesize that the source is a pulsar wind nebula embedded in its supernovaremnant. the lack of x/gamma-ray variability, the radio morphology and the ascaspectrum are all compatible with this interpretation. in any case we rule outthe hypothesis that hess j1813-178 belongs to a new class of tev objects orthat it is a cosmic "dark particle" accelerator.

astro-ph;0507660	the integral/ibis source axj1838.0-0655: a soft x-ray to tev gamma-ray  broad band emitter	we report on integral observations of ax j1838.0-0655, one of theunidentified objects listed in the first ibis/isgri survey catalogue andlocated in the scutum arm region. this object, detected in the 20-300 kev bandat a confidence level of 15.3 sigma (9 x 10^-11 erg cm-2 s-1) is the likelycounterpart of the still unidentified tev source hess j1837-069. it has beendetected in the past by various x-ray telescopes, including asca, implying thatit is a persistent rather than a transient source; the asca image is compatiblewith the source not being resolved. the broad 1-300 kev spectrum ischaracterized by an absorbed (nh = 6.7+/-1.3 x 10^22 cm-2) and hard (gamma =1.5+/- 0.2) power law continuum. possible counterparts (radio and infrared)present within the x-ray error box are discussed, even if no clear associationcan be identified. the broad band spectrum together with the tev detectionsuggests that ax j1838.0-0655 maybe a supernova remnant or a pulsar windnebula, which has so far eluded detection in the radio band. this is the secondunidentified hess source that shows a substantial soft gamma-ray emission.

astro-ph;0512627	integral detection of hard x-rays from ngc 6334: nonthermal emission  from colliding winds or an agn?	we report the detection of hard x-ray emission from the field of thestar-forming region ngc 6334 with the the international gamma-ray astrophysicslaboratory integral. the jem-x monitor and isgri imager aboard integral andchandra acis imager were used to construct 3-80 kev images and spectra of ngc6334. the 3-10 kev and 10-35 kev images made with jem-x show a complexstructure of extended emission from ngc 6334. the isgri source detected in theenergy ranges 20-40 kev and 40-80 kev coincides with the ngc 6334 ridge. the20-60 kev flux from the source is (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11) erg cm(-2) s(-1).spectral analysis of the source revealed a hard power-law component with aphoton index about 1. the observed x-ray fluxes are in agreement withextrapolations of x-ray imaging observations of ngc 6334 by chandra acis andasca gis. the x-ray data are consistent with two very different physicalmodels. a probable scenario is emission from a heavily absorbed, compact andhard chandra source that is associated with the agn candidate radio source ngc6334b. another possible model is the extended chandra source of nonthermalemission from ngc 6334 that can also account for the hard x-ray emissionobserved by integral. the origin of the emission in this scenario is due toelectron acceleration in energetic outflows from massive early type stars. thepossibility of emission from a young supernova remnant, as suggested by earlierinfrared observations of ngc 6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44tilines.

astro-ph;0609676	on the nature of the hard x-ray source igr j2018+4043	we found a very likely counterpart to the recently discovered hard x-raysource igr j2018+4043 in the multi-wavelength observations of the source field.the source, originally discovered in the 20-40 kev band, is now confidentlydetected also in the 40-80 kev band, with a flux of (1.4 +/- 0.4) x 10(-11) ergcm(-2) s(-1). a 5 ks swift observation of the igr j2018+4043 field revealed ahard point-like source with the observed 0.5-10 kev flux of 3.4(+0.7)(-0.8) x10(-12) erg cm(-2) s(-1) (90% confidence level) at alpha = 20h18m38.55s, delta= +40d41m00.4s (with a 4.2" uncertainty). the combined swift-integral spectrumcan be described by an absorbed power-law model with photon index gamma = 1.3+/- 0.2 and n_h = 6.1(+3.2)(-2.2) x 10(22) cm(-2). in archival optical andinfrared data we found a slightly extended and highly absorbed object at theswift source position. there is also an extended vla 1.4 ghz source peaked at abeam-width distance from the optical and x-ray positions. the observedmorphology and multiwavelength spectra of igr j2018+4043 are consistent withthose expected for an obscured accreting object, i.e. an agn or a galacticx-ray binary. the identification suggests possible connection of igr j2018+4043to the bright gamma-ray source gev j2020+4023 (3eg j2020+4017) detected by cosb and cgro egret in the gamma-cygni snr field.

0811.1559	pulsar wind nebula candidates recently discovered by h.e.s.s	h.e.s.s. is currently the most sensitive instrument in the very-high-energygamma-ray domain and has revealed many new sources along the galactic plane, asignificant fraction of which seems to be associated with energetic pulsars.hess j1825-137 and vela x are considered to be the prototypes of such sourcesin which the large vhe nebula results from the whole history of the pulsar windand the supernova remnant host, both evolving in a complex interstellar medium.these nebulae are seen to be offset from the pulsar position and, for hessj1825-137, a spectral steepening at increasing distance from the pulsar hasbeen measured. in this context, updated h.e.s.s. results on two previouslypublished sources, namely hess j1809-193 and hess j1912+101, and preliminaryresults on the newly discovered hess j1356-645, are presented. these extendedvhe sources are thought to be associated with the energetic pulsars psrj1809-1917, psr j1913+1011 and psr j1357-6429, respectively. properties of eachsource in the vhe regime, together with those measured in the radio and x-raydomains, are discussed.
