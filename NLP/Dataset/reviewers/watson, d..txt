0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

1010.1783	a nearby grb host prototype for z~7 lyman-break galaxies: spitzer-irs  and x-shooter spectroscopy of the host galaxy of grb031203	gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies have been studied extensively in opticalphotometry and spectroscopy. here we present the first mid-infrared spectrum ofa grb host, hg031203. it is one of the nearest grb hosts at z=0.1055, allowingboth low and high-resolution spectroscopy with spitzer-irs. medium resolutionuv-to-k-band spectroscopy with the x-shooter spectrograph on the vlt is alsopresented, along with spitzer irac and mips photometry, as well as radio andsub-mm observations. these data allow us to construct a uv-to-radio spectralenergy distribution with almost complete spectroscopic coverage from 0.3-35micron of a grb host galaxy for the first time, potentially valuable as atemplate for future model comparisons. the irs spectra show strong,high-ionisation fine structure line emission indicative of a hard radiationfield in the galaxy, suggestive of strong ongoing star-formation and a veryyoung stellar population. the selection of hg031203 via the presence of a grbsuggests that it might be a useful analogue of very young star-forming galaxiesin the early universe, and hints that local bcds may be used as more reliableanalogues of star-formation in the early universe than typical localstarbursts. we look at the current debate on the ages of the dominant stellarpopulations in z~7 and z~8 galaxies in this context. the nebular line emissionis so strong in hg031203, that at z~7, it can reproduce the spectral energydistributions of z-band dropout galaxies with elevated irac 3.6 and 4.5 micronfluxes without the need to invoke a 4000a break.

1011.1009	the metallicity of gamma-ray burst environments from high energy  observations	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and their early afterglows ionise their circumburstmaterial. only high-energy spectroscopy therefore, allows examination of thematter close to the burst itself. soft x-ray absorption allows an estimate tobe made of the total column density in metals. the detection of the x-rayafterglow can also be used to place a limit on the total gas column along theline of sight based on the compton scattering opacity. such a limit wouldenable, for the first time, the determination of lower limits on themetallicity in the circumburst environments of grbs. in this paper, wedetermine the limits that can be placed on the total gas column density in thevicinities of grbs based on the compton scattering. we simulate the effects ofcompton scattering on a collimated beam of high energy photons passing througha shell of high column density material to determine the expected lightcurves,luminosities, and spectra. we compare these predictions to observations, anddetermine what limits can realistically be placed on the total gas columndensity. the smearing out of pulses in the lightcurve from compton scatteringis not likely to be observable, and its absence does not place strongconstraints on the compton depth for grbs. however, the distribution ofobserved luminosities of bursts allows us to place statistical, model-dependentlimits that are typically &lt;~1e25 cm^{-2} for less luminous bursts, and as lowas ~1e24 cm$^{-2} for the most luminous. using the shape of the high-energybroadband spectrum, however, in some favourable cases, limits as low as ~5e24cm^{-2} can placed on individual bursts, implying metallicity lower limits fromx- and gamma-rays alone from 0 up to 0.01 z/zsun. at extremely high redshifts,this limit would be at least 0.02 z/z_sun, enough to discriminate populationiii from non-primordial grbs.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1109.3167	the dark grb080207 in an extremely red host and the implications for  grbs in highly obscured environments	[abridged] we present comprehensive x-ray, optical, near- and mid-infrared,and sub-mm observations of grb 080207 and its host galaxy. the afterglow wasundetected in the optical and near-ir, implying an optical to x-ray index &lt;0.3,identifying grb 080207 as a dark burst. swift x-ray observations show extremeabsorption in the host, which is confirmed by the unusually large opticalextinction found by modelling the x-ray to nir afterglow spectral energydistribution. our chandra observations obtained 8 days post-burst allow us toplace the afterglow on the sky to sub-arcsec accuracy, enabling us to pinpointan extremely red galaxy (ero). follow-up host observations with hst, spitzer,gemini, keck and the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) provide a photometricredshift solution of z ~1.74 (+0.05,-0.06) (1 sigma), 1.56 &lt; z &lt; 2.08 at 2sigma) for the ero host, and suggest that it is a massive and morphologicallydisturbed ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) system, with l_fir ~ 2.4 x10^12 l_solar. these results add to the growing evidence that grbs originatingin very red hosts always show some evidence of dust extinction in theirafterglows (though the converse is not true -- some extinguished afterglows arefound in blue hosts). this indicates that a poorly constrained fraction of grbsoccur in very dusty environments. by comparing the inferred stellar masses, andestimates of the gas phase metallicity in both grb hosts and sub-mm galaxies wesuggest that many grb hosts, even at z&gt;2 are at lower metallicity than thesub-mm galaxy population, offering a likely explanation for the dearth ofsub-mm detected grb hosts. however, we also show that the dark grb hosts aresystematically more massive than those hosting optically bright events, perhapsimplying that previous host samples are severely biased by the exclusion ofdark events.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1205.4239	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. vi. radio observations  at z&lt;1 and consistency with typical star-forming galaxies	the objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured starformation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb)hosts; and to test the hypothesis that grb hosts have properties consistentwith those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. we present a radiocontinuum survey of all z&lt;1 grb hosts in the optically unbiased grb host(tough) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-swift) grb-snhosts discovered before october 2006. we present new radio data for 22 objectsand have obtained a detection for three of them (grb 980425, 021211, 031203;none in the tough sample), increasing the number of radio-detected grb hostsfrom two to five. the star formation rate (sfr) for the grb 021211 host of ~825mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a grb host, places it in the categoryof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. we found that at least 63% of grb hostshave sfr &lt; 100 mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have sfr &gt; 500 mo yr^-1. for theundetected hosts the mean radio flux (&lt;35 ujy 3sigma) corresponds to an averagesfr &lt; 15 mo yr^-1. moreover, ~88% of the z&lt;1 grb hosts have ultraviolet dustattenuation a_uv &lt; 6.7 mag (visual attenuation a_v &lt; 3 mag). hence we did notfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of grb hosts. finally,we found that the distributions of sfrs and a_uv of grb hosts are consistentwith those of lyman break galaxies, halpha emitters at similar redshifts and ofgalaxies from cosmological simulations. the similarity of the grb populationwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that grbs, aleast at z&lt;1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are thereforeless biased indicators than once thought.

0712.2186	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts. i. comparing pre-swift and  swift era long/soft (type ii) grb optical afterglows	we have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of swift-era gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows including grbs up toseptember 2009, for a total of 76 grbs, and present an additional threepre-swift grbs not included in an earlier sample. furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 grb afterglows,including large data sets for grbs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820a, 050922c,060418, 080413a and 080810. we analyzed the light curves of all grbs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-swift afterglows. theresults of a former study, which showed that grb afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. we found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(swift-era and pre-swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. we derived bolometric isotropic energies for all grbs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the grb in thez=1 system. a comparative study of the optical luminosities of grb afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1311.2356	high redshift standard candles: predicted cosmological constraints	we investigate whether future measurements of high redshift standard candles(hzscs) will be a powerful probe of dark energy, when compared to other typesof planned dark energy measurements. active galactic nuclei and gamma raybursts have both been proposed as potential hzsc candidates. due to their highluminosity, they can be used to probe unexplored regions in the expansionhistory of the universe. information from these regions can help constrain theproperties of dark energy, and in particular, whether it varies over time.  we consider both linear and piecewise parameterizations of the dark energyequation of state, $w(z)$, and assess the optimal redshift distribution ahigh-redshift standard-candle survey could take to constrain these models.  the more general the form of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ beingtested, the more useful high-redshift standard candles become. for a linearparameterization of $w(z)$, hzscs give only small improvements over plannedsupernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements; a wide redshift rangewith many low redshift points is optimal to constrain this linear model.however to constrain a general, and thus potentially more informative, form of$w(z)$, having many hzscs can significantly improve limits on the nature ofdark energy.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

0803.1919	the spectral lag of grb060505: a likely member of the long duration  class	two long gamma-ray bursts, grb 060505 and grb 060614, occurred in nearbygalaxies at redshifts of 0.089 and 0.125 respectively. due to their proximityand durations, deep follow-up campaigns to search for supernovae (sne) wereinitiated. however none were found in either case, to limits more than twoorders of magnitude fainter than the prototypical grb-associated sn, 1998bw. itwas suggested that the bursts, in spite of their durations (4 and 102 s),belonged to the population of short grbs which has been shown to be unrelatedto sne. in the case of grb 060614 this argument was based on a number ofindicators, including the negligible spectral lag, which is consistent withthat of short bursts. grb 060505 has a shorter duration, but no spectral lagwas measured. we present the spectral lag measurements of grb 060505 usingsuzakus wide area monitor and the swift burst alert telescope. we find that thelag is 0.36+/- 0.05 s, inconsistent with the lags of short bursts andconsistent with the properties of long bursts and sn-grbs. these resultssupport the association of grb 060505 with other low-luminosity grbs also foundin star-forming galaxies and indicates that at least some massive stars may diewithout bright sne.

0803.2235	on the distribution of stellar masses in gamma-ray burst host galaxies	we analyse spitzer images of 30 long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) hostgalaxies. we estimate their total stellar masses (m*) based on the rest-framek-band luminosities (l_krest) and constrain their star formation rates (sfrs,not corrected for dust extinction) based on the rest-frame uv continua.further, we compute a mean m*/l_krest = 0.45 msun/lsun. we find that the hostsare low m*, star-forming systems. the median m* in our sample (&lt;m*&gt; = 10^9.7msun) is lower than that of "field" galaxies (e.g., gemini deep deep survey).the range spanned by m* is 10^7 msun &lt; m* &lt; 10^11 msun, while the range spannedby the dust-uncorrected uv sfr is 10^-2 msun yr^-1 &lt; sfr &lt; 10 msun yr^-1. thereis no evidence for intrinsic evolution in the distribution of m* with redshift.we show that extinction by dust must be present in at least 25% of the grbhosts in our sample and suggest that this is a way to reconcile our finding ofa relatively lower uv-based, specific sfr (phi = sfr/m*) with previous claimsthat grbs have some of the highest phi values. we also examine the effect thatthe inability to resolve the star-forming regions in the hosts has on phi.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

[s iv] emission at 10.5 micron was detected inthree of four h2 galaxies and in one seyfert 2 galaxy. the ratio of the 7.7\textmu m pah feature to the continuum at 7.7 micron (pah l/c) divides theeight smps at a ratio greater than 0.8 for h2 and less than 0.8 for seyfertgalaxies. an anti-correlation between pah l/c and the ratio of the continuumflux at 5.9 micron to the flux at 60 micron is found, similar to that found inultraluminous infrared galaxies. silicate absorption at approximately 9.7micron was observed in the seyfert 2 galaxy, iras 04385-0828 and in iras03344-2103. the previously unclassified smp galaxy iras 03344-2103 is probablya seyfert 2.

astro-ph;0009202	asca and other contemporaneous observations of the blazar b2 1308+326	the high redshift (z=0.997) blazar b2 1308+326 was observed contemporaneouslyat x-ray, optical and radio wavelengths in june 1996. the x-ray observationswere performed with asca. the asca results were found to be consistent withreanalysed data from two earlier rosat observations. the combined asca androsat data reveal an x-ray spectrum that is best fit by a broken power law withabsorber model. the break in the x-ray spectrum is interpreted, to be theemerging importance of inverse compton (ic) emission which dominates the ascaspectrum. the faint optical state reported for these observations(m_v=18.3+/-0.25) is incompatible with the high synchrotron flux previouslydetected by rosat. the ic emission detected by both rosat and asca was notsignificantly affected by the large change in the synchrotron component. mgiiemission was detected with an equivalent width (ew) significantly differentfrom previously reported values. absorption at a level of in excess of thegalactic value was detected, indicating the possible presence of a foregroundabsorber. a gravitational microlensing scenario cannot therefore be ruled outfor this blazar. b2 1308+326 could be a typical radio-selected bl lac in termsof peak synchrotron frequency and optical and radio variability but its highbolometric luminosity, variable line emission and high doppler boost factormake it appear more like a quasar than a bl lac. it is suggested that b21308+326 be considered as the prototype of this class of composite source.

astro-ph;0204075	the signature of supernova ejecta measured in the x-ray afterglow of  gamma-ray burst 011211	since their identification with cosmological distances, gamma-ray bursts(grbs) have been recognised as the most energetic phenomena in the universe,with an isotropic burst energy as high as 10^54 ergs. however, the progenitorsresponsible for the bursts remain elusive, favoured models ranging from aneutron star binary merger, to the collapse of a massive star. crucial to ourunderstanding of the origins of grbs is the study of the afterglow emission,where spectroscopy can reveal details of the environment of the burst. here wereport on an xmm-newton observation of the x-ray afterglow of grb 011211. thex-ray spectrum reveals evidence for emission lines of magnesium, silicon,sulphur, argon, calcium, and possibly nickel, arising in enriched material withan outflow velocity of order 0.1c. this is the first direct measurement ofoutflowing matter in a gamma ray burst. the observations strongly favour modelswhere a supernova explosion from a massive stellar progenitor precedes theburst event and is responsible for the outflowing matter.

astro-ph;0506101	on the afterglow and host galaxy of grb021004: a comprehensive study  with the hubble space telescope	(abridged) we report on hst observations of the late-time afterglow and hostgalaxy of grb021004 (z=2.33). although this grb is one of the best observed sofar, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations ofdata sets on this burst in the literature. we have observed the field ofgrb021004 with the hst at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 monthsafter the burst. with stis spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700aain the restframe. from the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of thelyman-limit we constrain the hi column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 basedon acs and nicmos imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromaticallywithin the errors. the color changes observed by other authors during the firstfour days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on anafterglow component with a constant spectral shape. this achromaticity impliesthat the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of thespectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. the optical-to-x-ray slope isconsistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. thisindicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according tofireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.the late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and isinconsistent with a single power-law. this could be due to a late-timeflattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due toexcess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. the host is astarburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong ly-alpha emission.the afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the hostsuggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.

astro-ph;0509424	multi-wavelength studies of the optically dark gamma-ray burst 001025a	we identify the fading x-ray afterglow of grb 001025a from xmm-newtonobservations obtained 1.9-2.3 days, 2 years, and 2.5 years after the burst. thenon-detection of an optical counterpart to an upper limit of r=25.5, 1.20 daysafter the burst, makes grb 001025a a ``dark'' burst. based on the x-rayafterglow spectral properties of grb 001025a, we argue that some bursts appearoptically dark because their afterglow is faint and their cooling frequency isclose to the x-ray band. this interpretation is applicable to several of thefew other dark bursts where the x-ray spectral index has been measured. thex-ray afterglow flux of grb 001025a is an order of magnitude lower than fortypical long-duration gamma-ray bursts. the spectrum of the x-ray afterglow canbe fitted with an absorbed synchrotron emission model, an absorbed thermalplasma model, or a combination thereof. for the latter, an extrapolation tooptical wavelengths can be reconciled with the r-band upper limit on theafterglow, without invoking any optical circumburst absorption, provided thecooling frequency is close to the x-ray band. alternatively, if the x-rayafterglow is due to synchrotron emission only, seven magnitudes of extinctionin the observed r-band is required to meet the r-band upper limit, making grb001025a much more obscured than bursts with detected optical afterglows. basedon the column density of x-ray absorbing circumburst matter, an smc gas-to-dustratio is insufficient to produce this amount of extinction. the x-ray tail ofthe prompt emission enters a steep temporal decay excluding that the tail ofthe prompt emission is the onset of the afterglow (abridged).

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0510404	low-resolution vlt spectroscopy of grbs 991216, 011211 and 021211	we present low-resolution vlt spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-raybursts (grbs) 991216, 011211 and 021211. our spectrum of grb991216 is the onlyoptical spectrum for this afterglow. it shows two probable absorption systemsat z=0.80 and z=1.02, where the highest redshift most likely reflects thedistance to the host galaxy. a third system may be detected at z=0.77. hstimaging of the field, obtained 4 months after the burst, has resulted in thedetection of two amorphous regions of emission, one at the projected afterglowposition, and the other 0.6" away. the spectrum shows a depression in flux inbetween 4000 a and 5500 a. this could be the result of a 2175 a-type extinctionfeature in the host of grb991216, but at a rather red wavelength of 2360 a. ifthis interpretation is correct, it is the first time the extinction feature isseen in a grb afterglow spectrum. it is centered at a wavelength similar tothat of the ultra-violet (uv) bumps inferred from observations of a fewuv-strong, hydrogen-poor stars in the galaxy. all significant absorption lines(except for one) detected in the spectrum of grb011211 are identified withlines originating in a single absorption system at z=2.142+/-0.002, theredshift of the grb011211 host galaxy. we also detect the lyman alphaabsorption line in the host, to which we fit a neutral hydrogen column densityof log n(hi)=20.4+/-0.2, which indicates that it is a damped lyman alphasystem. using a curve-of-growth analysis, we estimate the si, fe and almetallicity at the grb011211 redshift. for grb021211, we detect a singleemission line in a spectrum obtained tens of days after the burst, which weidentify as [oii] 3727 at z=1.006. the corresponding unobscured [oii]star-formation rate is 1.4 msun/yr.

astro-ph;0602444	probing cosmic chemical evolution with gamma-ray bursts: grb060206 at  z=4.048	aim: we present early optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-rayburst grb 060206 with the aim of determining the metallicity of the grbabsorber and the physical conditions in the circumburst medium. we also discusshow grbs may be important complementary probes of cosmic chemical evolution.method: absorption line study of the grb afterglow spectrum. results: wedetermine the redshift of the grb to be z=4.04795+/-0.00020. based on themeasurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped lyman-alphaline and the metal content from weak, unsaturated sii lines we derive ametallicity of [s/h] =-0.84+/-0.10. this is one of the highest metallicitiesmeasured from absorption lines at z~4. from the very high column densities forthe forbidden siii*, oi*, and oi** lines we infer very high densities and lowtemperatures in the system. there is evidence for the presence of h$_2$molecules with logn(h_2) ~ 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of logf\~ -3.5 with f=2n(h_2)/(2n(h_2)+ n(hi)). even if grbs are only formed by singlemassive stars with metallicities below ~0.3z(solar), they could still be fairlyunbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z&gt;2. hence, metallicitiesas derived for grb060206 here for a complete sample of grb afterglows willdirectly show the distribution of metallicities for representative star-forminggalaxies at these redshifts.

astro-ph;0603495	supernova 2006aj and the associated x-ray flash 060218	we have studied the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (grb) of february 18,2006. this is a nearby long grb, with a very low peak energy, and is thereforeclassified as an x-ray flash (xrf). xrf 060218 is clearly associated with asupernova -- dubbed sn 2006aj. we present early spectra for sn 2006aj as wellas optical lightcurves reaching out to 50 days past explosion. our opticallightcurves define the rise times, the lightcurve shapes and the absolutemagnitudes in the u, v and r bands, and we compare these data with data forother relevant supernovae. sn 2006aj evolved quite fast, somewhat similarly tosn 2002ap, but not as fast as sn 1994i. our spectra show the evolution of thesupernova over the peak, when the u-band portion of the spectrum rapidly fadesdue to extensive line blanketing. we compare to similar spectra of veryenergetic type ic supernovae. our first spectra are earlier than spectra forany other grb-sn. the spectrum taken 12 days after burst in the rest frame issimilar to somewhat later spectra of both sn 1998bw and sn 2003dh, implying arapid early evolution. this is consistent with the fast lightcurve.  from the narrow emission lines from the host galaxy we derive a redshift ofz=0.0331+-0.0007. this makes xrf 060218 the second closest gamma-ray burstdetected. the flux of these emission lines indicate a high-excitation state,and a modest metallicity and star formation rate of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0604153	are short gamma-ray bursts collimated? grb050709, a flare but no break	from the small sample of afterglow lightcurves of short duration gamma-raybursts (grbs), the decays are rapid, roughly following a power-law in time. ithas been assumed that the afterglow emission in short grbs is collimated injets in the same way as in long grbs. an achromatic break in a short grbafterglow lightcurve would therefore be strong evidence in favour ofcollimation in short grbs. we examine the optical lightcurve of the afterglowof the short grb 050709, the only short grb where a jet break has been claimedfrom optical data. we show that (1) the decay follows a single power-law from1.4 to 19 days after the burst and has a decay index alpha =1.73_{-0.04}^{+0.11}, (2) that an optical flare at ~10 days is required by thedata, roughly contemporaneous with a flare in the x-ray data, and (3) thatthere is no evidence for a break in the lightcurve. this means that so farthere is no direct evidence for collimation in the outflows of short grbs. theavailable limits on the collimation angles in short grbs now strongly suggestmuch wider opening angles than found in long grbs.

astro-ph;0609450	hi column densities of z &gt; 2 swift gamma-ray bursts	context: before the launch of the swift satellite, the majority of thegamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows for which ly-alpha was redshifted into theobservable spectrum showed evidence for a damped ly-alpha absorber. this smallsample indicated that grbs explode either in galaxies, or regions within them,having high neutral hydrogen column densities.  aims: to increase the spectroscopic sample of grbs with z &gt; 2 and henceestablish the n(hi) distribution along grb lines-of-sight.  methods: we have obtained six z &gt; 2 grb afterglow spectra and fitted thely-alpha absorption line in each case to determine n(hi). this has beencomplemented with 12 other swift n(hi) values from the literature.  results: we show that the peak of the grb n(hi) distribution is qualitativelyconsistent with a model where grbs originate in galactic-like molecular clouds.however, a systematic difference, in particular an excess of low column-densitysystems compared to the predictions, indicates that selection effects andconditions within the cloud (e.g. strong ionization) influence the observedn(hi) range. we also report the discovery of ly-alpha emission from the grb060714 host, corresponding to a star-formation rate of approximately 0.8m_sun/year. finally, we present accurate redshifts of the six bursts: z = 3.240+/- 0.001 (grb 050319), z = 2.198 +/- 0.002 (grb 050922c), z = 3.221 +/- 0.001(grb 060526), z = 3.425 +/- 0.002 (grb 060707), z = 2.711 +/- 0.001 (grb060714) and z = 3.686 +/- 0.002 (grb 060906).

astro-ph;0701736	the nature of the x-ray flash of august 24 2005	we present comprehensive photometric r-band observations of the fadingoptical afterglow of the x-ray flash xrf050824, from 11 minutes to 104 daysafter the burst. the r-band lightcurve of the afterglow resembles thelightcurves of long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a power-law albeitwith a rather shallow slope of alpha=0.6. our late r-band images reveal thehost galaxy with a rest-frame b-band luminosity corresponding to roughly 0.5lstar. the star-formation rate as determined from the [o ii] emission lineluminosity is about 1.8 msun per year. when accounting for the hostcontribution, the slope is alpha=0.65+-0.01 and a break in the lightcurve isalso suggested. a potential lightcurve bump at 2 weeks can be interpreted as asupernova only if this is a supernova with a fast rise and a fast decay.however, the overall fit still show excess scatter in the lightcurve due towiggles and bumps. the flat lightcurves in the optical and x-rays could beexplained by a continuous energy injection scenario with an on-axis viewingangle and a wide jet opening angle (theta_j&gt;10 deg). if the energy injectionsare episodic, this could potentially help explain the bumps and wiggles.spectroscopy of the afterglow give a redshift of z=0.828+-0.005 from bothabsorption and emission lines. the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theafterglow has a power-law shape with slope beta=0.56+-0.04. this can becompared to the x-ray spectral index which is betax=1.0+-0.1. the curvature ofthe sed constrain the dust reddening towards the burst to av&lt;0.5 mag.(abridged)

astro-ph;0702537	very different x-ray to optical column density ratios in gamma-ray burst  afterglows: ionisation in grb environments	we compare the hi column densities from ly-alpha absorption to the metalcolumn densities from x-ray absorption in gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows.eight bursts of seventeen entering the sample, have significant extragalacticx-ray absorptions. of these we find a range in metallicities from sub-solar toa few hundred times the solar value. there is a complete lack of correlationbetween the x-ray and optical column densities. this, and the large range andextreme values of these 'metallicities', suggest that the column densitiesderived by one or both methods are not a reliable indication of the true totalcolumn densities towards grbs. ionisation of the grb's gas cloud to largedistances along the line of sight seems the most likely cause. from the lowerlimit on the total column density and the uv luminosity of the grbs, we derivea maximum distance to the majority of the gas surrounding grbs of ~3 pc,suggesting that the gas probed by optical afterglow spectra is not the cloud inwhich the burst occurs. this is an encouraging result for the use of grboptical afterglows as probes of the interstellar medium (ism) in their hostgalaxies, as the ism observed is less likely to be strongly affected by the grbor its progenitor.

astro-ph;0703458	gamma-ray burst host galaxies and the link to star-formation	we briefly review the current status of the study of long-duration gamma-rayburst (grb) host galaxies. grb host galaxies are mainly interesting to studyfor two reasons: 1) they may help us understand where and when massive starswere formed throughout cosmic history, and 2) the properties of host galaxiesand the localisation within the hosts where grbs are formed may give essentialclues to the precise nature of the progenitors. the main current problem is tounderstand to what degree grbs are biased tracers of star formation. if grbsare only formed by low-metallicity stars, then their host galaxies will notgive a representative view of where stars are formed in the universe (at leastnot a low redshifts). on the other hand, if there is no dependency onmetallicity then the nature of the host galaxies leads to the perhapssurprising conclusion that most stars are formed in dwarf galaxies. in order toresolve this issue and to fully exploit the potential of grbs as probes ofstar-forming galaxies throughout the observable universe it is mandatory that acomplete sample of bursts with redshifts and host galaxy detections is built.

astro-ph;0703678	no supernovae detected in two long-duration gamma-ray bursts	there is strong evidence that long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) areproduced during the collapse of a massive star. in the standard version of thecollapsar model, a broad-lined and luminous type ic core-collapse supernova(sn) accompanies the grb. this association has been confirmed in observationsof several nearby grbs. recent observations show that some long duration grbsare different. no sn emission accompanied the long duration grbs 060505 and060614 down to limits fainter than any known type ic sn and hundreds of timesfainter than the archetypal sn1998bw that accompanied grb980425. multi-bandobservations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the hostgalaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration. furthermore,the bursts originated in star-forming galaxies, and in the case of grbs060505the burst was localised to a compact star-forming knot in a spiral arm of itshost galaxy. we find that the properties of the host galaxies, the longduration of the bursts and, in the case of grb060505 the location of the burstwithin its host, all imply a massive stellar origin. the absence of a sn tosuch deep limits therefore suggests a new phenomenological type of massivestellar death.

0810.2897	dust extinction in high-z galaxies with grb afterglow spectroscopy - the  2175{\aa} feature at z=2.45	we report the clear detection of the 2175a dust absorption feature in theoptical afterglow spectrum of the gamma-ray burst (grb) grb070802 at a redshiftof z=2.45. this is the highest redshift for a detected 2175a dust bump to date,and it is the first clear detection of the 2175a bump in a grb host galaxy,while several tens of optical afterglow spectra without the bump have beenrecorded in the past decade. the derived extinction curve gives a_v=0.8-1.5depending on the assumed intrinsic slope. of the three local extinction laws,an lmc type extinction gives the best fit to the extinction curve of the hostof grb070802. besides the 2175a bump we find that the spectrum of grb070802 ischaracterized by unusually strong low-ionization metal lines and possibly ahigh metallicity for a grb sightline ([si/h]=-0.46+/-0.38,[zn/h]=-0.50+/-0.68). in particular, the spectrum of grb070802 is unique for agrb spectrum in that it shows clear ci absorption features, leading us topropose a correlation between the presence of the bump and ci. the gas to dustratio for the host galaxy is found to be significantly lower than that of othergrb hosts with n(hi)/a_v=(2.4+/-1.0)x10^21 cm^-2 mag^-1, which lies betweentypical mw and lmc values. our results are in agreement with the tentativeconclusion reached by gordon et al. 2003 that the shape of the extinctioncurve, in particular the presence of the bump, is affected by the uv fluxdensity in the environment of the dust.

0706.1070	a multi-wavelength study of z = 3.15 lyman-alpha emitters in the goods  south field	context: ly-alpha-emitters have proven to be excellent probes of faint,star-forming galaxies in the high redshift universe. however, although thesample of known emitters is increasingly growing, their nature (e.g. stellarmasses, ages, metallicities, star-formation rates) is still poorly constrained.  aims: we aim to study the nature of ly-alpha-emitters, to find the propertiesof a typical ly-alpha-emitting galaxy and to compare these properties with theproperties of other galaxies at similar redshift, in particular lyman-breakgalaxies.  methods: we have performed narrow-band imaging at the vlt, focused only-alpha at redshift z ~ 3.15, in the goods-s field. we have identified asample of ly-alpha-emitting candidates, and we have studied their spectralenergy distributions (seds).  results: we find that the emitters are best fit by an sed with lowmetallicity (z/z_sun = 0.005), low dust extinction (a_v ~ 0.32) and mediumstellar masses of approximately 10^9 m_sun. the age is not very wellconstrained. one object out of 24 appears to be a high redshiftly-alpha-emitting dusty starburst galaxy. we find filamentary structure astraced by the ly-alpha-emitters at the 4 sigma level. the rest-frame uv sed ofthese galaxies is very similar to that of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) andcomply with the selection criteria for u-band drop-outs, except they areintrinsically fainter than the current limit for lbgs.  conclusion: ly-alpha-emitters are excellent probes of galaxies in the distantuniverse, and represent a class of star-forming, dust and agn free, medium massobjects.

0812.0979	in search of progenitors for supernova-less grbs 060505 and 060614:  re-examination of their afterglows	grb060505 and grb060614 are nearby long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)without accompanying supernovae (sne) down to very strict limits. they therebychallenge the conventional lgrb-sn connection and naturally give rise to thequestion: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which wouldhelp shed light on their progenitors? to answer this question, we combine newobservational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporaland spectral properties of the two afterglows. we find that both afterglows canbe well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shockwave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well withinthe range observed for other lgrbs. hence, from the properties of theafterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have anotherprogenitor than other lgrbs. recently, swift-discovered grb080503 also has thespike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similarto grb060614. we analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that thisgrb is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of0.8$\pm$0.4 s during its tail emission. thus, the properties of the promptemission of grb060614 and grb080503 are clearly different, motivating furtherthinking of grb classification. finally we note that, whereas the progenitor ofthe two sn-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for thesn-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can beobservationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the x-raydecay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.
