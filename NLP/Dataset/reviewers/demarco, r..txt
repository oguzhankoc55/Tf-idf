0908.3897	hubble space telescope weak-lensing study of the galaxy cluster xmmu  j2235.3-2557 at z=1.4: a surprisingly massive galaxy cluster when the  universe is one-third of its current age	we present a weak-lensing analysis of the z=1.4 galaxy cluster xmmuj2235.3-2557, based on deep advanced camera for surveys images. despite theobservational challenge set by the high redshift of the lens, we detect asubstantial lensing signal at the &gt;~ 8 sigma level. this clear detection isenabled in part by the high mass of the cluster, which is verified by our bothparametric and non-parametric estimation of the cluster mass. assuming that thecluster follows a navarro-frenk-white mass profile, we estimate that theprojected mass of the cluster within r=1 mpc is (8.5+-1.7) x 10^14 solar mass,where the error bar includes the statistical uncertainty of the shear profile,the effect of possible interloping background structures, the scatter inconcentration parameter, and the error in our estimation of the mean redshiftof the background galaxies. the high x-ray temperature 8.6_{-1.2}^{+1.3} kev ofthe cluster recently measured with chandra is consistent with this high lensingmass. when we adopt the 1-sigma lower limit as a mass threshold and use thecosmological parameters favored by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe5-year (wmap5) result, the expected number of similarly massive clusters at z&gt;~ 1.4 in the 11 square degree survey is n ~ 0.005. therefore, the discovery ofthe cluster within the survey volume is a rare event with a probability &lt; 1%,and may open new scenarios in our current understanding of cluster formationwithin the standard cosmological model.

1009.1423	cluster galaxies in xmmu j2235-2557: galaxy population properties in  most massive environments at z~1.4	we present a multi-wavelength study of galaxy populations in the core of themassive, x-ray luminous cluster xmmu j2235 at z=1.39, based on vlt and hstoptical and near-infrared photometry. luminosity functions in the z, h, and ksbands show a faint-end slope consistent with being flat, and a characteristicmagnitude m* close to passive evolution predictions of m* of local massiveclusters, with a formation redshift z&gt;2. the color-magnitude and color-massdiagrams show evidence of a tight red sequence of massive galaxies, withoverall old stellar populations, generally early-type morphology, typicallyshowing early-type spectral features and rest-frame far-uv emission consistentwith very low star formation rates (sfr&lt;0.2msun/yr). star forming spectroscopicmembers, with sfrs of up to ~100msun/yr, are all located at clustercentricdistances &gt;~250kpc, with the central cluster region already appearingeffectively quenched. massive galaxies in the core of this cluster appear to bein an advanced evolutionary stage in terms of both star formation and massassembly. the high-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function is essentiallyalready in place, and the stellar mass fraction estimated within r500 (~1%,kroupa imf) is already similar to that of local massive clusters. on the otherhand, morphological analysis of the massive red sequence galaxies suggests thatthey are smaller than similarly massive local early-types. while possiblyaffected by systematics and biases, this result might imply that, in spite ofthe overall early assembly of these sources, their evolution is not complete,and processes like minor (and likely dry) merging might still shape theirstructural properties to resemble those of their local counterparts, withoutsubstantially affecting their stellar mass or host stellarpopulations.[abridged]

1009.3986	star formation histories in a cluster environment at z~0.84	we present a spectrophotometric analysis of galaxies belonging to thedynamically young, massive cluster rx j0152.7-1357 at z~0.84, aimed atunderstanding the effects of the cluster environment on the star formationhistory (sfh) of cluster galaxies and the assembly of the red-sequence (rs). weuse vlt/fors spectroscopy, acs/wfc optical and ntt/sofi near-ir data tocharacterize sfhs as a function of color, luminosity, morphology, stellar mass,and local environment from a sample of 134 spectroscopic members. in order toincrease the signal-to-noise, individual galaxy spectra are stacked accordingto these properties. moreover, the d4000, balmer, cn3883, fe4383 and c4668indices are also quantified. the sfh analysis shows that galaxies in the bluefaint-end of the rs have on average younger stars (delta t ~ 2 gyr) than thosein the red bright-end. we also found, for a given luminosity range, differencesin age (delta t ~ 0.5 - 1.3 gyr) as a function of color, indicating that theintrinsic scatter of the rs may be due to age variations. passive galaxies inthe blue faint-end of the rs are preferentially located in the low densityareas of the cluster, likely being objects entering the rs from the "bluecloud". it is likely that the quenching of the star formation of these rsgalaxies is due to interaction with the intracluster medium. furthermore, thesfh of galaxies in the rs as a function of stellar mass reveals signatures of"downsizing" in the overall cluster.

1103.0259	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. ii. masses and ages of early-type galaxies  in different environments and their dependence on stellar population model  assumptions	we have derived masses and ages for 79 early-type galaxies (etgs) indifferent environments at z~1.3 in the lynx supercluster and in the goods/cdf-sfield using multiwavelength (0.6-4.5 $\mu$m; kpno, palomar, keck, hst, spitzer)datasets. at this redshift the contribution of the tp-agb phase is importantfor etgs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellarpopulation model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. we describe indetail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxyages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. current models stillyield large uncertainties. while recent models from maraston and charlot &amp;bruzual offer better modeling of the tp-agb phase with respect to less recentbruzual &amp; charlot models, their predictions do not often match. the modeling ofthis tp-agb phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters forgalaxies observed at high-redshift. some of our results do not depend on thechoice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldestones, independent of the environment. when using maraston and charlot &amp; bruzualmodels, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (m $\gtrsim$ 10^11msun) etgs. according to those last models, etgs belonging to the clusterenvironment host on average older stars with respect to group and fieldpopulations. this difference is less significant than the age difference ingalaxies of different masses.

1103.0265	early-type galaxies at z ~ 1.3. iii. on the dependence of formation  epochs and star formation histories on stellar mass and environment	we study the environmental dependence of stellar population properties at z ~1.3. we derive galaxy properties (stellar masses, ages and star formationhistories) for samples of massive, red, passive early-type galaxies in twohigh-redshift clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453 (with redshifts of z =1.26 and 1.27, respectively), and compare them with those measured for therdcs1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 and with those measured for a similarlymass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the goods-south field.robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained bycomparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to theinfrared. we find no variations of the overall stellar population propertiesamong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. however, whencomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, evenif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxymass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their finalmass. we find that, approximately 1 gyr after the onset of star formation, themajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (&gt; 80%) of theirfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field etgs have. thus weconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, theenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

1109.0284	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. iv. scaling relations in different  environments	we present the kormendy and mass-size relations for early-type galaxies(etgs) as a function of environment at z~1.3. our sample includes 76 visuallyclassified etgs with masses 10^10 &lt; m/msun &lt; 10^11.5, selected in the lynxsupercluster and in the goods/cdf-s field, 31 etgs in clusters, 18 in groupsand 27 in the field, all with multi-wavelength photometry and hst/acsobservations. the kormendy relation, in place at z~1.3, does not depend on theenvironment. the mass-size relation reveals that etgs overall appear to be morecompact in denser environments: cluster etgs have sizes on average around30-50% smaller than those of the local universe, and a distribution with asmaller scatter, whereas field etgs show a mass-size relation with a similardistribution than the local one. our results imply that (1) the mass-sizerelation in the field did not evolve overall from z ~ 1.3 to present; this isinteresting and in contrast to the trend found at higher masses from previousworks; (2) in denser environments, either etgs have increased their size by30-50%, on average, and spread their distributions, or more etgs have beenformed within the dense environment from not etg progenitors or larger galaxieshave been accreted to a pristine compact population to reproduce the mass-sizerelation observed in the local universe. our results are driven by galaxieswith masses m&lt;2*10^11msun and those with masses m~10^11msun follow the sametrends that the entire sample. following valentinuzzi et al. definition ofsuperdense etgs, around 35-45% of our cluster sample is made of superdenseetgs.

1208.5143	evidence for significant growth in the stellar mass of brightest cluster  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	using new and published data, we construct a sample of 160 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) spanning the redshift interval 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 1.63. we use thissample, which covers 70% of the history of the universe, to measure the growthin the stellar mass of bcgs after correcting for the correlation between thestellar mass of the bcg and the mass of the cluster in which it lives. we findthat the stellar mass of bcgs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 andz=0.2. compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions ofsemi-analytic models. however, bcgs at z=0.9, relative to bcgs at z=0.2, arestill a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. starformation rates in bcgs at z~1 are generally to low to result in significantamounts of mass. instead, it is likely that most of the mass build up occursthrough mainly dry mergers in which perhaps half of the mass is lost to theintra-cluster medium of the cluster.

1305.0882	the importance of major mergers in the build up of stellar mass in  brightest cluster galaxies at z=1	recent independent results from numerical simulations and observations haveshown that brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) have increased their stellar massby a factor of almost two between z~0.9 and z~0.2. the numerical simulationsfurther suggest that more than half this mass is accreted through majormergers. using a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with over 600spectroscopically confirmed cluster members between them, we search forobservational evidence that major mergers do play a significant role. we find amajor merger rate of 0.38 +/- 0.14 mergers per gyr at z~1. while theuncertainties, which stem from the small size of our sample, are relativelylarge, our rate is consistent with the results that are derived from numericalsimulations. if we assume that this rate continues to the present day and thathalf of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the bcg during thesemergers, then we find that this rate can explain the growth in the stellar massof the bcgs that is observed and predicted by simulations. major mergerstherefore appear to be playing an important role, perhaps even the dominantone, in the build up of stellar mass in these extraordinary galaxies.

1307.0003	larger sizes of massive quiescent early-type galaxies in clusters than  in the field at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.5	[abridged] the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies (etgs) has beenlargely studied in the last years to probe the mass assembly of the mostmassive objects in the universe. in this paper, we focus on the mass-sizerelation of quiescent massive etgs (mstar/msol &gt; 3*10^10) living in massiveclusters (m200 ~ 10^14 mstar) at 0.8&lt; z &lt;1.5, as compared to those living inthe field at the same epoch. our sample contains ~ 400 etgs in clusters and thesame number in the field. therefore, our sample is approximately an order ofmagnitude larger than previous studies in the same redshift range for galaxyclusters. we find that etgs living in clusters are between ~30-50% larger thangalaxies with the same stellar mass residing in the field. we parametrize thesize using the mass-normalized size, gamma=re/mstar^0.57. the gammadistributions in both environments peak at the same position but thedistributions in clusters are more skewed towards larger sizes. since this sizedifference is not observed in the local universe, the size evolution at fixedstellar mass from z~1.5 of cluster galaxies is less steep ((1+z)-0.53pm0.04)than the evolution of field galaxies ((1+z)-0.92pm0.04).  the size difference seems to be essentially driven by the galaxies residingin the clusters cores (r&lt;0.5*r200). if part of the size evolution is due tomergers, the difference we see between cluster and field galaxies could be dueto higher merger rates in clusters at higher redshift, probably during theformation phase of the clusters when velocity dispersions are lower. we cannotexclude however that the difference is driven by newly quenched galaxies whichare quenched more efficiently in clusters. the implications of these resultsfor the hierarchical growth of etgs will be discussed in a companion paper.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

0805.2381	a twelve-image gravitational lens system in the z ~ 0.84 cluster cl  j0152.7-1357	gravitational lens modeling is presented for the first discovered example ofa three-component source for which each component is quadruply imaged. the lensis a massive galaxy member of the cluster cl j0152.7-1357 at z ~ 0.84. takingadvantage of this exceptional configuration and of the excellent angularresolution of the hst/acs, we measure the properties of the lens. severalparametric macroscopic models were developed for the lens galaxy, starting frompointlike to extended image models. for a lens model in terms of a singularisothermal sphere with external shear, the einstein radius is found to be r_{e}= (9.54 +/- 0.15) kpc. the external shear points to the cluster's northern masspeak. the unknown redshift of the source is determined to be higher than 1.9and lower than 2.9. our estimate of the lensing projected total mass inside theeinstein radius, m_{len}(r &lt; 9.54 kpc), depends on the source distance and liesbetween 4.6 and 6.2 x 10^{11} m_{sun}. this result turns out to be compatiblewith the dynamical estimate based on an isothermal model. by considering theconstraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio that comes from the evolution ofthe fundamental plane, we can exclude the possibility that at more than 4 sigmalevel the total mass enclosed inside the einstein ring is only luminous matter.moreover, the photometric-stellar mass measurement within the einstein radiusgives a minimum value of 50% (1 sigma) for the dark-to-total matter fraction.the lensing analysis has allowed us to investigate the distribution of mass ofthe deflector, also providing some interesting indications on scales that arelarger and smaller than the einstein radius of the lens galaxy. the combinationof different diagnostics has proved to be essential in determining quantitiesthat otherwise would have not been directly measurable with the current data.

1510.05659	clash-vlt: environment-driven evolution of galaxies in the z=0.209  cluster abell 209	the analysis of galaxy properties and the relations among them and theenvironment, can be used to investigate the physical processes driving galaxyevolution. we study the cluster a209 by using the clash-vlt spectroscopic datacombined with subaru photometry, yielding to 1916 cluster members down to astellar mass of 10^{8.6} msun. we determine: i) the stellar mass function ofstar-forming and passive galaxies; ii) the intra-cluster light and itsproperties; iii) the orbits of low- and high-mass passive galaxies; and iv) themass-size relation of etgs. the stellar mass function of the star-forminggalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passivegalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. the color distribution of theintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. theanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies havetangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the bcg. the mass-sizerelation of low-mass passive etgs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,and its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. low-massgalaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 mpc. the ratiobetween stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in thecenter. the comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profilesindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. our results areconsistent with a scenario in which the "environmental quenching" of low-massgalaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to r200, starvation andram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of themass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passiveearly-types in different regions. our analyses support the idea that theintra-cluster light is formed through the tidal disruption of subgiantgalaxies.

1511.06707	on the properties of the interstellar medium in extremely metal-poor  blue compact dwarf galaxies. a vimos-ifu study of the cometary galaxy and ly  $\alpha$ absorber tol 65	in this study we present high-resolution visible multi-object spectrographintegral field unit spectroscopy (vimos-ifu) of the extremely metal-poorhii/blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy tol 65. the optical appearance of thisgalaxy shows clearly a cometary morphology with a bright main body and anextended and diffuse stellar tail. we focus on the detection of metallicitygradients or inhomogeneities as expected if the ongoing star-formation activityis sustained by the infall/accretion of metal-poor gas. no evidences ofsignificant spatial variations of abundances were found within ouruncertainties. however, our findings show a slight anticorrelation between gasmetallicity and star-formation rate at spaxel scales, in the sense that highstar-formation is found in regions of low-metallicity, but the scatter in thisrelation indicates that the metals are almost fully diluted. our observationsshow the presence of extended h$\alpha$ emission in the stellar tail of thegalaxy. we estimated that the mass of the ionized gas in the tailm(hii)$_{tail} \sim$1.7$\times$10$^5$ m$_{\odot}$ corresponds with $\sim$ 24per cent of the total mass of the ionized gas in the galaxy. we found that theh$\alpha$ velocity dispersion of the main body and the tail of the galaxy arecomparable with the one found in the neutral gas by previous studies. thissuggests that the ionized gas still retains the kinematic memory of itsparental cloud and likely a common origin. finally, we suggest that theinfall/accretion of cold gas from the outskirts of the galaxy and/or minormerger/interaction may have produced the almost flat abundance gradient and thecometary morphology in tol 65.

0806.4537	star formation histories of early-type galaxies at z = 1.2 in cluster  and field environments	we derive the star formation histories of early-type galaxies at z = 1.2 inboth low and high density environments. to this purpose, we compare theco-added spectroscopic and 8-9 band photometric data of 43 mass selectedearly-type galaxies in the massive cluster rdcs j1252.9-2927 and thegoods/cdf-s field with a large grid of composite stellar population models. wefind that the cluster early-type galaxies formed the bulk of their starsapproximately 0.5 gyr earlier than early-types in the field, whereas fieldearly-types presumably finish forming their stellar content on a longer timescale. such a difference is particularly evident at lower masses but becomesnegligible for the most massive galaxies. while our differential analysis ofthe stellar population parameters of cluster and field galaxies in the samemass range convincingly shows distinct star formation histories, the absoluteage difference remains model dependent. using the star formation histories thatbest fit the seds of the red sequence galaxies in rdcs 1252.9-2927, wereconstruct the evolution of the cluster red sequence and find that it wasestablished over 1 gyr and is expected to dissolve by z ~ 2.

0806.4604	formation epochs, star formation histories and sizes of massive  early-type galaxies in cluster and field environments at z=1.2: insights from  the rest-frame uv	we derive stellar masses, ages and star formation histories of massiveearly-type galaxies in the z=1.237 rdcs1252.9-2927 cluster and compare themwith those measured in a similarly mass-selected sample of field contemporariesdrawn from the goods south field. robust estimates of these parameters areobtained by comparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with8-9 band photometry in the rest-frame nuv, optical and ir, thus sampling theentire relevant domain of emission of the different stellar populations.additionally, we present new, deep $u$-band photometry of both fields, givingaccess to the critical fuv rest-frame, in order to constrain empirically thedependence on the environment of the most recent star formation processes. wefind that early-type galaxies, both in the cluster and in the field, showanalogous optical morphologies, follow comparable mass vs. size relation, havecongruent average surface stellar mass densities and lie on the same kormendyrelation. we also that a fraction of early-type galaxies in the field employlonger timescales, $\tau$, to assemble their mass than their clustercontemporaries. hence we conclude that, while the formation epoch of early-typeonly depends on their mass, the environment does regulate the timescales oftheir star formation histories. our deep $u$-band imaging strongly supportsthis conclusions. it shows that cluster galaxies are at least 0.5 mag fainterthan their field contemporaries of similar mass and optical-to-infrared colors,implying that the last episode of star formation must have happened morerecently in the field than in the cluster.

astro-ph;0306081	a study of dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters of galaxies  from rosat data	self-gravitating systems such as elliptical galaxies appear to have aconstant integrated specific entropy and obey a scaling law relating theirpotential energy to their mass. these properties can be interpreted as due tothe physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of thesestructures. dark matter halos obtained through numerical simulations have alsobeen found to obey a scaling law relating their potential energy to their masswith the same slope as for ellipticals, and very close to the expected valuepredicted by theory. since the x-ray gas in clusters is weakly dissipative, wetest here the hypothesis that it verifies similar properties. comparableproperties for the dark matter component are also investigated. with this aim,we have analyzed rosat-pspc images of 24 clusters, and fit a s\'ersic law totheir x-ray surface brightness profiles. we found that: 1) the s\'ersic lawparameters (intensity, shape and scale) describing the x-ray gas emission arecorrelated two by two, with a strong correlation between the shape and scaleparameters; 2) the hot gas in all these clusters roughly has the sameintegrated specific entropy, although a second order correlation between thisintegrated specific entropy and both the gas mass and the dynamical mass isobserved; 3) a scaling law links the cluster potential energy to its totalmass, with the same slope as that derived for elliptical galaxies and for darkmatter halo simulations. comparable relations are obtained for the dark mattercomponent. all these correlations are probably the consequence of the formationand evolution processes undergone by clusters of galaxies.

astro-ph;0309546	chandra and xmm-newton observations of rdcs1252.9-2927, a massive  cluster at z=1.24	we present deep chandra and xmm obervations of the galaxy clusterrdcs1252.9-2927, which was selected from the rosat deep cluster survey (rdcs)and confirmed by extensive spectroscopy with the vlt at redshift z=1.237. withthe chandra data, the x-ray emission from the intra-cluster medium is wellresolved and traced out to 500 kpc, thus allowing a measurement of the physicalproperties of the gas with unprecedented accuracy at this redshift. we detect aclear 6.7 kev iron k line in the chandra spectrum providing a redshift within1% of the spectroscopic one. by augmenting our spectroscopic analysis with thexmm data (mos detectors only), we significantly narrow down the 1 sigma errorbar to 10% for the temperature and 30% for the metallicity, with best fitvalues kt = 6.0(+0.7,-0.5) kev, z = 0.36(+0.12,-0.10) z_sun. in the likelyhypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium, we measure a total mass of m_{500} =(1.9+-0.3)10^14 h_70^{-1}m_sun within r_{delta=500} = 536 kpc. overall, theseobservations imply that rdcs1252.9-2927 is the most x-ray luminous and likelythe most massive bona-fide cluster discovered to date at z&gt;1. when combinedwith current samples of distant clusters, these data lend further support to amild evolution of the cluster scaling relations, as well the metallicity of theintra-cluster gas. inspection of the cluster mass function in the currentcosmological concordance model (h,omega_m,omega_lambda)=(0.7,0.3,0.7) andsigma_8=0.7-0.8 shows that rdcs1252.9-2927 is an m* cluster at z=1.24, inkeeping with number density expectations in the rdcs survey volume.

astro-ph;0404474	ks-band luminosity function of the z=1.237 cluster of galaxies rdcs  j1252.9-2927	we derive the ks-band luminosity function (lf) of the z=1.237 massive x-rayluminous cluster of galaxies rdcs j1252.9-2927. photometric redshifts, derivedfrom deep multi-wavelength bvrizjks data, and calibrated using a large subsetof galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, are used to separate the clustergalaxy population from the foreground and background field galaxy population.this allows for a simultaneous determination of the characteristic magnitudeks* and faint end slope alpha of the lf without having to make an uncertainstatistical background subtraction. the shape of the bright end of the derivedlf is similar to that measured at similar restframe wavelengths (in the z-band)in local clusters, but the characteristic magnitude is brighter by deltamz*=-1.40(+0.49/-0.58) magnitudes, suggesting that the massive clusterellipticals that dominate the bright end of the lf were already in place atz=1.237. the derived alpha is shallower (at the 2.2 sigma level) than the valuemeasured in the z-band in clusters in the local universe, suggesting that rdcsj1252.9-2927 contains a relatively smaller fraction of low mass galaxies thanclusters in the local universe. the results presented in this paper are achallenge for semi analytical hierarchical models of galaxy formation whichpredict the characteristic magnitude to grow fainter and the faint end slope tosteepen with redshift as the massive galaxies break up into their progenitors.the observed evolution is consistent with a scenario in which clusters arecomposed of a population of massive galaxies which formed at high redshift(z&gt;&gt;1) and subsequently evolved passively, and a population of lower massgalaxies which are gradually accreted from the field, primarily at lowerredshift (z&lt;1).

astro-ph;0408165	the evolutionary status of clusters of galaxies at z ~ 1	combined hst, x-ray, and ground-based optical studies show that clusters ofgalaxies are largely "in place" by $z \sim 1$, an epoch when the universe wasless than half its present age. high resolution images show that elliptical,s0, and spiral galaxies are present in clusters at redshifts up to $z \sim1.3$. analysis of the cmds suggest that the cluster ellipticals formed theirstars several gyr earlier, near redshift 3. the morphology--density relation iswell established at $z\sim1$, with star-forming spirals and irregulars residingmostly in the outer parts of the clusters and e/s0s concentrated in denseclumps. the intracluster medium has already reached the metallicity ofpresent-day clusters. the distributions of the hot gas and early-type galaxiesare similar in $z\sim1$ clusters, indicating both have largely virialized inthe deepest potentials wells. in spite of the many similarities between$z\sim1$ and present-day clusters, there are significant differences. themorphologies revealed by the hot gas, and particularly the early-type galaxies,are elongated rather than spherical. we appear to be observing the clusters atan epoch when the sub-clusters and groups are still assembling into a singleregular cluster. support for this picture comes from cl0152 where the gasappears to be lagging behind the luminous and dark mass in two mergingsub-components. moreover, the luminosity difference between the first andsecond brightest cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$ is smaller than in 93% ofpresent-day abell clusters, which suggests that considerable luminosityevolution through merging has occurred since that epoch. evolution is also seenin the bolometric x-ray luminosity function.

astro-ph;0501224	the morphology - density relation in z ~ 1 clusters	we measure the morphology--density relation (mdr) and morphology-radiusrelation (mrr) for galaxies in seven z ~ 1 clusters that have been observedwith the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope.simulations and independent comparisons of ourvisually derived morphologiesindicate that acs allows one to distinguish between e, s0, and spiralmorphologies down to zmag = 24, corresponding to l/l* = 0.21 and 0.30 at z =0.83 and z = 1.24, respectively. we adopt density and radius estimation methodsthat match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of themdr and mrr. we detect a change in the mdr between 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 and thatobserved at z ~ 0, consistent with recent work -- specifically, the growth inthe bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, f_e+so, with increasing density proceedsless rapidly at z ~ 1 than it does at z ~ 0. at z ~ 1 and density &lt;= 500galaxies/mpc^2, we find &lt;f_e+s0&gt; = 0.72 +/- 0.10. at z ~ 0, an e+s0 populationfraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. theevolution in the mdr is confined to densities &gt;= 40 galaxies/mpc^2 and appearsto be primarily due to a deficit of s0 galaxies and an excess of spiral+irrgalaxies relative to the local galaxy population. the elliptical fraction -density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and z = 0. wefind mild evidence to suggest that the mdr is dependent on the bolometric x-rayluminosity of the intracluster medium. implications for the evolution of thedisk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of theseobservations.

astro-ph;0503365	evolution in the cluster early-type galaxy size-surface brightness  relation at z =~ 1	we investigate the evolution in the distribution of surface brightness, as afunction of size, for elliptical and s0 galaxies in the two clusters rdcsj1252.9-2927, z=1.237 and rx j0152.7-1357, z=0.837. we use multi-color imagingwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope to determinethese sizes and surface brightnesses. using three different estimates of thesurface brightnesses, we find that we reliably estimate the surface brightnessfor the galaxies in our sample with a scatter of &lt; 0.2 mag and with systematicshifts of \lesssim 0.05 mag. we construct samples of galaxies with early-typemorphologies in both clusters. for each cluster, we use a magnitude limit in aband which closely corresponds to the rest-frame b, to magnitude limit of m_b =-18.8 at z=0, and select only those galaxies within the color-magnitudesequence of the cluster or by using our spectroscopic redshifts. we measureevolution in the rest-frame b surface brightness, and find -1.41 \+/- 0.14 magfrom the coma cluster of galaxies for rdcs j1252.9-2927 and -0.90 \+/- 0.12 magof evolution for rx j0152.7-1357, or an average evolution of (-1.13 \+/- 0.15)z mag. our statistical errors are dominated by the observed scatter in thesize-surface brightness relation, sigma = 0.42 \+/- 0.05 mag for rxj0152.7-1357 and sigma = 0.76 \+/- 0.10 mag for rdcs j1252.9-2927. we find nostatistically significant evolution in this scatter, though an increase in thescatter could be expected. overall, the pace of luminosity evolution we measureagrees with that of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies, implying thatthe majority of massive early-type galaxies observed at z =~ 1 formed at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0505610	feedback and brightest cluster galaxy formation: acs observations of the  radio galaxy tn j1338--1942 at z=4.1	we present deep optical imaging of the z=4.1 radio galaxy tn j1338--1942obtained using the acs on-board hst. the radio galaxy is known to reside withina large galaxy overdensity (both in physical extent and density contrast).there is good evidence that this `protocluster' region is the progenitor of apresent-day rich galaxy cluster. tn j1338 is the dominant galaxy in theprotocluster, in terms of size and luminosity and therefore seems destined toevolve into the brightest cluster galaxy. the high spatial-resolution acsimages reveal several kpc-scale features within and around the radio galaxy.the continuum light is aligned with the radio axis and is resolved into twoclumps in the i-band and z-band bands. these components have luminosities ~10^9l_sun and sizes of a few kpc. the estimated star-formation rate for the wholeradio galaxy is ~200 m_sun/yr. a simple model in which the jet has triggeredstar-formation in these continuum knots is consistent with the available data.an unusual feature is seen in lyman-alpha emission. a wedge-shaped extensionemanates from the radio galaxy perpendicularly to the radio axis. this `wedge'naturally connects to the surrounding, asymmetric, large-scale (~100 kpc)lyman-alpha halo. we posit that the wedge is a starburst-driven superwind,associated with the first major epoch of formation of the brightest clustergalaxy. the shock and wedge are examples of feedback processes due to both agnand star-formation in the earliest stages of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0506211	internal dynamics of the z sim 0.8 cluster rx j0152.7-1357	we present the results from the dynamical analysis of the cluster of galaxiesrx j0152-1357, which shows a complex structure in its x-ray emission, with twomajor clumps in the central region, and a third clump in the eastern region.our analysis is based on redshift data for 187 galaxies. we compute theline-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies, sigma_v=1322^+74_-68 kms^-1,which is significantly larger than what is expected in the case of a relaxedcluster with an observed x-ray temperature of 5-6 kev. we find evidence thatthis cluster is far from dynamical equilibrium, as shown by the non gaussianityof the velocity distribution, the presence of a velocity gradient andsignificant substructure. our analysis shows that the high value of sigma_v isdue to the complex structure of rx j0152-1357, i.e. to the presence of threegalaxy clumps of different mean velocity. using optical data we detect alow-velocity clump (with sigma_v=300-500 kms^-1) in the central sw region and ahigh--velocity clump (with sigma_v sim 700 kms^-1) in the e region, wellcorresponding to the sw and e peaks detected in the x-ray emission. the centralne x-ray peak is associated to the main galaxy structure with a velocity whichis intermediate between those of the other two clumps and sigma_v sim 900kms^-1. the mass of the whole system within 2 mpc is estimated to lie in therange (1.2-2.2)x10^{15} m_sun. analytic calculations based on the two-bodymodel indicate that the system is most likely bound, currently undergoingmerging. in particular, we suggest that the sw clump is not a small group, butrather the dense cluster-core of a massive cluster.

astro-ph;0509308	clustering of star-forming galaxies near a radio galaxy at z=5.2	we present hst/acs observations of the most distant radio galaxy known, tnj0924-2201 at z=5.2. this radio galaxy has 6 spectroscopically confirmed lyaemitting companion galaxies, and appears to lie within an overdense region. theradio galaxy is marginally resolved in i_775 and z_850 showing continuumemission aligned with the radio axis, similar to what is observed for lowerredshift radio galaxies. both the half-light radius and the uv star formationrate are comparable to the typical values found for lyman break galaxies atz~4-5. the lya emitters are sub-l* galaxies, with deduced star formation ratesof 1-10 msun/yr. one of the lya emitters is only detected in lya. based on thestar formation rate of ~3 msun/yr calculated from lya, the lack of continuumemission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 myr and isproducing its first stars.  observations in v_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additionallyman break galaxies associated with this structure. in addition to the radiogalaxy, there are 22 v-break (z~5) galaxies with z_850&lt;26.5 (5sigma), two ofwhich are also in the spectroscopic sample. we compare the surface density of2/arcmin^2 to that of similarly selected v-dropouts extracted from goods andthe udf parallel fields. we find evidence for an overdensity to very highconfidence (&gt;99%), based on a counts-in-cells analysis applied to the controlfield. the excess is suggestive of the v-break objects being associated with aforming cluster around the radio galaxy.

astro-ph;0509650	imprints of environment on cluster and field late-type galaxies at z~1	we present a comparison of late-type galaxies (sa and later) in intermediateredshift clusters and the field using acs imaging of four cluster fields:cl0152-1357, cl1056-0337 (ms1054), cl1604+4304, and cl1604+4321. concentration,asymmetry, and clumpiness parameters are calculated for each galaxy in blue(f606w or f625w) and red (f775w or f814w) filters. galaxy half-light radii,disk scale lengths, color gradients, and overall color are compared. we findmarginally significant differences in the asymmetry distributions of spiral andirregular galaxies in the x-ray luminous and x-ray faint clusters. the massiveclusters contain fewer galaxies with large asymmetries. the physical sizes ofthe cluster and field populations are similar; no significant differences arefound in half-light radii or disk scale lengths. the most significantdifference is in rest-frame $u-b$ color. late-type cluster galaxies aresignificantly redder, $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes at rest-frame $u-b$, than theirfield counterparts. moreover, the intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies tendto have blue inward color gradients, in contrast to the field galaxies, butsimilar to late-type galaxies in low redshift clusters. these blue inward colorgradients are likely to be the result of enhanced nuclear star formation ratesrelative to the outer disk. based on the significant rest-frame colordifference, we conclude that late-type cluster members at $z\sim0.9$ are not apristine infalling field population; some difference in past and/or currentstar formation history is already present. this points to high redshift``groups'', or filaments with densities similar to present-day groups, as thesites where the first major effects of environment are imprinted.

astro-ph;0601165	the near-infrared luminosity function of cluster galaxies beyond  redshift one	we determined the k band luminosity function (lf) of cluster galaxies atredshift z~1.2, using near-infrared images of three x-ray luminous clusters atz=1.11,1.24,1.27. the composite lf was derived down to m*+4, by means ofstatistical background subtraction, and is well described by a schechterfunction with k*=20.5 ab mag and alpha=-1.  from the k band composite lf we derived the stellar mass function of clustergalaxies. using available x-ray mass profiles we determined the m/l ratios ofthese three clusters, which tend to be lower than those measured in the localuniverse.  with these data, no significant difference can be seen between the shapes ofthe cluster galaxies lf and the lf of field galaxies at similar redshift.  we also found no significant evolution out to z ~1.2 in the bright (&lt;m*+4)part of the cluster galaxies lf probed in this study, apart from a brighteningof ~1.3 mag of the characteristic magnitude of the high redshift lf. weconfirm, and extend to higher redshift, the result from previous work that theredshift evolution of the characteristic magnitude m* is consistent withpassive evolution of a stellar population formed at z&gt;2.  the results obtained in this work support and extend previous findings thatmost of the stars in bright galaxies were formed at high redshift, and thatk-bright (m&gt;10^11 msun) galaxies were already in place at z ~ 1.2, at least inthe central regions of x-ray luminous clusters. together with recent results onthe field galaxies stellar mass function, this implies that most of the stellarmass is already assembled in massive galaxies by z ~ 1, both in low and highdensity environments.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.
