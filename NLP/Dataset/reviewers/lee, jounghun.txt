0706.1412	the alignments of the galaxy spins with the real-space tidal field  reconstructed from the two mass redshift survey	we report a direct observational evidence for the existence of the galaxyspin alignments with the real space tidal field. we calculate the real spacetidal field from the real space density field reconstructed recently from thetwo mass redshift survey (2mrs) by erdogdu et al. in 2006. using a total of12122 nearby spiral galaxies from the tully galaxy catalog, we calculate theorientations of their spin axes relative to the 2mrs tidal field. we find aclear signal of the intrinsic correlations between the galaxy spins and theintermediate principal axes of the tidal shears. the null hypothesis of nocorrelation is rejected at 99.99 % confidence level. we also investigate thedependence of the intrinsic correlations on the galaxy morphological type andthe environment. it is found that (i) the intrinsic correlation depends weaklyon the morphological type of the spiral galaxies but tends to decrease slightlyas the type increases; (ii) it is stronger in the high-density regions than inthe low-density regions. the observational result is quantitatively consistentwith analytic prediction based on the tidal torque theory. it is concluded thatthe galaxy spin orientations may provide in principle a new complimentary probeof the dark matter distribution.

0903.5095	probing the warm dark matter with high-z quasar luminosity function	in a warm dark matter (wdm) cosmology, the first objects to form at z&gt;=20 areone dimensional filaments with mean length on the order of the wdmfree-streaming scale. gao and theuns recently claimed by using high-resolutionhydrodynamic simulations that the eventual collapse of these wdm filamentsalong their longest axes may seed the supermassive black holes that powerhigh-z quasars. in this picture, it is supposed that the high-z quasarluminosity function should reflect how abundant the wdm filaments are in theearly universe. we derive analytically the mass function of early-universefilaments with the help of the zel'dovich approximation. then, we determine therate of its decrease in the mass section corresponding to the free streamingscale of a wdm particle of mass m_v. adjusting the value of m_v, we fit theslope of the analytic model to that of the high-z quasar luminosity functionmeasured from the sloan digital sky survey dr3. a new wdm constraint from thisfeasibility study is found to be consistent with the lightest super-symmetricpartner.

0905.4277	the bridge effect of void filaments	cosmic filaments play a role of bridges along which matter and gas accreteonto galaxies to trigger star formation and feed central black holes. here weexplore the correlations between the intrinsic properties of void galaxies andthe linearity r_l of void filaments (degree of filament's straightness). wefocus on void regions since the bridge effect of filaments should be mostconspicuous in the pristine underdense regions like voids. analyzing themillennium-run semi-analytic galaxy catalogue, we identify void filamentsconsisting of more than four galaxies (three edges) and calculate the means ofcentral black hole mass, star formation rate, and stellar mass as a function ofr_l. it is shown that the void galaxies constituting more straight filamentstend to have higher luminosity, more massive central black holes and higherstar formation rate. among the three properties, the central black hole mass ismost strongly correlated with r_l. it is also shown that the dark halosconstituting straight filaments tend to have similar masses. our resultssuggest that the fuel-supply for central black holes and star formation of voidgalaxies occurs most efficiently along straight void filaments whose potentialwells are generated by similar-mass dark halos.

0704.1400	reconstructing the intrinsic triaxial shape of the virgo cluster	to use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to accountfor their triaxiality. assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters areinduced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, lee and kangrecently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axialratio of a triaxial cluster. we examine the validity of this reconstructionalgorithm by performing an observational test of it with the virgo cluster as atarget. we first modify the lk06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensionalprojection effect. then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the virgocluster catalogue and find the projected direction of the virgo cluster majoraxis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the membergalaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. applying the modifiedreconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio ofthe triaxial virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). this result is consistent withthe recent observational report from the virgo cluster survey, proving therobustness of the reconstruction algorithm. it is also found that at the innerradii the shape tends to be more like prolate. we discuss the possible effectof the virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.

0906.5163	the anisotropic two-point correlation functions of the nonlinear  traceless tidal field in the principal-axis frame	galaxies on the largest scales of the universe are observed to be embedded inthe filamentary cosmic web which is shaped by the nonlinear tidal field. as anefficient tool to quantitatively describe the statistics of this cosmic web, wepresent the anisotropic two-point correlation functions of the nonlineartraceless tidal field in the principal-axis frame, which are measured usingnumerical data from an n-body simulation. we show that both of the nonlineardensity and traceless tidal fields are more strongly correlated along thedirections perpendicular to the eigenvectors associated with the largesteigenvalues of the local tidal field. the correlation length scale of thetraceless tidal field is found to be ~20 mpc/h, which is much larger than thatof the density field ~5 mpc/h. we also provide analytic fitting formulae forthe anisotropic correlation functions of the traceless tidal field, which turnout to be in excellent agreement with the numerical results. we expect that ournumerical results and analytic formula are useful to disentangle cosmologicalinformation from the filamentary network of the large-scale structures.

0906.5166	lagrangian statistics of dark halos in a lcdm cosmology	new statistical properties of dark matter halos in lagrangian space arepresented. tracing back the dark matter particles constituting bound halosresolved in a series of n-body simulations, we measure quantitatively thecorrelations of the proto-halo's inertia tensors with the local tidal tensorsand investigate how the correlation strength depends on the proto-halo'ssphericity, local density and filtering scale. it is shown that the majority ofthe proto-halos exhibit strong correlations between the two tensors providedthat the tidal field is smoothed on the proto-halo's mass scale. thecorrelation strength is found to increase as the proto-halo's sphericityincreases, as the proto-halo's mass increases, and as the local density becomesclose to the critical value, delta_{ec}. it is also found that those peculiarproto-halos which exhibit exceptionally weak correlations between the twotensors tend to acquire higher specific angular momentum in eulerian space,which is consistent with the linear tidal torque theory. in the light of ourresults, it is intriguing to speculate a hypothesis that the low surfacebrightness galaxies observed at present epoch correspond to the peculiarproto-halos with extreme low-sphericity whose inertia tensors are weaklycorrelated with the local tidal tensors.

0707.1690	the nonlinear evolution of galaxy intrinsic alignments	the non-gaussian contribution to the intrinsic halo spin alignments isanalytically modeled and numerically detected. assuming that the growth ofnon-gaussianity in the density fluctuations caused the tidal field to havenonlinear-order effect on the orientations of the halo angular momentum, wemodel the intrinsic halo spin alignments as a linear scaling of the densitycorrelations on large scales, which is different from the previousquadratic-scaling model based on the linear tidal torque theory. then, weanalyze the halo catalogs from the recent high-resolution millennium runsimulation at four different redshifts (z=0,0.5,1 and 2) and measurequantitatively the degree of the nonlinear effect on the halo spin alignmentsand its changes with redshifts. a clear signal of spin correlations is found onscales as large as 10 mpc/h at z=0, which marks a detection of the nonlineartidal effect on the intrinsic halo alignments. we also investigate how thenonlinear effect depends on the intrinsic properties of the halos. it is foundthat the degree of the nonlinear tidal effect increases as the halo mass scaledecreases, the halo specific angular momentum increases, and the halo peculiarvelocity decreases. we discuss implication of our result on the weakgravitational lensing.

0911.4755	a scaling relation of the evolving tidal fields in a lcdm cosmology	we report the finding of a scaling relation among the cosmic-web anisotropyparameter $a$, the linear density rms fluctuation sigma(r) and the lineargrowth factor d(z). using the tidal field derived from the millenniumsimulation on 512^{3} grids at z=0, 2, 5 and 127, we calculate the largesteigenvalues $\lambda$ of the local tidal tensor at each grid resolution andmeasure its distance-averaged two-point correlation function, xi_{lambda}, as afunction of the cosines of polar angles cos(theta) in the local principal axisframe. we show that xi_{lambda} is quite anisotropic, increasing toward thedirections of minimal matter compression, and that the anisotropy ofxi_{lambda} increases as the redshift, z, decreases and as the upper distancecutoff r_{c} decreases. fitting the numerical results to an analytic fittingmodel \xi_{\lambda}(\cos\theta)\propto (1+a\cos^{n}\theta)^{-1}, it is foundthat the best fit value of a, dubbed the cosmic-web anisotropy parameter,varies systematically with sigma(r_{c}) and d(z), allowing us to determine thesimple empiral scaling relation a(r_{c},z)=0.8, d^{0.76}(z), sigma (r_{c})$.

1003.0939	bullet cluster: a challenge to lcdm cosmology	to quantify how rare the bullet-cluster-like high-velocity merging systemsare in the standard lcdm cosmology, we use a large-volume 27 (gpc/h)^3 micesimulation to calculate the distribution of infall velocities of subclustersaround massive main clusters. the infall-velocity distribution is given at(1-3)r_{200} of the main cluster (where r_{200} is similar to the virialradius), and thus it gives the distribution of realistic initial velocities ofsubclusters just before collision. these velocities can be compared with theinitial velocities used by the non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of1e0657-56 in the literature. the latest parameter search carried out recentlyby mastropietro and burkert showed that the initial velocity of 3000 km/s atabout 2r_{200} is required to explain the observed shock velocity, x-raybrightness ratio of the main and subcluster, and displacement of the x-raypeaks from the mass peaks. we show that such a high infall velocity at 2r_{200}is incompatible with the prediction of a lcdm model: the probability of finding3000 km/s in (2-3)r_{200} is between 3.3x10^{-11} and 3.6x10^{-9}. it isconcluded that the existence of 1e0657-56 is incompatible with the predictionof a lcdm model, unless a lower infall velocity solution for 1e0657-56 with &lt;1800 km/s at 2r_{200} is found.

1006.4101	merging rates of the first objects and the formation of first  mini-filaments in models with massive neutrinos	we study the effect of massive neutrinos on the formation and evolution ofthe first filaments containing the first star-forming halos of massm~10^{6}m_sun at z~20. with the help of the extended press-schechter formalism,we evaluate analytically the rates of merging of the first star-forming halosinto zero-dimensional larger halos and one-dimensional first filaments. it isshown that as the neutrino mass fraction f_{\nu} increases, thehalo-to-filament merging rate increases while the halo-to-halo merging ratedecreases sharply. for f_{\nu}&lt;=0.04, the halo-to-filament merging rate isnegligibly low at all filament mass scales, while for f_{\nu}&gt;=0.07 thehalo-to-filament merging rate exceeds 0.1 at the characteristic filament massscale of ~10^{9}m_sun. the distribution of the redshifts at which the firstfilaments ultimately collapse along their longest axes is derived and found tohave a sharp maximum at z~8. we also investigate the formation and evolution ofthe second generation filaments which contain the first galaxies of mass10^{9}m_sun at z=8 as the parent of the first generation filaments. a similartrend is found: for f_{\nu}&gt;= 0.07 the rate of clustering of the first galaxiesinto the second-generation filaments exceeds 0.3 at the characteristic massscale of ~10^{11}m_sun. the longest-axis collapse of these second-generationfilaments are found to occur at z~3. the implications of our results on theformation of massive high-z galaxies and the early metal enrichment of theintergalactic media by supernova-driven outflows, and possibility ofconstraining the neutrino mass from the mass distribution of the high-z centralblackholes are discussed.

1008.4620	the misalignments between matter and galaxy distributions in triaxial  clusters: a signature of a possible fifth force?	the standard structure formation model based on a lcdm cosmology predictsthat the galaxy clusters have triaxial shapes and that the cluster galaxieshave a strong tendency to be located preferentially along the major axes ofhost cluster's dark matter distributions due to the gravitational tidal effect.the predicted correlations between dark matter and galaxy distributions intriaxial clusters are insensitive to the initial cosmological parameters and tothe galaxy bias, and thus can provide a unique test-bed for the nonlinearstructure formation of the lcdm cosmology. recently, oguri et al. determinedrobustly the dark matter distributions in the galaxy clusters using the twodimensional weak lensing shear fitting and showed that the orientations of thecluster galaxy distributions are only very weakly correlated with those of theunderlying dark matter distributions determined robustly, which is in contrastto with the lcdm-based prediction. we reanalyze and compare quantitatively theobservational result with the lcdm-based prediction from the millennium runsimulation with the help of the bootstrap resampling and generalizedchi^{2}-statistics. the hypothesis that the observational result is consistentwith the lcdm-based prediction is ruled out at the 99% confidence level. alocal fifth force induced by a non-minimal coupling between dark energy anddark matter might be responsible for the observed misalignments between darkmatter and galaxy distributions in triaxial clusters.

1011.5755	on the intrinsic alignments of the late-type spiral galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey data release 7	a robust detection of the tidally induced intrinsic alignments of thelate-type spiral galaxies with high statistical significance is reported. fromthe spectroscopic galaxy sample of sdss dr7 compiled by huertas-company et al.which lists each galaxy's probabilities of being in five hubble types,p(e),p(ell), p(s0),p(sab), p(scd), we select the nearby large late-type spiralgalaxies which have redshifts of 0&lt;=z&lt;=0.02, probabilities of p(scd)&gt;=0.5 andangular sizes of d&gt;=7.92 arcsec. the spin axes of the selected nearby largelate-type spiral galaxies are determined up to the two-fold ambiguity with thehelp of the circular thin-disk approximation and their spatial correlations aremeasured as a function of the separation distance r. a clear signal of theintrinsic correlation as high as 3.4 sigma and 2.4 sigma is found at theseparation distance of r~1mpc/h and r~2mpc/h, respectively. the comparison ofthis observational results with the analytic model based on the tidal torquetheory reveals that the spin correlation function for the late-type spiralgalaxies follow the quadratic scaling of the linear density correlation andthat the intrinsic correlations of the galaxy spin axes are stronger than thatof the underlying dark halos. we investigate a local density dependence of thegalaxy spin correlations and found that the correlations are stronger for thegalaxies located in dense regions having more than 10 neighbors within 2mpc/h.we also attempt to measure a luminosity dependence of the galaxy spincorrelations, but find that it is impossible with our magnitude-split samplesto disentangle a luminosity from a redshift dependence. we provide the physicalexplanations for these observational results and also discuss the effects ofpossible residual systematics on the results.

0709.1106	quantifying the cosmic web i: the large-scale halo  ellipticity-ellipticity and ellipticity-direction correlations	the formation of dark matter halos tends to occur anisotropically along thefilaments of the cosmic web, which induces both ellipticity-ellipticity (ee)correlations between the shapes of halos, as well as ellipticity-direction (ed)cross-correlations between halo shapes and the directions to neighboring halos.we analyze the halo catalogue and the semi-analytic galaxy catalogue of therecent millennium run simulation to measure the ee and ed correlationsnumerically at four different redshifts (z=0, 0.5, 1 and 2). for the eecorrelations, we find that (i) the major-axis correlation is strongest whilethe intermediate-axis correlation is weakest; (ii) the signal is significant atdistances out to 10 mpc/h; (iii) the signal decreases as z decreases; (iv) andits behavior depends strongly on the halo mass scale, with larger massesshowing stronger correlations at large distances. for the ed correlations, wefind that (i) the correlations are much stronger than the ee correlations, andare significant even out to distances of 50 mpc/h; (ii) the signal alsodecreases as z decreases; (iii) and it increases with halo mass at alldistances. we also provide empirical fitting functions for the ee and edcorrelations. the ee correlations are found to scale linearly with the lineardensity correlation function, xi(r). while the ed cross-correlation is found toscale as xi^{1/2}(r) at large distances beyond 10 mpc/h. the best-fit values ofthe fitting parameters for the ee and the ed correlations are all determinedthrough chi^{2}-statistics. our results may be useful for quantifying thefilamentary distribution of dark matter halos over a wide range of scales.

1101.5761	the effect of coupled dark energy on the alignment between dark matter  and galaxy distributions in clusters	we investigate the effects of a coupled dark energy (cde) scalar field on thealignment between satellites and matter distributions in galaxy clusters. usinghigh-resolution n-body simulations for lcdm and cde cosmological models, wecompute the probability density distribution for the alignment angle betweenthe satellite galaxies and underlying matter distributions, finding adifference between the two scenarios. with respect to lcdm, in cde cosmologiesthe satellite galaxies are less preferentially located along the major axis ofthe matter distribution, possibly reducing the tension with obersevationaldata. a physical explanation is that the coupling between dark matter and darkenergy acts as an additional tidal force on the satellite galaxies diminishingthe alignments between their distribution and the matter one. through a waldtest based on the generalized chi-square statistics, the null hypothesis thatthe two probability distributions come from the same parent population isrejected at the 99 % confidence level. it is concluded that the galaxy-matteralignment in clusters may provide a unique probe of dark sector interactions aswell as the nature of dark energy.

1106.5104	modeling the alignment profile of satellite galaxies in clusters	analyzing the halo and galaxy catalogs from the millennium simulations atredshifts $z=0,\ 0.5,\ 1$, we determine the alignment profiles of clustergalaxies by measuring the average alignments between the major axes of thepseudo inertia tensors from all satellites within cluster's virial radius andfrom only those satellites within some smaller radius as a function of thetop-hat scale difference. the alignment profiles quantify how well thesatellite galaxies retain the memory of the external tidal fields after merginginto their host clusters and how fast they lose the initial alignment tendencyas the cluster's relaxation proceeds. it is found that the alignment profiledrops faster at higher redshifts and on smaller mass scales. this result isconsistent with the picture that the faster merging of the satellites andearlier onset of the nonlinear effect inside clusters tend to break thepreferential alignments of the satellites with the external tidal fields.modeling the alignment profile of cluster galaxies as a power-law of thedensity correlation coefficient that is independent of the power spectrumnormalization ($\sigma_{8}$) and demonstrating that the density correlationcoefficient varies sensitively with the density parameter ($\omega_{m}$) andneutrino mass fraction ($f_{\nu}$), we suggest that the alignment profile ofcluster galaxies might be useful for breaking the $\omega_{m}$-$\sigma_{8}$ and$f_{\nu}$-$\sigma_{8}$ degeneracies.

1108.1712	the relative abundance of isolated clusters as a probe of dark energy	those galaxy clusters which do not belong to the superclusters are referredto as the isolated clusters. their relative abundance at a given epoch may be apowerful constraint of the dark energy equation of state since it dependsstrongly on how fast the structures grow on the largest scale in the universe.we note that the mass function of the isolated clusters can be separatelyevaluated through the modification of the recently developedcorasaniti-achitouv (ca) theory according to which the stochastic collapsebarrier is quantified by two coefficients: the drifting average coefficient(\beta) and the diffusion coefficient (d_b). regarding $\beta$ in the caformalism as an adjustable parameter and assuming that the formation ofisolated clusters corresponds to the case of d_b=0, we determine the massfunction of the isolated clusters by fitting the numerical results from themice simulations to the modified ca formula. it is found that the best-fitvalue of beta changes with redshift and that the ca mass function with d_b=0agrees very well with the numerical results at various redshifts. defining therelative abundance of the isolated clusters, xi_i, as the ratio of thecumulative mass function of the isolated clusters to that of the non-isolatedclusters at a given epoch, we finally show how sensitively xi_i changes withthe dark energy equation of state. it is also discussed how xi_i can help tobreak the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the otherkey cosmological parameters.

1203.0869	voids in redshift space	we study the ellipticity probability distribution function (pdf) of voids inredshift space with galaxies as tracers of the shapes of voids. we find thatthe redshift space distortion on the shape of voids statistically increases theellipticities of voids, and leaves a prominent feature on the ellipticity pdfas a substantial reduction in the probability of having voids with smallellipticity. the location of this characteristic cutoff of the ellipticity pdfis an explicit function of the logarithmic growth rate, and it can be used as aprobe of cosmology once the radial density profile of voids is betterunderstood. however, the biggest limiting factor for the use of ellipticity pdfas a probe of cosmology lies in the poisson noise from a small number ofgalaxies to define the shape of a given void. this poisson noise creates asignificant contamination of the resulting ellipticity pdf so that the shape ofthe original pdf is almost washed-out. nevertheless, there is a way to overcomethe poisson noise via the alcock paczynski test on the shape of stacked voids.in redshift space, since the void is elongated toward the line of sight, thestacked void has non-zero ellipticity, which can be a tell-tale of thelogarithmic growth rate. although some useful information of void ellipticitywill be lost by stacking, in this way, we can see the effect of redshift spacedistortion as a source of anisotropy in the stacked void ellipticity. we thinkthat the stacking analysis of the voids in redshift space is potentially apowerful tool to probe the cosmology.

1210.8321	how does the surface density and size of disk galaxies measured in  hydrodynamic simulations correlate with the halo spin parameter?	late-type low surface brightness galaxies (lsbs) are faint disk galaxies withcentral maximum stellar surface densities below 100 msun/pc^2. the currentlyfavored scenario for their origin is that lsbs have formed in fast-rotatinghalos with large angular momenta. we present the first numerical evidence forthis scenario using a suite of self-consistent hydrodynamic simulations of a2.3e11 msun galactic halo, in which we investigate the correlations between thedisk stellar/gas surface densities and the spin parameter of its host halo. aclear anti-correlation between the surface densities and the halo spinparameter, lambda, is found. that is, as the halo spin parameter increases, thedisk cutoff radius at which the stellar surface density drops below 0.1msun/pc^2 monotonically increases, while the average stellar surface density ofthe disk within that radius decreases. the ratio of the average stellar surfacedensity for the case of lambda=0.03 to that for the case of lambda=0.14 reachesmore than 15. we demonstrate that the result is robust against variations inthe baryon fraction, confirming that the angular momentum of the host halo isan important driver for the formation of lsbs.

1301.0348	detection of the vorticity effect on the disk orientations	we present an observational evidence for the vorticity effect on thenonlinear evolution of the galaxy angular momentum. we first calculate thevorticity as the curl of the peculiar velocity field reconstructed from the2mass redshift survey. then, measuring the alignments between the vorticity andthe tidal shear fields, we study how the alignment strength and tendencydepends on the cosmic web environment. it is found that in the knot andfilament regions the vorticity vectors are anti-aligned with the directions ofthe maximal volume compression while in the void and sheet regions they areanti-aligned with the directions of the minimal compression. determining thespin axes of the nearby large face-on and edge-on disk galaxies from theseventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey and measuring theircorrelations with the vorticity vectors at the galaxy positions, we finallydetect a clear signal of the alignments between the galaxy spin and the localvorticity fields. the null hypothesis that there is no alignment between themis rejected at the 99.999% confidence level. our result supportsobservationally the recently proposed scenario that although the galaxy angularmomentum originates from the initial tidal interaction in the linear regime itssubsequent evolution is driven primarily by the cosmic vorticity field.

0801.0634	the size distribution of void filaments in a lcdm cosmology	the size distribution of mini-filaments in voids has been derived from themillennium run halo catalogs at redshifts z=0,0.5,1 and 2. it is assumed thatthe primordial tidal field originated the presence of filamentary substructuresin voids and that the void filaments have evolved only little, keeping theinitial memory of the primordial tidal field. applying the filament-findingalgorithm based on the minimal spanning tree (mst) technique to the millenniumvoids, we identify the mini-filaments running through voids and measure theirsizes at each redshift. then, we calculate the comoving number density of voidfilaments as a function of their sizes in the logarithmic interval anddetermine an analytic fitting function for it. it is found that the sizedistribution of void mini-filaments in the logarithmic interval has an almostuniversal shape, insensitive to the redshift: in the short-size section it iswell approximated as a power-law, while in the long-size section it decreasesexponentially. we expect that the universal size distribution of void filamentsmay provide a useful cosmological probe without resorting to the rms densityfluctuations.

0801.1558	the variation of galaxy morphological type with the shear of environment	recent n-body simulations have shown that the assembly history of galactichalos depend on the density of large-scale environment. it implies that thegalaxy properties like age and size of bulge may also vary with the surroundinglarge-scale structures, which are characterized by the tidal shear as well asthe density. by using a sample of 15,882 well-resolved nearby galaxies from thetully catalog and the real space tidal field reconstructed from the 2massredshift survey (2mrs), we investigate the dependence of galaxy morphologicaltype on the shear of large-scale environment where the galaxies are embedded.we first calculate the large scale dimensionless overdensities (d) and thelarge-scale ellipticities (e) of the regions where the tully galaxies arelocated and classify the tully galaxies according to their morphological typesand create subsamples selected at similar value of d but span different rangesin e. we calculate the mean ellipticity, &lt;e&gt;, averaged over each subsample andfind a signal of variation of &lt;e&gt; with galaxy morphological type: for the caseof 0.5&lt;=d&lt;=1.0, the ellipticals are found to be preferentially located in theregions with low ellipticity. for the case of -0.3&lt;=d&lt;=0.1, the latest-typespirals are found to be preferentially located in the regions with highellipticity. the null hypothesis that the mean ellipticities of the regionswhere the ellipticals and the latest type spirals are located are same as theglobal mean ellipticity averaged over all types is rejected at 3 sigma levelwhen -0.3&lt;=d&lt;=0.1. yet, no signal of galaxy-shear correlation is found in thehighly overdense/underdense regions. the observed trend suggests that theformation epochs of galactic halos might be a function not only of halo massand large-scale density but also of large-scale shear.

1311.7187	massive gravity wrapped in the cosmic web	we study how the filamentary pattern of the cosmic web changes if the truegravity deviates from the general relativity (gr) on the large scale. the f(r)gravity whose strength is controlled to satisfy the current observationalconstraints on the cluster scale is adopted as our fiducial model and a largen-body simulation of high-resolution is utilized for this study. by applyingthe minimal spanning tree algorithm to the halo catalogs from the simulation atvarious epochs, we identify the main stems of the rich superclusters located inthe most prominent filamentary section of the cosmic web and determine theirspatial extents per member cluster as the degree of their straightness. it isfound that the $f(r)$ gravity has an effect of significantly bending thesuperclusters and that the effect becomes stronger as the universe evolves.even in the case where the deviation from gr is too small to be detectable byany other observables, the degree of the supercluster straightness exhibitsconspicuous difference between the $f(r)$ and the gr models. our results alsoimply that the supercluster straightness could be a useful discriminator off(r) gravity from the coupled dark energy since it is shown to evolvedifferently between the two models. as a final conclusion, the degree of thestraightness of the rich superclusters should provide a powerful cosmologicaltest of large scale gravity.

1404.3639	breaking the cosmic degeneracy between modified gravity and massive  neutrinos with the cosmic web	in a recent work, baldi et al. highlighted the issue of cosmic degeneracies,consisting in the fact that the standard statistics of the large-scalestructure might not be sufficient to conclusively test cosmological modelsbeyond $\lambda $cdm when multiple extensions of the standard scenario coexistin nature. in particular, it was shown that the characteristic features of an$f(r)$ modified gravity theory and of massive neutrinos with an appreciabletotal mass $\sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}$ are suppressed in most of the basiclarge-scale structure observables for a specific combination of the mainparameters of the two non-standard models. in the present work, we explore thepossibility that the mean specific size of the supercluster spines -- which wasrecently proposed as a non-standard statistics by shim and lee to probe gravityat large scales -- can help to break this cosmic degeneracy. by analyzing thehalo samples from n-body simulations featuring various combinations of $f(r)$and $\sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}$ we find that -- at the present epoch -- the valueof $\sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}$ required to maximally suppress the effects of$f(r)$ gravity on the specific sizes of the superclusters spines is differentfrom that found for the other standard statistics. furthermore, it is alsoshown that at higher redshifts ($z\ge 0.3$) the deviations of the mean specificsizes of the supercluster spines for all of the four considered combinationsfrom its value for the standard $\lambda$cdm case are statisticallysignificant.

1406.5250	alignments of the galaxies in and around the virgo cluster with the  local velocity shear	an observational evidence is presented for the alignment between the cosmicsheet and the principal axis of the velocity shear field at the position of thevirgo cluster. the galaxies in and around the virgo cluster from the extendedvirgo cluster catalog recently constructed by kim et al. are used to determinethe direction of the local sheet. the peculiar velocity field reconstructedfrom the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 is analyzed to estimate thelocal velocity shear tensor at the virgo center. showing first that the minorprincipal axis of the local velocity shear tensor is almost parallel to theline of sight direction, we detect a clear signal of alignment between thepositions of the virgo satellites and the intermediate principal axis of thelocal velocity shear projected onto the plane of the sky. furthermore, thedwarf satellites are found to appear more strongly aligned than the normalcounterparts, which is interpreted as indication of the following: (i) thenormal and the dwarf satellites fall in the virgo cluster preferentially alongthe local filament and the local sheet, respectively. (ii) the local filamentis aligned with the minor principal axis of the local velocity shear while thelocal sheet is in parallel to the plane spanned by the minor and theintermediate principal axes. our result is consistent with the recent numericalclaim that the velocity shear is a good tracer of the cosmic web.

0803.1759	connecting the physical properties of galaxies with the overdensity and  tidal shear of the large-scale environment	we have examined the correlations between the large-scale environment ofgalaxies and their physical properties, using a sample of 28,354 nearbygalaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey, and the large-scale tidalfield reconstructed in real space from the 2mass redshift survey and smoothedover a radius of $\sim 6 h^{-1}$mpc. the large-scale environment is expressedin terms of the overdensity, the ellipticity of the shear and the type of thelarge-scale structure. the physical properties analyzed include $r$-bandabsolute magnitude $m_{^{0.1}r}$, stellar mass $m_\ast$, $g-r$ colour,concentration parameter $r_{90}/r_{50}$ and surface stellar mass density$\mu_\ast$.  both luminosity and stellar mass are found to be statistically linked to thelarge-scale environment, regardless of how the environment is quantified. moreluminous (massive) galaxies reside preferentially in the regions with higherdensities, lower ellipticities and halo-like structures. at fixed luminosity,the large-scale overdensity depends strongly on parameters related to therecent star formation history, that is colour and d(4000), but is almostindependent of the structural parameters $r_{90}/r_{50}$ and $\mu_\ast$. allthe physical properties are statistically linked to the shear of thelarge-scale environment even when the large-scale density is constrained to anarrow range. this statistical link has been found to be most significant inthe quasi-linear regions where the large-scale density approximates to an orderof unity, but no longer significant in highly nonlinear regimes with$\delta_{\rm ls}\gg 1$.

1407.4168	the extended zel'dovich mass functions of clusters and isolated clusters  in the presence of primordial non-gaussianity	we present new formulae for the mass functions of the clusters and theisolated clusters with non gaussian initial conditions. for this study, weadopt the extended zel'dovich (ezl) model as a basic framework, focusing on thecase of primordial non-gaussianity of the local type whose degree is quantifiedby a single parameter $f_{nl}$. by making a quantitative comparison with then-body results, we first demonstrate that the ezl formula with the constantvalues of three fitting parameters still works remarkably well for the local$f_{nl}$ case. we also modify the ezl formula to find an analytic expressionfor the mass function of isolated clusters which turns out to have only onefitting parameter other than the overall normalization factor and showed thatthe modified ezl formula with a constant value of the fitting parameter matchesexcellently the n-body results with various values of $f_{nl}$ at variousredshifts. given the simplicity of the generalized ezl formulae and their goodagreements with the numerical results, we finally conclude that the ezl massfunctions of the massive clusters and isolated clusters should be useful as ananalytic guideline to constrain the scale dependence of the primordialnon-gaussianity of the local type.

1408.6608	detection of the velocity shear effect on the spatial distributions of  the galactic satellites in isolated systems	we report a detection of the effect of the large-scale velocity shear on thespatial distributions of the galactic satellites around the isolated hosts.identifying the isolated galactic systems each of which consists of a singlehost galaxy and its satellites from the seventh data release of the sloandigital sky survey and reconstructing linearly the velocity shear field in thelocal universe, we measure the alignments between the relative positions of thesatellites from their isolated hosts and the principal axes of the localvelocity shear tensors projected on to the plane of sky. we find a clear signalthat the galactic satellites in isolated systems are located preferentiallyalong the directions of the minor principal axes of the large-scale velocityshear field. those galactic satellites which are spirals, brighter, located atdistances larger than the projected virial radii of the hosts and belonging tothe spiral hosts yield stronger alignment signals, which implies that thealignment strength depends on the formation and accretion epochs of thegalactic satellites. it is also shown that the alignment strength is quiteinsensitive to the cosmic web environment as well as the size and luminosity ofthe isolated hosts. although this result is consistent with the numericalfinding of libeskind et al. based on a n-body experiment, due to the very lowsignificance of the observed signals it remains inconclusive whether or not thevelocity shear effect on the satellite distribution is truly universal.

1412.0178	an observational signal of the void shape correlation and its link to  the cosmic web	the shapes of cosmic voids are prone to distortions by the external tidalforces since their low-densities imply a lower internal resistance. thissusceptibility of the void shapes to the tidal distortions makes them useful asan indicator of the large-scale tidal and density fields, despite the practicaldifficulty in defining them. using the void catalog constructed by pan et al.(2012) from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdssdr7), we detect a clear 4 sigma signal of spatial correlations of the voidshapes on the scale of 20 mpc/h and show that the signal is robust against theprojection of the void shapes onto the plane of sky. by constructing a simpleanalytic model for the void shape correlation, within the framework of tidaltorque theory, we demonstrate that the void shape correlation function scaleslinearly with the two-point correlation function of the linear density field.we also find a direct observational evidence for the cross-correlation of thevoid shapes with the large-scale velocity shear field that was linearlyreconstructed by lee et al. (2014) from the sdss dr7. we discuss thepossibility of using the void shape correlation function to break thedegeneracy between the density parameter and the power spectrum amplitude andto independently constrain the neutrino mass as well.

1501.07064	a new dynamical mass measurement for the virgo cluster using the radial  velocity profile of the filament galaxies	the radial velocities of the galaxies in the vicinity of a cluster showsdeviation from the pure hubble flow due to their gravitational interaction withthe cluster. according to a recent study of falco et al. (2014) based on ahigh-resolution n-body simulation, the radial velocity profile of the galaxieslocated at distances larger than three times the virial radius of a neighborcluster can be well approximated by a universal formula and could bereconstructed from direct observables provided that the galaxies aredistributed along one dimensional filament. they suggested an algorithm for theestimation of the dynamic mass of a cluster $m_{\rm v}$ by fitting theuniversal formula from the simulation to the reconstructed radial velocityprofile of the filament galaxies around the cluster from observations. we applythe algorithm to two narrow straight filaments (called the filament a and b)that were identified recently by kim et al. (2015) in the vicinity of the virgocluster from the nasa-sloan-atlas catalog. the dynamical mass of the virgocluster is estimated to be $m_{\rmv}=(0.84^{+2.75}_{-0.51})\times10^{15}\,h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ and $m_{\rm v}=(3.24^{+4.99}_{-1.31})\times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ for the cases of thefilament a and b, respectively. we discuss observational and theoreticalsystematics intrinsic to the method of falco et al.

1504.00077	an observational detection of the bridge effect of void filaments	the bridge effect of void filaments is a phrase coined by park &amp; lee (2009b)to explain the correlations found in a numerical experiment between theluminosity of the void galaxies and the degree of the straightness of theirhost filaments. their numerical finding implies that a straight void filamentprovides a narrow channel for the efficient transportation of gas and matterparticles from the surroundings into the void galaxies. analyzing the sloanvoid catalog constructed by pan et al (2012), we identify the filamentarystructures in void regions and determine the specific size of each voidfilament as a measure of its straightness. to avoid possible spurious signalscaused by the malmquist bias, we consider only those void filaments whoseredshifts are in the range of 0=&lt; z &lt;= 0.02 and find a clear tendency that thevoid galaxies located in the more straight filaments are on average moreluminous, which is in qualitative agreement with the numerical prediction. itis also shown that the strength of correlation increases with the number of themember galaxies of the void filaments, which can be physically understood onthe grounds that the more stretched filaments can connect the densesurroundings even to the galaxies located deep in the central parts of thevoids. this observational evidence may provide a key clue to the puzzling issueof why the void galaxies have higher specific star formation rates and bluercolors than their wall counterparts.

1511.00056	a bound violation on the galaxy group scale: the turn-around radius of  ngc 5353/4	the first observational evidence for the violation of the maximum turn-aroundradius on the galaxy group scale is presented. the ngc 5353/4 group is chosenas an ideal target for our investigation of the bound-violation because of itsproximity, low-density environment, optimal mass scale, and existence of anearby thin straight filament. using the observational data on theline-of-sight velocities and three-dimensional distances of the filamentgalaxies located in the bound zone of the ngc 5353/4 group, we construct theirradial velocity profile as a function of separation distance from the groupcenter and then compare it to the analytic formula obtained empirically byfalco et al. (2014) to find the best-fit value of an adjustable parameter withthe help of the maximum likelihood method. the turn-around radius of ngc 5353/4is determined to be the separation distance where the adjusted analytic formulafor the radial velocity profile yields zero. the estimated turn-around radiusof ngc 5353/4 turns out to substantially exceed the upper limit predicted bythe spherical model based on the lambdacdm cosmology. even when the restrictivecondition of spherical symmetry is released, the estimated value is found to beonly marginally consistent with the lambdacdm expectation.

astro-ph;0111186	detection of galaxy spin alignments in the pscz shear field	we report the first direct observational evidence for alignment of galaxyspin axes with the local tidal shear field. we measure quantitatively thestrength of this directional correlation of disk galaxies from the tullycatalog with the local shear field reconstructed from pscz galaxies. wedemonstrate that the null hypothesis of random galaxy alignments relative tothe shear frame can be ruled out more than 99.98 % confidence. the observedintrinsic correlation averaged over the censored samples that have detectednon-zero signals is measured in terms of the alignment parameter 'a=0.17 +/-0.04', which includes only statistical errors of the censored data, but not thecosmic variance error. the reconstruction procedure is likely to underestimates'a' systematically. our result is consistent with the linear tidal torquemodel, and supports the idea that the present galaxy spins may be used as aprobe of primordial tidal shear and mass density fields. the intrinsicalignments of galaxy spins dominate over weak gravitational lensing for shallowsurveys such like sdss, while it should be negligible for deeper surveys at z ~1.

astro-ph;0306102	arc statistics in triaxial dark matter halos: testing the collisionless  cold dark matter paradigm	statistics of lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies serve as a powerful probeof both the non-sphericity and the inner slope of dark matter halos. we developa semi-analytic method to compute the number of arcs in triaxial dark matterhalos. this combines the lensing cross section from the monte carlo ray-tracingsimulations, and the probability distribution function (pdf) of the axis ratiosevaluated from cosmological n-body simulations. this approach enables one toincorporate both asymmetries in the projected mass density and elongationsalong the line-of-sight analytically, for the first time in cosmological lensedarc statistics. as expected, triaxial dark matter halos significantly increasethe number of arcs relative to spherical models; the difference amounts to morethan one order of magnitude while the value of enhancement depends on thespecific properties of density profiles. then we compare our theoreticalpredictions with the observed number of arcs from 38 x-ray selected clusters.in contrast to the previous claims, our triaxial dark matter halos with innerdensity profile \rho \propto r^{-1.5} in a lambda-dominated cold dark matter(cdm) universe reproduces well the observation. since both the central massconcentration and triaxial axis ratios (minor to major axis ratio ~0.5)required to account for the observed data are consistent with cosmologicaln-body simulations, our result may be interpreted to lend strong support forthe collisionless cdm paradigm at the mass scale of clusters.

astro-ph;0604017	on the environmental dependence of galaxy properties established by the  initial cosmological conditions	we study theoretically how the initial cosmological conditions establish thedependence of galaxy properties on the environment. first, we adopt the lineartidal torque theory according to which the angular momentum of a proto-galaxyis generated at first order by the misalignment between the proto-galaxyinertia tensor and the local tidal tensor. then, we quantify analytically thedegree of the misalignment between the two tensors, and show quantitativelythat it increases as the density of the environment decreases. it implies thatthe proto-galaxies forming in the lower density regions should end up withhaving higher angular momentum than those in the higher density regions, whichis consistent with recent numerical finding that the void and field galaxieshave higher spin parameters than the cluster galaxies. since the galaxy angularmomentum plays a role of developing a disk-like structure and hindering thestar-formation, our theoretical insight provides an answer to such fundamentalobservational question as why the large void galaxies have young stellarpopulations and high specific star formation rate, which was not explained bythe previous morphology-density relation.

astro-ph;9709200	the cosmological mass distribution function in the zel'dovich  approximation	an analytic approximation to the mass function for gravitationally boundobjects is presented. we base on the zel'dovich approximation to extend thepress-schechter formalism to a nonspherical dynamical model. a simpleextrapolation of that approximation suggests that the gravitational collapsealong all three directions which eventually leads to the formation of realvirialized objects - clumps occur in the regions where the lowest eigenvalue ofthe deformation tensor,lambda_{3}, is positive. we derive the conditionalprobability of lambda_{3}&gt;0 as a function of the linearly extrapolated densitycontrast, delta, and the conditional probability distribution of delta providedthat lambda_{3}&gt;0. these two conditional probability distributions show thatthe most probable density of the bound regions (lambda_{3}&gt;0) is roughly 1.5 atthe characteristic mass scale, and that the probability of lambda_{3}&gt;0 isalmost unity in the highly overdense regions (delta&gt;3*sigma). finally ananalytic mass function of clumps is derived with a help of one simple ansatzwhich is employed to treat the multistream regions beyond the validity of thezel'dovich approximation. the resulting mass function is renormalized by afactor of 12.5, which we justify with a sharp k-space filter by means of themodified jedamzik analysis. our mass function is shown to be different from thepress-schechter one, having a lower peak and predicting more small-massobjects.

astro-ph;9803221	the large scale biasing and the primordial gravitational potential	we modified the press-schechter (ps) formalism and then analytically deriveda constrained mass distribution function n(m|varphi) for the regions havingsome specified value of the primordial gravitational potential, varphi. theresulting modified ps theory predicts that gravitationally bound clumps withmasses corresponding to rich clusters are significantly biased toward theregions of negative primordial potential - the troughs of the potential. theprediction is quantitative, depending on the mass and the depth of the troughs,which can be tested in large n-body simulations. as an illustration of themagnitude of the effect we calculate the constrained mass function for the cdmmodel with gamma = omega h = 0.25 normalized to sigma_{8} = 1. in particular,we show that the probability of finding a clump of mass 10^{14} -10^{15}h^{-1}m_{odot} in the region of negative initial potential is 1.3 - 3times greater (depending on the mass) than that in the region ofpositiveinitial potential. the scale of the potential fluctuationsr_{varphi}=sqrt{3} sigma_{varphi}/sigma_{varphi'} is shown to be approx 120h^{-1} mpc for the spectrum in question. the rms mass density contrast on thisscale is only about sigma_{delta}(r_{varphi}) approx 0.03. assuming that themodified ps theory is statistically correct, we conclude that clusters aresignificantly biased (b ge 10, b is a bias factor defined by delta n_{cl}/n_{cl} = b delta rho_m/rho_m) toward the regions having negative initialpotential.
