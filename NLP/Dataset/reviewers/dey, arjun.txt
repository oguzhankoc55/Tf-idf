0901.1109	the cosmic evolution of agn in galaxy clusters	we present the surface density of luminous active galactic nuclei (agn)associated with a uniformly selected galaxy cluster sample identified in the8.5 square degree bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. the clustersare distributed over a large range of redshift (0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5) and we identifyagn using three different selection criteria: mid-ir color, radio luminosity,and x-ray luminosity. relative to the field, we note a clear overdensity of thenumber of agn within 0.5 mpc of the cluster centers at z &gt; 0.5. the amplitudeof this agn overdensity increases with redshift. although there are significantdifferences between the agn populations probed by each selection technique, therise in cluster agn surface density generally increases more steeply than thatof field quasars. in particular, x-ray selected agn are at least three timesmore prevalent in clusters at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 compared to clusters at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.this effect is stronger than can be explained by the evolving median richnessof our cluster sample. we thus confirm the existence of a butcher-oemler typeeffect for agn in galaxy clusters, with the number of agn in clustersincreasing with redshift.

0901.4121	host galaxies, clustering, eddington ratios, and evolution of radio,  x-ray, and infrared-selected agns	we explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei(agns) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxyproperties, clustering, and eddington ratios of agns selected in the radio,x-ray, and infrared. we study a sample of 585 agns at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 usingredshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages) and data in the radio(wsrt 1.4 ghz), x-rays (chandra xbootes), and mid-ir (irac shallow survey). theradio, x-ray, and ir agn samples show modest overlap, indicating that to theflux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of agns. wederive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as eddington ratios(lambda), for obscured or optically faint agns. we also measure the two-pointcross-correlation between agns and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h^-1 mpc, andderive typical dark matter halo masses. we find that: (1) radio agns are mainlyfound in luminous red galaxies, are strongly clustered (with m_halo ~ 3x10^13h^-1 m_sun), and have very low lambda &lt;~ 10^-3; (2) x-ray-selected agns arepreferentially found in galaxies in the "green valley" of color-magnitude spaceand are clustered similarly to typical ages galaxies (m_halo ~ 10^13 h^-1m_sun), with 10^-3 &lt;~ lambda &lt;~ 1; (3) ir agns reside in slightly bluer, lessluminous galaxies than x-ray agns, are weakly clustered (m_halo &lt;~ 10^12 h^-1m_sun), and have lambda &gt; 10^-2. we interpret these results in terms of asimple model of agn and galaxy evolution, whereby a "quasar" phase and thegrowth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches acritical mass between ~10^12 and 10^13 m_sun. subsequently, star formationceases and agn accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and ir-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically-faint, radio-bright) modes.

0903.2219	the star formation and nuclear accretion histories of normal galaxies in  the ages survey	we combine ir, optical and x-ray data from the overlapping, 9.3 square degreenoao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs), agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages),and xbootes survey to measure the x-ray evolution of 6146 normal galaxies as afunction of absolute optical luminosity, redshift, and spectral type over thelargely unexplored redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. because only the closest orbrightest of the galaxies are individually detected in x-rays, we use astacking analysis to determine the mean properties of the sample. our resultssuggest that x-ray emission from spectroscopically late-type galaxies isdominated by star formation, while that from early-type galaxies is dominatedby a combination of hot gas and agn emission. we find that the mean starformation and supermassive black hole accretion rate densities evolve like(1+z)^3, in agreement with the trends found for samples of bright, individuallydetectable starburst galaxies and agn. our work also corroborates the resultsof many previous stacking analyses of faint source populations, with improvedstatistics.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0904.1231	high redshift dust obscured galaxies, a morphology-sed connection  revealed by keck adaptive optics	a simple optical to mid-ir color selection, r-[24] &gt; 14, i.e. f_nu(24) /f_nu(r) &gt; 1000, identifies highly dust obscured galaxies (dogs) with typicalredshifts of z~2 +/- 0.5. extreme mid-ir luminosities (l_{ir} &gt; 10^{12-14})suggest that dogs are powered by a combination of agn and star formation,possibly driven by mergers. in an effort to compare their photometricproperties with their rest frame optical morphologies, we obtained high spatialresolution (0.05 -0.1") keck adaptive optics (ao) k'-band images of 15 dogs.the images reveal a wide range of morphologies, including: small exponentialdisks (8 of 15), small ellipticals (4 of 15), and unresolved sources (2 of 15).one particularly diffuse source could not be classified because of low signalto noise ratio. we find a statistically significant correlation between galaxyconcentration and mid-ir luminosity, with the most luminous dogs exhibitinghigher concentration and smaller physical size. dogs with high concentrationalso tend to have spectral energy distributions (seds) suggestive of agnactivity. thus central agn light may be biasing the morphologies of the moreluminous dogs to higher concentration. conversely, more diffuse dogs tend toshow an sed shape suggestive of star formation. two of fifteen in the sampleshow multiple resolved components with separations of ~1 kpc, circumstantialevidence for ongoing mergers.

0905.4274	strong pah emission from z~2 ulirgs	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, wepresent low-resolution (64 &lt; lambda / dlambda &lt; 124), mid-infrared (20-38micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ulirgs detected in the bootes field of thenoao deep wide-field survey. all of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24micron) &gt; 0.5 mjy; 2) r-[24] &gt; 14 vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into spitzer's 3-8 micron iracbands. of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs),usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. the pah features indicateredshifts in the range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, with a mean of &lt;z&gt;=1.96 and a dispersionof 0.30. based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infraredluminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. our results confirmprevious indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can beefficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, andthat the fraction of starburst-dominated ulirgs increases to faint 24 micronflux densities. using local templates, we find that the observed narrowredshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability ofpah-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. we can analogously explain thebroader redshift distribution of spitzer-detected agn-dominated ulirgs based onthe shapes of their seds. finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with adetectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient agn emission toveil the 7.7 micron pah band.

0907.3185	active galactic nuclei and the truncation of star formation in k+a  galaxies	we have searched for active galactic nuclei (agns) in k+a galaxies, usingmultiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy in the bootes field of the noao deepwide-field survey. the k+a galaxies, which have had their star formationrapidly truncated, are selected via their strong balmer absorption lines andweak h-alpha emission. our sample consists of 24 k+a galaxies selected from6594 0.10&lt;z&lt;0.35 galaxies brighter than i=20 with optical spectroscopy from theagn and galaxy evolution survey. two thirds of the k+a galaxies are likelyongoing galaxy mergers, with nearby companion galaxies or tidal tails. galaxymergers may be responsible for the truncation of star formation, or we areobserving the aftermath of merger triggered starbursts. as expected, theoptical colors of k+a galaxies largely fall between blue galaxies with ongoingstar formation and red passive galaxies. however, only 1% of the galaxies withcolors between the red and blue populations are k+a galaxies, and we concludethat the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies must have been unusuallyabrupt (&lt;100 myr). we examined the agn content of k+a galaxies with bothoptical emission-line ratios (bpt diagrams) and chandra x-ray imaging. at leasthalf of all k+a galaxies display the optical emission-line ratios of agns, anda third of m_r&lt;-22 k+a galaxies host agns with x-ray luminosities of 10^{42}erg/s. the faintest k+a galaxies do not show clear evidence for hosting agns,having emission-line ratios consistent with photoionization by massive starsand few x-ray detections. we speculate that two mechanisms may be responsiblefor the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies, with agn feedback onlyplaying a role in m_r&lt;-20.5 galaxies.

0909.2650	infrared luminosities and dust properties of z ~ 2 dust-obscured  galaxies	we present sharc-ii 350um imaging of twelve 24um-bright (f_24um &gt; 0.8 mjy)dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) and carma 1mm imaging of a subset of 2 dogs, allselected from the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. detectionsof 4 dogs at 350um imply ir luminosities which are consistent within a factorof 2 of expectations based on a warm dust spectral energy distribution (sed)scaled to the observed 24um flux density. the 350um upper limits for the 8non-detected dogs are consistent with both mrk231 and m82 (warm dust seds), butexclude cold dust (arp220) seds. the two dogs targeted at 1mm were not detectedin our carma observations, placing strong constraints on the dust temperature:t_dust &gt; 35-60 k. assuming these dust properties apply to the entire sample, wefind dust masses of ~3x10^8 m_sun. in comparison to other dusty z ~ 2 galaxypopulations such as sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs) and other spitzer-selectedhigh-redshift sources, this sample of dogs has higher ir luminosities (2x10^13l_sun vs. 6x10^12 l_sun for the other galaxy populations), warmer dusttemperatures (&gt;35-60 k vs. ~30 k), and lower inferred dust masses (3x10^8 m_sunvs. 3x10^9 m_sun). herschel and scuba-2 surveys should be able to detecthundreds of these power-law dominated dogs. we use hst and spitzer/irac data toestimate stellar masses of these sources and find that the stellar to gas massratio may be higher in our 24um-bright sample of dogs than in smgs and otherspitzer-selected sources. although larger sample sizes are needed to provide adefinitive conclusion, the data are consistent with an evolutionary trend inwhich the formation of massive galaxies at z~2 involves a sub-millimeterbright, cold-dust and star-formation dominated phase followed by a 24um-bright,warm-dust and agn-dominated phase.

0910.2234	a physical model for z~2 dust obscured galaxies	we present a physical model for the origin of z~2 dust-obscured galaxies(dogs), a class of high-redshift ulirgs selected at 24 micron which areparticularly optically faint (24/r&gt;1000). by combining n-body/sph simulationsof high redshift galaxy evolution with 3d polychromatic dust radiative transfermodels, we find that luminous dogs (with f24 &gt; 0.3 mjy at z~2 are well-modeledas extreme gas-rich mergers in massive (~5x10^12-10^13 msun) halos, withelevated star formation rates (~500-1000 msun/yr) and/or significant agn growth(mdot &gt; 0.5 msun/yr), whereas less luminous dogs are more diverse in nature. atfinal coalescence, merger-driven dogs transition from being starburst dominatedto agn dominated, evolving from a "bump" to a power-law shaped mid-ir (irac)spectral energy distribution (sed). after the dog phase, the galaxy settlesback to exhibiting a "bump" sed with bluer colors and lower star formationrates. while canonically power-law galaxies are associated with beingagn-dominated, we find that the power-law mid-ir sed can owe both to direct agncontribution, as well as to a heavily dust obscured stellar bump at times thatthe galaxy is starburst dominated. thus power-law galaxies can be eitherstarburst or agn dominated. less luminous dogs can be well-represented eitherby mergers, or by massive ($m_{\rm baryon} ~5x10^11 msun) secularly evolvinggas-rich disc galaxies (with sfr &gt; 50 msun/yr). by utilising similar models asthose employed in the smg formation study of narayanan et al. (2010), weinvestigate the connection between dogs and smgs. we find that the most heavilystar-forming merger driven dogs can be selected as submillimetre galaxies(smgs), while both merger-driven and secularly evolving dogs typically satisfythe bzk selection criteria.

0912.2799	the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~4	we have conducted a spectroscopic survey to find faint quasars (-26.0 &lt;m_{1450} &lt; -22.0) at redshifts z=3.8-5.2 in order to measure the faint end ofthe quasar luminosity function at these early times. using available opticalimaging data from portions of the noao deep wide-field survey and the deep lenssurvey, we have color-selected quasar candidates in a total area of 3.76 deg^2.thirty candidates have r &lt;= 23 mags. we conducted spectroscopic followup for 28of our candidates and found 23 qsos, 21 of which are reported here for thefirst time, in the 3.74 &lt; z &lt;5.06 redshift range. we estimate our surveycompleteness through detailed monte carlo simulations and derive the firstmeasurement of the density of quasars in this magnitude and redshift interval.we find that the binned luminosity function is somewhat affected by thek-correction used to compute the rest-frame absolute magnitude at 1450a.considering only our r &lt;= 23 sample, the best-fit single power-law (phi \proptol^beta) gives a faint-end slope beta = -1.6+/-0.2. if we consider our larger,but highly incomplete sample going one magnitude fainter, we measure a steeperfaint-end slope -2 &lt; beta &lt; -2.5. in all cases, we consistently find faint-endslopes that are steeper than expected based on measurements at z ~ 3. wecombine our sample with bright quasars from the sloan digital sky survey toderive parameters for a double-power-law luminosity function. our best fitfinds a bright-end slope, alpha = -2.4+/-0.2, and faint-end slope, beta =-2.3+/-0.2, without a well-constrained break luminosity. this is effectively asingle power-law, with beta = -2.7+/-0.1. we use these results to place limitson the amount of ultraviolet radiation produced by quasars and find thatquasars are able to ionize the intergalactic medium at these redshifts.

0707.4182	a luminosity function of lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift 4.5	we present a catalog of 59 z=4.5 lyman alpha emitting galaxiesspectroscopically confirmed in a campaign of keck/deimos follow-up observationsto candidates selected in the large area lyman alpha (lala) narrow-band imagingsurvey. we targeted 97 candidates for spectroscopic follow-up; by accountingfor the variety of conditions under which we performed spectroscopy, weestimate a selection reliability of about 76%. together with our previoussample of keck/lris confirmations, the 59 sources confirmed herein bring thetotal catalog to 73 spectroscopically confirmed z=4.5 lyman alpha emittinggalaxies in the 0.7 square degrees covered by the lala imaging. as with thekeck/lris sample, we find that a non-negligible fraction of the confirmed lymanalpha lines have rest-frame equivalent widths (w_{rest}) which exceed themaximum predicted for normal stellar populations: 17% -- 31% (93% confidence)of the detected galaxies show w_{rest} &gt; 190 aa, and 12% -- 27% (90%confidence) show w_{rest} &gt; 240 aa. we construct a luminosity function of z=4.5lyman alpha emission lines for comparison to lyman alpha luminosity functionsspanning 3.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.6. we find no significant evidence for lyman alphaluminosity function evolution from z ~ 3 to z ~ 6. this result supports theconclusion that the intergalactic medium remains largely reionized from thelocal universe out to z=6.5. it is somewhat at odds with the pronounced drop inthe cosmic star formation rate density recently measured between z~3 and z~6 incontinuum-selected lyman-break galaxies, and therefore potentially sheds lighton the relationship between the two populations.

1004.1436	ultracool field brown dwarf candidates selected at 4.5 microns	we have identified a sample of cool field brown dwarf candidates using iracdata from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs). the candidates wereselected from 400,000 sdwfs sources with [4.5] &lt;= 18.5 mag and required to have[3.6]-[4.5] &gt;= 1.5 and [4.5] - [8.0] &lt;= 2.0 on the vega system. the first colorrequirement selects objects redder than all but a handful of presently knownbrown dwarfs with spectral classes later than t7, while the second eliminates14 probable reddened agn. optical detection of 4 of the remaining 18 sourcesimplies they are likely also agn, leaving 14 brown dwarf candidates. for two ofthe brightest candidates (sdwfs j143524.44+335334.6 and sdwfsj143222.82+323746.5), the spectral energy distributions including near-infrareddetections suggest a spectral class of ~ t8. the proper motion is &lt; 0.25 "/yr,consistent with expectations for a luminosity inferred distance of &gt;70 pc. thereddest brown dwarf candidate (sdwfs j143356.62+351849.2) has [3.6] -[4.5]=2.24 and h - [4.5] &gt; 5.7, redder than any published brown dwarf in thesecolors, and may be the first example of the elusive y-dwarf spectral class.models from burrows et al.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

1009.3022	the average physical properties and star formation histories of the  uv-brightest star-forming galaxies at z~3.7	[abridged] we investigate the average physical properties and star formationhistories of the most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies at z~3.7. our resultsare derived from analyses of the average spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed from stacked optical to infrared photometry, of a sample of the1,902 most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies found in 5.3 square degrees of thenoao deep wide-field survey. we bin the sample according to uv luminosity, andfind that the shape of the average sed in the rest-frame optical and infraredis fairly constant with uv luminosity: i.e., more uv luminous galaxies are, onaverage, also more luminous at longer wavelengths. in the rest-uv, however, thespectral slope (measured at 0.13-0.28 um) rises steeply with the median uvluminosity from -1.8 at l l* to -1.2 in the brightest bin (l~4-5l*). we usepopulation synthesis analyses to derive the average physical properties ofthese galaxies and find that: (1) l_uv, and thus star formation rates (sfrs),scale closely with stellar mass such that more uv-luminous galaxies are alsomore massive; (2) the median ages indicate that the stellar populations arerelatively young (200-400 myr) and show little correlation with uv luminosity;and (3) more uv-luminous galaxies are dustier than their less-luminouscounterparts, such that l~4-5l* galaxies are extincted up to a(1600)=2 magwhile l l* galaxies have a(1600)=0.7-1.5 mag. based on these observations, weargue that the average star formation histories of uv-luminous galaxies arebetter described by models in which sfr increases with time in order tosimultaneously reproduce the tight correlation between the observed sfr andstellar mass, and the universally young ages of these galaxies. we demonstratethe potential of measurements of the sfr-m* relation at multiple redshifts todiscriminate between simple models of star formation histories.

1102.2929	the dirt on dry mergers	using data from the spitzer space telescope, we analyze the mid-infrared(3-70 micron) spectral energy distributions of dry merger candidates in thebootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. these candidates were selectedby previous authors to be luminous, red, early-type galaxies with morphologicalevidence of recent tidal interactions. we find that a significant fraction ofthese candidates exhibit 8 and 24 micron excesses compared to expectations forold stellar populations. we estimate that a quarter of dry merger candidateshave mid-infrared-derived star formation rates greater than ~1 msun/yr. thisrepresents a "frosting" on top of a large old stellar population, and has beenseen in previous studies of elliptical galaxies. further, the dry mergercandidates include a higher fraction of starforming galaxies relative to acontrol sample without tidal features. we therefore conclude that the starformation in these massive ellipticals is likely triggered by merger activity.our data suggest that the mergers responsible for the observed tidal featureswere not completely dry, and may be minor mergers involving a gas-rich dwarfgalaxy.

1102.3918	the line polarization within a giant lyman-alpha nebula	recent theoretical work has suggested that lyman-alpha nebulae could besubstantially polarized in the lyman-alpha emission line, depending on thegeometry, kinematics, and powering mechanism at work. polarization observationscan therefore provide a useful constraint on the source of ionization in thesesystems. in this letter, we present the first lyman-alpha polarizationmeasurements for a giant lyman-alpha nebula at z~2.656. we do not detect anysignificant linear polarization of the lyman-alpha emission:p_{lyman-alpha}=2.6+/-2.8% (corrected for statistical bias) within a singlelarge aperture. the current data also do not show evidence for the radialpolarization gradient predicted by some theoretical models. these results ruleout singly scattered lyman-alpha (e.g., from the nearby agn) and may beinconsistent with some models of backscattering in a spherical outflow.however, the effects of seeing, diminished signal-to-noise ratio, and angleaveraging within radial bins make it difficult to put strong constraints on theradial polarization profile. the current constraints may be consistent withhigher density outflow models, spherically symmetric infall models,photoionization by star formation within the nebula or the nearby agn, resonantscattering, or non-spherically symmetric cold accretion (i.e., alongfilaments). higher signal-to-noise ratio data probing to higher spatialresolution will allow us to harness the full diagnostic power of polarizationobservations in distinguishing between theoretical models of giant lyman-alphanebulae.

1102.4616	black hole masses and star formation rates of z &gt;1 dust obscured  galaxies (dogs): results from keck osiris integral field spectroscopy	we have obtained high spatial resolution keck osiris integral fieldspectroscopy of four z~1.5 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies that exhibit broadh-alpha emission lines indicative of strong agn activity. the observations weremade with the keck laser guide star adaptive optics system giving a spatialresolution of 0.1", or &lt;1 kpc at these redshifts. these high spatial resolutionobservations help to spatially separate the extended narrow-line regions ---possibly powered by star formation --- from the nuclear regions, which may bepowered by both star formation and agn activity. there is no evidence forextended, rotating gas disks in these four galaxies. assuming dust correctionfactors as high as a(h-alpha)=4.8 mag, the observations suggest lower limits onthe black hole masses of (1 - 9) x 10^8 solar masses, and star formation rates&lt;100 solar masses per year. the black hole masses and star formation rates ofthe sample galaxies appear low in comparison to other high-z galaxies withsimilar host luminosities. we explore possible explanations for theseobservations including, host galaxy fading, black hole growth, and the shutdown of star formation.

1102.4850	clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the bootes field:  placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web	we present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infraredselected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 bootes multiwavelength survey. recentlythe spitzer space telescope and x-ray observations have revealed largepopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of thex-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. to date, little isknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the massesof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolutionof black holes and galaxies. in this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infraredselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxycross-correlation function w_p(r). the observed clustering yieldscharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) =12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (qso-1s) and obscuredquasars (obs-qsos), respectively. the results for qso-1s are in excellentagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while weconclude that the obs-qsos are at least as strongly clustered as the qso-1s. wetest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faintobs-qsos, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on theclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clusteringamplitude of the obs-qsos by at most ~20%. we compare our results to previousstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering forobscured quasars.

1103.3527	hst morphologies of z ~ 2 dust-obscured galaxies ii: bump sources	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging of 22 ultra-luminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) at z~2 with extremely red r-[24] colors (called dust-obscuredgalaxies, or dogs) which have a local maximum in their spectral energydistribution (sed) at rest-frame 1.6um associated with stellar emission. thesesources, which we call "bump dogs", have star-formation rates of 400-4000msun/yr and have redshifts derived from mid-ir spectra which show strongpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission --- a sign of vigorous on-goingstar-formation. using a uniform morphological analysis, we look forquantifiable differences between bump dogs, power-law dogs (spitzer-selectedulirgs with mid-ir seds dominated by a power-law and spectral features that aremore typical of obscured active galactic nuclei than starbursts),sub-millimeter selected galaxies (smgs), and other less-reddened ulirgs fromthe spitzer extragalactic first look survey (xfls). bump dogs are larger thanpower-law dogs (median petrosian radius of 8.4 +/- 2.7 kpc vs. 5.5 +/- 2.3 kpc)and exhibit more diffuse and irregular morphologies (median m_20 of -1.08 +/-0.05 vs. -1.48 +/- 0.05). these trends are qualitatively consistent withexpectations from simulations of major mergers in which merging systems duringthe peak star-formation rate period evolve from m_20 = -1.0 to m_20 = -1.7.less obscured ulirgs (i.e., non-dogs) tend to have more regular, centrallypeaked, single-object morphologies rather than diffuse and irregularmorphologies. this distinction in morphologies may imply that less obscuredulirgs sample the merger near the end of the peak star-formation rate period.alternatively, it may indicate that the intense star-formation in theseless-obscured ulirgs is not the result of a recent major merger.

1106.6055	searching for z~7.7 lyman alpha emitters in the cosmos field with  newfirm	the study of ly-alpha emission in the high-redshift universe is a usefulprobe of the epoch of reionization, as the ly-alpha line should be attenuatedby the intergalactic medium (igm) at low to moderate neutral hydrogenfractions. here we present the results of a deep and wide imaging search forly-alpha emitters in the cosmos field. we have used two ultra-narrowbandfilters (filter width of ~8-9 {\deg}a) on the newfirm camera, installed on themayall 4m telescope at kitt peak national observatory, in order to isolately-alpha emitters at z = 7.7; such ultra-narrowband imaging searches haveproved to be excellent at detecting ly-alpha emitters. we found 5-sigmadetections of four candidate ly-alpha emitters in a survey volume of 2.8 x 10^4mpc^3 (total survey area ~760 arcmin^2). each candidate has a line flux greaterthan 8 x 10^-18 erg s^-1 cm^-2. using these results to construct a luminosityfunction and comparing to previously established ly-alpha luminosity functionsat z = 5.7 and z = 6.5, we find no conclusive evidence for evolution of theluminosity function between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7. statistical monte carlosimulations suggest that half of these candidates are real z = 7.7 targets, andspectroscopic follow-up will be required to verify the redshift of thesecandidates. however, our results are consistent with no strong evolution in theneutral hydrogen fraction of the igm between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7, even if onlyone or two of the z = 7.7 candidates are spectroscopically confirmed.

1111.0630	resolving the galaxies within a giant lya nebula: witnessing the  formation of a galaxy group?	detailed analysis of the substructure of lya nebulae can put importantconstraints on the physical mechanisms at work and the properties of galaxiesforming within them. using high resolution hst imaging of a lya nebula atz~2.656, we have taken a census of the compact galaxies in the vicinity, usedoptical/near-infrared colors to select system members, and put constraints onthe morphology of the spatially-extended emission. the system is characterizedby (a) a population of compact, low luminosity (~0.1 l*) sources --- 17primarily young, small (re~1-2 kpc), disky galaxies including an obscured agn--- that are all substantially offset (&gt;20 kpc) from the line-emitting nebula;(b) the lack of a central galaxy at or near the peak of the lya emission; and(c) several nearly coincident, spatially extended emission components --- lya,heii, and uv continuum --- that are extremely smooth. these morphologicalfindings are difficult to reconcile with theoretical models that invokeoutflows, cold flows, or resonant scattering, suggesting that while all ofthese physical phenomena may be occurring, they are not sufficient to explainthe powering and large extent of lya nebulae. in addition, although the compactgalaxies within the system are irrelevant as power sources, the region issignificantly overdense relative to the field galaxy population (by at least afactor of 4). these observations provide the first estimate of the luminosityfunction of galaxies within an individual lya nebula system, and suggest thatlarge lya nebulae may be the seeds of galaxy groups or low-mass clusters.

1111.2603	a successful broad-band survey for giant lya nebulae i: survey design  and candidate selection	giant lya nebulae (or lya "blobs") are likely sites of ongoing massive galaxyformation, but the rarity of these powerful sources has made it difficult toform a coherent picture of their properties, ionization mechanisms, and spacedensity. systematic narrow-band lya nebula surveys are ongoing, but the smallredshift range covered and the observational expense limit the comoving volumethat can be probed by even the largest of these surveys and pose a significantproblem when searching for such rare sources. we have developed a systematicsearch technique designed to find large lya nebulae at 2&lt;z&lt;3 within deepbroad-band imaging and have carried out a survey of the 9.4 square degree noaodeep wide-field survey (ndwfs) bootes field. with a total survey comovingvolume of ~10^8 h^-3_70 mpc^3, this is the largest volume survey for lyanebulae ever undertaken. in this first paper in the series, we present thedetails of the survey design and a systematically-selected sample of 79candidates, which includes one previously discovered lya nebula.

1111.2869	the star-formation histories of z~2 dogs and smgs	the spitzer space telescope has identified a population of ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z ~ 2 that may play an important role in theevolution of massive galaxies. we measure the stellar masses of two populationsof spitzer-selected ulirgs, both of which have extremely red r-[24] colors(dust-obscured galaxies, or dogs) and compare our results with sub-millimeterselected galaxies (smgs). one set of 39 dogs has a local maximum in theirmid-ir spectral energy distribution (sed) at rest-frame 1.6um associated withstellar emission ("bump dogs"), while the other set of 51 dogs has a power-lawdominated mid-ir sed with spectral features typical of obscured agn ("power-lawdogs"). we use stellar population synthesis models applied self-consistently tobroad-band photometry in the rest-frame ultra-violet, optical, andnear-infrared of each of these populations and test a variety of stellarpopulation synthesis codes, star-formation histories (sfhs), and initial massfunctions (imfs). assuming a simple stellar population sfh and a chabrier imf,we find that the median and inner quartile stellar masses of smgs, bump dogsand power-law dogs are given by log(m_*/m_sun) = 10.42_-0.36^+0.42,10.62_-0.32^+0.36, and 10.71_-0.34^+0.40, respectively. implementing morecomplicated sfhs with multiple age components increases these mass estimates byup to 0.5 dex. our stellar mass estimates are consistent with physicalmechanisms for the origin of z~2 ulirgs that result in high star-formationrates for a given stellar mass. such mechanisms are usually driven by a majormerger of two gas-rich systems, rather than smooth accretion of gas and smallsatellites.

1209.2414	herschel detection of dust emission from uv-luminous star-forming  galaxies at 3.3&lt;z&lt;4.3	we report the herschel spire detection of dust emission arising fromuv-luminous (l&gt;~l*) star-forming galaxies at 3.3&lt;z&lt;4.3. our sample of 1,913lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidates is selected over an area of 5.3 deg2 in thebootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. this is one of the largestsamples of uv-luminous galaxies at this epoch and enables an investigation ofthe bright end of the galaxy luminosity function. we divide our sample intothree luminosity bins and stack the herschel spire data to measure the averagespectral energy distribution (sed) of lbgs at far-infrared (fir) wavelengths.we find that these galaxies have average ir luminosities of (3-5)x10^{11}l_sunand 60-70% of their star-formation obscured by dust. the fir seds peak atlambda&gt;100um, suggesting dust temperatures (t_d=27-30k) significantly colderthan that of local galaxies of comparable ir luminosities. the observedir-to-uv luminosity ratio (irx=l_ir/l_uv) is low (~3-4) compared with thatobserved for z~2 lbgs (irx(z~2)~7.1+/-1.1). the correlation between the slopeof the uv continuum and irx for galaxies in the two lower luminosity binssuggests dust properties similar to those of local starburst galaxies. however,the galaxies in the highest luminosity bin appear to deviate from the localrelation, suggesting that their dust properties may differ from those of theirlower-luminosity and low-redshift counterparts. we speculate that the most uvluminous galaxies at this epoch are being observed in a short-lived and youngevolutionary phase.

1209.2707	evidence for a wide range of uv obscuration in z ~ 2 dusty galaxies from  the goods-herschel survey	dusty galaxies at z ~ 2 span a wide range of relative brightness betweenrest-frame mid-infrared (8um) and ultraviolet wavelengths. we attempt todetermine the physical mechanism responsible for this diversity. dust-obscuredgalaxies (dogs), which have rest-frame mid-ir to uv flux density ratios &gt; 1000,might be abnormally bright in the mid-ir, perhaps due to prominent agn and/orpah emission, or abnormally faint in the uv. we use far-infrared data from thegoods-herschel survey to show that most dogs with 10^12 l_sun &lt; l_ir &lt; 10^13l_sun are not abnormally bright in the mid-ir when compared to other dustygalaxies with similar ir (8--1000um) luminosities. we observe a relationbetween the median ir to uv luminosity ratios and the median uv continuumpower-law indices for these galaxies, and we find that only 24% have specificstar formation rates which indicate the dominance of compact star-formingregions. this circumstantial evidence supports the idea that the uv- andir-emitting regions in these galaxies are spatially coincident, which implies aconnection between the abnormal uv faintness of dogs and dust obscuration. weconclude that the range in rest-frame mid-ir to uv flux density ratios spannedby dusty galaxies at z ~ 2 is due to differing amounts of uv obscuration. ofgalaxies with these ir luminosities, dogs are the most obscured. we attributedifferences in uv obscuration to either: 1) differences in the degree ofalignment between the spatial distributions of dust and massive stars, or 2)differences in the total dust content.

1211.2823	pah emission in powerful high-redshift radio galaxies	we present the mid-infrared spectra of seven of the most powerfulradio-galaxies known to exist at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6. the radio emission of thesesources is dominated by the agn with 500 mhz luminosities in the range 10^27.8- 10^29.1 w/hz. the agn signature is clearly evident in the mid-infraredspectra, however, we also detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission,indicative of prodigious star formation at a rate of up to ~1000 msun/yr.interestingly, we observe no significant correlation between agn power and starformation in the host galaxy. we also find most of these radio galaxies to haveweak 9.7 um silicate absorption features (tau_{9.7 um} &lt; 0.8) which impliesthat their mid-ir obscuration is predominantly due to the dusty torus thatsurrounds the central engine, rather than the host galaxy. the tori are likelyto have an inhomogeneous distribution with the obscuring structure consistingof individual clouds. we estimate that these radio galaxies have already formedthe bulk of their stellar mass and appear to lie at a stage in their evolutionwhere the obscured agn dominates the energy output of the system but starformation is also prevalent.

1211.3114	a successful broad-band survey for giant lya nebulae ii: spectroscopic  confirmation	using a systematic broad-band search technique, we have carried out a surveyfor large lya nebulae (or lya "blobs") at 2&lt;z&lt;3 within 8.5 square degrees ofthe noao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs) bootes field, corresponding to a totalsurvey comoving volume of ~10^8 h_70^-3 mpc^3. here, we present ourspectroscopic observations of candidate giant lya nebulae. of 26 candidatestargeted, 5 were confirmed to have lya emission at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7, four of whichwere new discoveries. the confirmed lya nebulae span a range of lya equivalentwidths, colors, sizes, and line ratios, and most show spatially-extendedcontinuum emission. the remaining candidates did not reveal any strong emissionlines, but instead exhibit featureless, diffuse, blue continuum spectra. theirnature remains mysterious, but we speculate that some of these might be lyanebulae lying within the redshift desert (i.e., 1.2&lt;z&lt;1.6). our spectroscopicfollow-up confirms the power of using deep broad-band imaging to search for thebright end of the lya nebula population across enormous comoving volumes.

1211.6798	the clustering of extremely red objects	we measure the clustering of extremely red objects (eros) in ~8 deg^2 of thenoao deep wide field survey bo\"otes field in order to establish robust linksbetween ero z~1.2 and local galaxy z&lt;0.1 populations. three different colorselection criteria from the literature are analyzed to assess the consequencesof using different criteria for selecting eros. specifically, our samples are(r-k_s)&gt;5.0 (28,724 galaxies), (i-k_s)&gt;4.0 (22,451 galaxies) and (i-[3.6])&gt;5.0(64,370 galaxies). magnitude-limited samples show the correlation length (r_0)to increase for more luminous eros, implying a correlation with stellar mass.we can separate star-forming and passive ero populations using the (k_s-[24])and ([3.6]-[24]) colors to k_s=18.4 and [3.6]=17.5, respectively. star-formingand passive eros in magnitude limited samples have different clusteringproperties and host dark halo masses, and cannot be simply understood as asingle population. based on the clustering, we find that bright passive erosare the likely progenitors of &gt;4l^* elliptical galaxies. bright eros withongoing star formation were found to occupy denser environments thanstar-forming galaxies in the local universe, making these the likelyprogenitors of &gt;l^* local ellipticals. this suggests that the progenitors ofmassive &gt;4l^* local ellipticals had stopped forming stars by z&gt;1.2, but thatthe progenitors of less massive ellipticals (down to l^*) can still showsignificant star formation at this epoch.

1212.4835	probing high-redshift galaxy formation at the highest luminosities: new  insights from deimos spectroscopy	we present deimos spectroscopic observations of the most uv-luminousstar-forming galaxies at 3.2&lt;z&lt;4.6. our sample contains galaxies withluminosities of l*&lt;l&lt;7l* and is one of the largest samples to date of the mostuv-luminous galaxies at these redshifts. our data confirm 41 star-forminggalaxies at 3.2&lt;z&lt;4.6 and validate the clean selection of the photometriccandidates. we find that the fraction of lya emitting galaxies increases withdecreasing uv luminosity. we find strong evidence of large-scale outflows,transporting the neutral/ionized gas in the interstellar medium away from thegalaxy. galaxies exhibiting both interstellar absorption and lya emission linesshow a significant velocity offset between the two features (200-1140 km/s). wefind tentative evidence that this measure of the outflow velocity increaseswith uv luminosity and/or stellar mass. the luminosity- and mass-dependentoutflow strengths suggest that the efficiency of feedback and enrichment of thesurrounding medium depend on these parameters. we present composite spectra ofthe absorption-line-only and lya-emitting subsets of the uv luminous galaxiesat z~3.7. the composite spectra are similar to those of lower-z andlower-luminosity lbgs samples, but with some subtle differences. analyses ofthe composite spectra suggest that the uv luminous lbgs at z~3.7 may have ahigher covering fraction of absorbing gas, and may be older than their lower-zand lower-luminosity counterparts. in addition, we have discovered 5 galaxiesthat belong to a massive overdensity at z=3.78. finally, two galaxies each showtwo distinct sets of interstellar absorption features. the latter may be a signof a final stage of major merger, or clumpy disk formation. their presenceimplies that frequency of such sources among our luminous z~3.7 lbgs may be anorder of magnitude higher than in lower redshift and lower luminosity samples.

1304.5231	spitzer spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies: diagnostics of agn  and star formation and contribution to total infrared luminosity	we use spitzer irs spectroscopy to study the nature 65 ir-luminous galaxiesat 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 with f(24micron) &gt; 1.2mjy. the irs spectra cover wavelengthsspanning the pah features and important atomic diagnostic lines. our samplecorresponds to l(ir) = l(8-1000micron) = 10^10-10^12 lsun. we divide ourgalaxies into those with spitzer irac colors indicative of warm dust heated byan agn (iragn) and those whose colors indicate star-formation processes(non-iragn). compared to the non-iragn, the iragn show smaller pah emissionews, which we attribute to an increase in mid-ir continuum from the agn. wefind that in both the iragn and non-iragn samples, the pah luminositiescorrelate strongly with the [ne ii] emission, from which we conclude that thepah luminosity directly traces the instantaneous sfr in both the iragn andnon-iragn galaxies. we compare the ratio of pah luminosity to the total irluminosity and show that for most iragn star-formation accounts for 10-50% ofthe l(ir). we also find no measurable difference between the pah luminosityratios of l(11.3)/l(7.7) and l(6.2)/l(7.7) for the iragn and non-iragn,suggesting that agn do not significantly excite or destroy pah molecules ongalaxy-wide scales. a small subset of galaxies show excess of [o iv] emissioncompared to their pah emission, which indicates the presence ofheavily-obscured agn, including 3 galaxies that are not otherwise selected asiragn. the low pah emission and low [ne ii] emission of the iragn and [oiv]-excess objects imply they have low sfrs and their ir luminosity isdominated by processes associated with the agn.

0801.1860	a significant population of very luminous dust-obscured galaxies at  redshift z ~ 2	observations with spitzer space telescope have recently revealed asignificant population of high-redshift z~2 dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) withlarge mid-ir to uv luminosity ratios. these galaxies have been missed intraditional optical studies of the distant universe. we present a simple methodfor selecting this high-z population based solely on the ratio of the observedmid-ir 24um to optical r-band flux density. in the 8.6 sq.deg bootes ndwfsfield, we uncover ~2,600 dog candidates (= 0.089/sq.arcmin) with 24um fluxdensities f24&gt;0.3mjy and (r-[24])&gt;14 (i.e., f[24]/f[r] &gt; 1000). these galaxieshave no counterparts in the local universe, and become a larger fraction of thepopulation at fainter f24, representing 13% of the sources at 0.3~mjy. dogsexhibit evidence of both star-formation and agn activity, with the brighter24um sources being more agn- dominated. we have measured spectroscopicredshifts for 86 dogs, and find a broad z distribution centered at &lt;z&gt;~2.0.their space density is 2.82e-5 per cubic mpc, similar to that of brightsub-mm-selected galaxies at z~2. these redshifts imply very large luminositieslir&gt;~1e12-14 lsun. dogs contribute ~45-100% of the ir luminosity densitycontributed by all z~2 ulirgs, suggesting that our simple selection criterionidentifies the bulk of z~2 ulirgs. dogs may be the progenitors of ~4l*present-day galaxies seen undergoing a luminous,short- lived phase of bulge andblack hole growth. they may represent a brief evolution phase between smgs andless obscured quasars or galaxies.

1307.4835	the lbt bootes field survey: i. the rest-frame uv and luminosity  functions and clustering of bright lyman break galaxies at z~3	we present a deep lbt/lbc u-band imaging survey (9 deg2) covering the noaobootes field. a total of 14,485 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 areselected, which are used to measure the rest-frame uv luminosity function (lf).the large sample size and survey area reduce the lf uncertainties due topoisson statistics and cosmic variance by &gt;3 compared to previous studies. atthe bright end, the lf shows excess power compared to the best-fit schechterfunction, which can be attributed to the contribution of $z\sim3$ quasars. wecompute the rest-frame near-infrared lf and stellar mass function (smf) of z~3lbgs based on the r-band and irac [4.5 micro m]-band flux relation. weinvestigate the evolution of the uv lfs and smfs between z~7 and z~3, whichsupports a rising star formation history in the lbgs. we study the spatialcorrelation function of two bright lbg samples and estimate their average hosthalo mass. we find a tight relation between the host halo mass and the galaxystar formation rate (sfr),which follows the trend predicted by the baryonicaccretion rate onto the halo, suggesting that the star formation in lbgs isfueled by baryonic accretion through the cosmic web. by comparing the sfrs withthe total baryonic accretion rates, we find that cosmic star formationefficiency is about 5%-20% and it does not evolve significantly with redshift,halo mass, or galaxy luminosity.

0801.4578	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of distant x-ray luminous agn	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 16 optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope. these sources were jointly selected from spitzer andchandra imaging surveys in the ndwfs bootes field and were selected from theirbright x-ray fluxes to host luminous agn. none of the spectra show significantemission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; 6.2um equivalent widths&lt;0.2um), consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by agn. nineof the x-ray sources show 9.7um silicate absorption features. their redshiftsare in the range 0.9&lt;z&lt;2.6, implying infrared luminosities oflog(l{ir})=12.5-13.6 solar luminosities. the average silicate absorptionstrength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies with similar mid-infrared luminosities implying thatthe x-ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of si-rich dust thannon-x-ray selection. seven of the x-ray sources have featureless power-lawmid-ir spectra. we argue that the featureless spectra likely result from thesources having weak or absent silicate and pah features rather than the sourceslying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the irsspectral window. we investigate whether there are any correlations betweenx-ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorptionfeatures tend to have fainter x-ray fluxes and harder x-ray spectra, indicatinga weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density ofx-ray-absorbing gas.

1310.6037	h$\alpha$ star formation rates of $z$ &gt; 1 galaxy clusters in the irac  shallow cluster survey	we present hubble space telescope near-ir spectroscopy for 18 galaxy clustersat 1.0 &lt; $z$ &lt; 1.5 in the irac shallow cluster survey. we use wide field camera3 grism data to spectroscopically identify h$\alpha$ emitters in both the coresof galaxy clusters as well as in field galaxies. we find a largecluster-to-cluster scatter in the star formation rates within a projectedradius of 500 kpc, and many of our clusters (~60%) have significant levels ofstar formation within a projected radius of 200 kpc. a stacking analysisreveals that dust reddening in these star-forming galaxies is positivelycorrelated with stellar mass and may be higher in the field than the cluster ata fixed stellar mass. this may indicate a lower amount of gas in star-formingcluster galaxies than in the field population. also, h$\alpha$ equivalentwidths of star-forming galaxies in the cluster environment are still suppressedbelow the level of the field. this suppression is most significant for lowermass galaxies (log m$_{*}$ &lt; 10.0 m$_{\odot}$). we therefore conclude thatenvironmental effects are still important at 1.0 &lt; $z$ &lt; 1.5 for star-forminggalaxies in galaxy clusters with log m$_{*}$ &lt; 10.0 m$_{\odot}$.

1310.6039	the era of star formation in galaxy clusters	we analyze the star formation properties of 16 infrared-selected,spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters at $1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$ from thespitzer/irac shallow cluster survey (iscs). we present new spectroscopicconfirmation for six of these high-redshift clusters, five of which are at$z&gt;1.35$. using infrared luminosities measured with deep spitzer/mipsobservations at 24 $\mu$m, along with robust optical+irac photometric redshiftsand sed-fitted stellar masses, we present the dust-obscured star-formingfractions, star formation rates and specific star formation rates in theseclusters as functions of redshift and projected clustercentric radius. we findthat $z\sim 1.4$ represents a transition redshift for the iscs sample, withclear evidence of an unquenched era of cluster star formation at earlier times.beyond this redshift the fraction of star-forming cluster members increasesmonotonically toward the cluster centers. indeed, the specific star formationrate in the cores of these distant clusters is consistent with field values atsimilar redshifts, indicating that at $z&gt;1.4$ environment-dependent quenchinghad not yet been established in iscs clusters. combining these observationswith complementary studies showing a rapid increase in the agn fraction, astochastic star formation history, and a major merging episode at the sameepoch in this cluster sample, we suggest that the starburst activity is likelymerger-driven and that the subsequent quenching is due to feedback frommerger-fueled agn. the totality of the evidence suggests we are witnessing thefinal quenching period that brings an end to the era of star formation ingalaxy clusters and initiates the era of passive evolution.

1310.6040	the evolution of dust-obscured star formation activity in galaxy  clusters relative to the field over the last 9 billion years	we compare the star formation (sf) activity in cluster galaxies to the fieldfrom z=0.3-1.5 using $herschel$ spire 250$\mu$m imaging. we utilize 274clusters from the irac shallow cluster survey (iscs) selected as rest-framenear-infrared overdensities over the 9 square degree bootes field . thisanalysis allows us to quantify the evolution of sf in clusters over a longredshift baseline without bias against active cluster systems. using a stackinganalysis, we determine the average star formation rates (sfrs) andspecific-sfrs (ssfr=sfr/m$_{\star}$) of stellar mass-limited (m&gt;1.3x10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$), statistical samples of cluster and field galaxies, probing boththe star forming and quiescent populations. we find a clear indication that theaverage sf in cluster galaxies is evolving more rapidly than in the field, withfield sf levels at z&gt;1.2 in the cluster cores (r&lt;0.5 mpc), in good agreementwith previous iscs studies. by quantifying the sf in cluster and field galaxiesas an exponential function of cosmic time, we determine that cluster galaxiesare evolving ~2 times faster than the field. additionally, we see enhanced sfabove the field level at z~1.4 in the cluster outskirts (r&gt;0.5 mpc). thesegeneral trends in the cluster cores and outskirts are driven by the lower massgalaxies in our sample. blue cluster galaxies have systematically lower ssfrsthan blue field galaxies, but otherwise show no strong differential evolutionwith respect to the field over our redshift range. this suggests that thecluster environment is both suppressing the star formation in blue galaxies onlong time-scales and rapidly transitioning some fraction of blue galaxies tothe quiescent galaxy population on short time-scales. we argue that our resultsare consistent with both strangulation and ram pressure stripping acting inthese clusters, with merger activity occurring in the cluster outskirts.

1311.3667	on the automated and objective detection of emission lines in  faint-object spectroscopy	modern spectroscopic surveys produce large spectroscopic databases, generallywith sizes well beyond the scope of manual investigation. the need arises,therefore, for an automated line detection method with objective indicators fordetection significance. in this paper, we present an automated and objectivemethod for emission line detection in spectroscopic surveys and apply thistechnique to 1574 spectra, obtained with the hectospec spectrograph on the mmtobservatory (mmto), to detect lyman alpha emitters near z ~ 2.7. the basic ideais to generate on-source (signal plus noise) and off-source (noise only) mockobservations using monte carlo simulations, and calculate completeness andreliability values, (c, r), for each simulated signal. by comparing thedetections from real data with the monte carlo results, we assign thecompleteness and reliability values to each real detection. from 1574 spectra,we obtain 881 raw detections and, by removing low reliability detections, wefinalize 649 detections from an automated pipeline. most of high completenessand reliability detections, (c, r) ~ (1.0, 1.0), are robust detections whenvisually inspected; the low c and r detections are also marginal on visualinspection. this method at detecting faint sources is dependent on the accuracyof the sky subtraction.

0802.2489	redshift distribution of extragalactic 24 micron sources	we present the redshift distribution of a complete, unbiased sample of 24micron sources down to fnu(24 micron) = 300 ujy (5-sigma). the sample consistsof 591 sources detected in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey.we have obtained optical spectroscopic redshifts for 421 sources (71%). thesehave a redshift distribution peaking at z~0.3, with a possible additional peakat z~0.9, and objects detected out to z=4.5. the spectra of the remaining 170(29%) exhibit no strong emission lines from which to determine a redshift. wedevelop an algorithm to estimate the redshift distribution of these sources,based on the assumption that they have emission lines but that these lines arenot observable due to the limited wavelength coverage of our spectroscopicobservations. the redshift distribution derived from all 591 sources exhibitsan additional peak of extremely luminous (l(8-1000 micron) &gt; 3 x 10^{12} lsun)objects at z~2, consisting primarily of sources without observable emissionlines. we use optical line diagnostics and irac colors to estimate that 55% ofthe sources within this peak are agn-dominated. we compare our results topublished models of the evolution of infrared luminous galaxies. the modelswhich best reproduce our observations predict a large population ofstar-formation dominated ulirgs at z &gt; 1.5 rather than the agn-dominatedsources we observe.

1402.2686	pinpointing the molecular gas within a lyman alpha blob at z ~ 2.7	we present iram pdbi observations of the co(3-2) and co(5-4) line transitionsfrom a ly-alpha blob at z~2.7 in order to investigate the gas kinematics,determine the location of the dominant energy source, and study the physicalconditions of the molecular gas. co line and dust continuum emission aredetected at the location of a strong mips source that is offset by ~1.5" fromthe ly-alpha peak. neither of these emission components is resolved with the1.7" beam, showing that the gas and dust are confined to within ~7kpc from thisgalaxy. no millimeter source is found at the location of the ly-alpha peak,ruling out a central compact source of star formation as the power source forthe ly-alpha emission. combined with a spatially-resolved spectrum of ly-alphaand heii, we constrain the kinematics of the extended gas using the co emissionas a tracer of the systemic redshift. near the mips source, the ly-alphaprofile is symmetric and its line center agrees with that of co line, implyingthat there are no significant bulk flows and that the photo-ionization from themips source might be the dominant source of the ly-alpha emission. in theregion near the ly-alpha peak, the gas is slowly receding (~100km/s) withrespect to the mips source, thus making the hyper-/superwind hypothesisunlikely. we find a sub-thermal line ratio between two co transitions,i_co(5-4)/i_co(3-2)=0.97+/-0.21. this line ratio is lower than the averagevalues found in high-z smgs and qsos, but consistent with the value found inthe galactic center, suggesting that there is a large reservoir of low-densitymolecular gas that is spread over the mips source and its vicinity.

1405.2620	discovery of a very large structure at z=3.78	we report the discovery of a large-scale structure containing multipleprotoclusters at z=3.78 in the bo\"otes field. the spectroscopic discovery offive galaxies at z=3.783+/-0.002 lying within 1 mpc of one another led us toundertake a deep narrow- and broad-band imaging survey of the surroundingfield. within a comoving volume of 72x72x25 mpc^3, we have identified 65 lymanalpha emitter (lae) candidates at z=3.795+/-0.015, and four additional galaxiesat z_spec=3.730,3.753,3.780,3.835. the galaxy distribution within the field ishighly non-uniform, exhibiting three large (~3-5x) overdensities separated by8-14 mpc (physical) and possibly connected by filamentary structures traced bylaes. the observed number of laes in the entire field is nearly twice theaverage expected in field environments, based on estimates of the lyaluminosity function at these redshifts. we estimate that by z=0 the largestoverdensity will grow into a cluster of mass 10^15 msun; the two smalleroverdensities will grow into clusters of mass (2-6)x10^14 msun. the highestconcentration of galaxies is located at the southern end of the image,suggesting that the current imaging may not map the true extent of the largescale structure. finding three large protocluster candidates within a single0.3 deg^2 field is highly unusual; expectations from theory suggest that suchalignments should occur less than 2% of the time. searching for andcharacterizing such structures and accurately measuring their volume spacedensity can therefore place constraints on the theory of structure formation.such regions can also serve as laboratories for the study of galaxy formationin dense environments.

1410.3489	the clustering and halo masses of star forming galaxies at z&lt;1	we present clustering measurements and halo masses of star forming galaxiesat 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. after excluding agn, we construct a sample of 22553 24 {\mu}msources selected from 8.42 deg^2 of the spitzer mips agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey of bo\"otes. mid-infrared imaging allows us to observe galaxies with thehighest star formation rates (sfrs), less biased by dust obscuration afflictingthe optical bands. we find that the galaxies with the highest sfrs have opticalcolors which are redder than typical blue cloud galaxies, with many residingwithin the green valley. at z &gt; 0.4 our sample is dominated by luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^11 lsun) and is comprised entirely oflirgs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^12 lsun) at z &gt;0.6. we observe weak clustering of r_0 = 3-6 mpc/h for almost all of our starforming samples. we find that the clustering and halo mass depend on l_tir atall redshifts, where galaxies with higher l_tir (hence higher sfrs) havestronger clustering. galaxies with the highest sfrs at each redshift typicallyreside within dark matter halos of m_halo ~ 10^12.9 msun/h. this is consistentwith a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated,although we cannot exclude that ulirgs reside within higher mass halos. bymodeling the clustering evolution of halos, we connect our star forming galaxysamples to their local descendants. most star forming galaxies at z &lt; 1.0 arethe progenitors of l &lt; 2.5l* blue galaxies in the local universe, but starforming galaxies with the highest sfrs (l_tir &gt;10^11.7 lsun) at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 arethe progenitors of early-type galaxies in denser group environments.

1411.2589	spatially resolved gas kinematics within a ly$\alpha$ nebula: evidence  for large-scale rotation	we use spatially extended measurements of ly$\alpha$ as well as lessoptically thick emission lines from an $\approx$80 kpc ly$\alpha$ nebula at$z\approx1.67$ to assess the role of resonant scattering and to disentanglekinematic signatures from ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects. we find thatthe ly$\alpha$, civ, heii, and ciii] emission lines all tell a similar story inthis system, and that the kinematics are broadly consistent with large-scalerotation. first, the observed surface brightness profiles are similar in extentin all four lines, strongly favoring a picture in which the ly$\alpha$ photonsare produced in situ instead of being resonantly scattered from a centralsource. second, we see low kinematic offsets between ly$\alpha$ and the lessoptically thick heii line ($\sim$100-200 km s$^{-1}$), providing furthersupport for the argument that the ly$\alpha$ and other emission lines are allbeing produced within the spatially extended gas. finally, the full velocityfield of the system shows coherent velocity shear in all emission lines:$\approx$500 km s$^{-1}$ over the central $\approx$50 kpc of the nebula. thekinematic profiles are broadly consistent with large-scale rotation in a gasdisk that is at least partially stable against collapse. these observationssuggest that the ly$\alpha$ nebula represents accreting material that isilluminated by an offset, hidden agn or distributed star formation, and that isundergoing rotation in a clumpy and turbulent gas disk. with an implied mass ofm(&lt;r=20 kpc)$\sim3\times10^{11}$ $m_{\odot}$, this system may represent theearly formation of a large milky way mass galaxy or galaxy group.

1412.6717	star formation in high-redshift cluster ellipticals	we measure the star formation rates (sfrs) of massive($m_{\star}&gt;10^{10.1}m_{\odot}$) early-type galaxies (etgs) in a sample of 11high-redshift ($1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$) galaxy clusters drawn from the irac shallowcluster survey (iscs). we identify etgs visually from hubble space telescopeimaging and select likely cluster members as having either an appropriatespectroscopic redshift or red sequence color. mid-infrared sfrs are measuredusing spitzer 24 $\mu$m data for isolated cluster galaxies for whichcontamination by neighbors, and active galactic nuclei, can be ruled out.cluster etgs show enhanced specific star formation rates (ssfrs) compared tocluster galaxies in the local universe, but have ssfrs more than four timeslower than that of field etgs at $1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$. relative to the late-typecluster population, isolated etgs show substantially quenched mean sfrs, yetstill contribute 12% of the overall star formation activity measured in $1 &lt; z&lt; 1.5$ clusters. we find that new etgs are likely being formed in iscsclusters; the fraction of cluster galaxies identified as etgs increases from34% to 56% from $z \sim 1.5 \rightarrow 1.25$. while the fraction of clusteretgs that are highly star-forming ($\textrm{sfr}\geq26\ m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$)drops from 27% to 10% over the same period, their ssfrs are roughly constant.all these factors taken together suggest that, particularly at $z\gtrsim1.25$,the events that created these distant cluster etgs$-$likely mergers, at leastamong the most massive$-$were both recent and gas-rich.

0804.2293	red galaxy growth and the halo occupation distribution	we have traced the past 7 gyr of red galaxy stellar mass growth within darkmatter halos. we have determined the halo occupation distribution, whichdescribes how galaxies reside within dark matter halos, using the observedluminosity function and clustering of 40,696 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 red galaxies in bootes.half of 10^{11.9} msun/h halos host a red central galaxy, and this fractionincreases with increasing halo mass. we do not observe any evolution of therelationship between red galaxy stellar mass and host halo mass, although weexpect both galaxy stellar masses and halo masses to evolve over cosmic time.we find that the stellar mass contained within the red population has doubledsince z=1, with the stellar mass within red satellite galaxies tripling overthis redshift range. in cluster mass halos most of the stellar mass resideswithin satellite galaxies and the intra-cluster light, with a minority of thestellar mass residing within central galaxies. the stellar masses of the mostluminous red central galaxies are proportional to halo mass to the power of athird. we thus conclude that halo mergers do not always lead to rapid growth ofcentral galaxies. while very massive halos often double in mass over the past 7gyr, the stellar masses of their central galaxies typically grow by only 30%.

1503.06792	on the cosmic evolution of fe/mg in qso absorption line systems	we investigate the variation of the ratio of the equivalent widths of thefeii$\lambda$2600 line to the mgii$\lambda\lambda$2796,2803 doublet as afunction of redshift in a large sample of absorption lines drawn from thejhu-sdss absorption line catalog. we find that despite large scatter, theobserved ratio shows a trend where the equivalent width ratio$\mathcal{r}\equiv w_{\rm feii}/w_{\rm mgii}$ decreases monotonically withincreasing redshift $z$ over the range $0.55 \le z \le 1.90$. selecting thesubset of absorbers where the signal-to-noise ratio of the mgii equivalentwidth $w_{\rm mgii}$ is $\ge$3 and modeling the equivalent width ratiodistribution as a gaussian, we find that the mean of the gaussian distributionvaries as $\mathcal{r}\propto (-0.045\pm0.005)z$. we discuss various possiblereasons for the trend. a monotonic trend in the fe/mg abundance ratio ispredicted by a simple model where the abundances of mg and fe in the absorbingclouds are assumed to be the result of supernova ejecta and where the cosmicevolution in the snia and core-collapse supernova rates is related to thecosmic star-formation rate. if the trend in $\mathcal{r}$ reflects theevolution in the abundances, then it is consistent with the predictions of thesimple model.

0804.4798	clusters of galaxies in the first half of the universe from the irac  shallow survey	we have identified 335 galaxy cluster and group candidates, 106 of which areat z &gt; 1, using a 4.5 um selected sample of objects from a 7.25 deg^2 region inthe spitzer infrared array camera (irac) shallow survey. clusters wereidentified as 3-dimensional overdensities using a wavelet algorithm, based onphotometric redshift probability distributions derived from irac and noao deepwide-field survey data. we estimate only ~10% of the detections are spurious.to date 12 of the z &gt; 1 candidates have been confirmed spectroscopically, atredshifts from 1.06 to 1.41. velocity dispersions of ~750 km/s for two of theseargue for total cluster masses well above 10^14 m_sun, as does the massestimated from the rest frame near infrared stellar luminosity. although notselected to contain a red sequence, some evidence for red sequences is presentin the spectroscopically confirmed clusters, and brighter galaxies aresystematically redder than the mean galaxy color in clusters at all redshifts.the mean i - [3.6] color for cluster galaxies up to z ~ 1 is well matched by apassively evolving model in which stars are formed in a 0.1 gyr burst startingat redshift z_f = 3. at z &gt; 1, a wider range of formation histories is needed,but higher formation redshifts (i.e. z_f &gt; 3) are favored for most clusters.

1504.00006	network analysis of cosmic structures : network centrality and  topological environment	we apply simple analyses techniques developed for the study of complexnetworks to the study of the cosmic web, the large scale galaxy distribution.in this paper, we measure three network centralities (ranks of topologicalimportance), degree centrality (dc), closeness centrality (cl), and betweennesscentrality (bc) from a network built from the cosmological evolution survey(cosmos) catalog. we define 8 galaxy populations according to the centralitymeasures; void, wall, and cluster by dc, main branch and dangling leaf by bc,and kernel, backbone, and fracture by cl. we also define three populations byvoronoi tessellation density to compare these with the dc selection. we applythe topological selections to galaxies in the (photometric) redshift range$0.91&lt;z&lt;0.94$ from the cosmos survey, and explore whether the red and bluegalaxy populations show differences in color, star-formation rate (sfr) andstellar mass in the different topological regions. despite the limitations anduncertainties associated with using photometric redshift and indirectmeasurements of galactic parameters, the preliminary results illustrate thepotential of network analysis. the coming future surveys will provide betterstatistical samples to test and improve this "network cosmology".

1509.06381	probing the physical properties of z=4.5 lyman alpha emitters with  spitzer	we present the results from a stellar population modeling analysis of asample of 162 z=4.5, and 14 z=5.7 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) in thebootes field, using deep spitzer/irac data at 3.6 and 4.5 um from the spitzerlyman alpha survey, along with hubble space telescope nicmos and wfc3 imagingat 1.1 and 1.6 um for a subset of the laes. this represents one of the largestsamples of high-redshift laes imaged with spitzer irac. we find that 30/162(19%) of the z=4.5 laes and 9/14 (64%) of the z=5.7 laes are detected at&gt;3-sigma in at least one irac band. individual z=4.5 irac-detected laes have alarge range of stellar mass, from 5x10^8 to 10^11 msol. one-third of theirac-detected laes have older stellar population ages of 100 myr - 1 gyr, whilethe remainder have ages &lt; 100 myr. a stacking analysis of irac-undetected laesshows this population to be primarily low mass (8 -- 20 x 10^8 msol) and young(64 - 570 myr). we find a correlation between stellar mass and thedust-corrected ultraviolet-based star-formation rate (sfr) similar to that atlower redshifts, in that higher mass galaxies exhibit higher sfrs. however, thez=4.5 lae correlation is elevated 4-5 times in sfr compared tocontinuum-selected galaxies at similar redshifts. the exception is the mostmassive laes which have sfrs similar to galaxies at lower redshifts suggestingthat they may represent a different population of galaxies than the traditionallower-mass laes, perhaps with a different mechanism promoting lyman alphaphoton escape.

0807.1115	morphologies of high redshift, dust obscured galaxies from keck laser  guide star adaptive optics	spitzer mips images in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyhave revealed a class of extremely dust obscured galaxy (dog) at z~2. the dogsare defined by very red optical to mid-ir (observed-frame) colors, r - [24 um]&gt; 14 mag, i.e. f_v (24 um) / f_v (r) &gt; 1000. they are ultra-luminous infraredgalaxies with l_8-1000 um &gt; 10^12 -10^14 l_sun, but typically have very faintoptical (rest-frame uv) fluxes. we imaged three dogs with the keck laser guidestar adaptive optics (lgsao) system, obtaining ~0.06'' resolution in thek'-band. one system was dominated by a point source, while the other two wereclearly resolved. of the resolved sources, one can be modeled as a exponentialdisk system. the other is consistent with a de vaucouleurs profile typical ofelliptical galaxies. the non-parametric measures of their concentration andasymmetry, show the dogs to be both compact and smooth. the ao images rule outdouble nuclei with separations of greater than 0.1'' (&lt; 1 kpc at z=2), makingit unlikely that ongoing major mergers (mass ratios of 1/3 and greater) aretriggering the high ir luminosities. by contrast, high resolution images of z~2scuba sources tend to show multiple components and a higher degree ofasymmetry. we compare near-ir morphologies of the dogs with a set of z=1luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs; l_ir ~ 10^11 l_sun) imaged with keck lgsaoby the center for adaptive optics treasury survey. the dogs in our sample havesignificantly smaller effective radii, ~1/4 the size of the z=1 lirgs, and tendtowards higher concentrations. the small sizes and high concentrations may helpexplain the globally obscured rest-frame blue-to-uv emission of the dogs.

astro-ph;0002239	one-line redshifts and searches for high-redshift lyman-alpha emission	we report the serendipitous discovery of two objects close in projection withfairly strong emission lines at long wavelength (~9190 a). one (a) seems not tobe hosted by any galaxy brighter than v(555)=27.5, or i(814)=26.7 (vega-based3-sigma limits in 1.0 arcsec diameter apertures), while the other line isassociated with a faint (i(814)~24.4) red galaxy (b) offset by 2.7 arcsec and 7a spectrally. both lines are broad (fwhm 700 km/s), extended spatially, andhave high equivalent widths (w(a,obs)&gt;1225 a, 95% confidence limit;w(b,obs)~150 a). no secondary spectral features are detected for galaxy a. bluecontinuum and the marginal detection of a second weak line in the spectrum ofgalaxy b is consistent with [oii] (the strong line) and mgii (the weak line) atz=1.466. by association, galaxy a is likely at z=1.464, implying a rest-frameequivalent width of the [oii] emission line in excess of 600 a and a projectedseparation of 30 kpc for the galaxy pair. conventional wisdom states thatisolated emission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths larger than ~200 aare almost exclusively lyman-alpha. this moderate-redshift discovery thereforecompromises recent claims of high-redshift lyman-alpha emitters for which othercriteria (i.e., line profile, associated continuum decrements) are notreported. we discuss observational tests to distinguish lyman-alpha emitters athigh redshift from foreground systems.

astro-ph;0003465	first results from the large area lyman alpha survey	we report on a new survey for z=4.5 lyman alpha sources, the large area lymanalpha (lala) survey. our survey achieves an unprecedented combination of volumeand sensitivity by using narrow-band filters on the new 8192x8192 pixel ccdmosaic camera at the 4 meter mayall telescope of kitt peak nationalobservatory.  well-detected sources with flux and equivalent width matching known highredshift lyman alpha galaxies (i.e., observed equivalent width above 80angstroms and line+continuum flux between 2.6e-17 and 5.2e-17 erg/cm^2/sec inan 80 angstrom filter) have an observed surface density corresponding to 11000+- 700 per square degree per unit redshift at z=4.5. spatial variation in thissurface density is apparent on comparison between counts in 6561 and 6730angstrom filters.  early spectroscopic followup results from the keck telescope included threesources meeting our criteria for good lyman alpha candidates. of these, one isconfirmed as a z=4.52 source, while another remains consistent with eitherz=4.55 or z=0.81. we infer that 30 to 50% of our good candidates are bona fidelyman alpha emitters, implying a net density of about 4000 lyman alpha galaxiesper square degree per unit redshift.

astro-ph;0004348	stellar populations and galaxy morphology at high redshift	in this article we investigate the morphology and stellar populations ofhigh-redshift galaxies through multi-waveband hst imaging and ground-basedspatially-resolved spectroscopy. we study the redshift evolution of galaxymorphology in the hubble deep field, using the deep idt-nicmos near-infraredhst imaging coupled with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. using themulti-waveband data to compare the appearance of galaxies at the samerest-frame wavelengths reveals that "morphological k-corrections" (the changein appearance when viewing high-z objects at shorter rest-frame wavelengths)are only important in a minority of cases, and that galaxies were intrinsicallymore peculiar at high redshift. one example of significant morphologicalk-corrections is spiral galaxies, which often show more pronounced barredstructure in the near-infrared than in the optical. therefore, the apparentdecline in the fraction of barred spirals at faint magnitudes in the opticalhdf may be due to band-shifting effects at the higher redshifts, rather thanintrinsic evolution. using such features as the age-sensitive balmer+4000angbreak, the spatially- resolved colours of distant galaxies inoptical/near-infrared imaging can also be used to study their component stellarpopulations. we supplement this with deep keck/lris spectroscopy of twoextended sources: a chain galaxy at z=2.8 (hdf4-555.1, the "hot dog" - thebrightest u-drop lyman-break galaxy in the hdf) and a pair of z=4.04gravitationally lensed arcs behind the cluster abell 2390. the absence ofmeasurable rotation across the z=2.8 chain galaxy implies that it is unikely tobe a disk viewed edge on. with the resolution enhancement from lensing, wedetect stellar populations of different ages in the z=4 arcs.

astro-ph;0005234	an excess of submm sources near 4c41.17: a candidate proto-cluster at  z=3.8?	biased galaxy-formation theories predict that massive galaxies at highredshifts should act as signposts to high-density environments in the earlyuniverse, which subsequently evolve into the cores of the richest clusters seenat the present day. these regions are characterised by over-densities of younggalaxies, perhaps including a population of dusty, interaction-drivenstarbursts - the progenitors of massive cluster ellipticals. by searching forthis population at submm wavelengths we can therefore test both galaxy- andstructure-formation models. we have undertaken such a search in the field of az=3.8 radio galaxy, 4c41.17, with the scuba submm camera. our extremely deep450- and 850-micron maps reveal an order-of-magnitude over-density of luminoussubmm galaxies compared to typical fields (the likelihood of finding such anover-density in a random field is &lt;2e-3). the scuba galaxies have bolometricluminosities, &gt;10^13 l(solar), which imply star-formation rates consistent withthose required to form a massive galaxy in only a few 10^8 years. we also notethat this field exhibits an over-density of extremely red objects (eros), someof which may be associated with the submm sources, and lyman-break galaxies. wepropose that the over-densities of both submm and ero sources in this fieldrepresent young dusty, starburst galaxies forming within a proto-clustercentered on the radio galaxy at z=3.8, which is also traced by a less-obscuredpopulation of lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;0209544	spectroscopic confirmation of three redshift 5.7 lyman-alpha emitters  from the large area lyman alpha survey	narrow-band searches for lyman alpha emission are an efficient way ofidentifying star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. we present keck telescopespectra confirming redshifts z = 5.7 for three objects discovered in the largearea lyman alpha (lala) survey at kitt peak national observatory.  all three spectra show strong, narrow emission lines with the asymmetricprofile that is characteristically produced in high redshift lyman alphaemitters by preferential hi absorption in the blue wing of the line. theseobjects are undetected in deep bw, v, r, and 6600a narrow-band images from thenoao deep wide-field survey and from lala, as expected from lyman break andlyman alpha forest absorption at redshift z = 5.7. all three objects show largeequivalent widths (&gt;= 150a in the rest-frame), suggesting at least one of thefollowing: a top-heavy initial mass function, very low stellar metallicity, orthe presence of an active nucleus. we consider the case for an active nucleusto be weak in all three objects due to the limited width of the lyman alphaemission line (&lt; 500 km/s) and the absence of any other indicator of quasaractivity.  the three confirmed high redshift objects were among four spectroscopicallyobserved targets drawn from the sample of 18 candidates presented by rhoads andmalhotra (2001). thus, these spectra support the lyman alpha emitter populationstatistics from our earlier photometric study, which imply little evolution innumber density from z=5.7 to z=4.5 and provide strong evidence that thereionization redshift is greater than 5.7.

0808.2816	the nature of faint spitzer-selected dust-obscured galaxies	we use deep far-ir, submm, radio and x-ray imaging and mid-ir spectroscopy toexplore the nature of a sample of spitzer-selected dust-obscured galaxies(dogs) in goods-n. a sample of 79 galaxies satisfy the criteria r-[24]&gt;14(vega) down to s24&gt;100 microjy. twelve of these galaxies have irs spectraavailable which we use to measure redshifts and classify these objects as beingdominated by star formation or active galactic nuclei (agn) activity in themid-ir. the irs spectra and spitzer photometric redshifts confirm that the dogslie in a tight redshift distribution around z~2. based on mid-ir colors, 80% ofdogs are likely dominated by star formation; the stacked x-ray emission fromthis sub-sample of dogs is also consistent with star formation. since only asmall number of dogs are individually detected at far-ir and submm wavelengths,we use a stacking analysis to determine the average flux from these objects andplot a composite ir (8-1000 microns) spectral energy distribution (sed). theaverage luminosity of these star forming dogs is lir~1e12 lsun. we compare theaverage star forming dog to the average bright (s850&gt;5 mjy) submillimetergalaxy (smg); the s24&gt;100 microjy dogs are 3 times more numerous but 8 timesless luminous in the ir. the far-ir sed shape of dogs is similar to that ofsmgs (average dust temperature of around 30 k) but dogs have a higher mid-ir tofar-ir flux ratio. the average star formation-dominated dog has a starformation rate of 200 msun/yr which, given their space density, amounts to acontribution of 0.01 msun/yr/mpc3 (or 5-10%) to the star formation rate densityat z~2. we use the composite sed to predict the average flux of dogs in futureherschel/pacs 100 micron and scuba-2 450 micron surveys and show that themajority of them will be detected.

astro-ph;0410523	mid-infrared selection of active galaxies	mid-infrared photometry provides a robust technique for identifying activegalaxies. while the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of normal galaxies isdominated by the composite stellar black body curve and peaks at approximately1.6 microns, the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of active galaxies isdominated by a power law. consequently, with sufficient wavelength baseline,one can easily distinguish agn from stellar populations. mirroring the tendencyof agn to be bluer than galaxies in the ultraviolet, where galaxies (and stars)sample the blue, rising portion of stellar spectra, agn tend to be redder thangalaxies in the mid-infrared, where galaxies sample the red, falling portion ofthe stellar spectra. we report on spitzer space telescope mid-infrared colors,derived from the irac shallow survey, of nearly 10,000 spectroscopicallyidentified sources from the agn and galaxy evolution survey. based on thisspectroscopic sample, we find that simple mid-infrared color criteria provideremarkably robust separation of active galaxies from normal galaxies andgalactic stars, with over 80% completeness and less than 20% contamination.considering only broad-lined agn, these mid-infrared color criteria identifyover 90% of spectroscopically identified quasars and seyfert 1s. applying thesecolor criteria to the full imaging data set, we discuss the implied surfacedensity of agn and find evidence for a large population of optically obscuredactive galaxies.

astro-ph;0605030	the discovery of three new z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolution  survey	we present the discovery of three z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey (ages) spectroscopic observations of the noao deep wide-field survey(ndwfs) bootes field. these quasars were selected as part of a larger spitzermid-infrared quasar sample with no selection based on optical colors. thehighest redshift object, ndwfs j142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is thelowest-luminosity z&gt;5.8 quasar currently known. we compare mid-infraredtechniques for identifying z&gt;5 quasars to more traditional optical techniquesand show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasarseven at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z&gt;7where optical selection is impossible. using the superb multi-wavelengthcoverage available in the ndwfs bootes field, we construct the spectral energydistributions (seds) of high-redshift quasars from observed bw-band to 24microns (rest-frame 600 angstroms - 3.7 microns). we show that the threehigh-redshift quasars have quite similar seds, and the rest-frame composite sedof low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared toour high-redshift objects. we compare the number of z&gt;5 quasars we havediscovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.while analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on onlythree objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with psil^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasarsdiscovered in our survey.

astro-ph;0609451	clustering of the ir background light with spitzer: contribution from  resolved sources	we describe the angular power spectrum of resolved sources at 3.6 microns(l-band) in spitzer imaging data of the goods hdf-n, the goods cdf-s, and thendwfs bootes field in several source magnitude bins. we also measure angularpower spectra of resolved sources in the bootes field at k_s and j-bands usingground-based ir imaging data. in the three bands, j, k_s, and l, we detect theclustering of galaxies on top of the shot-noise power spectrum at multipolesbetween ell ~ 10^2 and 10^5. the angular power spectra range from the large,linear scales to small, non-linear scales of galaxy clustering, and in somemagnitude ranges, show departure from a power-law clustering spectrum. weconsider a halo model to describe clustering measurements and to establish thehalo occup ation number parameters of ir bright galaxies at redshifts aroundone. we also extend our clustering results and completeness-corrected faintsource number counts in goods fields to understand the underlying nature ofunresolved sources responsible for ir background (irb) anisotropies that weredetected in deep spitzer images. while these unresolved fluctuations weremeasured at sub-arcminute angular scales, if a high-redshift diffuse componentassociated with first galaxies exists in the irb, then it's clusteringproperties are best studied with shallow, wide-field images that allow ameasurement of the clustering spectrum from a few degrees to arcminute angularscales.

astro-ph;0609584	the evolving luminosity function of red galaxies	we trace the assembly history of red galaxies since z=1, by measuring theirevolving space density with the b-band luminosity function. our sample of 39599red galaxies, selected from 6.96 square degrees of imaging from the noao deepwide-field and spitzer irac shallow surveys, is an order of magnitude larger,in size and volume, than comparable samples in the literature. we measure ahigher space density of z=0.9 red galaxies than some of the recent literature,in part because we account for the faint yet significant galaxy flux whichfalls outside of our photometric aperture. the b-band luminosity density of redgalaxies, which effectively measures the evolution of ~l* galaxies, increasesby only 36 percent from z=0 to z=1. if red galaxy stellar populations havefaded by 1.24 b-band magnitudes since z=1, the stellar mass contained withinthe red galaxy population has roughly doubled over the past 8 gyr. this isconsistent with star-forming galaxies being transformed into ~l* red galaxiesafter a decline in their star formation rates. in contrast, the evolution of4l* red galaxies differs only slightly from a model with negligible starformation and no galaxy mergers since z=1. if this model approximates theluminosity evolution of red galaxy stellar populations, then 80 percent of thestellar mass contained within today's 4l* red galaxies was already in place atz=0.7. while red galaxy mergers have been observed, such mergers do not producerapid growth of 4l* red galaxy stellar masses between z=1 and the present day.

astro-ph;0702753	metal enriched gaseous halos around distant radio galaxies: clues to  feedback in galaxy formation	we present the results of an optical and near-ir spectroscopic study of giantnebular emission line halos associated with three z &gt; 3 radio galaxies, 4c41.17, 4c 60.07 and b2 0902+34. previous deep narrow band ly-alpha imaging hadrevealed complex morphologies with sizes up to 100 kpc), possibly connected tooutflows and agn feedback from the central regions. the outer regions of thesehalos show quiet kinematics with typical velocity dispersions of a few hundredkm/s, and velocity shears that can mostly be interpreted as being due torotation. the inner regions show shocked cocoons of gas closely associated withthe radio lobes. these display disturbed kinematics and have expansionvelocities and/or velocity dispersions &gt;1000 km/s. the core region ischemically evolved, and we also find spectroscopic evidence for the ejection ofenriched material in 4c 41.17 up to a distance of approximately 60 kpc alongthe radio-axis. the dynamical structures traced in the ly-alpha line are, inmost cases, closely echoed in the carbon and oxygen lines. this shows that thely-alpha line is produced in a highly clumped medium of small filling factor,and can therefore be used as a tracer of the dynamics of high-z radio galaxies(hzrgs). we conclude that these hzrgs are undergoing a final jet-induced phaseof star formation with ejection of most of their interstellar medium beforebecoming "red and dead" elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0703224	the massive hosts of radio galaxies across cosmic time	we present the results of a comprehensive spitzer survey of 69 radio galaxiesacross 1&lt;z&lt;5.2. using irac (3.6-8.0um), irs (16um) and mips (24-160um) imaging,we decompose the rest-frame optical to infrared spectral energy distributionsinto stellar, agn, and dust components and determine the contribution of hostgalaxy stellar emission at rest-frame h-band. stellar masses derived fromrest-frame near-ir data, where agn and young star contributions are minimized,are significantly more reliable than those derived from rest-frame optical anduv data. we find that the fraction of emitted light at rest-frame h-band fromstars is &gt;60% for ~75% the high redshift radio galaxies. as expected fromunified models of agn, the stellar fraction of the rest-frame h-band luminosityhas no correlation with redshift, radio luminosity, or rest-frame mid-ir (5um)luminosity. additionally, while the stellar h-band luminosity does not varywith stellar fraction, the total h-band luminosity anti-correlates with thestellar fraction as would be expected if the underlying hosts of these radiogalaxies comprise a homogeneous population. the resultant stellar luminositiesimply stellar masses of 10^{11-11.5}msun even at the highest redshifts.powerful radio galaxies tend to lie in a similar region of mid-ir color-colorspace as unobscured agn, despite the stellar contribution to their mid-ir sedsat shorter-wavelengths. the mid-ir luminosities alone classify most hzrgs aslirgs or ulirgs with even higher total-ir luminosities. as expected, theseexceptionally high mid-ir luminosities are consistent with an obscured,highly-accreting agn. we find a weak correlation of stellar mass with radioluminosity.

astro-ph;9512077	the radio galaxy 3c265 contains a hidden quasar nucleus	we report the discovery of broad mgii emission from the high redshift radiogalaxy 3c265 (z=0.81). we detect the broad line in the nuclear spectrum and inthe spatially extended galaxian component, both near the nucleus and in thespectrum of an off-nuclear knot located 31 kpc south east of the nucleus of thegalaxy. these data provide strong support for the simplest form of theunification hypothesis, that radio galaxies are quasars whose optical radiationis directed in the plane of the sky rather than into our line of sight. thesedata also strongly support the scattering model for the alignment of the uvcontinuum emission with the radio axis. in 3c265, if the axis of theanisotropically emitted uv continuum radiation is identified with the majoraxis of the radio source, then the observed rest frame uv continuum emissionimplies that the opening angle of the radiation cone is large (half angleapproximately 45 degrees). we also derive a mass estimate of 8x10^{10} msun forthe central region of 3c265 from its rotation curve. the implied mass-to-lightratio is low (m/l is roughly 2), and suggests that a significant fraction ofthe rest frame uv continuum emission from this galaxy is dominated byreprocessed radiation from the buried agn. finally, we detect thecaii\lambda3933 k line in absorption in the integrated spectrum of 3c265. thisprovides direct spectroscopic evidence for the existence of stars in a highredshift radio galaxy.

astro-ph;9601099	on the origin of the uv continuum emission from the high redshift radio  galaxy 3c256	we report spectropolarimetric observations obtained with the w.m. kecktelescope of the high redshift z=1.824 aligned radio galaxy 3c256. ourobservations confirm that the spatially extended uv continuum emission fromthis galaxy is polarized (p_v = 10.9% +/- 0.9%) with the electric vectorperpendicular to the aligned radio and optical major axes (pa = 48.0 +/- 2.4degrees). this strongly suggests that a significant fraction of the rest frameuv continuum emission from the galaxy is not starlight, but is insteadscattered light from a powerful agn which is hidden from our direct view. thenarrow emission lines, including mgii, are unpolarized. the percentagepolarization of the continuum emission and the polarization position angle areroughly constant as a function of wavelength. the present data do not permit usto discriminate between cool electrons and dust as the origin of thescattering. but scattering by hot (t &gt; 10^7 k) electrons cannot be the dominantprocess, since such a population would overproduce x-ray emission. a largepopulation of cooler t ~ 10^4 k electrons could be responsible for both theline emission and the scattered light, but would require that the dust to gasratio in the scattering cones is 0.001 times smaller than that in our galaxyand would imply that a large fraction of the baryonic mass in the galaxy is inthe ionized component of its ism. dust scattering is more efficient, but wouldresult in detectable extinction of the emission line spectrum unless the dustdistribution is more highly clumped than the line emitting gas. finally, wedetect a strong (ew = 12a) broad (fwhm=6500 km/s) absorption line centered at1477a. we conclude that the most likely explanation is that the absorption isdue to a high velocity bal cloud near the nucleus of 3c256.

astro-ph;9605203	the spectroscopic redshift of an extremely red object and the nature of  the very red galaxy population	infrared surveys have discovered a significant population of bright (k&lt;19)extremely red (r-k&gt;6) objects. little is known about the properties of theseobjects on account of their optical faintness (r&gt;24). here, we report deepinfrared imaging and spectroscopy of one of the extremely red objects (eros)discovered by hu \&amp; ridgway (1994) in the field of the z=3.79 quasarpc1643+4631a. the infrared images were obtained in 0.5" seeing, and show thatthe object (denoted hr10) is not a dynamically relaxed elliptical galaxydominated by an old stellar population as was previously suspected, but insteadhas an asymmetric morphology suggestive of either a disk or an interactingsystem. the infrared spectrum of hr10 shows a single, possibly broad emissionfeature at 1.60um which we identify as halpha+[nii] at z=1.44. the luminosityand width of this emission line indicates either intense star formation (about20h^{-2} solar masses/yr) or the presence of an active nucleus. based on therest frame uv-optical spectral energy distribution, the luminosity of hr10 isestimated to be 3 to 8 l*. the colors of hr10 are unusually red for a galaxy(at z=1.44 the age of hr10 is at most 2 to 8 gyr depending on cosmology), andindicate that hr10 is dusty. hr10 is detected weakly at radio wavelengths; thisis consistent with either the starburst or agn hypothesis. if hr10 is a typicalrepresentative of its class, eros are numerous and represent a significantcomponent of the luminous objects in the universe at z approx 1.5.

astro-ph;9909218	jet-induced emission-line nebulosity and star formation in the  high-redshift radio galaxy 4c41.17	the high redshift radio galaxy 4c41.17 consists of a powerful radio source inwhich previous work has shown that there is strong evidence for jet-inducedstar formation along the radio axis. we argue that nuclear photoionization isnot responsible for the excitation of the emission line clouds and we constructa jet-cloud interaction model to explain the major features revealed by thedata. the interaction of a high-powered jet with a dense cloud in the halo of4c41.17 produces shock-excited emission-line nebulosity through ~1000 km/sshocks and induces star formation. the ciii to civ line ratio and the civluminosity emanating from the shock, imply that the pre-shock density in theline-emitting cloud is high enough (~1-10 cm^-3) that shock initiated starformation could proceed on a timescale of order a few x 10^6 yrs, well withinthe estimated dynamical age of the radio source. broad (fwhm ~ 100 - 1400 km/s)emission lines are attributed to the disturbance of the gas cloud by a partialbow--shock and narrow emission lines (fwhm ~ 500 - 650 km/s) (in particularciv) arise in precursor emission in relatively low metallicity gas. the impliedbaryonic mass ~ 8 \times 10^{10} solar masses of the cloud is high and impliesthat milky way size condensations existed in the environments of forming radiogalaxies at a redshift of 3.8. our interpretation of the data provides aphysical basis for the alignment of the radio, emission-line and uv continuumimages in some of the highest redshift radio galaxies and the analysispresented here may form a basis for the calculation of densities and cloudmasses in other high redshift radio galaxies.

0811.1398	the origin of the 24-micron excess in red galaxies	observations with the spitzer space telescope have revealed a population ofred-sequence galaxies with a significant excess in their 24-micron emissioncompared to what is expected from an old stellar population. we identify 900red galaxies with 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages)selected from the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. using spitzer/mips,we classify 89 (~10%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24&gt;0.3 mjy). wedetermine the prevalence of agn and star-formation activity in all the agesgalaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-ir color-color criteria. usingthe irac color-color diagram from the irac shallow survey, we find that 64% ofthe 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong pah emissionfeatures in the 8-micron irac band. this fraction is significantly larger thanthe 5% of red galaxies with f24&lt;0.3 mjy that are estimated to have strong pahemission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due tostar-formation processes. only 15% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies haveoptical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64% are classifiedas agn and 21% are unclassifiable). the difference between the optical andinfrared results suggest that both agn and star-formation activity is occurringsimultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. these resultsshould serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical linediagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared andother bands. we find that ~40% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-onspiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. the remaining sources are likelyto be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination ofobscured agn and star-formation activity.

0811.1997	hst morphologies of z~2 dust obscured galaxies i: power-law sources	we present high spatial resolution optical and near-infrared imaging obtainedusing the acs, wfpc2 and nicmos cameras aboard the hubble space telescope of 3124um--bright z~2 dust obscured galaxies (dogs) identified in the bootes fieldof the noao deep wide-field survey. although this subset of dogs have mid-irspectral energy distributions dominated by a power-law component suggestive ofan agn, all but one of the galaxies are spatially extended and not dominated byan unresolved component at rest-frame uv or optical wavelengths. the observedv-h and i-h colors of the extended components are 0.2-3 magnitudes redder thannormal star-forming galaxies. all but 1 have axial ratios &gt;0.3, making itunlikely that dogs are composed of an edge-on star-forming disk. we model thespatially extended component of the surface brightness distributions of thedogs with a sersic profile and find effective radii of 1-6 kpc. this sample ofdogs is smaller than most sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs), but larger thanquiescent high-redshift galaxies. non-parametric measures (gini and m20) of dogmorphologies suggest that these galaxies are more dynamically relaxed thanlocal ulirgs. we estimate lower limits to the stellar masses of dogs based onthe rest-frame optical photometry and find that these range from ~10^(9-11)m_sun. if major mergers are the progenitors of dogs, then these observationssuggest that dogs may represent a post-merger evolutionary stage.
