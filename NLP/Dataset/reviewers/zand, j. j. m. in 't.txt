0901.1296	rxte and bepposax observations of the transient x-ray pulsar xte  j1859+083	we present observations of the 9.8 s x-ray pulsar xte j1859+083 made with theasm and pca on board rxte, and the wfc on board bepposax. the asm data cover a12 year time interval and show that an extended outburst occurred betweenapproximately mjd 50,250 and 50,460 (1996 june 16 to 1997 january 12). the asmdata excluding this outburst interval suggest a possible modulation with aperiod of 60.65 +/- 0.08 days. eighteen sets of pca observations were obtainedover an approximately one month interval in 1999. the flux variability measuredwith the pca appears consistent with the possible period found with the asm.the pca measurements of the pulse period showed it to decreasenon-monotonically and then to increase significantly. doppler shifts due toorbital motion rather than accretion torques appear to be better able toexplain the pulse period changes. observations with the wfc during the extendedoutburst give a position which is consistent with a previously determined pcaerror box, but which has a significantly smaller error. the transient nature ofxte j1859+083 and the length of its pulse period are consistent with it being abe/neutron star binary. the possible 60.65 day orbital period would be of theexpected length for a be star system with a 9.8 s pulse period.

0905.4477	the effect of rotation on the stability of nuclear burning in accreting  neutron stars	hydrogen and/or helium accreted by a neutron star from a binary companion mayundergo thermonuclear fusion. at different mass accretion rates differentburning regimes are discerned. theoretical models predict helium fusion toproceed as a thermonuclear runaway for accretion rates below the eddingtonlimit and as stable burning above this limit. observations, however, place theboundary close to 10% of the eddington limit. we study the effect ofrotationally induced transport processes on the stability of helium burning.for the first time detailed calculations of thin helium shell burning onneutron stars are performed using a hydrodynamic stellar evolution codeincluding rotation and rotationally induced magnetic fields. we find that inmost cases the instabilities from the magnetic field provide the dominantcontribution to the chemical mixing, while eddington-sweet circulations becomeimportant at high rotation rates. as helium is diffused to greater depths, thestability of the burning is increased, such that the critical accretion ratefor stable helium burning is found to be lower. combined with a higher heatflux from the crust, as suggested by recent studies, turbulent mixing couldexplain the observed critical accretion rate. furthermore, close to thisboundary we find oscillatory burning, which previous studies have linked to mhzqpos. in models where we continuously lower the heat flux from the crust, theperiod of the oscillations increases by up to several tens of percents, similarto the observed frequency drift, suggesting that this drift could be caused bythe cooling of deeper layers.

0909.3391	what ignites on the neutron star of 4u 0614+091?	[abridged] the lmxb 4u 0614+091 is a source of sporadic thermonuclear (typei) x-ray bursts. we find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics inserendipitous wide-field x-ray observations by eureca/watch, rxte/asm,bepposax/wfc, hete-2/fregate, integral/ibis/isgri, and swift/bat, as well aspointed observations by rxte/pca and hexte. most of them reach a peak flux of~15 crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a crab. one of the burstsshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. this allows us toevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. the burst durations are between10 sec to 5 min. however, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, afaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. onevery long burst lasted for several hours. this superburst candidate wasfollowed by a normal type-i burst only 19 days later. this is, to ourknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. a superburstin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% l_edd. theintermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4u 0614+091's persistent emissionwas lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one everymonth to 3 months). the average burst rate increased significantly after thisperiod. the maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2weeks. the burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least anappreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donorstar. if the system is an ultra-compact x-ray binary with a co white-dwarfdonor, as has been suggested, this is unexpected. if the bursts are powered byhelium, we find that the energy production per accumulated mass is about 2.5times less than expected for pure helium matter.

1001.0900	evidence of heavy-element ashes in thermonuclear x-ray bursts with  photospheric superexpansion	a small subset of thermonuclear x-ray bursts on neutron stars exhibit such astrong photospheric expansion that for a few seconds the photosphere is locatedat a radius r_ph &gt;~ 1000 km. such `superexpansions' imply a large and rapidenergy release, a feature characteristic of pure he burst models. previouscalculations have shown that during a pure he burst, the freshly synthesizedheavy-element ashes of burning can be ejected in a strong radiative wind andproduce significant spectral absorption features. we search the burst datacatalogs and literature and find 32 superexpansion bursts. we find that thesebursts exhibit the following interesting features: (1) at least 31 are from(candidate) ultracompact x-ray binaries in which the neutron star accreteshydrogen-deficient fuel, suggesting that these bursts indeed ignite in ahelium-rich layer. (2) in 2 bursts we detect strong absorption edges during theexpansion phase. the edge energies and depths are consistent with the h-like orhe-like edge of iron-peak elements with abundances greater than 100 timessolar, suggesting that we are seeing the exposed ashes of nuclear burning. (3)the superexpansion phase is always followed by a moderate expansion phaseduring which r_ph ~ 30 km and the luminosity is near the eddington limit. (4)the decay time of the bursts, t_d, ranges from short (approximately 10 s) tointermediate (&gt;~ 1000 s). however, despite the large range of t_d, the durationof the superexpansion is always a few seconds, independent of t_d. by contrast,the duration of the moderate expansion is always of order t_d. (5) thephotospheric radii r_ph during the moderate expansion phase are much smallerthan steady state wind models predict. we show that this may be furtherindication that the wind contains highly non-solar abundances of heavyelements.

1001.2222	x-ray spectral study of the hot gas in three clusters of galaxies	we study the physical properties of three clusters of galaxies, selected froma bepposax wide field camera (wfc) survey. these sources are identified as 1rxsj153934.7-833535, 1rxs j160147.6-754507, and 1rxs j081232.3-571423 in the rosatall-sky survey catalogue. we obtained xmm-newton follow-up observations forthese three clusters. we fit single and multi-temperature models to spectraobtained from the epic-pn camera to determine the temperature, the chemicalcomposition of the gas and their radial distribution. since two observationsare contaminated by a high soft-proton background, we develop a new method toestimate the effect of this background on the data. for the first time, wepresent the temperature and iron abundance of two of these three clusters. theiron abundance of 1rxs j153934.7-33535 decreases with radius. the fits to thexmm-newton and chandra data show that the radial temperature profile within 3'towards the centre either flattens or lowers. a chandra image of the sourcesuggests the presence of x-ray cavities. the gas properties in 1rxsj160147.6-754507 are consistent with a flat radial distribution of iron andtemperature within 2' from the centre. 1rxs j081232.3-571423 is a relativelycool cluster with a temperature of about 3 kev. the radial temperature and ironprofiles suggest that 1rxs j153934.7-833535 is a cool core cluster. the chandraimage shows substructure which points toward agn feedback in the core. the flatradial profiles of the temperature and iron abundance in 1rxs j160147.6-754507are similar to the profiles of non-cool-core clusters.

0704.1741	detection of a 1258 hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic  oscillation in the ultra-compact x-ray binary 1a 1246-588	we have observed the ultra-compact low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) 1a 1246-588with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). in this manuscript we report thediscovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in 1a 1246-588. thekilohertz qpo was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux statereminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. only one kilohertz qpopeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 hz and at a singletrial significance of more than 7 sigma. kilohertz qpos with a higher frequencyhave only been found on two occasions in 4u 0614+09. furthermore, the frequencyis higher than that found for the lower kilohertz qpo in any source, stronglysuggesting that the qpo is the upper of the kilohertz qpo pair often found inlmxbs. the full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 hz, making the coherence thehighest found for an upper kilohertz qpo. from a distance estimate of ~6 kpcfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1a 1246-588 is at a persistentflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the eddington flux, hence 1a 1246-588 is one ofthe weakest lmxbs for which a kilohertz qpo has been detected. theroot-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 kev band is 27+-3 per cent, thisis the highest for any kilohertz qpo source so far, in line with the generalanti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertzqpo peak identified before. using the x-ray spectral information we produce acolour-colour diagram. the source behaviour in this diagram provides furtherevidence for the atoll nature of the source.

1005.3302	multi-instrument x-ray observations of thermonuclear bursts with short  recurrence times	type i x-ray bursts from low-mass x-ray binaries result from a thermonuclearrunaway in the material accreted onto the neutron star. although typicalrecurrence times are a few hours, consistent with theoretical ignition modelpredictions, there are also observations of bursts occurring as promptly as tenminutes or less after the previous event. we present a comprehensive assessmentof this phenomenon using a catalog of 3387 bursts observed with thebepposax/wfcs and rxte/pca x-ray instruments. this catalog contains 136 burstswith recurrence times of less than one hour, that come in multiples of up tofour events, from 15 sources. short recurrence times are not observed fromso-called ultra-compact binaries, indicating that hydrogen burning processesplay a crucial role. as far as the neutron star spin frequency is known, thesesources all spin fast at over 500 hz; the rotationally induced mixing mayexplain burst recurrence times of the order of 10 min. short recurrence timebursts generally occur at all mass accretion rates where normal bursts areobserved, but for individual sources the short recurrence times may berestricted to a smaller interval of accretion rate. the fraction of such burstsis roughly 30%. we also report the shortest known recurrence time of 3.8minutes.

1007.5201	puzzling thermonuclear burst behaviour from the transient low-mass x-ray  binary igr j17473-2721	we investigate the thermonuclear bursting behaviour of igr j17473-2721, anx-ray transient that in 2008 underwent a six month long outburst, starting(unusually) with an x-ray burst. we detected a total of 57 thermonuclear burststhroughout the outburst with agile, swift, rxte, and integral. the wide rangeof inferred accretion rates (between &lt;1% and about 20% of the eddingtonaccretion rate m-dot_edd) spanned during the outburst allows us to studychanges in the nuclear burning processes and to identify up to seven differentphases. the burst rate increased gradually with the accretion rate until itdropped (at a persistent flux corresponding to about 15% of m-dot_edd) a fewdays before the outburst peak, after which bursts were not detected for amonth. as the persistent emission subsequently decreased, the bursting activityresumed with a much lower rate than during the outburst rise. this hysteresismay arise from the thermal effect of the accretion on the surface nuclearburning processes, and the timescale is roughly consistent with that expectedfor the neutron star crust thermal response. on the other hand, an undetectedsuperburst, occurring within a data gap near the outburst peak, could haveproduced a similar quenching of burst activity.

1103.1486	the galactic bulge survey: outline and x-ray observations	we introduce the galactic bulge survey (gbs) and we provide the chandrasource list for the region that has been observed to date. among the goals ofthe gbs are constraining the neutron star equation of state and the black holemass distribution via the identification of eclipsing neutron star and blackhole low-mass x-ray binaries. the latter goal will, in addition, be obtained bysignificantly enlarging the number of black hole systems for which a black holemass can be derived. further goals include constraining x-ray binary formationscenarios, in particular the common envelope phase and the occurrence of kicks,via source-type number counts and an investigation of the spatial distributionof x-ray binaries, respectively. the gbs targets two strips of 6x1 degrees (12square degrees in total), one above (1&lt;b&lt;2 degrees) and one below (-2&lt;b&lt;-1degrees) the galactic plane in the direction of the galactic center at bothx-ray and optical wavelengths. by avoiding the galactic plane (-1&lt;b&lt;1 degrees)we limit the influence of extinction on the x-ray and optical emission butstill sample relatively large number densities of sources. the survey isdesigned such that a large fraction of the x-ray sources can be identified fromtheir optical spectra. the x-ray survey, by design, covers a large area on thesky while the depth is shallow using 2 ks per chandra pointing. in this way wemaximize the predicted number ratio of (quiescent) low-mass x-ray binaries tocataclysmic variables. the survey is approximately homogeneous in depth to an0.5-10 kev flux of 7.7x10^-14 erg cm-2 s-1. so far, we have covered abouttwo-thirds (8.3 square degrees) of the projected survey area with chandraproviding over 1200 unique x-ray sources. we discuss the characteristics andthe variability of the brightest of these sources.

1204.1343	superburst models for neutron stars with hydrogen and helium-rich  atmospheres	superbursts are rare day-long type i x-ray bursts due to carbon flashes onaccreting neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries. they heat the neutron starenvelope such that the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium becomes stable,and the common shorter x-ray bursts are quenched. short bursts reappear onlyafter the envelope cools down. we study multi-zone one-dimensional models ofthe neutron star envelope, in which we follow carbon burning during thesuperburst, and we include hydrogen and helium burning in the atmosphere above.we investigate both the case of a solar composition and a helium-richatmosphere. this allows us to study for the first time a wide variety ofthermonuclear burning behavior as well as the transitions between the differentregimes in a self-consistent manner. for solar composition, burst quenchingends much sooner than previously expected. this is because of the complexinterplay between the 3-alpha, hot cno, and cno breakout reactions. stableburning of hydrogen and helium transitions via marginally stable burning (mhzqpos) to less energetic bursts with short recurrence times. we find ashort-lived bursting mode where weaker and stronger bursts alternate.eventually the bursting behavior changes back to that of the pre-superburstbursts. because of the scarcity of observations, this transition has not beendirectly detected after a superburst. using the minbar burst catalog weidentify the shortest upper limit on the quenching time for 4u 1636-536, andderive further constraints on the time scale on which bursts return.

0711.2572	constraining the neutron star equation of state using xmm-newton	we have identified three possible ways in which future xmm-newtonobservations can provide significant constraints on the equation of state ofneutron stars. first, using a long observation of the neutron star x-raytransient cenx-4 in quiescence one can use the rgs spectrum to constrain theinterstellar extinction to the source. this removes this parameter from thex-ray spectral fitting of the pn and mos spectra and allows us to investigatewhether the variability observed in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of this sourceis due to variations in the soft thermal spectral component or variations inthe power law spectral component coupled with variations in n_h. this will testwhether the soft thermal spectral component can indeed be due to the hotthermal glow of the neutron star. potentially such an observation could alsoreveal redshifted spectral lines from the neutron star surface. second,xmm-newton observations of radius expansion type i x-ray bursts might revealredshifted absorption lines from the surface of the neutron star. third,xmm-newton observations of eclipsing quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries providethe eclipse duration. with this the system inclination can be determinedaccurately. the inclination determined from the x-ray eclipse duration inquiescence, the rotational velocity of the companion star and thesemi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve determined through opticalspectroscopy, yield the neutron star mass.

0711.4207	first superburst from a classical low-mass x-ray binary transient	we report the analysis of the first superburst from a transiently accretingneutron star system with the all-sky monitor (asm) on the rossi x-ray timingexplorer. the superburst occurred 55 days after the onset of an accretionoutburst in 4u 1608-522. during that time interval, the accretion rate was atleast 7% of the eddington limit. the peak flux of the superburst is 22 to 45%of the eddington limit, and its radiation energy output is between 4e41 and9e41 erg for a distance of 3.2 kpc. fits of cooling models to the superburstlight curve indicate an ignition column depth between 1.5e12 and 4.1e12 g/cm2.extrapolating the accretion history observed by the asm, we derive that thiscolumn was accreted over a period of 26 to 72 years. the superburstcharacteristics are consistent with those seen in other superbursting low-massx-ray binaries. however, the transient nature of the hosting binary presentssignificant challenges for superburst theory, requiring additional ingredientsfor the models. the carbon that fuels the superburst is thought to be producedmostly during the accretion outbursts and destroyed in the frequent type-ix-ray bursts. mixing and sedimentation of the elements in the neutron starenvelope may significantly influence the balance between the creation anddestruction of carbon. furthermore, predictions for the temperature of theneutron star crust fail to reach the values required for the ignition of carbonat the inferred column depth.

1210.2949	superexpansion as a possible probe of accretion in 4u 1820-30	the ultracompact x-ray binary 4u 1820-30 is well known for its ~170-dsuperorbital modulation in x-ray flux and spectrum, and the exclusiveness ofbursting behavior to the low hard 'island' state. in may-june 2009, there wasan exceptionally long 51-d low state. this state was well covered by x-rayobservations and 12 bursts were detected, 9 with the high-throughput rxte. weinvestigate the character of these x-ray bursts and find an interesting changein their photospheric expansion behavior. at the lowest inferred mass accretionrates, this expansion becomes very large in 4 bursts and reaches the so-calledsuperexpansion regime. we speculate that this is due to the geometry of theinner accretion flow being spherical and a decreasing accretion rate: when theflow geometry nearest to the neutron star is spherical and the accretion rateis low, the ram pressure of the accretion disk may become too low to counteractthat of the photospheric expansion. in effect, this may provide a novel meansto probe the accretion flow. additionally, we observe a peculiar effect: thewell-known cessation of x-ray bursts in the high state is too quick to beconsistent with a transition to stable helium burning. we suggest analternative explanation, that the cessation is due to the introduction of anon-nuclear heat source in the neutron star ocean.

1310.6939	double-peaked thermonuclear bursts at the soft-hard state transition in  the rapid burster	long suspected to be due to unstable accretion events, the type ii burstsexhibited by the rapid burster (rb, or mxb 1730-335) still lack an exhaustiveexplanation. apart from type ii bursts, the transient rb also shows thebetter-understood thermonuclear shell flashes known as type i bursts. in searchof links between these two phenomena, we carried out a comprehensive analysisof all $\textit{rossi x-ray timing explorer}$ observations of the rb and foundsix atypical type i bursts, featuring a double-peaked profile that is not dueto photospheric radius expansion. the bursts appear in a phase of the outburstdecay close to the onset of the type ii bursts, when the source also switchesfrom the high/soft to the low/hard state. we also report the discovery of asimultaneous low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation present in the persistentemission as well as in the burst decaying emission. we discuss severalscenarios to understand the nature of the peculiar bursts and of theaccompanying oscillation, as well as their possible relation with each otherand with the type ii burst phenomenon. we favour a model consisting of twoaccretion channels, one polar and one equatorial, in a source viewed at lowinclination. we also, for the first time, clearly identify the atoll nature ofthe rb.

1312.5234	the cooling rate of neutron stars after thermonuclear shell flashes	thermonuclear shell flashes on neutron stars are detected as bright x-raybursts. traditionally, their decay is modeled with an exponential function.however, this is not what theory predicts. the expected functional form forluminosities below the eddington limit, at times when there is no significantnuclear burning, is a power law. we tested the exponential and power-lawfunctional forms against the best data available: bursts measured with thehigh-throughput proportional counter array (pca) on board the rossi x-raytiming explorer. we selected a sample of 35 'clean' and ordinary (i.e., shorterthan a few minutes) bursts from 14 different neutron stars that 1) show a largedynamic range in luminosity, 2) are the least affected by disturbances by theaccretion disk and 3) lack prolonged nuclear burning through the rp-process. wefind indeed that for every burst a power law is a better description than anexponential function. we also find that the decay index is steep, 1.8 onaverage, and different for every burst. this may be explained by contributionsfrom degenerate electrons and photons to the specific heat capacity of theignited layer and by deviations from the stefan-boltzmann law due to changes inthe opacity with density and temperature. detailed verification of thisexplanation yields inconclusive results. while the values for the decay indexare consistent, changes of it with the burst time scale, as a proxy of ignitiondepth, and with time are not supported by model calculations.

1502.03941	a population study of type ii bursts in the rapid burster	type ii bursts are thought to arise from instabilities in the accretion flowonto a neutron star in an x-ray binary. despite having been known for almost 40years, no model can yet satisfactorily account for all their properties. toshed light on the nature of this phenomenon and provide a reference for futuretheoretical work, we study the entire sample of rossi x-ray timing explorerdata of type ii bursts from the rapid burster (mxb 1730-335). we find that typeii bursts are eddington-limited in flux, that a larger amount of energy goes inthe bursts than in the persistent emission, that type ii bursts can be as shortas 0.130 s, and that the distribution of recurrence times drops abruptly below15-18 s. we highlight the complicated feedback between type ii bursts and thens surface thermonuclear explosions known as type i bursts, and between type iibursts and the persistent emission. we review a number of models for type iibursts. while no model can reproduce all the observed burst properties andexplain the source uniqueness, models involving a gating role for the magneticfield come closest to matching the properties of our sample. the uniqueness ofthe source may be explained by a special combination of magnetic fieldstrength, stellar spin period and alignment between the magnetic field and thespin axis.

1503.04751	discovery of grs 1915+105 variability patterns in the rapid burster	we report the discovery of two new types of variability in the neutron starlow-mass x-ray binary mxb 1730-335 (the 'rapid burster'). in one observation in1999, it exhibits a large-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillation with a period ofabout 7 min. in another observation in 2008, it exhibits two 4-min long 75 percent deep dips 44 min apart. these two kinds of variability are very similar tothe so-called $\rho$ or 'heartbeat' variability and the $\theta$ variability,respectively, seen in the black hole low-mass x-ray binaries grs 1915+105 andigr j17091-3624. this shows that these types of behavior are unrelated to ablack hole nature of the accretor. our findings also show that these kinds ofbehaviour need not take place at near-eddington accretion rates. we speculatethat they may rather be related to the presence of a relatively wide orbit withan orbital period in excess of a few days and about the relation between theseinstabilities and the type ii bursts.

astro-ph;0001437	sax j1810.8-2609: a new hard x-ray bursting transient	the transient x-ray source sax j1810.8-2609 was discovered on 1998, march 10with the wide field cameras on board the bepposax satellite, while observingthe galactic bulge in the 2-28 kev energy range. on march 11, a strong type-ix-ray burst was detected with evidence of photospheric radius expansion. afollow-up target of opportunity observation with the narrow-field instruments(nfi) was performed on march 11 and 12, for a total elapsed time of 8.51 x10^{4} s. the wide band spectral data (0.1-200 kev) obtained with the nfi showa remarkable hard x-ray spectrum detected up to ~200 kev, which can bedescribed by a power law with photon spectral index gamma=1.96\pm0.04, plus asoft component which is compatible with blackbody radiation of temperaturekt~0.5 kev.  the detection of the type-i x-ray burst is a strong indication that thecompact object is a neutron star in a low mass x-ray binary system. assumingstandard burst parameters and attributing the photospheric radius expansion tonear eddington luminosity, we estimate a distance of ~5 kpc. the inferred 2-10kev x-ray luminosity is ~ 9 x 10^{35} erg/s at the time of the discovery.

astro-ph;0104362	bepposax measurements of the bright gamma-ray burst 010222	we analyze the bepposax measurements of the prompt and afterglow emission ofthe gamma-ray burst grb010222. among 45 grbs detected with the wide fieldcameras on bepposax, the 40-700 kev fluence of (9.3+/-0.3)e-5 erg cm-2 is onlysurpassed by grb990123. in terms of the isotropic 20-2000 kev energy output of7.8e53 erg, it ranks third of all grbs with measured distances. since thisburst is so bright, the data provide complete and valuable coverage up to 65 hrafter the event, except for a gap between 3.5 and 8.0 hr. the 2-10 kev fluxhistory shows clear signs of a break which is consistent with a break seen inthe optical, and provides supporting evidence for the achromatic nature of thebreak. an explanation for the break in the context of a collimated expansion isnot straightforward. rather, a model is favored whereby the fireball is brakedto the non-relativistic regime quickly (within a fraction of day) by a dense1e6 cm-3 circumburst medium. this implies that, after a mild beamingcorrection, grb010222 may be the most energetic burst observed thus far. thex-ray decay index after the break is 1.33+/-0.04, the spectral index0.97+/-0.05. the decay is, with unprecedented accuracy, identical to thatobserved in the optical.

astro-ph;0206467	a relativistic fe k-alpha emission line in the intermediate luminosity  bepposax spectrum of the galactic microquasar v4641 sgr	broad fe k-alpha emission lines have recently been reported in a number ofgalactic black holes. such lines are useful accretion flow diagnostics becausethey may be produced at the inner accretion disk and shaped by relativisticeffects, but in general they have only been observed at luminosities of l_x ~10^(37-38) erg/s in soft x-rays. the galactic microquasar v4641 sgr -- widelyknown for its 12.2 crab (1.5-12 kev) outburst in 1999 september -- displayedlow-level activity in 1999 march. bepposax observed the source in this stateand fe k-alpha line emission was found (in 't zand et al. 2000). inre-analyzing these data, we find strong evidence that the fe k-alpha lineprofile is broadened. for the most likely values of the source distance andblack hole mass measured by orosz et al. (2001), our fits to the total spectrumindicate that the source was observed at a luminosity of l_x = 1.9 (+1.0, -0.8)* 10^(36) erg/s (2-10 kev), or l_x/l_edd. = 1.8 (+0.9, -0.8) * 10^(-3).advection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) models predict a radially-recesseddisk in this regime. in contrast, fits to the observed fe k-alpha emission lineprofile with a relativistic line model constrain the inner disk to beconsistent with the marginally stable circular orbit of a schwarzschild blackhole.

astro-ph;0312377	x-ray spectral evolution of sax j1747.0-2853 during outburst activity  and confirmation of its transient nature	sax j1747.0-2853 is an x-ray transient which exhibited x-ray outbursts yearlybetween 1998 and 2001, and most probably also in 1976. the outburst of 2000 wasthe longest and brightest. we have analyzed x-ray data sets that focus on the2000 outburst and were obtained with bepposax, xmm-newton and rxte. the datacover unabsorbed 2--10 kev fluxes between 0.1 and 5.3 x 10^-9 erg/s/cm^2. theequivalent luminosity range is 6 x 10^35 to 2 x 10^37 erg/s. the 0.3--10 kevspectrum is well described by a combination of a multi-temperature diskblackbody, a hot comptonization component and a narrow fe-k emission line at6.5 to 6.8 kev with an equivalent width of up to 285 ev. the hydrogen columndensity in the line of sight is (8.8+/-0.5) x 10^22 cm^-2. the most conspicuousspectral changes in this model are represented by variations of the temperatureand radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk, and a jump of theequivalent width of the fe-k line in one observation. furthermore, 45 type-ix-ray bursts were unambiguously detected between 1998 and 2001 which alloccurred during or close to outbursts. we derive a distance of 7.5+/-1.3 kpcwhich is consistent with previous determinations. our failure to detect burstsfor prolonged periods outside outbursts provides indirect evidence that thesource returns to quiescence between outbursts and is a true transient.

astro-ph;0403584	multiwavelength study of the very long grb 020410	grb 020410 is by far the longest gamma-ray burst (with a duration of about1600 s) to have been followed up from the x-ray through the radio regime.afterglow emission was detected in x-rays and at optical wavelengths while noemission was detected at 8 ghz brighter than 120 microjy. the decaying x-rayafterglow, back extrapolated to 11 hr after the burst, had a flux of 7.9 10^-12cgs (2-10 kev); the brightest detected so far. no direct redshift determinationis available yet for this grb, but according to the empirical relationshipbetween the peak energy in the \nu f_\nu spectrum and the isotropic energyoutput, z is constrained in the range 0.9-1.5. the reconstructed opticalafterglow light curve implies at least two breaks in the simple power-lawdecay. this may be related to emergence of a sn, or refreshment of the externalshock by a variation in the circumstellar medium. by comparing the backwardextrapolation of the 2-10 kev afterglow decay it is shown that the longduration of the prompt emission is not related to an early onset of afterglowemission, but must be related to prolonged activity of the ``central engine''.

astro-ph;0407083	superbursts at near-eddington mass accretion rates	models for superbursts from neutron stars involving carbon shell flashespredict that the mass accretion rate should be anywhere in excess of one tenthof the eddington limit. yet, superbursts have so far only been detected insystems for which the accretion rate is limited between 0.1 and 0.25 times thatlimit. the question arises whether this is a selection effect or an intrinsicproperty. therefore, we have undertaken a systematic study of data from thebepposax wide field cameras on the luminous source gx 17+2, comprising 10 msecof effective observing time on superbursts. gx 17+2 contains a neutron starwith regular type-i x-ray bursts and accretes matter within a few tens ofpercents of the eddington limit. we find four hours-long flares whichreasonably match superburst characteristics. two show a sudden rise (i.e.,faster than 10 s), and two show a smooth decay combined with spectralsoftening. the implied superburst recurrence time, carbon ignition column andquenching time for ordinary bursts are close to the predicted values. however,the flare decay time, fluence and the implied energy production of (2-4) x10^17 erg/g are larger than expected from current theory.

astro-ph;0506666	on the possibility of a helium white dwarf donor in the presumed  ultracompact binary 2s 0918-549	2s 0918-549 is a low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) with a low optical to x-rayflux ratio. probably it is an ultracompact binary with an orbital periodshorter than 60 min. such binaries cannot harbor hydrogen rich donor stars. aswith other (sometimes confirmed) ultracompact lmxbs, 2s 0918-549 is observed tohave a high neon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (juett et al. 2001) which has beenused to argue that the companion star is a co or one white dwarf. however,type-i x-ray bursts have been observed from several of these systems implyingthe presence of hydrogen or helium on the neutron star surface. in this paper,we argue that the companion star in 2s 0918-549 is a helium white dwarf wefirst present a type i x-ray burst from 2s 0918-549 with a long duration of 40minutes. we show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of purehelium at the inferred accretion rate of ~0.01 times the eddington accretionrate. at higher accretion rates of ~0.1 eddington, hydrogen is required toexplain long duration bursts. however, at low rates the long duration is due tothe large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst. we show that itis possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary ifaccretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch, when the core ismade of predominantly helium. furthermore, this scenario naturally explains thehigh neon-to-oxgen ratio, without requiring a co or one white dwarf companion.the only observational aspect of 2s 0918-549 that we cannot explain is theabsence of helium lines in the optical spectrum. model calculations of opticalaccretion disk spectra need to be carried out in order to obtain limits on thehelium abundance.

astro-ph;0508240	chandra observation of the fast x-ray transient igr j17544-2619:  evidence for a neutron star?	igr j17544-2619 belongs to a distinct group of at least seven fast x-raytransients that cannot readily be associated with nearby flare stars orpre-main sequence stars and most probably are x-ray binaries with windaccretion. sofar, the nature of the accretor has been determined in only onecase (sax j1819.3-2525/v4641 sgr). we carried out a 20 ks chandra acis-sobservation of igr j17544-2619 which shows the source in quiescence going intooutburst. the chandra position confirms the previous tentative identificationof the optical counterpart, a blue o9ib supergiant at 3 to 4 kpc (pellizza,chaty &amp; negueruela, in prep.). this is the first detection of a fast x-raytransient in quiescence. the quiescent spectrum is very soft. the photon indexof 5.9+/-1.2 (90% confidence error margin) is much softer than 6 quiescentblack hole candidates that were observed with chandra acis-s (kong et al. 2002;tomsick et al. 2003). assuming that a significant fraction of the quiescentphotons comes from the accretor and not the donor star, we infer that theaccretor probably is a neutron star. a fit to the quiescent spectrum of theneutron star atmosphere model developed by pavlov et al. (1992) and zavlin etal. (1996) implies an unabsorbed quiescent 0.5--10 kev luminosity of(5.2+/-1.3) x 10^32 erg/s. we speculate on the nature of the brief outbursts.

astro-ph;0508432	long type i x-ray bursts and neutron star interior physics	superbursts are very energetic type i x-ray bursts discovered in recent yearsby long term monitoring of x-ray bursters, believed to be due to unstableignition of carbon in the deep ocean of the neutron star. a number of"intermediate duration" bursts have also been observed, probably associatedwith ignition of a thick helium layer. we investigate the sensitivity of theselong x-ray bursts to the thermal profile of the neutron star crust and core. wefirst compare cooling models of superburst lightcurves with observations, andderive constraints on the ignition mass and energy release, and then calculateignition models for superbursts and pure helium bursts, and compare toobservations. the superburst lightcurves and ignition models imply that thecarbon mass fraction is approximately 20% or greater in the fuel layer,constraining models of carbon production. however, the most important result isthat when cooper pairing neutrino emission is included in the crust, thetemperature is too low to support unstable carbon ignition at the observedcolumn depths. some additional heating mechanism is required in theaccumulating fuel layer to explain the observed properties of superbursts. ifcooper pair emission is less efficient than currently thought, the observedignition depths for superbursts imply that the crust is a poor conductor, andthe core neutrino emission is not more efficient than modified urca. theobserved properties of helium bursts support these conclusions, requiringinefficient crust conductivity and core neutrino emission.

astro-ph;0605689	the superburst recurrence time in luminous persistent lmxbs	theory and observations favor stable helium burning as the most importantmeans to produce fuel for superbursts on neutron star surfaces. however, allknown superbursters exhibit unstable burning as well. this ambiguity promptedus to search for superbursts in data from the bepposax wide field cameras often luminous lmxbs, most of which do not exhibit normal type-i x-ray bursts. wefound no superbursts and determine a lower limit on the recurrence time whichvaries between 30 and 76 days (90% confidence). all recurrence time limitsexcept one are longer than the observed recurrence time for gx 17+2. thisdifference can be understood if the mass accretion rate in gx 17+2 is severaltens of percent higher than in the other sources; alternatively, the accretedmaterial in gx 17+2 might be hydrogen deficient, leading to larger carbonyields than in the other sources. we compare our results to the latest modelsof superbursts. as our search method is indiscriminate of the burst ignitionscenario, the recurrence time limits may also be applied to other bursts ofsimilar duration and brightness.

astro-ph;0701575	discovery of x-ray burst triplets in exo 0748-676	[abridged] type-i x-ray bursts are thermonuclear flashes that take place onthe surface of accreting neutron stars. the wait time between consecutivebursts is set by the time required to accumulate the fuel needed to trigger anew burst; this is at least one hour. sometimes secondary bursts are observed,approximately 10 min after the main burst. these short wait-time bursts are notyet understood. we observed the low-mass x-ray binary and x-ray burster exo0748-676 with xmm-newton for 158 h, during 7 uninterrupted observations lastingup to 30 h each. we detect 76 x-ray bursts. most remarkably, 15 of these burstsoccur in burst triplets, with wait times of 12 min between the three componentsof the triplet. we also detect 14 doublets with similar wait times between thetwo components of the doublet. the characteristics of the bursts indicate thatpossibly all bursts in this system are hydrogen-ignited, in contrast with mostother frequent x-ray bursters in which bursts are helium-ignited, butconsistent with the low mass accretion rate in exo 0748-676. possibly thehydrogen ignition is the determining factor for the occurrence of shortwait-time bursts.

astro-ph;0701810	six new candidate ultracompact x-ray binaries	ultracompact x-ray binaries (ucxbs) appear able to sustain accretion onto thecompact accretor at rates lower than in wider x-ray binaries. this may beunderstood by the smaller accretion disks in ucxbs: a lower x-ray luminositysuffices to keep a disk completely ionized through irradiation and, thus, keepthe viscosity at a sufficiently high level to allow effective transport ofmatter to the compact object. we employ this distinguishing factor on data fromrxte and bepposax to identify six new candidate ucxbs, thus increasing thepopulation by one quarter. the candidates are drawn from the population ofpersistently accreting and type-i x-ray bursting low-mass x-ray binaries. thex-ray bursts establish the low-mass x-ray binary nature and provide a handle onthe accretion rate. we find that the low accretion rates are supported by thelong burst recurrence times and the hard x-ray spectra of the persistentemission as derived from the 2nd integral catalog of soft gamma-ray sources. wediscuss the peculiar light curves of some new ucxb candidates.

0809.3323	restless quiescence: thermonuclear flashes between transient x-ray  outbursts	for thermonuclear flashes to occur on neutron-star surfaces, fuel must havebeen accreted from a donor star. however, sometimes flashes are seen fromtransient binary systems when they are thought to be in their quiescent phase,during which no accretion, or relatively little, is expected to occur. weinvestigate the accretion luminosity during several such flashes, including thefirst-ever and brightest detected flash from cen x-4 in 1969. we infer fromobservations and theory that immediately prior to these flashes the accretionrate must have been between about 0.001 and 0.01 times the equivalent of theeddington limit, which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude less than the peakaccretion rates seen in these transients during an x-ray outburst and 3-4orders of magnitude more than the lowest measured values in quiescence.furthermore, three such flashes, including the one from cen x-4, occurredwithin 2 to 7 days followed by an x-ray outburst. a long-term episode ofenhanced, but low-level, accretion is predicted near the end of the quiescentphase by the disk-instability model, and may thus have provided the rightconditions for these flashes to occur. we discuss the possibility of whetherthese flashes acted as triggers of the outbursts, signifying a dramaticincrease in the accretion rate. although it is difficult to rule out, we findit unlikely that the irradiance by these flashes is sufficient to change thestate of the accretion disk in such a dramatic way.

astro-ph;9910107	the orbital period of the recurrent x-ray transient in terzan 6	four or five new outbursts were detected of the bright x-ray transient grs1747-312 in the globular cluster terzan 6 between 1996 and 1999, throughmonitoring campaigns with the wide field cameras (wfcs) on bepposax and theproportional counter array (pca) on rossixte. this is the first time that thesource is seen to exhibit recurrent outbursts after the discovery in september1990 with art-p on granat. three target-of-opportunity observations in 1998 and1999, with the narrow-field instruments on bepposax and the pca, revealed onesharp drop in the flux which we identify as an eclipse of the compact x-raysource by the companion star. a detailed analysis of wfc data identifiesfurther eclipses and we measure the orbital period at 12.360+/-0.009 hr. thisis consistent with an identification as a low-mass x-ray binary, as suggestedalready by the association with a globular cluster. the eclipse duration is0.72+/-0.06 hr. this implies that the inclination angle is larger than 74 deg.the 0.1-200 kev unabsorbed peak luminosity is 7x10^36 erg/s. the nature of thecompact object is unclear.

astro-ph;9910235	bepposax observations of grb980425: detection of the prompt event and  monitoring of the error box	we present bepposax follow-up observations of grb980425 obtained with thenarrow field instruments (nfi) in april, may, and november 1998. the first nfiobservation has detected within the 8' radius error box of the grb an x-raysource positionally consistent with the supernova 1998bw, which exploded withina day of grb980425, and a fainter x-ray source, not consistent with theposition of the supernova. the former source is detected in the following nfipointings and exhibits a decline of a factor of two in six months. if it isassociated with sn 1998bw, this is the first detection of x-ray emission from atype i supernova above 2 kev. the latter source exhibits only marginallysignificant variability. the x-ray spectra and variability of the supernova arecompared with thermal and non-thermal models of supernova high energy emission.based on the bepposax data, it is not possible to firmly establish which of thetwo detected sources is the grb x-ray counterpart, although probabilityconsiderations favor the supernova.
