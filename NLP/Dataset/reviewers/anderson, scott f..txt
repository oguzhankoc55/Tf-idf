0902.1366	x-ray insights into the nature of weak emission-line quasars at high  redshift	we present chandra observations of nine high-redshift quasars (z=2.7-5.9)discovered by the sloan digital sky survey with weak or undetectablehigh-ionization emission lines in their uv spectra (wlqs). adding archivalx-ray observations of six additional sources of this class has enabled us toplace the strongest constraints yet on the x-ray properties of this remarkableclass of agns. although our data cannot rule out the possibility that theemission lines are overwhelmed by a relativistically boosted continuum, asmanifested by bl lac objects, we find that wlqs are considerably weaker in thex-ray and radio bands than the majority of bl lacs found at much lowerredshifts. if wlqs are high-redshift bl lacs, then it is difficult to explainthe lack of a large parent population of x-ray and radio bright weak-linedsources at high redshift. we also consider the possibility that wlqs arequasars with extreme properties, and in particular that the emission lines aresuppressed by high accretion rates. using joint spectral fitting of the x-rayspectra of 11 wlqs we find that the mean photon index in the hard x-ray band isconsistent with those observed in typical radio-quiet agns with no hint of anunusually steep hard-x-ray spectrum. this result poses a challenge to thehypothesis that wlqs have extremely high accretion rates, and we discussadditional observations required to test this idea.

0902.1527	astro2010 decadal survey whitepaper: coordinated science in the  gravitational and electromagnetic skies	it is widely expected that the coming decade will witness the first directdetection of gravitational waves (gws). the ground-based ligo and virgo gwobservatories are being upgraded to advanced sensitivity, and are expected toobserve a significant binary merger rate. the launch of the laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) would extend the gw window to lowfrequencies, opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (m &gt;~10^5 m_sun) black holes. gw events are likely to be accompanied byelectromagnetic (em) counterparts and, since information carriedelectromagnetically is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a greatdeal can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes possibleto measure both forms of radiation in concert. measurements of this kind willmark the dawn of trans-spectral astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectralbands of information. the aim of this whitepaper is to articulate futuredirections in both theory and observation that are likely to impact broadastrophysical inquiries of general interest. what will em observations reflecton the nature and diversity of gw sources? can gw sources be exploited ascomplementary probes of cosmology? what cross-facility coordination will expandthe science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic observations?

0902.3981	the impact of the astro2010 recommendations on variable star science	the next decade of survey astronomy has the potential to transform ourknowledge of variable stars. stellar variability underpins our knowledge of thecosmological distance ladder, and provides direct tests of stellar formationand evolution theory. variable stars can also be used to probe the fundamentalphysics of gravity and degenerate material in ways that are otherwiseimpossible in the laboratory. the computational and engineering advances of thepast decade have made large-scale, time-domain surveys an immediate reality.some surveys proposed for the next decade promise to gather more data than inthe prior cumulative history of astronomy. the actual implementation of thesesurveys will have broad implications for the types of science that will beenabled. we examine the design considerations for an optimal time-domainphotometric survey dedicated to variable star science, including: observingcadence, wavelength coverage, photometric and astrometric accuracy,single-epoch and cumulative depth, overall sky coverage, and data access by thebroader astronomical community. the best surveys must combine aspects from eachof these considerations to fully realize the potential for the next decade oftime-domain science.

0903.0330	a radio search for pulsar companions to sdss low-mass white dwarfs	we have conducted a search for pulsar companions to 15 low-mass white dwarfs(lmwds; m &lt; 0.4 m_sun) at 820 mhz with the nrao green bank telescope (gbt).these lmwds were spectroscopically identified in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), and do not show the photometric excess or spectroscopic signatureassociated with a companion in their discovery data. however, lmwds arebelieved to evolve in binary systems and to have either a more massive wd or aneutron star as a companion. indeed, evolutionary models of low-mass x-raybinaries, the precursors of millisecond pulsars (msps), produce significantnumbers of lmwds (e.g., benvenuto &amp; de vito 2005), suggesting that the sdsslmwds may have neutron star companions. no convincing pulsar signal is detectedin our data. this is consistent with the findings of van leeuwen et al. (2007),who conducted a gbt search for radio pulsations at 340 mhz from unseencompanions to eight sdss wds (five are still considered lmwds; the three othersare now classified as "ordinary" wds). we discuss the constraints ournon-detections place on the probability p_msp that the companion to a givenlmwd is a radio pulsar in the context of the luminosity and acceleration limitsof our search; we find that p_msp &lt; 10 +4 -2 %.

0903.4505	increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in astronomy:  executive summary	promoting racial and ethnic diversity is critically important to the futuresuccess and growth of the field of astronomy. the raw ability, drive andinterest required to excel in the field is distributed without regard to race,gender, or socioeconomic background. by not actively promoting diversity in ourfield we risk losing talented people to other professions (or losing thementirely), which means that there will be astronomical discoveries that simplywon't get made. there is demonstrated evidence that stem fields benefit fromdiverse perspectives on problems that require more complex thought processes.this is especially relevant to a field like astronomy where more and more workis being done collaboratively. the lack of notable growth in african american,hispanic, and native american representation in astronomy indicates that the'pipeline' for these individuals is systemically leaky at critical junctures.substantially more effort must be directed toward improving the educational andcareer development of minorities to insure that these potential colleagues aresupported through the process. however, simply recognizing that the pipeline isfaulty is woefully inadequate. there must be very specific, targeted solutionsto help improve the situation. with this in mind, we offer two position papersaddressing specific areas of improvement that we identify as (a) essential forany foreseeable progress in the field, and (b) attainable in the 2010-2020decade. these position papers focus primarily on african americans, hispanics,and native americans. although we do not directly address issues of asianamericans, pacific islanders, and other groups, many of the recommendationsmade here can be adapted to address issues faced by these groups as well.

0903.4506	increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in astronomy at the  undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels (paper i)	if the ethnic makeup of the astronomy profession is to achieve parity withthe general population within one generation (~30 years), the number ofunderrepresented minorities earning graduate degrees in astronomy andastrophysics must increase in the coming decade by a factor of 5 to 10. toaccomplish this, the profession must develop and invest in mechanisms to moreeffectively move individuals across critical educational junctures to the phdand beyond. early and continuous research engagement starting in theundergraduate years is critical to this vision, in which the federally fundedresearch internship programs (e.g. nsf reu, nasa gsrp) and nationalcenters/observatories play a vital role. regionally based partnerships withminority-serving institutions (msis) are crucial for tapping extant pools ofminority talent, as are post-baccalaurate and/or masters degree "bridging"programs that provide critical stepping stones to the phd. because of thestrong undergraduate physics, engineering, and computer science backgrounds ofmany students from msis, we suggest that instrument development and large scalecomputing/data-mining are particularly promising avenues for engagement in thecoming decade.

0909.4086	probing the balance of agn and star-forming activity in the local  universe with champ	the combination of the sdss and the chandra multiwavelength project (champ)currently offers the largest and most homogeneously selected sample of nearbygalaxies for investigating the relation between x-ray nuclear emission, nebularline-emission, black hole masses, and properties of the associated stellarpopulations. we present here novel constraints that both x-ray luminosity lxand x-ray spectral energy distribution bring to the galaxy evolutionarysequence h ii -&gt; seyfert/transition object -&gt; liner -&gt; passive suggested byoptical data. in particular, we show that both lx and gamma, the slope of thepower-law that best fits the 0.5 - 8 kev spectra, are consistent with a cleardecline in the accretion power along the sequence, corresponding to a softeningof their spectra. this implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity agn levels,there is an anti-correlation between gamma and l/ledd, opposite to the trendexhibited by high z agn (quasars). the turning point in the gamma -l/ledd llagn+ quasars relation occurs near gamma ~ 1.5 and l/ledd ~ 0.01. interestingly,this is identical to what stellar mass x-ray binaries exhibit, indicating thatwe have probably found the first empirical evidence for an intrinsic switch inthe accretion mode, from advection-dominated flows to standard (disk/corona)accretion modes in supermassive black hole accretors, similar to what has beenseen and proposed to happen in stellar mass black hole systems. theanti-correlation we find between gamma and l/ledd may instead indicate thatstronger accretion correlates with greater absorption. therefore the trend forsofter spectra toward more luminous, high redshift, and strongly accretingagn/quasars could simply be the result of strong selection biases reflected inthe dearth of type 2 quasar detections.

1007.3464	chandra x-ray observations of two unusual bal quasars	we report sensitive chandra x-ray non-detections of two unusual, luminousiron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars (felobals). the observationsdo detect a non-bal, wide-binary companion quasar to one of the felobalquasars. we combine x-ray-derived column density lower limits (assuming solarmetallicity) with column densities measured from ultraviolet spectra and cloudyphotoionization simulations to explore whether constant density slabs at broadline region densities can match the physical parameters of these two baloutflows, and find that they cannot. in the "overlapping-trough" object sdssj0300+0048, we measure the column density of the x-ray absorbing gas to be n_h&gt;= 1.8 x 1024 cm-2. from the presence of fe ii uv78 absorption but lack of feii uv195/uv196 absorption, we infer the density in that part of the absorbingregion to be n_e ~ 106 cm-3. we do find that a slab of gas at that densitymight be able to explain this object's absorption. in the fe iii-dominantobject sdss j2215-0045, the x-ray absorbing column density of n_h &gt;= 3.4 x 1024cm-2 is consistent with the fe iii-derived n_h &gt;= 2 x 1022 cm-2 provided theionization parameter is log u &gt; 1.0 for both the n_e = 1011 cm-3 and n_e = 1012cm-3 scenarios considered (such densities are required to produce fe iiiabsorption without fe ii absorption). however, the velocity width of theabsorption rules out its being concentrated in a single slab at thesedensities. instead, this object's spectrum can be explained by a low density,high ionization and high temperature disk wind that encounters and ablateshigher density, lower ionization fe iii-emitting clumps.

1104.0981	a deep chandra view of the ngc 404 central engine	we present the results of a 100 ks {\it chandra} observation of the ngc 404nuclear region. the long exposure and excellent spatial resolution of {\itchandra} has enabled us to critically examine the nuclear environment of ngc404, which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially anintermediate-mass black hole (on the order of a few times $10^5$ \msun). wefind two distinct x-ray sources: a hard, central point source coincident withthe optical and radio centers of the galaxy, and a soft extended region that iscoincident with areas of high h$\alpha$ emission and likely recent starformation. when we fit the 0.3-8 kev spectra of each region separately, we findthe hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law (\pl = 1.88),while the soft off-nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ($kt$ =0.67 kev). we therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hotgas in the nuclear region of ngc 404. we estimate the 2-10 kev luminosity to be1.3$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. a low-level of diffuse x-rayemission is detected out to $\sim$15\as ($\sim$0.2 kpc) from the nucleus. wecompare our results to the observed relationships between power law photonindex and eddington ratio for both x-ray binaries and low luminosity activegalaxies and find ngc 404 to be consistent with other low luminosity activegalaxies. we therefore favor the conclusion that ngc 404 harbors anintermediate-mass black hole accreting at a very low level.

1105.3211	using the fundamental plane of black hole activity to distinguish x-ray  processes from weakly accreting black holes	the fundamental plane of black hole activity is a relation between x-rayluminosity, radio luminosity, and black hole mass for hard state galactic blackholes and their supermassive analogs. the fundamental plane suggests that, atlow-accretion rates, the physical processes regulating the conversion of anaccretion flow into radiative energy could be universal across the entire blackhole mass scale. however, there is still a need to further refine thefundamental plane in order to better discern the radiative processes and theirgeometry very close to the black hole, in particular the source of hard x-rays.further refinement is necessary because error bars on the best-fit slopes ofthe fundamental plane are generally large, and also the inferred coefficientscan be sensitive to the adopted sample of black holes. in this work, we regressthe fundamental plane with a bayesian technique. our approach shows thatsub-eddington black holes emit x-ray emission that is predominantly opticallythin synchrotron radiation from the jet, provided that their radio spectra areflat or inverted. x-ray emission dominated by very radiatively inefficientaccretion flows are excluded at the &gt;3\sigma\ level. we also show that it isdifficult to place fr i galaxies onto the fundamental plane because their x-rayjet emission is highly affected by synchrotron cooling. on the other hand, bllac objects fit onto the fundamental plane. including a uniform subset ofhigh-energy peaked bl lac objects from the sdss, we find sub-eddington blackholes with flat/inverted radio spectra follow log l_x=(1.45\pm0.04)logl_r-(0.88\pm0.06)\logm_{bh}-6.07\pm1.10, with \sigma_{int}=0.07\pm0.05 dex.finally, we discuss how the effects of synchrotron cooling of jet emission fromthe highest black hole masses can bias fundamental plane regressions, perhapsleading to incorrect inferences on x-ray radiation mechanisms.

1112.0679	a description of quasar variability measured using repeated sdss and  poss imaging	we provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of theoptical continuum variability of quasars. the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)has obtained repeated imaging in five uv-to-ir photometric bands for 33,881spectroscopically confirmed quasars. about 10,000 quasars have an average of 60observations in each band obtained over a decade along stripe 82 (s82), whereasthe remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. the observedtime lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasarvariability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-framewavelengths from 1000a to 6000a. we publicly release a user-friendly catalog ofquasars from the sdss data release 7 that have been observed at least twice insdss or once in both sdss and the palomar observatory sky survey, and we use itto analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. based on a dampedrandom walk (drw) model defined by a characteristic time scale and anasymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black holemass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in s82, we canfully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-s82 quasars suchas the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. all available dataare consistent with the drw model as a viable description of the opticalcontinuum variability of quasars on time scales of ~5-2000 days in the restframe. we use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination intransient surveys such as those from ptf and lsst.

1112.2228	x-ray and multiwavelength insights into the nature of weak emission-line  quasars at low redshift	(abridged) we report on the x-ray and multiwavelength properties of 11radio-quiet quasars with weak or no emission lines identified by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) with redshift z=0.4-2.5. the distribution of relativex-ray brightness for our low-redshift weak-line quasar (wlq) candidates issignificantly different from that of typical radio-quiet quasars, having anexcess of x-ray weak sources, but it is consistent with that of high-redshiftwlqs. the x-ray weak sources generally show similar uv emission-line propertiesto those of the x-ray weak quasar phl 1811; they may belong to the notableclass of phl 1811 analogs. the average x-ray spectrum of these sources issomewhat harder than that of typical radio-quiet quasars. several otherlow-redshift wlq candidates have normal ratios of x-ray-to-optical/uv flux, andtheir average x-ray spectral properties are also similar to those of typicalradio-quiet quasars. the x-ray weak and x-ray normal wlq candidates may belongto the same subset of quasars having high-ionization "shielding gas" coveringmost of the wind-dominated broad emission-line region, but be viewed atdifferent inclinations. the mid-infrared-to-x-ray spectral energy distributions(seds) of these sources are generally consistent with those of typical sdssquasars, showing that they are not likely to be bl lac objects withrelativistically boosted continua and diluted emission lines. however, onesource in our x-ray observed sample is remarkably strong in x-rays, indicatingthat a small fraction of low-redshift wlq candidates may actually be bl lacsresiding in the radio-faint tail of the bl lac population. we also investigateuniversal selection criteria for wlqs over a wide range of redshift, findingthat it is not possible to select wlq candidates in a fully consistent wayusing different prominent emission lines as a function of redshift.

1112.5162	the lack of torus emission from bl lacertae objects: an infrared view of  unification with wise	we use data from the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) to perform astatistical study on the mid-infrared (ir) properties of a large number($\sim10^2$) of bl lac objects --- low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (agn)with a jet beamed toward the earth. as expected, many bl lac objects are sohighly beamed that their jet synchrotron emission dominates their ir spectralenergy distributions. in other bl lac objects, however, the jet is not strongenough to completely dilute the rest of the agn emission. we do not seeobservational signatures of the dusty torus from these weakly beamed bl lacobjects. the lack of observable torus emission is consistent with suggestionsthat bl lac objects are fed by radiatively inefficient accretion disks.implications for the "nature vs. nurture" debate for fr i and fr ii radiogalaxies are briefly discussed. our study supports the notion that, beyondorientation, accretion rate plays an important role in agn unification.

1202.0236	hst/cos observations of thirteen new he ii quasars	the full reionization of intergalactic helium was a major event in thehistory of the igm, and uv observations of the he ii gunn-peterson trough allowus to characterize the end of this process at z~3. due to intervening hydrogenabsorption, quasars allowing such study are rare, with only 33 known in theliterature, and most of those are very recent discoveries. we expand on ourprevious discovery work, and present 13 new he ii quasars with redshifts 2.82 &lt;z &lt; 3.77, here selected with ~80% efficiency, and including several that aremuch brighter than the vast majority of those previously known. this is thelargest sample of uniformly observed he ii quasars covering such a broadredshift range, and they show evidence of igm opacity increasing with redshift,as expected for the helium reionization epoch. no evidence of he ii ly{\alpha}quasar emission is seen in individual or averaged spectra, posing a problem forstandard models of the broad line region. the current rapid advance in thestudy of he ii quasars has been greatly facilitated by the cosmic originsspectrograph on hst, and we discuss the instrumental and other subtleties thatmust be taken into account in igm he ii observations.

1209.3770	characterizing the optical variability of bright blazars:  variability-based selection of fermi agn	we investigate the use of optical photometric variability to select andidentify blazars in large-scale time-domain surveys, in part to aid in theidentification of blazar counterparts to the ~30% of gamma-ray sources in thefermi 2fgl catalog still lacking reliable associations. using data from theoptical linear asteroid survey, we characterize the optical variability ofblazars by fitting a damped random walk model to individual light curves withtwo main model parameters, the characteristic timescales of variability (tau),and driving amplitudes on short timescales (sigma). imposing cuts on minimumtau and sigma allows for blazar selection with high efficiency e andcompleteness c. to test the efficacy of this approach, we apply this method tooptically variable linear objects that fall within the several-arcminute errorellipses of gamma-ray sources in the fermi 2fgl catalog. despite the extremestellar contamination at the shallow depth of the linear survey, we are able torecover previously-associated optical counterparts to fermi agn with e &gt; 88%and c = 88% in fermi 95% confidence error ellipses having semimajor axis r &lt;8'. we find that the suggested radio counterpart to fermi source 2fglj1649.6+5238 has optical variability consistent with other gamma-ray blazars,and is likely to be the gamma-ray source. our results suggest that thevariability of the non-thermal jet emission in blazars is stochastic in nature,with unique variability properties due to the effects of relativistic beaming.after correcting for beaming, we estimate that the characteristic timescale ofblazar variability is ~3 years in the rest-frame of the jet, in contrast withthe ~320 day disk flux timescale observed in quasars. the variability-basedselection method presented will be useful for blazar identification intime-domain optical surveys, and is also a probe of jet physics.

1401.1211	evidence for large temperature fluctuations in quasar accretion disks  from spectral variability	the well-known bluer-when-brighter trend observed in quasar variability is asignature of the complex processes in the accretion disk, and can be a probe ofthe quasar variability mechanism. using a sample of 604 variable quasars withrepeat spectra in sdss-i/ii, we construct difference spectra to investigate thephysical causes of this bluer-when-brighter trend. the continuum of ourcomposite difference spectrum is well-fit by a power-law, with a spectral indexin excellent agreement with previous results. we measure the spectralvariability relative to the underlying spectra of the quasars, which isindependent of any extinction, and compare to model predictions. we show thatour sdss spectral variability results cannot be produced by global accretionrate fluctuations in a thin disk alone. however, we find that a simple model ofa inhomogeneous disk with localized temperature fluctuations will producepower-law spectral variability over optical wavelengths. we show that theinhomogeneous disk will provide good fits to our observed spectral variabilityif the disk has large temperature fluctuations in many independently varyingzones, in excellent agreement with independent constraints from quasarmicrolensing disk sizes, their strong uv spectral continuum, and single-bandvariability amplitudes. our results provide an independent constraint on quasarvariability models, and add to the mounting evidence that quasar accretiondisks have large localized temperature fluctuations.

1502.01723	detection of quasar feedback from the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect  in planck	poorly understood feedback processes associated with highly-luminous blackhole accretion in quasars may dramatically affect the properties of their hostgalaxies. we search for the effect of quasar feedback on surrounding gas usingplanck maps of the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (tsz). by stacking tszcompton-y maps centered on the locations of 26,686 spectroscopic quasars fromthe sloan digital sky survey, we detect a strong but unresolved tsz compton-ysignal at &gt;5 sigma significance that likely originates from a combination ofvirialized halo atmosphere gas and quasar feedback effects. we show that thefeedback contribution to our detected quasar tsz signal is likely to dominateover virialized halo gas by isolating the feedback tsz component for high- andlow-redshift quasars. we find that this quasar tsz signal also scales withblack hole mass and bolometric luminosity, all consistent with generalexpectations of quasar feedback. we estimate the mean angularly-integratedcompton-y of quasars at z~1.5 to be 3.5x10^-6 mpc^2, corresponding to meantotal thermal energies in feedback and virialized halo gas of 1.1(+/- 0.2) x10^62 erg, and discuss the implications for quasar feedback. if confirmed, thelarge total thermal feedback energetics we estimate of 5% (+/-1% statisticaluncertainty) of the black hole mass will have important implications for theeffects of quasar feedback on the host galaxy, as well as the surroundingintergalactic medium.

1503.07523	detection of rest-frame optical lines from x-shooter spectroscopy of  weak emission line quasars	over the past 15 years, examples of exotic radio-quiet quasars withintrinsically weak or absent broad emission line regions (belrs) have emergedfrom large-scale spectroscopic sky surveys. here, we present spectroscopy ofseven such weak emission line quasars (wlqs) at moderate redshifts (z=1.4-1.7)using the x-shooter spectrograph, which provides simultaneous optical andnear-infrared spectroscopy covering the rest-frame ultraviolet through optical.these new observations effectively double the number of wlqs with spectroscopyin the optical rest-frame, and they allow us to compare the strengths of (weak)high-ionization emission lines (e.g., civ) to low-ionization lines (e.g., mgii,hb, ha) in individual objects. we detect broad hb and ha emission in allobjects, and these lines are generally toward the weaker end of thedistribution expected for typical quasars (e.g., hb has rest-frame equivalentwidths ranging from 15-40 ang.). however, these low-ionization lines are notexceptionally weak, as is the case for high-ionization lines in wlqs. thex-shooter spectra also display relatively strong optical feii emission, hb fwhm&lt;4000 km/s, and significant civ blueshifts (1000-5500 km/s) relative to thesystemic redshift; two spectra also show elevated ultraviolet feii emission,and an outflowing component to their (weak) mgii emission lines. theseproperties suggest that wlqs are exotic versions of "wind-dominated" quasars.their belrs either have unusual high-ionization components, or their belrs arein an atypical photoionization state because of an unusually soft continuum.

1505.00760	the time domain spectroscopic survey: variable object selection and  anticipated results	we present the selection algorithm and anticipated results for the timedomain spectroscopic survey (tdss). tdss is an sdss-iv eboss subproject thatwill provide initial identification spectra of approximately 220,000luminosity-variable objects (variable stars and agn) across 7,500 squaredegrees selected from a combination of sdss and multi-epoch pan-starrs1photometry. tdss will be the largest spectroscopic survey to explicitly targetvariable objects, avoiding pre-selection on the basis of colors or detailedmodeling of specific variability characteristics. kernel density estimate (kde)analysis of our target population performed on sdss stripe 82 data suggests ourtarget sample will be 95% pure (meaning 95% of objects we select have genuineluminosity variability of a few magnitudes or more). our final spectroscopicsample will contain roughly 135,000 quasars and 85,000 stellar variables,approximately 4,000 of which will be rr lyrae stars which may be used as outermilky way probes. the variability-selected quasar population has a smootherredshift distribution than a color-selected sample, and variabilitymeasurements similar to those we develop here may be used to make more uniformquasar samples in large surveys. the stellar variable targets are distributedfairly uniformly across color space, indicating that tdss will obtain spectrafor a wide variety of stellar variables including pulsating variables, starswith significant chromospheric activity, cataclysmic variables and eclipsingbinaries. tdss will serve as a pathfinder mission to identify and characterizethe multitude of variable objects that will be detected photometrically in evenlarger variability surveys such as lsst.

1509.03640	now you see it, now you don't: the disappearing central engine of the  quasar j1011+5442	we report the discovery of a new "changing-look" quasar, sdssj101152.98+544206.4, through repeat spectroscopy from the time domainspectroscopic survey. this is an addition to a small but growing set of quasarswhose blue continua and broad optical emission lines have been observed todecline by a large factor on a time scale of approximately a decade. the 5100angstrom monochromatic continuum luminosity of this quasar drops by a factor of&gt; 9.8 in a rest-frame time interval of &lt; 9.7 years, while the broad h-alphaluminosity drops by a factor of 55 in the same amount of time. the width of thebroad h-alpha line increases in the dim state such that the black hole massderived from the appropriate single-epoch scaling relation agrees between thetwo epochs within a factor of 3. the fluxes of the narrow emission lines do notappear to change between epochs. the light curve obtained by the catalina skysurvey suggests that the transition occurs within a rest-frame time interval ofapproximately 500 days. we examine three possible mechanisms for thistransition suggested in the recent literature. an abrupt change in thereddening towards the central engine is disfavored by the substantialdifference between the timescale to obscure the central engine and the observedtimescale of the transition. a decaying tidal disruption flare is consistentwith the decay rate of the light curve but not with the prolonged bright statepreceding the decay, nor can this scenario provide the power required by theluminosities of the emission lines. an abrupt drop in the accretion rate ontothe supermassive black hole appears to be the most plausible explanation forthe rapid dimming.

1510.06107	constraints on the initial-final mass relation from wide double white  dwarfs	we present observational constraints on the initial-final mass relation(ifmr) using wide double white dwarfs (dwds). we identify 65 new candidate widedwds within the sloan digital sky survey, bringing the number of candidate widedwds to 142. we then engage in a spectroscopic follow-up campaign and collectexisting spectra for these objects; using these spectra, we derive masses andcooling ages for 54 hydrogen (da) wds in dwds. we also identify one new da/dbpair, four candidate da/dc pairs, four candidate da/dah pairs, and one newcandidate triple degenerate system. because wide dwds are co-eval and evolveindependently, the difference in the pre-wd lifetimes should equal thedifference in the wd cooling ages. we use this to develop a bayesianhierarchical framework and construct a likelihood function to determine theprobability that any particular ifmr fits a sample of wide dwds. we then definea parametric model for the ifmr and find the best parameters indicated by oursample of dwds. we place robust constraints on the ifmr for initial masses of2--4 \msun. the wd masses produced by our model for stars within this massrange differ from those predicted by semi-empirical fits to open cluster wds.within this mass range, where there are few constraining open cluster wds anddisagreements in the cluster ages, wide dwds may provide more reliableconstraints on the ifmr. expanding this method to the many wide dwds expectedto be discovered by gaia may transform our understanding of the ifmr.

astro-ph;0201550	the optical identification of the x-ray burster x1746-370 in the  globular cluster ngc6441	we find convincing observational evidence to confirm the opticalidentification of the x-ray burster x1746-370 located in the globular clusterngc6441. chandra/hrc-i imaging yields a much improved x-ray position for thesource, which we show to be fully consistent with our rederived position of auv-excess star, u1, in the same astrometric reference frame. in addition, thesmaller chandra x-ray error circle excludes the only other blue starspreviously identified in the old einstein circle. we have also obtained hubblespace telescope/stis time-resolved optical spectra of star u1. although thereare no strong line features, the flux distribution demonstrates u1 to beunusually bright in the blue and faint in the red, consistent with earlierwfpc2 photometry. more notably, the flux level of the continuum is seen to varysignificantly compared to stars of similar brightness. indeed, the lightcurvecan plausibly be fit by a 5.73 hr period sinusoid, which is the period of therecurring x-ray dips seen in this source. the presence of modulations in bothwavelengths strengthens the case for an orbital origin, and therefore deepensthe puzzle of the unusual energy independent x-ray dips. lastly, we note thatx1746-370 remains the longest period confirmed x-ray burster in a globularcluster, and the only one with a period typical of the galactic population as awhole.

astro-ph;0305093	a large, uniform sample of x-ray emitting agn: selection approach and an  initial catalog from the rosat all-sky and sloan digital sky surveys	many open questions in x-ray astronomy are limited by the relatively smallnumber of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when raresubclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution orcorrelations between wavebands. we describe initial results of a program aimedto ultimately yield 10^4 x-ray source identifications--a sample about an orderof magnitude larger than earlier efforts. the technique employs x-ray data fromthe rosat all-sky survey (rass), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followupfrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical objects in the sdss catalogsare automatically cross-correlated with rass x-ray source positions; thenpriorities for follow-on sdss optical spectra of candidate counterparts areautomatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios forvarious classes of x-ray emitters. sdss parameters for optical morphology,magnitude, colors, plus first radio data, serve as proxies for object class.  initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalogof 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/agn that are probable rassidentifications. most of the ids are new, and only a few percent of the agn arelikely to be random superpositions. the magnitude and redshift ranges of thecounterparts extend over 15&lt;m&lt;21 and 0.03&lt;z&lt;3.6. although most ids are quasarsand sy 1s, a variety of other agn subclasses are also sampled. substantialnumbers of rare agn are found, including more than 130 narrow-line seyfert 1sand 45 bl lac candidates. these results already provide a sizeable set of newids, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate thecapability of the rass/sdss approach to efficiently proceed towards the largesthomogeneously selected/observed sample of x-ray emitting agn. abridged abstract

astro-ph;0506730	ultracompact am cvn binaries from the sloan digital sky survey: three  candidates plus the first confirmed eclipsing system	am cvn systems are a rare (about a dozen previously known) class ofcataclysmic variables, arguably encompassing the shortest orbital periods (downto about 10 minutes) of any known binaries. both binary components are thoughtto be degenerate (or partially so), likely with mass-transfer from ahelium-rich donor onto a white dwarf, driven by gravitational radiation.although rare, am cvn systems are of high interest as possible sn iaprogenitors, and because they are predicted to be common sources of gravitywaves in upcoming experiments such as lisa. we have identified four new am cvncandidates from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectral database. all fourshow hallmark spectroscopic characteristics of the am cvn class: each is devoidof hydrogen features, and instead shows a spectrum dominated by helium. allfour show double-peaked emission, indicative of helium-dominated accretiondisks. limited time-series ccd photometric follow-on data have been obtainedfor three of the new candidates from the arc 3.5m; most notably, a 28.3 minutebinary period with sharp, deep eclipses is discovered in one case, sdssj0926+3624. this is the first confirmed eclipsing am cvn, and our data allowinitial estimates of binary parameters for this ultracompact system. the fournew sdss objects also provide a substantial expansion of the currentlycritically-small sample of am cvn systems.

0809.0765	a high yield of new sightlines for the study of intergalactic helium:  far-uv-bright quasars from sdss, galex, and hst	investigations of he ii ly-alpha (304 a rest) absorption toward a half-dozenquasars at z~3-4 have demonstrated the great potential of helium studies of theigm, but the current critically small sample size of clean sightlines for thehe ii gunn-peterson test limits confidence in cosmological inferences, and alarger sample is required. although the unobscured quasar sightlines to highredshift are extremely rare, sdss dr6 provides thousands of z&gt;2.8 quasars. wehave cross-correlated these sdss quasars with galex gr2/gr3 to establish acatalog of 200 higher-confidence (~70% secure) cases of quasars at z=2.8-5.1potentially having surviving far-uv (restframe) flux. we also catalog another112 likely far-uv-bright quasars from galex cross-correlation with other(non-sdss) quasar compilations. reconnaissance uv prism observations with hstof 24 of our sdss/galex candidates confirm 12 as detected in the far-uv, withat least 9 having flux extending to very near the he ii break; with refinementsour success rate is even higher. our sdss/galex selection approach is therebyconfirmed to be an order of magnitude more efficient than previous he ii quasarsearches, more than doubles the number of spectroscopically confirmed cleansightlines to high redshift, and provides a resource list of hundreds ofhigh-confidence sightlines for upcoming he ii and other far-uv studies fromhst. our reconnaissance hst prism spectra suggest some far-uv diversity,confirming the need to obtain a large sample of independent quasar sightlinesacross a broad redshift range to assess such issues as the epoch(s) of heliumreionization, while averaging over individual-object pathology and/or cosmicvariance.

astro-ph;0511659	candidate isolated neutron stars and other optically blank x-ray fields  identified from the rosat all-sky and sloan digital sky surveys	only seven radio-quiet isolated neutron stars (inss) emitting thermal x raysare known, a sample that has yet to definitively address such fundamentalissues as the equation of state of degenerate neutron matter. we describe aselection algorithm based on a cross-correlation of the rosat all-sky survey(rass) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) that identifies x-ray errorcircles devoid of plausible optical counterparts to the sdss g~22 magnitudeslimit. we quantitatively characterize these error circles as optically blank;they may host inss or other similarly exotic x-ray sources such as radio-quietbl lacs, obscured agn, etc. our search is an order of magnitude more selectivethan previous searches for optically blank rass error circles, and excludes the99.9% of error circles that contain more common x-ray-emitting subclasses. wefind 11 candidates, nine of which are new. while our search is designed to findthe best ins candidates and not to produce a complete list of inss in the rass,it is reassuring that our number of candidates is consistent with predictionsfrom ins population models. further x-ray observations will obtain pinpointpositions and determine whether these sources are entirely optically blank atg~22, supporting the presence of likely isolated neutron stars and perhapsenabling detailed follow-up studies of neutron star physics.

astro-ph;0512645	the soft x-ray properties of quasars in the sloan digital sky survey	we use the rosat all sky survey (rass) to study the soft x-ray properties ofa homogeneous sample of 46,420 quasars selected from the third data release ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical luminosities, both at rest-frame2500\aa ($l_{2500}$) and in [oiii] ($l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$) span more than threeorders of magnitude, while redshifts range over $0.1&lt;z&lt;5.4$. we detect 3366quasars directly in the observed 0.1--2.4 kev band. sub-samples of radio-loudand radio-quiet objects (rlqs and rqqs) are obtained by cross-matching with thefirst catalogue. we study the distribution of x-ray luminosity as a function ofoptical luminosity, redshift and radio power using both individual detectionsand stacks of complete sets of similar quasars. at every optical luminosity andredshift $\log l_{2\kev}$ is, to a good approximation, normally distributedwith dispersion $\sim 0.40$, at least brightwards of the median x-rayluminosity. this median x-ray luminosity of quasars is a power law of opticalluminosity with index $\sim 0.53$ for $l_{2500}$ and $\sim 0.30$ for$l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$. rlqs are systematically brighter than rqqs by about a factorof 2 at given optical luminosity. the zero-points of these relations increasesystematically with redshift, possibly in different ways for rlqs and rqqs.evolution is particularly strong at low redshift and if the optical luminosityis characterised by $l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$. at low redshift and at given$l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$ the soft x-ray emission from type ii agn is more than 100times weaker than that from type i agn.

astro-ph;0601434	the sdss quasar survey: quasar luminosity function from data release  three	we determine the number counts and z=0-5 luminosity function for awell-defined, homogeneous sample of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we conservatively define the most uniform statistical sample possible,consisting of 15,343 quasars within an effective area of 1622 deg^2 that wasderived from a parent sample of 46,420 spectroscopically confirmed broad-linequasars in the 5282 deg^2 of imaging data from sdss data release three. thesample extends from i=15 to i=19.1 at z&lt;3 and to i=20.2 for z&gt;3. the numbercounts and luminosity function agree well with the results of the 2df qsosurvey, but the sdss data probe to much higher redshifts than does the 2dfsample. the number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts 2 and 3,although uncertainties in the selection function in this range do not allow usto determine the peak redshift more precisely. our best fit model has a flatterbright end slope at high redshift than at low redshift. for z&lt;2.4 the data arebest fit by a redshift-independent slope of beta = -3.1 (phi(l) propto l^beta).above z=2.4 the slope flattens with redshift to beta=-2.37 at z=5. this slopechange, which is significant at a &gt;5-sigma level, must be accounted for inmodels of the evolution of accretion onto supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0602442	chandra observations of the highest redshift quasars from the sloan  digital sky survey	we present new chandra observations of 21 z&gt;4 quasars, including 11 sourcesat z&gt;5. these observations double the number of x-ray detected quasars at z&gt;5,allowing investigation of the x-ray spectral properties of a substantial sampleof quasars at the dawn of the modern universe. by jointly fitting the spectraof 15 z&gt;5 radio-quiet quasars (rqqs), including sources from the chandraarchive, with a total of 185 photons, we find a mean x-ray power-law photonindex of gamma=1.95^{+0.30}_{-0.26}, and a mean neutral intrinsic absorptioncolumn density of n_h&lt;~6x10^{22} cm^{-2}. these results show that quasar x-rayspectral properties have not evolved up to the highest observable redshifts. wealso find that the mean optical-x-ray spectral slope (alpha_ox) ofoptically-selected z&gt;5 rqqs, excluding broad absorption line quasars, isalpha_ox=-1.69+/-0.03, which is consistent with the value predicted from theobserved relationship between alpha_ox and ultraviolet luminosity. four of thesources in our sample are members of the rare class of weak emission-linequasars, and we detect two of them in x-rays. we discuss the implications ourx-ray observations have for the nature of these mysterious sources and, inparticular, whether their weak-line spectra are a consequence of continuumboosting or a deficit of high-ionization line emitting gas.

astro-ph;0610818	two additions to the new class of low accretion-rate magnetic binaries	two new magnetic white dwarf accretion binaries with extremely lowmass-transfer rates have been discovered in the course of the sloan digital skysurvey. measured magnetic fields are 42 mg and 57 mg, and one system orbitswith a period of just 82 min. the new systems therefore significantly expandthe range in properties exhibited by the small class. the measured accretionrates are very low, 0.6-5x10^{-13} msun/yr, and multiple visits spanning morethan a year confirm that this is not a short-lived characteristic. it isbecoming increasingly clear that the low-mdot magnetic white dwarf binariesaccrete by nearly complete magnetic capture of the stellar wind from thesecondary star rather than by roche lobe overflow. the accretion ratestherefore provide some of the first realistic estimates of the total wind lossrates from m dwarfs. although one or more of the eight systems known to datemay be interrupted or possibly even extinct polars, several lines of evidencesuggest that most are pre-polars whose evolution has not yet brought thesecondaries into contact with their roche surfaces. considering thedifficulties of identifying binaries over a wide range in field strength andaccretion rate, it is quite possible that the space density of wind-accretingmagnetic binaries exceeds that of the classical x-ray emitting, roche-lobeoverflow polars.

astro-ph;0702214	clustering of high redshift ($z\ge 2.9$) quasars from the sloan digital  sky survey	(abridged) we study the two-point correlation function of a uniformlyselected sample of 4,426 luminous optical quasars with redshift $2.9 \le z\le5.4$ selected over 4041 deg$^2$ from the fifth data release of the sloandigital sky survey. for a real-space correlation function of the form$\xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are$r_0 = 15.2 \pm 2.7 h^{-1}$ mpc and $\gamma = 2.0 \pm 0.3$, over a scale range$4\le r_p\le 150 h^{-1}$ mpc. thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably morestrongly clustered than their $z \approx 1.5$ counterparts, which have acomoving clustering length $r_0 \approx 6.5 h^{-1}$ mpc. dividing our sampleinto two redshift bins: $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $z\ge 3.5$, and assuming apower-law index $\gamma=2.0$, we find a correlation length of $r_0 = 16.9 \pm1.7 h^{-1}$ mpc for the former, and $r_0 = 24.3 \pm 2.4 h^{-1}$ mpc for thelatter. following martini &amp; weinberg, we relate the clustering strength andquasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. using the sheth &amp;tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range$4\sim 50$ myr for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$; and $30\sim 600$ myr forquasars with $z\ge 3.5$. the corresponding duty cycles are $0.004\sim 0.05$ forthe lower redshift bin and $0.03\sim 0.6$ for the higher redshift bin. theminimum mass of halos in which these quasars reside is $2-3\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $4-6\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $z\ge 3.5$.

astro-ph;9607157	rosat soft x-ray properties of the large bright quasar survey: modeling  of stacked x-ray spectra	we develop and apply a novel method of analysis to study the x-ray spectralproperties of 908 qsos in the large bright quasar survey (lbqs) that wereobserved during the soft x-ray rosat all-sky survey (rass). due to therelatively short (&lt;600sec) rass exposure times, only 10% of the qsos aredetected in x-rays, so x-ray spectral model fits for individual qsos areprecluded by poor photon statistics. spectral stacking provides effectivelymuch more sensitive x-ray observations for an average qso in bins of redshift,and for several classes of qsos. we model the stacked x-ray spectra in a waythat obviates both the distinction between detections and non-detections, andthe need to stack together only those objects observed through similar galacticcolumn densities n_h. in application to the lbqs/rass sample, we marginallyconfirm a flattening of the x-ray spectral index of qsos toward higherredshifts. radio-loud qsos show flatter x-ray photon indices, in agreement withprevious work. we show that the apparent flattening of the photon index withredshift is not due to an increasing fractional contribution from theradio-loud class of qsos.

astro-ph;9812239	the full re-ionization of helium	observations of resolved heii lyman alpha absorption in spectra of two qso'ssuggest that the epoch of helium ionization occurred at z~3. proximity zones inthe spectra of the quasars (z=3.18, 3.285) at 304 a resemble stromgren spheres,suggesting that the intergalactic medium is only singly ionized in helium. wepresent models of the proximity effect which include the full physics of theionization, heating and cooling and an accurately simulated inhomogeneous gasdistribution. in these models the underdense intergalactic medium is heated toat least 10,000-20,000 k after cooling to as low as a few 1000 k due tocosmological expansion, with higher temperatures achieved farther away from thequasar due to absorption-hardened ionizing spectra. the quasars turn on for afew times 10^7 years with a fairly steady flux output at 228 a comparable tothe 304 a flux output directly observed with hst. the recoveries in the spectraoccur naturally due to voids in the igm and may provide a fairlymodel-independent probe of the baryon density.

astro-ph;9901210	a morphological and multicolor survey for faint qsos in the  groth-westphal strip	quasars representative of the populous faint end of the luminosity functionare frustratingly dim with m~24 at intermediate redshift; moreover groundbasedsurveys for such faint qsos suffer substantial morphological contamination bycompact galaxies having similar colors. in order to establish a more reliableultrafaint qso sample, we used the apo 3.5-m telescope to take deep groundbasedu-band ccd images in fields previously imaged in v,i with wfpc2/hst. ourapproach hence combines multicolor photometry with the 0.1" spatial resolutionof hst, to establish a morphological and multicolor survey for qsos extendingabout 2 magnitudes fainter than most extant groundbased surveys. we presentresults for the "groth-westphal strip", in which we identify 10 high likelihooduv-excess candidates having stellar or stellar-nucleus+galaxy morphology inwfpc2. for m(606)&lt;24.0 (roughly b&lt;24.5) the surface density of such qsocandidates is 420 (+180,-130) per square degree, or a surface density of 290(+160,-110) per square degree with an additional v-i cut that may furtherexclude compact emission line galaxies. even pending confirming spectroscopy,the observed surface density of qso candidates is already low enough to yieldinteresting comparisons: our measures agree extremely well with the predictionsof several recent luminosity function models.

astro-ph;9905174	infrared candidates for the intense galactic x-ray source gx 17+2	we present new astrometric solutions and infrared hubble space telescopeobservations of gx 17+2 (x1813-140), one of the brightest x-ray sources on thecelestial sphere. despite 30 years of intensive study, and the existence of astrong radio counterpart with a sub-arcsecond position, the object remainsoptically unidentified. the observed x-ray characteristics strongly suggestthat it is a so-called "z-source," the rare but important category thatincludes sco x-1 and cyg x-2. use of the usno-a2.0 catalog enables us tomeasure the position of optical and infrared objects near the radio source tosub-arcsecond precision within the international celestial reference frame, fordirect comparison with the radio position, which we also recompute using moderncalibrators. with high confidence we eliminate the v~17.5 star np ser, oftenlisted as the probable optical counterpart of the x-ray source, as a candidate.our hst nicmos observations show two faint objects within our 0.5" radius 90%confidence error circle. even the brighter of the two, star a, is far fainterthan expected (h~19.8), given multiple estimates of the extinction in thisfield and our previous understanding of z sources, but it becomes the bestcandidate for the counterpart of gx 17+2. the probability of a chancecoincidence of an unrelated faint object on the radio position is high.however, if the true counterpart is not star a, it is fainter still, and ourconclusion that the optical counterpart is surprisingly underluminous is butstrengthened.

0809.3952	efficient photometric selection of quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey: ii. ~1,000,000 quasars from data release six	we present a catalog of 1,172,157 quasar candidates selected from thephotometric imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the objectsare all point sources to a limiting magnitude of i=21.3 from 8417 sq. deg. ofimaging from sdss data release 6 (dr6). this sample extends our previouscatalog by using the latest sdss public release data and probing both uv-excessand high-redshift quasars. while the addition of high-redshift candidatesreduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to~80%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars -- ~8times the number of our previous sample, and ~10 times the size of the largestspectroscopic quasar catalog. cross-matching between our photometric catalogand spectroscopic quasar catalogs from both the sdss and 2df surveys, yields88,879 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. for judicious selection of the mostrobust uv-excess sources (~500,000 objects in all), the efficiency is nearly97% -- more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. the catalog'scompleteness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than70%, with most missing objects occurring at z&lt;0.7 and 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.0. in addition toclassification information, we provide photometric redshift estimates(typically good to delta z +/- 0.3 [2 sigma]) and cross-matching with radio,x-ray, and proper motion catalogs. finally, we consider the catalog's utilityfor determining the optical luminosity function of quasars and are able toconfirm the flattening of the bright-end slope of the quasar luminosityfunction at z~4 as compared to z~2.

astro-ph;9912259	ultracompact x-ray binaries in globular clusters: variability of the  optical counterpart of x1832-330 in ngc 6652	evidence is emerging that the luminous x-ray sources in the cores of globularclusters may often consist of, or perhaps even as a class be dominated by,ultracompact (p &lt; 1 hr) binary stars. to the two such systems already known, inngc 6624 and ngc 6712, we now add evidence for two more. we detect largeamplitude variability in the candidate optical counterpart for the x-ray sourcein the core of ngc 6652. although the available observations are relativelybrief, the existing hubble space telescope data indicate a strong 43.6 minperiodic modulation of the visible flux of semi-amplitude 30%. further,although the orbital period of the source in ngc 1851 is not yet explicitlymeasured, we demonstrate that previous correlations of optical luminosity withx-ray luminosity and accretion disk size, strengthened by recent data, stronglyimply that the period of that system is also less than 1 hr. thus currentlythere is evidence that 4 of the 7 globular cluster x-ray sources withconstrained periods are ultracompact, a fraction far greater than that found inx-ray binaries the field.

0810.2747	a catalog of broad absorption line quasars in sloan digital sky survey  data release 5	we present a catalog of 5039 broad absorption line (bal) quasars (qsos) inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 (dr5) qso catalog that haveabsorption troughs covering a continuous velocity range &gt;= 2000 km/s. we havefit ultraviolet (uv) continua and line emission in each case, enabling us toreport common diagnostics of bal strengths and velocities in the range -25,000to 0 km/s for siiv $\lambda$1400, civ $\lambda$1549, aliii $\lambda$1857, andmgii $\lambda$2799. we calculate these diagnostics using the spectrum listed inthe dr5 qso catalog, and also for spectra from additional sdss observing epochswhen available. in cases where bal qsos have been observed with chandra orxmm-newton, we report the x-ray monochromatic luminosities of these sources.  we confirm and extend previous findings that bal qsos are more stronglyreddened in the rest-frame uv than non-bal qsos and that bal qsos arerelatively x-ray weak compared to non-bal qsos. the observed bal fraction isdependent on the spectral signal-to-noise (s/n); for higher-s/n sources, wefind an observed bal fraction of approximately 15%. bal qsos show a similarbaldwin effect as for non-bal qsos, in that their civ emission equivalentwidths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. however, bal qsos haveweaker civ emission in general than do non-bal qsos. sources with higher uvluminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the baloutflow velocity and uv absorption strength are correlated with relative x-rayweakness. these results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend onstrong x-ray absorption to shield the outflow from over-ionization and enableradiative acceleration....
