0903.2487	are br(b-&gt;s gamma) and (g-2)_muon consistent within the constrained  mssm?	we employ two different statistical tests to examine whether, in theframework of the constrained mssm, the experimentally determined values ofbr(b-&gt;s gamma) and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (g-2), areconsistent with each other. our tests are designed to compare the theoreticalpredictions of the cmssm in data space with the actual measurements, once allof the cmssm free parameters have been integrated out and constrained using allother available data. we investigate the value of (g-2) as obtained by usinge+e- data alone (which shows a ~3sigma discrepancy with the sm prediction) andas obtained based on tau decay data (which shows a much milder, 1sigmadiscrepancy). we find that one of our tests returns either a statisticallyinconclusive result or shows weak evidence of tension between br(b-&gt;s gamma)and the e+e- data based value of (g-2). on the other hand, our second test,which is more stringent in this application, reveals that the jointobservations of br(b-&gt;s gamma) and (g-2) from e+e- data alone are incompatiblewithin the cmssm at the ~2sigma level. on the other hand, for both tests wefind no significant tension between br(b-&gt;s gamma) and the value of (g-2)evaluated using tau decay data. these results are only weakly dependent on thethree different priors that we employ in the analysis. we conclude that, if thediscrepancy between the standard model and the experimental determinations of(g-2) is confirmed at the 3sigma level, this could be interpreted as strongevidence against the cmssm.

0706.4289	a low cmb variance in the wmap data	we have estimated the cmb variance from the three-year wmap data, finding avalue which is significantly lower than the one expected from gaussiansimulations using the wmap best-fit cosmological model, at a significance levelof 98.7 per cent. this result is even more prominent if we consider only thenorth ecliptic hemisphere (99.8 per cent). different analyses have beenperformed in order to identify a possible origin for this anomaly. inparticular we have studied the behaviour of single radiometers and single yeardata as well as the effect of residual foregrounds and 1/f noise, finding thatnone of these possibilities can explain the low value of the variance. we havealso tested the effect of varying the cosmological parameters, finding that theestimated cmb variance tends to favour higher values of $n_s$ than the one ofthe wmap best-fit model. in addition, we have also tested the consistencybetween the estimated cmb variance and the actual measured cmb power spectrumof the wmap data, finding a strong discrepancy. a possible interpretation ofthis result could be a deviation from gaussianity and/or isotropy of the cmb.

1012.4441	a blind detection of a large, complex, sunyaev--zel'dovich structure	we present an interesting sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) detection in the first ofthe arcminute microkelvin imager (ami) 'blind', degree-square fields to havebeen observed down to our target sensitivity of 100{\mu}jy/beam. in follow-updeep pointed observations the sz effect is detected with a maximum peakdecrement greater than 8 \times the thermal noise. no corresponding emission isvisible in the rosat all-sky x-ray survey and no cluster is evident in thepalomar all-sky optical survey. compared with existing sz images of distantclusters, the extent is large (\approx 10') and complex; our analysis favours amodel containing two clusters rather than a single cluster. our bayesiananalysis is currently limited to modelling each cluster with an ellipsoidal orspherical beta-model, which do not do justice to this decrement. fitting anellipsoid to the deeper candidate we find the following. (a) assuming that theevrard et al. (2002) approximation to press &amp; schechter (1974) correctly givesthe number density of clusters as a function of mass and redshift, then, in thesearch area, the formal bayesian probability ratio of the ami detection of thiscluster is 7.9 \times 10^4:1; alternatively assuming jenkins et al. (2001) asthe true prior, the formal bayesian probability ratio of detection is 2.1\times 10^5:1. (b) the cluster mass is mt,200 = 5.5+1.2\times 10^14h-1m\odot.(c) abandoning a physical model with num- -1.3 70 ber density prior and insteadsimply modelling the sz decrement using a phenomenological {\beta}-model oftemperature decrement as a function of angular distance, we find a central sztemperature decrement of -295+36 {\mu}k - this allows for cmb primaryanisotropies, receiver -15 noise and radio sources. we are unsure if thecluster system we observe is a merging system or two separate clusters.

1012.5129	detecting extrasolar planets from stellar radial velocities using  bayesian evidence	stellar radial velocity (rv) measurements have proven to be a very successfulmethod for detecting extrasolar planets. analysing rv data to determine theparameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challengeowing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies betweenorbital parameters. determining the number of planets favoured by the observeddata is an even more difficult task. bayesian model selection provides amathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginalposterior probabilities of models with different number of planets, but the useof this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by thecomputational cost of the evaluating bayesian evidence. nonetheless, bayesianmodel selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existingobservational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets. we present anew and efficient bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolarplanets, as well as for inferring their orbital parameters, without having tocalculate directly the bayesian evidence for models containing a large numberof planets. instead, we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain aconservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additionalplanet into the model. we apply this method to simulated data-sets containingone and two planets and successfully recover the correct number of planets andreliable constraints on the orbital parameters. we also apply our method to rvmeasurements of hd 37124, 47 ursae majoris and hd 10180. for hd 37124, weconfirm that the current data strongly favour a three-planet system. we findstrong evidence for the presence of a fourth planet in 47 ursae majoris, butits orbital period is suspiciously close to one year, casting doubt on itsvalidity. for hd 10180 we find strong evidence for a six-planet system.

1103.4619	a bayesian study of the primordial power spectrum from a novel closed  universe model	we constrain the shape of the primordial power spectrum using recentmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe (wmap) 7-year data and other high-resolution cmbexperiments. we also include observations of the matter power spectrum from theluminous red galaxy (lrg) subset dr7 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). weconsider two different models of the primordial power spectrum. the first isthe standard nearly scale-invariant spectrum in the form of a generalisedpower-law parameterised in terms of the spectral amplitude $a_{\rm s}$, thespectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and (possibly) the running parameter $n_{\rm run}$.the second spectrum is derived from the lasenby and doran (ld) model. the ldmodel is based on the restriction of the total conformal time available in aclosed universe and the predicted primordial power spectrum depends upon justtwo parameters. an important feature of the ld spectrum is that it naturallyincorporates an exponential fall-off on large scales, which might provide apossible explanation for the lower-than-expected power observed at lowmultipoles in the cmb. in addition to parameter estimation, we compare bothmodels using bayesian model selection. we find there is a significantpreference for the ld model over a simple power-law spectrum for a cmb-onlydataset, and over models with an equal number of parameters for all thedatasets considered.

1105.6106	constraints on general primordial non-gaussianity using wavelets for the  wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-year data	we present constraints on the non-linear coupling parameter fnl with thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) data. we use the method based onthe spherical mexican hat wavelet (smhw) to measure the fnl parameter for threeof the most interesting shapes of primordial non-gaussianity: local,equilateral and orthogonal. our results indicate that this parameter iscompatible with a gaussian distribution within the two sigma confidence level(cl) for the three shapes and the results are consistent with the valuespresented by the wmap team. we have included in our analysis the impact on fnldue to contamination by unresolved point sources. the point sources add apositive contribution of delta(fnl) = 2.5 \pm 3.0, delta(fnl) = 37 \pm 18 anddelta(fnl) = 25 \pm 14 for the local, equilateral and orthogonal casesrespectively. as mentioned by the wmap team, the contribution of the pointsources to the orthogonal and equilateral form is expected to be larger thanthe local one and thus it cannot be neglected in future constraints on theseparameters. taking into account this contamination, our best estimates for fnlare -16.0 \leq fnl \leq 76.0, -382 \leq fnl \leq 202 and -394 \leq fnl \leq 34at 95% cl for the local, equilateral and orthogonal cases respectively. thethree shapes are compatible with zero at 95% cl (2{\sigma}). our conclusion isthat the wmap 7-year data are consistent with gaussian primordial fluctuationswithin ~2{\sigma} cl. we stress however the importance of taking into accountthe unresolved point sources in the measurement of fnl in future works,especially when using more precise data sets such as the forthcoming planckdata.

1108.2202	weak lensing by triaxial galaxy clusters	weak gravitational lensing studies of galaxy clusters often assume aspherical cluster model to simplify the analysis, but some recent studies havesuggested this simplifying assumption may result in large biases in estimatedcluster masses and concentration values, since clusters are expected to exhibittriaxiality. several such analyses have, however, quoted expressions for thespatial derivatives of the lensing potential in triaxial models, which are opento misinterpretation. in this paper, we give a clear description of weaklensing by triaxial nfw galaxy clusters and also present an efficient androbust method to model these clusters and obtain parameter estimates. byconsidering four highly triaxial nfw galaxy clusters, we re-examine the impactof simplifying spherical assumptions and found that while the concentrationestimates are largely unbiased except in one of our traixial nfw simulatedclusters, for which the concentration is only slightly biased, the masses aresignificantly biased, by up to 40%, for all the clusters we analysed. moreover,we find that such assumptions can lead to the erroneous conclusion that somesubstructure is present in the galaxy clusters or, even worse, that multiplegalaxy clusters are present in the field. our cluster fitting method alsoallows one to answer the question of whether a given cluster exhibitstriaxiality or a simple spherical model is good enough.

0704.3158	cosmological applications of a wavelet analysis on the sphere	the cosmic microwave background (cmb) is a relic radiation of the big bangand as such it contains a wealth of cosmological information. statisticalanalyses of the cmb, in conjunction with other cosmological observables,represent some of the most powerful techniques available to cosmologists forplacing strong constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe theorigin, content and evolution of the universe. the last decade has witnessedthe introduction of wavelet analyses in cosmology and, in particular, theirapplication to the cmb. we review here spherical wavelet analyses of the cmbthat test the standard cosmological concordance model. the assumption that thetemperature anisotropies of the cmb are a realisation of a statisticallyisotropic gaussian random field on the sphere is questioned. deviations fromboth statistical isotropy and gaussianity are detected in the reviewed works,suggesting more exotic cosmological models may be required to explain ouruniverse. we also review spherical wavelet analyses that independently provideevidence for dark energy, an exotic component of our universe of which we knowvery little currently. the effectiveness of accounting correctly for thegeometry of the sphere in the wavelet analysis of full-sky cmb data isdemonstrated by the highly significant detections of physical processes andeffects that are made in these reviewed works.

1205.0847	reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state	one of the main challenges of modern cosmology is to investigate the natureof dark energy in our universe. the properties of such a component are normallysummarised as a perfect fluid with a (potentially) time-dependentequation-of-state parameter $w(z)$. we investigate the evolution of thisparameter with redshift by performing a bayesian analysis of currentcosmological observations. we model the temporal evolution as piecewise linearin redshift between `nodes', whose $w$-values and redshifts are allowed tovary. the optimal number of nodes is chosen by the bayesian evidence. in thisway, we can both determine the complexity supported by current data and locateany features present in $w(z)$. we compare this node-based reconstruction withsome previously well-studied parameterisations: the chevallier-polarski-linder(cpl), the jassal-bagla-padmanabhan (jbp) and the felice-nesseris-tsujikawa(fnt). by comparing the bayesian evidence for all of these models we find anindication towards possible time-dependence in the dark energyequation-of-state. it is also worth noting that the cpl and jbp models arestrongly disfavoured, whilst the fnt is just significantly disfavoured, whencompared to a simple cosmological constant $w=-1$. we find that our node-basedreconstruction model is slightly disfavoured with respect to the $\lambda$cdmmodel.

1207.3705	comparison of cosmological parameter inference methods applied to  supernovae lightcurves fitted with salt2	we present a comparison of two methods for cosmological parameter inferencefrom supernovae ia lightcurves fitted with the salt2 technique. the standardchi-square methodology and the recently proposed bayesian hierarchical method(bhm) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3-yeardata release from the supernova legacy survey (snls3), and also data from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss), the low redshift sample and the hubble spacetelescope (hst), assuming a concordance lcdm cosmology. for both methods, wefind that the recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the globalnuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to thesupernovae lightcurves, suffer from small biasses. the magnitude of the biassesis similar in both cases, with the bhm yielding slightly more accurate results,in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the snls3 singlesurvey data sets. most notably, in this case, the biasses in the recoveredmatter density $\omega_{\rm m,0}$ are in opposite directions for the twomethods. for any given realisation of the snls3-type data, this can result in a$\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy in the estimated value of $\omega_{\rm m,0}$between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real snls3 data. asmore higher and lower redshift snia samples are included, however, thecosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge.

1207.3708	bayesian constraints on dark matter halo properties using  gravitationally-lensed supernovae	a hierarchical bayesian method is applied to the analysis of type-iasupernovae (snia) observations to constrain the properties of the dark matterhaloes of galaxies along the snia lines-of-sight via their gravitationallensing effect. the full joint posterior distribution of the dark matter haloparameters is explored using the nested sampling algorithm {\sc multinest},which also efficiently calculates the bayesian evidence, thereby facilitatingrobust model comparison. we first demonstrate the capabilities of the method byapplying it to realistic simulated snia data, based on the real 3-year datarelease from the supernova legacy survey (snls3). assuming typical values forthe halo parameters in our simulations, we find that a catalogue analogous tothe existing snls3 data set is incapable of detecting the lensing signal, but acatalogue containing approximately three times as many snia does produce robustand accurate parameter constraints and model selection results for two halomodels: a truncated singular isothermal sphere (sis) and anavarro--frenk--white (nfw) profile, thereby validating our analysismethodology. in the analysis of the real snls3 data, contrary to previousstudies, we obtain only a very marginal detection of a lensing signal and weakconstraints on the halo parameters for the truncated sis model, although theseconstraints are tighter than those obtained from the equivalent simulated sniadata set. this difference is driven by a preferred value of $\eta \approx 1$ inthe assumed scaling-law $\sigma \propto l^\eta$ between velocity dispersion andluminosity, which is somewhat higher than the canonical values of $\eta =\tfrac{1}{4}$ and $\eta = \tfrac{1}{3}$ for early and late-type galaxies,respectively, and leads to a stronger lensing effect by the halo. no detectionof a lensing signal is made for the nfw model.

1208.1264	a simple and robust method for automated photometric classification of  supernovae using neural networks	a method is presented for automated photometric classification of supernovae(sne) as type-ia or non-ia. a two-step approach is adopted in which: (i) the snlightcurve flux measurements in each observing filter are fitted separately;and (ii) the fitted function parameters and their associated uncertainties,along with the number of flux measurements, the maximum-likelihood value of thefit and bayesian evidence for the model, are used as the input feature vectorto a classification neural network (nn) that outputs the probability that thesn under consideration is of type-ia. the method is trained and tested usingdata released following the supernova photometric classification challenge(snpcc). we consider several random divisions of the data into training andtesting sets: for instance, for our sample d_1 (d_4), a total of 10% (40%) ofthe data are involved in training the algorithm and the remainder used forblind testing of the resulting classifier; we make no selection cuts. assigninga canonical threshold probability of p_th=0.5 on the nn output to classify a snas type-ia, for the sample d_1 (d_4) we obtain a completeness of 0.78 (0.82),purity of 0.77 (0.82), and snpcc figure-of-merit of 0.41 (0.50). including thesn host-galaxy redshift and its uncertainty as additional inputs to the nnresults in a modest 5-10% increase in these values. we find that theclassification quality does not vary significantly with sn redshift. moreover,our probabilistic classification method allows one to calculate the expectedcompleteness, purity or other measures of classification quality as a functionof the p_th, without knowing the true classes of the sne in the testing sample.the method may thus be improved further by optimising p_th and can easily beextended to divide non-ia sne into their different classes.

1208.2542	reciprocity invariance of the friedmann equation, missing matter and  double dark energy	the current concordance model of cosmology is dominated by two mysteriousingredients: dark matter and dark energy. in this paper, we explore thepossibility that, in fact, there exist two dark-energy components: thecosmological constant \lambda, with equation-of-state parameter w_\lambda=-1,and a `missing matter' component x with w_x=-2/3, which we introduce here toallow the friedmann equation written in terms of conformal time \eta to beform-invariant under the reciprocity transformation a(\eta)\to 1/a(\eta) of thescale factor. using recent cosmological observations, we constrain thepresent-day energy density of missing matter to be \omega_{x,0}=-0.11\pm 0.14.this is consistent with the standard lcdm model, but constraints on the energydensities of all the components are considerably broadened by the introductionof missing matter; significant relative probability exists even for\omega_{x,0}\sim 0.2, and so the presence of a missing matter component cannotbe ruled out. nonetheless, a bayesian model selection analysis disfavours itsintroduction by about 1.5 log-units of evidence. foregoing our requirement ofform invariance of the friedmann equation under the reciprocity transformation,we extend our analysis by allowing w_x to be a free parameter. for this moregeneric `double dark energy' model, we find w_x= -1.02\pm 0.20 and\omega_{x,0}= 0.08\pm 0.57, which is again consistent with lcdm, although oncemore the posterior distributions are sufficiently broad that the existence of asecond dark-energy component cannot be ruled out. moreover, the two-dimensionalposterior in the (w_x,\omega_{x,0})-plane is strongly bimodal with both peaksoffset from the standard lcdm corresponding to (-1,0), although the latter isstill admissible; this bimodality is in contrast to the correctly-centredunimodal posterior obtained when analysing simulated observations from a lcdmmodel.

0704.3704	multimodal nested sampling: an efficient and robust alternative to mcmc  methods for astronomical data analysis	in performing a bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficultproblems often emerge. first, in estimating the parameters of some model forthe data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibitpronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditionalmcmc sampling methods. second, in selecting between a set of competing models,calculation of the bayesian evidence for each model is computationallyexpensive. the nested sampling method introduced by skilling (2004), hasgreatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and alsoproduces posterior inferences as a by-product. this method has been appliedsuccessfully in cosmological applications by mukherjee et al. (2006), but theirimplementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounceddegeneracies. shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nestedsampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling frommultimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of thefinal evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a furtherincrease in efficiency. in this paper, we build on the work of shaw et al. andpresent three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation fromdistributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; wealso present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty onthe evaluated evidence. these methods lead to a further substantial improvementin sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems todemonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameterestimation. finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing bayesianobject detection in astronomical datasets.

1303.4014	constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio for non-power-law models	recent cosmological observations hint at a deviation from the simplepower-law form of the primordial spectrum of curvature perturbations. in thispaper we show that in the presence of a tensor component, a turn-over in theinitial spectrum is preferred by current observations, and hence non-power-lawmodels ought to be considered. for instance, for a power-law parameterisationwith both a tensor component and running parameter, current data show apreference for a negative running at more than $2.5\sigma$ c.l. as aconsequence of this deviation from a power-law, constraints on thetensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are slightly broader. we also present constraints onthe inflationary parameters for a model-independent reconstruction and thelasenby &amp; doran (ld) model. in particular, the constraints on thetensor-to-scalar ratio from the ld model are: $r_{\rm ld}=0.11\pm{0.024}$. inaddition to current data, we show expected constraints from planck-like andcmb-pol sensitivity experiments by using markov-chain-monte-carlo samplingchains. for all the models, we have included the bayesian evidence to perform amodel selection analysis. the bayes factor, using current observations, shows astrong preference for the ld model over the standard power-lawparameterisation, and provides an insight into the accuracy of differentiatingmodels through future surveys.

1306.2144	importance nested sampling and the multinest algorithm	bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. first, inestimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posteriordistribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergenceto stationarity of traditional markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) techniquesbecomes incredibly slow. second, in selecting between a set of competing modelsthe necessary estimation of the bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a(possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; againthis can be a daunting computational task, although new monte carlo (mc)integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. nestedsampling (ns) is one such contemporary mc strategy targeted at calculation ofthe bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as aby-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and modelselection. the widely-used multinest algorithm presents a particularlyefficient implementation of the ns technique for multi-modal posteriors. inthis paper we discuss importance nested sampling (ins), an alternativesummation of the multinest draws, which can calculate the bayesian evidence atup to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' ns with no change inthe way multinest explores the parameter space. this is accomplished bytreating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected bymultinest, including those previously discarded under the constrainedlikelihood sampling of the ns algorithm. we apply this technique to severalchallenging test problems and compare the accuracy of bayesian evidencesobtained with ins against those from vanilla ns.

1401.2253	kinetic initial conditions for inflation	we consider the classical evolution of the inflaton field $\phi(t)$ and thehubble parameter $h(t)$ in homogeneous and isotropic single-field inflationmodels. under an extremely broad assumption, we show that the universegenerically emerges from an initial singularity in a non-inflating state wherethe kinetic energy of the inflaton dominates its potential energy,$\dot{\phi}^2 \gg v(\phi)$. in this kinetically-dominated regime, the dynamicalequations admit simple analytic solutions for $\phi(t)$ and $h(t)$, which areindependent of the form of $v(\phi)$. in such models, these analytic solutionsthus provide a simple way of setting the initial conditions from which to startthe (usually numerical) integration of the coupled equations of motion for$\phi(t)$ and $h(t)$. we illustrate this procedure by applying it tospatially-flat models with polynomial and exponential potentials, and determinethe background evolution in each case; generically $h(t)$ and $|\phi(t)|$ aswell as their time derivatives decrease during kinetic dominance until$\dot{\phi}^2\sim v(\phi)$, marking the onset of a brief period of fast-rollinflation prior to a slow roll phase. we also calculate the approximatespectrum of scalar perturbations produced in each model and show that itexhibits a generic damping of power on large scales. this may be relevant tothe apparent low-$\ell$ falloff in the cmb power spectrum.

0802.3916	a fast bayesian approach to discrete object detection in astronomical  datasets - powellsnakes i	a new fast bayesian approach is introduced for the detection of discreteobjects immersed in a diffuse background. this new method, called powellsnakes,speeds up traditional bayesian techniques by: i) replacing the standard form ofthe likelihood for the parameters characterizing the discrete objects by analternative exact form that is much quicker to evaluate; ii) using asimultaneous multiple minimization code based on powell's direction setalgorithm to locate rapidly the local maxima in the posterior; and iii)deciding whether each located posterior peak corresponds to a real object byperforming a bayesian model selection using an approximate evidence value basedon a local gaussian approximation to the peak. the construction of thisgaussian approximation also provides the covariance matrix of the uncertaintiesin the derived parameter values for the object in question. this new approachprovides a speed up in performance by a factor of `hundreds' as compared toexisting bayesian source extraction methods that use mcmc to explore theparameter space, such as that presented by hobson &amp; mclachlan. we illustratethe capabilities of the method by applying to some simplified toy models.furthermore powellsnakes has the advantage of consistently defining thethreshold for acceptance/rejection based on priors which cannot be said of thefrequentist methods. we present here the first implementation of this technique(version-i). further improvements to this implementation are currently underinvestigation and will be published shortly. the application of the method torealistic simulated planck observations will be presented in a forthcomingpublication.

1404.2854	generalised fisher matrices	the fisher information matrix formalism is extended to cases where the datais divided into two parts (x,y), where the expectation value of y depends on xaccording to some theoretical model, and x and y both have errors witharbitrary covariance. in the simplest case, (x,y) represent data pairs ofabscissa and ordinate, in which case the analysis deals with the case of datapairs with errors in both coordinates, but x can be any measured quantities onwhich y depends. the analysis applies for arbitrary covariance, provided allerrors are gaussian, and provided the errors in x are small, both in comparisonwith the scale over which the expected signal y changes, and with the width ofthe prior distribution. this generalises the fisher matrix approach, whichnormally only considers errors in the `ordinate' y. in this work, we includeerrors in x by marginalising over latent variables, effectively employing abayesian hierarchical model, and deriving the fisher matrix for this moregeneral case. the methods here also extend to likelihood surfaces which are notgaussian in the parameter space, and so techniques such as dali (derivativeapproximation for likelihoods) can be generalised straightforwardly to includearbitrary gaussian data error covariances. for simple mock data and theoreticalmodels, we compare to markov chain monte carlo experiments, illustrating themethod with cosmological supernova data. we also include the new method in thefisher4cast software.

1405.5013	comparison of sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements from planck and from the  arcminute microkelvin imager for 99 galaxy clusters	we present observations and analysis of a sample of 123 galaxy clusters fromthe 2013 planck catalogue of sunyaev-zel'dovich sources with the arcminutemicrokelvin imager (ami), a ground-based radio interferometer. ami provides anindependent measurement with higher angular resolution, 3 arcmin compared tothe planck beams of 5-10 arcmin. the ami observations thus provide validationof the cluster detections, improved positional estimates, and a consistencycheck on the fitted 'size' ($\theta_{s}$) and 'flux' ($y_{\rm tot}$) parametersin the generalised navarro, frenk and white (gnfw) model. we detect 99 of theclusters. we use the ami positional estimates to check the positional estimatesand error-bars produced by the planck algorithms powellsnakes and mmf3. we findthat $y_{\rm tot}$ values as measured by ami are biased downwards with respectto the planck constraints, especially for high planck-snr clusters. we performsimulations to show that this can be explained by deviation from the'universal' pressure profile shape used to model the clusters. we show that amidata can constrain the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters describing the shape ofthe profile in the gnfw model for individual clusters provided carefulattention is paid to the degeneracies between parameters, but one requiresinformation on a wider range of angular scales than are present in ami dataalone to correctly constrain all parameters simultaneously.

1412.1427	generative pulsar timing analysis	a new bayesian method for the analysis of folded pulsar timing data ispresented that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of evolution in the pulseprofile in either frequency or time, along with the timing model and additionalstochastic processes such as red spin noise, or dispersion measure variations.we model the pulse profiles using `shapelets' - a complete ortho-normal set ofbasis functions that allow us to recreate any physical profile shape. anyevolution in the profiles can then be described as either an arbitrary numberof independent profiles, or using some functional form. we perform simulationsto compare this approach with established methods for pulsar timing analysis,and to demonstrate model selection between different evolutionary scenariosusing the bayesian evidence. %s the simplicity of our method allows for manypossible extensions, such as including models for correlated noise in the pulseprofile, or broadening of the pulse profiles due to scattering. as such, whileit is a marked departure from standard pulsar timing analysis methods, it hasclear applications for both new and current datasets, such as those from theeuropean pulsar timing array (epta) and international pulsar timing array(ipta).

0704.0626	probing dark energy with steerable wavelets through correlation of wmap  and nvss local morphological measures	using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerablewavelet analysis, we examine the three-year wmap and the nvss data forcorrelation induced by the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect. the steerablewavelet constructed from the second derivative of a gaussian allows one todefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,orientation and elongation of local features. detections of correlation betweenthe wmap and nvss data are made with each of these morphological measures. themost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of thesigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. by inspectingsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see thecorrelation between the wmap and nvss data by eye. foreground contamination andinstrumental systematics in the wmap data are ruled out as the source of allsignificant detections of correlation. our results provide new insight on theisw effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation inducedbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of theuniverse. given the current constraints on the flatness of the universe, ourdetection of the isw effect again provides direct and independent evidence fordark energy. moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future tohelp us to better understand the nature of dark energy.

0807.2523	classical big-bounce cosmology: dynamical analysis of a homogeneous and  irrotational weyssenhoff fluid	a dynamical analysis of an effective homogeneous and irrotational weyssenhofffluid in general relativity is performed using the 1+3 covariant approach thatenables the dynamics of the fluid to be determined without assuming anyparticular form for the space-time metric. the spin contributions to the fieldequations produce a bounce that averts an initial singularity, provided thatthe spin density exceeds the rate of shear. at later times, when the spincontribution can be neglected, a weyssenhoff fluid reduces to a standardcosmological fluid in general relativity. numerical solutions for the timeevolution of the generalised scale factor in spatially-curved models arepresented, some of which exhibit eternal oscillatory behaviour without anysingularities. in spatially-flat models, analytical solutions for particularvalues of the equation-of-state parameter are derived. although the scalefactor of a weyssenhoff fluid generically has a positive temporal curvaturenear a bounce, it requires unreasonable fine tuning of the equation-of-stateparameter to produce a sufficiently extended period of inflation to fit thecurrent observational data.

astro-ph;0001385	do wavelets really detect non-gaussianity in the 4-year cobe data?	we investigate the detection of non-gaussianity in the 4-year cobe datareported by pando, valls-gabaud &amp; fang (1998), using a technique based on thediscrete wavelet transform. their analysis was performed on the two dmr facescentred on the north and south galactic poles respectively, using thedaubechies 4 wavelet basis. we show that these results depend critically on theorientation of the data, and so should be treated with caution. for twodistinct orientations of the data, we calculate unbiased estimates of theskewness, kurtosis and scale-scale correlation of the corresponding waveletcoefficients in all of the available scale domains of the transform. we obtainseveral detections of non-gaussianity in the dmr-dsmb map at greater than the99 per cent confidence level, but most of these occur on pixel-pixel scales andare therefore not cosmological in origin. indeed, after removing all multipolesbeyond $\ell = 40$ from the cobe maps, only one robust detection remains.moreover, using monte-carlo simulations, we find that the probability ofobtaining such a detection by chance is 0.59. we repeat the analysis for the53+90 ghz coadded cobe map. in this case, after removing $\ell &gt; 40$multipoles, two non-gaussian detections at the 99 per cent level remain.nevertheless, again using monte-carlo simulations, we find that the probabilityof obtaining two such detections by chance is 0.28. thus, we conclude thewavelet technique does {\em not} yield strong evidence for non-gaussianity ofcosmological origin in the 4-year cobe data.

astro-ph;0010387	maximum-entropy reconstruction of gravitational lenses using shear  and/or magnification data	we demonstrate that the maximum-entropy method for gravitational lensreconstruction presented in bridle et al. (1998) may be applied even when onlyshear \emph{or} magnification information is present. we also demonstrate thatthe method can easily handle irregularly shaped observing fields and, becauseshear is a non-local function of the lensing mass, reconstructions that useshear information can successfully bridge small gaps in observations. for oursimulations we use a mass density distribution that is realistic for a z=0.4cluster of total mass around 10^15 h^-1 m_solar. using hst-quality shear dataalone, covering the area of four wfpc2 observations, we detect 60 per cent ofthe mass of the cluster within the area observed, despite the mass sheetdegeneracy. this is qualitatively because the shear provides information aboutthe variations in the mass distribution, and our prior includes a positivityconstraint. we investigate the effect of using various sizes of observing fieldand find that 50 to 100 per cent of the cluster mass is detected, depending onthe observing strategy and cluster shape. finally we demonstrate how thismethod can cope with strong lensing regions of a mass distribution.

astro-ph;0112396	maximum-entropy weak lens reconstruction: improved methods and  application to data	we develop the maximum-entropy weak shear mass reconstruction methodpresented in earlier papers by taking each background galaxy image shape as anindependent estimator of the reduced shear field and incorporating an intrinsicsmoothness into the reconstruction. the characteristic length scale of thissmoothing is determined by bayesian methods. within this algorithm theuncertainties due to both the intrinsic distribution of galaxy shapes andgalaxy shape estimation are carried through to the final mass reconstruction,and the mass within arbitrarily shaped apertures can be calculated withcorresponding uncertainties. we apply this method to two clusters taken fromn-body simulations using mock observations corresponding to keck lris andmosaiced hst wfpc2 fields. we demonstrate that the bayesian choice of smoothinglength is sensible and that masses within apertures (including one on afilamentary structure) are reliable, provided the field of view is not toosmall. we apply the method to data taken on the cluster ms1054-03 using thekeck lris (clowe et al. 2000) and hst (hoekstra et al. 2000), finding resultsin agreement with this previous work; we also present reconstructions withoptimal smoothing lengths, and mass estimates which do not rely on anyassumptions of circular symmetry. the code used in this work (lensent2) isavailable from the web.

astro-ph;0203259	combining cosmological datasets: hyperparameters and bayesian evidence	a method is presented for performing joint analyses of cosmological datasets,in which the weight assigned to each dataset is determined directly by it ownstatistical properties. the weights are considered in a bayesian context as aset of hyperparameters, which are then marginalised over in order to recoverthe posterior distribution as a function only of the cosmological parameters ofinterest. in the case of a gaussian likelihood function, this marginalisationmay be performed analytically. calculation of the bayesian evidence for thedata, with and without the introduction of hyperparameters, enables a directdetermination of whether the data warrant the introduction of weights into theanalysis; this generalises the standard likelihood ratio approach to modelcomparison. the method is illustrated by application to the classic toy problemof fitting a straight line to a set of data. a cosmological illustration of thetechnique is also presented, in which the latest measurements of the cosmicmicrowave background power spectrum are used to infer constraints oncosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0303246	maximum-entropy image reconstruction using wavelets	wavelet functions allow the sparse and efficient representation of a signalat different scales. recently the application of wavelets to the denoising ofmaps of cosmic microwave background (cmb) fluctuations has been proposed. themaximum-entropy method (mem) is also often used for enhancing astronomicalimages and has been applied to cmb data. in this paper, we give a systematicdiscussion of combining these two approaches by the use of the mem in waveletbases for the denoising and deconvolution of cmb maps and more general images.certain types of wavelet transforms, such as the a trous transform, can beviewed as a multi-channel intrinsic correlation function (icf). we find thatthe wavelet mem has lower reconstruction residuals than conventionalpixel-basis mem in the case when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the pointspread function narrow. furthermore, the bayesian evidence for the wavelet memreconstructions is generally higher for a wide range of images.  from a bayesian point of view, the wavelet basis thus provides a better modelof the image.

astro-ph;0307098	bayesian joint analysis of cluster weak lensing and sunyaev-zel'dovich  effect data	as the quality of the available galaxy cluster data improves, the modelsfitted to these data might be expected to become increasingly complex. here wepresent the bayesian approach to the problem of cluster data modelling:starting from simple, physically motivated parameterised functions to describethe cluster's gas density, gravitational potential and temperature, we explorethe high-dimensional parameter spaces with a markov-chain monte-carlo sampler,and compute the bayesian evidence in order to make probabilistic statementsabout the models tested. in this way sufficiently good data will enable themodels to be distinguished, enhancing our astrophysical understanding; in anycase the models may be marginalised over in the correct way when estimatingglobal, perhaps cosmological, parameters. in this work we apply thismethodology to two sets of simulated interferometric sunyaev-zel'dovich effectand gravitational weak lensing data, corresponding to current andnext-generation telescopes. we calculate the expected precision on themeasurement of the cluster gas fraction from such experiments, and investigatethe effect of the primordial cmb fluctuations on their accuracy. we find thatdata from instruments such as ami, when combined with wide-field ground-basedweak lensing data, should allow both cluster model selection and estimation ofgas fractions to a precision of better than 30 percent for a given cluster.

astro-ph;0406604	a high-significance detection of non-gaussianity in the wmap 1-year data  using directional spherical wavelets	a directional spherical wavelet analysis is performed to examine thegaussianity of the wmap 1-year data. such an analysis is facilitated by theintroduction of a fast directional continuous spherical wavelet transform. thedirectional nature of the analysis allows one to probe orientated structure inthe data. significant deviations from gaussianity are detected in the skewnessand kurtosis of spherical elliptical mexican hat and real morlet waveletcoefficients for both the wmap and tegmark et al. (2003) foreground-removedmaps. the previous non-gaussianity detection made by vielva et al. (2003) usingthe spherical symmetric mexican hat wavelet is confirmed, although theirdetection at the 99.9% significance level is only made at the 95.3%significance level using our most conservative statistical test. furthermore,deviations from gaussianity in the skewness of spherical real morlet waveletcoefficients on a wavelet scale of 550 arcmin (corresponding to an effectiveglobal size on the sky of approximately 26 degrees and an internal size of 3degrees) at an azimuthal orientation of 72 degrees, are made at the 98.3%significance level, using the same conservative method. the wavelet analysisinherently allows one to localise on the sky those regions that introduceskewness and those that introduce kurtosis. preliminary noise analysisindicates that these detected deviation regions are not atypical and haveaverage noise dispersion. further analysis is required to ascertain whetherthese detected regions correspond to secondary or instrumental effects, orwhether in fact the non-gaussianity detected is due to intrinsic primordialfluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;0503039	effect of component separation on the temperature distribution of the  cmb	we present a study of the effect of component separation on the recoveredcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature distribution, consideringgaussian and non-gaussian input cmb maps. first, we extract the cmb componentfrom simulated planck data (in small patches of the sky) using the maximumentropy method (mem), wiener filter (wf) and a method based on the subtractionof foreground templates plus a linear combination of frequency channels (lcfc).we then apply a wavelet-based method to study the gaussianity of the recoveredcmb and compare it with the same analysis for the input map. when the originalcmb map is gaussian (and assuming that point sources have been removed), wefind that none of the methods introduce non-gaussianity (ng) in the cmbreconstruction. on the contrary, if the input cmb map is non-gaussian, all thestudied methods produce a reconstructed cmb with lower detections of ng thanthe original map. this effect is mainly due to the presence of instrumentalnoise. in this case, mem tends to produce slightly higher non-gaussiandetections in the reconstructed map than wf whereas the detections are lowerfor the lcfc. we have also studied the effect of point sources in the memreconstruction. if no attempt to remove point sources is performed, theyclearly contaminate the cmb reconstruction, introducing spurious ng. when thebrightest point sources are removed from the data using the mexican hatwavelet, the gaussian character of the cmb is preserved. however, whenanalysing larger regions of the sky, the variance of our estimators will beappreciably reduced and, in this case, we expect the point source residuals tointroduce spurious ng in the cmb. thus, a careful subtraction (or masking) ofpoint source emission is crucial when studying the gaussianity of the cmb.

astro-ph;0510349	non-gaussianity detections in the bianchi viih corrected wmap 1-year  data made with directional spherical wavelets	many of the current anomalies reported in the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) 1-year data disappear after `correcting' for the best-fit embeddedbianchi type vii_h component (jaffe et al. 2005), albeit assuming no darkenergy component. we investigate the effect of this bianchi correction on thedetections of non-gaussianity in the wmap data that we previously made usingdirectional spherical wavelets (mcewen et al. 2005a). as previously discoveredby jaffe et al. (2005), the deviations from gaussianity in the kurtosis ofspherical mexican hat wavelet coefficients are eliminated once the data iscorrected for the bianchi component. this is due to the reduction of the coldspot at galactic coordinates (l,b)=(209^\circ,-57\circ), which cruz et al.(2005) claim to be the source of non-gaussianity introduced in the kurtosis.our previous detections of non-gaussianity observed in the skewness ofspherical wavelet coefficients are not reduced by the bianchi correction.indeed, the most significant detection of non-gaussianity made with thespherical real morlet wavelet at a significant level of 98.4% remains (using avery conservative method to estimate the significance). we make our code tosimulate bianchi induced temperature fluctuations publicly available.

astro-ph;0511573	a bayesian analysis of the primordial power spectrum	we present a bayesian analysis of large-scale structure and cosmic microwavebackground data to constrain the form of the primordial power spectrum. we haveextended the usual presumption of a scale invariant spectrum to include: (i) arunning spectral index; (ii) a broken spectrum arising perhaps from aninterruption of the potential driving inflation; (iii) a large scale cutoff inpower as the first year wmap results appear to indicate; (iv) a reconstructionof the spectrum in eight bins in wavenumber; and (v) a spectrum resulting froma cosmological model proposed by lasenby &amp; doran, which naturally exhibits anexponential drop in power on very large scales. the result of our completebayesian analysis includes not only the posterior probability distribution fromwhich parameter estimates are inferred but also the bayesian evidence. thisevidence value is greater for a model with fewer parameters unless a morecomplicated model provides a significantly better fit to the data, thusallowing a powerful method of model selection. we find that those modelsexhibiting any form of cutoff in power on large scales consistently producehigher evidences than either the harrison-zel'dovich or single spectral indexspectra. in particular, within the best-fit concordance cosmology, we find thelasenby &amp; doran spectrum to show significantly larger evidence as compared tothe other models.

astro-ph;0601493	a bayesian analysis of regularised source inversions in gravitational  lensing	strong gravitational lens systems with extended sources are of specialinterest because they provide additional constraints on the models of the lenssystems. to use a gravitational lens system for measuring the hubble constant,one would need to determine the lens potential and the source intensitydistribution simultaneously. a linear inversion method to reconstruct apixellated source brightness distribution of a given lens potential model wasintroduced by warren &amp; dye. in the inversion process, a regularisation on thesource intensity is often needed to ensure a successful inversion with afaithful resulting source. in this paper, we use bayesian analysis to determinethe optimal regularisation constant (strength of regularisation) of a givenform of regularisation and to objectively choose the optimal form ofregularisation given a selection of regularisations. we consider and comparequantitatively three different forms of regularisation previously described inthe literature for source inversions in gravitational lensing: zeroth-order,gradient and curvature. we use simulated data with the exact lens potential todemonstrate the method. we find that the preferred form of regularisationdepends on the nature of the source distribution.

astro-ph;0605325	markov chain monte carlo analysis of bianchi vii_h models	we have extended the analysis of jaffe et al. to a complete markov chainmonte carlo (mcmc) study of the bianchi type ${\rm vii_h}$ models including adark energy density, using 1-year and 3-year wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) cosmic microwave background (cmb) data. since we perform theanalysis in a bayesian framework our entire inference is contained in themultidimensional posterior distribution from which we can extract marginalisedparameter constraints and the comparative bayesian evidence. treating theleft-handed bianchi cmb anisotropy as a template centred upon the `cold-spot'in the southern hemisphere, the parameter estimates derived for the totalenergy density, `tightness' and vorticity from 3-year data are found to be:$\omega_{tot} = 0.43\pm 0.04$, $h = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.13}$, $\omega =9.7^{+1.6}_{-1.5}\times 10^{-10}$ with orientation $\gamma ={337^{\circ}}^{+17}_{-23}$). this template is preferred by a factor of roughlyunity in log-evidence over a concordance cosmology alone. a bianchi typetemplate is supported by the data only if its position on the sky is heavilyrestricted. the low total energy density of the preferred template, implies ageometry that is incompatible with cosmologies inferred from recent cmbobservations. jaffe et al. found that extending the bianchi model to include aterm in $\omega_{\lambda}$ creates a degeneracy in the $\omega_m -\omega_{\lambda}$ plane. we explore this region fully by mcmc and find that thedegenerate likelihood contours do not intersect areas of parameter space that 1or 3 year wmap data would prefer at any significance above $2\sigma$. thus wecan confirm that a physical bianchi ${\rm vii_h}$ model is not responsible forthis signature.

astro-ph;0607404	wmap 3-year primordial power spectrum	we constrain the form of the primordial power spectrum using wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe (wmap) 3-year cosmic microwave background (cmb) data(+ other high resolution cmb experiments) in addition to complementarylarge-scale structure (lss) data: 2df, sdss, ly-alpha forest and luminous redgalaxy (lrg) data from the sdss catalogue. we compute the comparative bayesianevidence in addition to parameter estimates for a collection of seven models:(i) a scale invariant harrison-zel'dovich (h-z) spectrum; (ii) a power-law;(iii) a running spectral index; (iv) a broken spectrum; (v) a power-law with anabrupt cutoff on large-scales; (vi) a reconstruction of the spectrum in eightbins in wavenumber; and (vii) a spectrum resulting from a cosmological modelproposed by lasenby &amp; doran (l-d). using a basic dataset of wmap3 + other cmb +2df + sdss our analysis confirms that a scale-invariant spectrum is disfavouredby between 0.7 and 1.7 units of log evidence (depending on priors chosen) whencompared with a power-law tilt. moreover a running spectrum is nowsignificantly preferred, but only when using the most constraining set ofpriors. the addition of ly-alpha and lrg data independently both suggest muchlower values of the running index than with basic dataset alone andinterestingly the inclusion of ly-alpha significantly disfavours a runningparameterisation by more than a unit in log evidence. overall the highestevidences, over all datasets, were obtained with a power law spectrumcontaining a cutoff with a significant log evidence difference of roughly 2units. the natural tilt and exponential cutoff present in the l-d spectrum isfound to be favoured decisively by a log evidence difference of over 5 units,but only for a limited study within the best-fit concordance cosmology.

astro-ph;0608174	fast cosmological parameter estimation using neural networks	we present a method for accelerating the calculation of cmb power spectra,matter power spectra and likelihood functions for use in cosmological parameterestimation. the algorithm, called cosmonet, is based on training a multilayerperceptron neural network and shares all the advantages of the recentlyreleased pico algorithm of fendt &amp; wandelt, but has several additional benefitsin terms of simplicity, computational speed, memory requirements and ease oftraining. we demonstrate the capabilities of cosmonet by computing cmb powerspectra over a box in the parameter space of flat \lambda cdm models containingthe 3\sigma wmap1 confidence region. we also use cosmonet to compute the wmap3likelihood for flat \lambda cdm models and show that marginalised posteriors onparameters derived are very similar to those obtained using camb and the wmap3code. we find that the average error in the power spectra is typically 2-3% ofcosmic variance, and that cosmonet is \sim 7 \times 10^4 faster than camb (forflat models) and \sim 6 \times 10^6 times faster than the official wmap3likelihood code. cosmonet and an interface to cosmomc are publically availableat www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/cosmonet.

astro-ph;0701867	efficient bayesian inference for multimodal problems in cosmology	bayesian model selection provides the cosmologist with an exacting tool todistinguish between competing models based purely on the data, via the bayesianevidence. previous methods to calculate this quantity either lacked generalapplicability or were computationally demanding. however, nested sampling(skilling 2004), which was recently applied successfully to cosmology bymuhkerjee et al. 2006, overcomes both of these impediments. theirimplementation restricts the parameter space sampled, and thus improves theefficiency, using a decreasing ellipsoidal bound in the n-dimensional parameterspace centred on the maximum likelihood point. however, if the likelihoodfunction contains any multi-modality, then the ellipse is prevented fromconstraining the sampling region efficiently. in this paper we introduce amethod of clustered ellipsoidal nested sampling which can form multipleellipses around each individual peak in the likelihood.  in addition we have implemented a method for determining the expectation andvariance of the final evidence value without the need to use sampling errorfrom repetitions of the algorithm ; this further reduces the computational loadby at least an order of magnitude. we have applied our algorithm to a pair oftoy models and one cosmological example where we demonstrate that the number oflikelihood evaluations required is ~ 4% of that necessary for using previousalgorithms.  we have produced a fortran library containing our routines which can becalled from any sampling code, in addition for convenience we have incorporatedit into the popular cosmomc code as cosmoclust. both are available for downloadat http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/cosmoclust .

astro-ph;9610105	ideal scales for weighing the universe	we investigate the performance of a large class of cosmic microwavebackground experiments with respect to their ability to measure variouscosmological parameters. we pay special attention to the measurement of thetotal cosmological density, $\omega$. we consider interferometer experiments,all-sky single-dish experiments, and also single-dish experiments with adeep-patch technique. power spectrum estimates for these experiments arestudied, and their induced errors in cosmological parameter estimatesevaluated. given this motivation we find various promising corners in theexperiment parameter space surveyed. low noise all-sky satellite experimentsare the expensive option, but they are best suited for dealing with large setsof cosmological parameters. at intermediate noises we find a useful corner inhigh-resolution deep patch single-dish experiments. interferometers are limitedby sample variance, but provide the best estimates based on the very smallangular scales. for all these experiments we present conservative, but stillpromising estimates of the accuracy of the measurement of $\omega$. in theseestimates we consider a variety of possible signals not necessarily in thevicinity of standard cold dark matter.

astro-ph;9802109	joint estimation of cosmological parameters from cmb and iras data	observations of large scale structure (lss) and the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) each place separate constraints on the values of cosmologicalparameters. we calculate a joint likelihood based on various cmb experimentsand the iras 1.2jy galaxy redshift survey and use this to find an overalloptimum with respect to the free parameters. our formulation self-consistentlytakes account of the underlying mass distribution, which affects both the cmbpotential fluctuations and the iras redshift distortion. this not only allowsmore accurate parameter estimation, but also removes the parameter degeneracywhich handicaps calculations based on either approach alone. the family of colddark matter (cdm) models analysed corresponds to a spatially-flat universe withan initially scale-invariant spectrum and a cosmological constant. freeparameters in the joint model are the mass density due to all matter (omega_m),hubble's parameter (h = h_0 / 100km/s mpc^-1), the quadrupole normalisation ofthe cmb power spectrum (q) in uk, and the iras light-to-mass bias (b_i).throughout the analysis, the baryonic density (omega_b) is required is tosatisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint omega_b h^2 = 0.024. results from thetwo data sets show good agreement, and the joint optimum lies at omega_m=0.39,h=0.53, q=16.96uk, and b_i=1.21. the 68 per cent confidence intervals are:0.29&lt;omega_m&lt;0.53, 0.39&lt;h&lt;0.58, 15.34&lt;q&lt;17.60, and 0.98&lt;b_i&lt;1.56. for the aboveparameters the normalisation and shape of the mass power-spectrum aresigma_8=0.67 and gamma=0.15, and the age of the universe is 16.5gyr.

0809.3437	multinest: an efficient and robust bayesian inference tool for cosmology  and particle physics	we present further development and the first public release of our multimodalnested sampling algorithm, called multinest. this bayesian inference toolcalculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and producesposterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes andpronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. the developmentspresented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiencyand robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in feroz &amp;hobson (2008), which itself significantly outperformed existing mcmc techniquesin a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. the accuracy and economyof the multinest algorithm is demonstrated by application to two toy problemsand to a cosmological inference problem focussing on the extension of thevanilla $\lambda$cdm model to include spatial curvature and a varying equationof state for dark energy. the multinest software, which is fully parallelizedusing mpi and includes an interface to cosmomc, is available athttp://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. it will also be released as partof the superbayes package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories ofparticle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org

astro-ph;9903472	cosmological parameters from cluster abundances, cmb and iras	we combine information on cosmological parameters from cluster abundances,cmb primordial anisotropies and the iras 1.2 jy galaxy redshift survey. we takeas free parameters the present values of the total matter density of theuniverse, omega_m, the hubble parameter, h, sigma_8, and the iras biasingfactor, b_iras. we assume that the universe is spatially flat, with acosmological constant, and that structure formed from adiabatic initialfluctuations with a harrison-zel'dovich power spectrum. the nucleosynthesisvalue omega_b=0.019/h^2 is adopted. we use the full three- and four-dimensional likelihood functions for each data set and marginalise these totwo- and one- dimensional distributions in a bayesian way, integrating over theother parameters. it is shown that the three data sets are in excellentagreement, with a best fit point of omega_m= 1-omega_lambda=0.36, h=0.54,sigma_8=0.74, and b_iras=1.08. this point is within one sigma of the minimumfor each data set alone. pairs of these data sets have their degeneracies insufficiently different directions that using only two data sets at a time issufficient to place good constraints on the cosmological parameters. we showthat the results from each of the three possible pairings of the data are alsoin good agreement. finally, we combine all three data sets to obtainmarginalised 68 per cent confidence intervals of 0.30&lt;omega_m&lt;0.43,0.48&lt;h&lt;0.59, 0.69&lt;sigma_8&lt;0.79, and 1.01&lt;b_iras&lt;1.16. for the best fitparameters the cmb quadrupole is q_rms-ps=18.0 uk, gamma=0.15, omega_b=0.066and the age of the universe is 16.7 gyr.

0809.3792	the impact of priors and observables on parameter inferences in the  constrained mssm	we use a newly released version of the superbayes code to analyze the impactof the choice of priors and the influence of various constraints on thestatistical conclusions for the preferred values of the parameters of theconstrained mssm. we assess the effect in a bayesian framework and compare itwith an alternative likelihood-based measure of a profile likelihood. we employa new scanning algorithm (multinest) which increases the computationalefficiency by a factor ~200 with respect to previously used techniques. wedemonstrate that the currently available data are not yet sufficientlyconstraining to allow one to determine the preferred values of cmssm parametersin a way that is completely independent of the choice of priors and statisticalmeasures. while b-&gt;s gamma generally favors large m_0, this is in some contrastwith the preference for low values of m_0 and m_1/2 that is almost entirely aconsequence of a combination of prior effects and a single constraint comingfrom the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which remains somewhatcontroversial. using an information-theoretical measure, we find that thecosmological dark matter abundance determination provides at least 80% of thetotal constraining power of all available observables. despite the remaininguncertainties, prospects for direct detection in the cmssm remain excellent,with the spin-independent neutralino-proton cross section almost guaranteedabove sigma_si ~ 10^{-10} pb, independently of the choice of priors orstatistics. likewise, gluino and lightest higgs discovery at the lhc remainhighly encouraging. while in this work we have used the cmssm as particlephysics model, our formalism and scanning technique can be readily applied to awider class of models with several free parameters.

astro-ph;9904415	detection of cosmic microwave background structure in a second field  with the cosmic anisotropy telescope	we describe observations at frequencies near 15 ghz of the second 2x2 degreefield imaged with the cambridge cosmic anisotropy telescope (cat). after theremoval of discrete radio sources, structure is detected in the images oncharacteristic scales of about half a degree, corresponding to sphericalharmonic multipoles in the approximate range l= 330--680. a bayesian analysisconfirms that the signal arises predominantly from the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) radiation for multipoles in the lower half of this range; theaverage broad-band power in a bin with centroid l=422 (theta = 51') isestimated to be delta_t/t=2.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5} x 10^{-5}. for multipoles centredon l=615 (theta =35'), we find contamination from galactic emission issignificant, and constrain the cmb contribution to the measured power in thisbin to be delta_t/t &lt;2.0 x 10^{-5} (1-sigma upper limit). these new results areconsistent with the first detection made by cat in a completely different areaof sky. together with data from other experiments, this new cat detection addsweight to earlier evidence from cat for a downturn in the cmb power spectrum onscales smaller than 1 degree. improved limits on the values of h_0 and omegaare determined using the new cat data.

0811.1199	bayesian modelling of clusters of galaxies from multi-frequency pointed  sunyaev--zel'dovich observations	we present a bayesian approach to modelling galaxy clusters usingmulti-frequency pointed observations from telescopes that exploit thesunyaev--zel'dovich effect. we use the recently developed multinest technique(feroz, hobson &amp; bridges, 2008) to explore the high-dimensional parameterspaces and also to calculate the bayesian evidence. this permits robustparameter estimation as well as model comparison. tests on simulated arcminutemicrokelvin imager observations of a cluster, in the presence of primary cmbsignal, radio point sources (detected as well as an unresolved background) andreceiver noise, show that our algorithm is able to analyse jointly the datafrom six frequency channels, sample the posterior space of the model andcalculate the bayesian evidence very efficiently on a single processor. we alsoillustrate the robustness of our detection process by applying it to a fieldwith radio sources and primordial cmb but no cluster, and show that indeed nocluster is identified. the extension of our methodology to the detection andmodelling of multiple clusters in multi-frequency sz survey data will bedescribed in a future work.

0812.3541	bayesian optimal reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum	the form of the primordial power spectrum has the potential to differentiatestrongly between competing models of perturbation generation in the earlyuniverse and so is of considerable importance. the recent release of five yearsof wmap observations have confirmed the general picture of the primordial powerspectrum as deviating slightly from scale invariance with a spectral tiltparameter of n_s ~ 0.96. nonetheless, many attempts have been made to isolatefurther features such as breaks and cutoffs using a variety of methods, someemploying more than ~ 10 varying parameters. in this paper we apply the robusttechnique of bayesian model selection to reconstruct the optimal degree ofstructure in the spectrum. we model the spectrum simply and generically aspiecewise linear in ln k between `nodes' in k-space whose amplitudes areallowed to vary. the number of nodes and their k-space positions are chosen bythe bayesian evidence so that we can identify both the complexity and locationof any detected features. our optimal reconstruction contains, perhaps,surprisingly few features, the data preferring just three nodes. thisreconstruction allows for a degree of scale dependence of the tilt with the`turn-over' scale occuring around k ~ 0.016 mpc^{-1}. more structure ispenalised by the evidence as over-fitting the data, so there is currentlylittle point in attempting reconstructions that are more complex.
