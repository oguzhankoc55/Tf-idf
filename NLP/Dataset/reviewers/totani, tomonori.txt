hep-ph;9609241	effects of neutrino oscillation on the supernova relic neutrino  background	we investigate to what extent the oscillation or conversion of neutrinosenhances the expected event rate of the supernova relic neutrino background(srn) at the super-kamiokande detector (sk). the srn \bar\nu_e's can be almostcompletely exchanged with \nu_\mu-like neutrinos by the msw oscillation underthe inverse mass hierarchy with \delta m^2 ~ 10^{-8}--10^5 [ev^2], or by themagnetic moment of majorana neutrinos with \mu_\nu &gt;~ 10^{-12} \mu_b and \deltam^2 ~ 10^{-4}--10^0 [ev^2]. in the standard calculation of the srn flux, theevent rate of the srn \bar\nu_e's at the sk in the observable energy range of15--40 mev can be enhanced from 1.2 yr^{-1} to 2.4 yr^{-1} if all \bar\nu_e'sare exchanged with \nu_\mu-like neutrinos. the enhancement is prominentespecially in the high energy range (\gtilde 25 mev). in the astrophysicallyoptimistic calculation, the event rate becomes as high as 9.4 yr^{-1}. becausethe theoretical upper bound of the srn events without oscillation is about 5yr^{-1} taking account of the various astrophysical uncertainties, we mighthave to resort to the neutrino oscillation if more than 5 events in a year, aswell as a significantly harder spectrum, were observed in the sk.

0902.2064	photometric h alpha and [o ii] luminosity function of sdf and sxdf  galaxies: implications for future baryon oscillation surveys	efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z &gt; 1 by photometricinformation in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopicsurveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)signature. here we estimate the h alpha and [o ii] line luminosity functions ofgalaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imagingdata is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formationrates. these photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift usethe large data sets of the subaru deep field and subaru xmm-newton deep field(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of thelocal sloan digital sky survey galaxies. the derived luminosity functions(especially h alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates basedon spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. this dataset is useful forexamining the photometric selection of target galaxies for bao surveys becauseof the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies withdetailed photometric information. we use the sample to derive the photometricand physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for futurespectroscopic bao surveys. we also show some examples of photometric selectionprocedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.

0902.2882	lyman alpha emitters in hierarchical galaxy formation ii. uv continuum  luminosity function and equivalent width distribution	we present theoretical predictions of uv continuum luminosity function (uvlf) and lya equivalent width (ew) distribution of lyman alpha emitters (laes)in the framework of the hierarchical clustering model of galaxy formation. themodel parameters about laes were determined by fitting to the observed lya lfat z=5.7 in our previous study, and the fit indicates that extinction of lyaphotons by dust is significantly less effective than that of uv continuumphotons, implying clumpy dust distribution in interstellar medium. we thencompare the predictions about uv lfs and ew distributions with a variety ofobservations at z ~ 3-6, allowing no more free parameters and paying carefulattention to the selection conditions of laes in each survey. we find that thepredicted uv lfs and ew distributions are in nice agreement with observed data,and especially, our model naturally reproduces the existence of large ew laes(&gt; 240 a) without introducing pop iii stars or top-heavy initial mass function.we show that both the stellar population (young age and low metallicity) andextinction by clumpy dust are the keys to reproduce large ew laes. the evidenceof ew enhancement by clumpy dust is further strengthened by the quantitativeagreement between our model and recent observations about a positivecorrelation between ew and extinction. the observed trend that brighter laes inuv continuum tend to have smaller mean ew is also reproduced, and the clumpydust is playing an important role again for this trend. we suggested in ourprevious study that the transmission of intergalactic medium for lya emissionrapidly decreases from z ~ 6 to 7 by the fitting to lya lfs, and this evidenceis quantitatively strengthened by the comparison with the uv lf and ewdistribution at z ~ 6.6.

0706.2783	intracluster short gamma-ray bursts by compact binary mergers	one of the possible origins of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) is merging ofcompact binaries, and the effect of large kick velocity is a signature that canbe used as an observational test for this hypothesis. intracluster sgrbs thatescaped from a host galaxy in a galaxy cluster are interesting in this context,since they would escape more easily by cluster tidal force, and would havebrighter afterglow luminosity by dense intracluster gas, than those in generalfield galaxies. here we calculate the escape fraction of compact binaries fromtheir host galaxies in a galaxy cluster, and discuss some observationalimplications. we found that the escape fraction strongly depends on the natureof dark matter subhalos associated with member galaxies. if the amount of darkmatter around member galaxies is not large and the gravitational potential foran escaping binary is determined mostly by stellar mass, most of sgrbs shouldescape and be observed as hostless, which is a much higher fraction than thosein the field. hence, statistics of intracluster sgrbs could give importantinformation about the dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, as well ashints for the origin of sgrbs.

0905.1525	probing the long gamma-ray burst progenitor by lyman-alpha emission of  host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been suggested to occur preferentially inlow metallicity environment. we discuss the possibility and theoretical aspectsof using lyman alpha emission properties of long grb host galaxies as ametallicity indicator of high redshift grb environments, where directmetallicity measurements are not easy. we propose to use the fraction ofly-alpha emitters (laes) in long grb host galaxies as a function of uvluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted laefraction of lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicitydependence. there are two important effects of metallicity dependence of longgrb rate to change the lae fraction of host galaxies. one is the enhancement ofintrinsic ly-alpha equivalent width (ew) by stronger ionizing uv luminosity oflow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellardust to change the observable ew. based on a latest theoretical model of laesthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in theopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease lae fraction if grbspreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpyinter-stellar medium effect. the high lae fraction of grb host galaxiesindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the lae model ifgrbs occur when z &lt; 0.1z_sun, although this result is still indicative becauseof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties. this resultdemonstrates that the lae statistics of grb hosts may give us usefulinformation in the future.

0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

0707.1561	the reionization and galaxy evolution probed by z=7 lyman alpha emitters	we made a narrowband nb973 (bandwidth of 200a at 9755a) imaging of the subarudeep field (sdf) and found two z=7 lyman alpha emitter (lae) candidates down tonb973=24.9. carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy, we identified one of themas a real z=6.96 lae. this has shown that galaxy formation was in progress just750 myr after the big bang. meanwhile, the lyman alpha line luminosity functionof lae is known to decline from z=5.7 to 6.6 in the sdf. l* at z=6.6 is 40-60%of that at z=5.7. we also confirm that the number density of z=7 lae is only17% of the density at z=6.6 comparing the latest sdf lae samples. this seriesof significant decreases in lae density with increasing redshift can be theresult of galaxy evolution during these epochs. however, using the uv continuumluminosity functions of laes, those of lyman break galaxies, and a laeevolution model based on the hierarchical clustering, we find that galaxyevolution alone cannot explain all the decrease in density. this extra densitydeficit can be interpreted as the attenuation of the lyman alpha photons fromlaes due to a rapid evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction during the ongoingcosmic reionization at z~6.6-7.

1001.0103	the cosmological evolution of blazars and the extragalactic gamma-ray  background in the fermi era	the latest determination of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (egrb)radiation by fermi is compared with the theoretical prediction of the blazarcomponent by inoue &amp; totani (2009; hereafter it09). the fermi egrb spectrum isin excellent agreement with it09, indicating that blazars are the dominantcomponent of the egrb, and contributions from any other sources (e.g., darkmatter annihilations) are minor. it also indicates that the blazar sed(spectral energy distribution) sequence taken into account in it09 is a validdescription of mean blazar seds. the possible contribution of mev blazars tothe egrb in the mev band is also discussed. in five total years ofobservations, we predict that fermi will detect ~1200 blazars all sky down tothe corresponding sensitivity limit. we also address the detectability of thehighest-redshift blazars. updating our model with regard to high-redshiftevolution based on sdss quasar data, we show that fermi may find some blazarsup to z~6 during the five-year survey. such blazars could provide a new probeof early star and galaxy formation through gev spectral attenuation signaturesinduced by high-redshift uv background radiation.

1005.1390	contribution from star-forming galaxies to the cosmic gamma-ray  background radiation	we present a new theoretical calculation of the contribution to theextragalactic gamma-ray background radiation (egrb) from star-forming galaxies,based on a state-of-the-art model of hierarchical galaxy formation that is inquantitative agreement with a variety of observations of local andhigh-redshift galaxies. gamma-ray luminosity ($l_\gamma$) and spectrum ofgalaxies are related to star formation rate ($\psi$), gas mass ($m_gas$), andstar formation mode (quiescent or starburst) of model galaxies using latestobserved data of nearby galaxies. we try the two limiting cases about gamma-rayproduction: the escape limit ($l_\gamma \propto \psi m_gas$) and thecalorimetric limit ($l_\gamma \propto \psi$), and our standard model predicts 7and 4% contribution from star-forming galaxies to the total egrb flux(including bright resolved sources) recently reported by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope. systematic uncertainties do not allow us to determine the egrbflux better than by a factor of ~2. the predicted number of nearby galaxiesdetectable by fermi is consistent with the observation. intergalacticabsorption by pair-production attenuates the egrb flux only by a modest factorof ~1.3 at the highest fermi energy band, and the reprocessed cascade emissiondoes not significantly alter egrb at lower photon energies. the sum of theknown contributions from agns and star-forming galaxies can explain a largepart of egrb, with a remarkable agreement between the predicted model spectrumand observation.

1006.5033	luminosity distribution of gamma-ray burst host galaxies at redshift z=1  in cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations: implications for  the metallicity dependence of grbs	we study the relationship between the metallicity of gamma-ray burst (grb)progenitors and the probability distribution function (pdf) of grb hostgalaxies as a function of luminosity using cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of galaxy formation. we impose a maximum limit to the gasmetallicity in which grbs can occur, and examine how the predicted luminositypdf of grb host galaxies changes in the simulation. we perform thekolmogorov-smirnov test, and show that the result from our simulation agreeswith the observed luminosity pdf of core-collapse supernovae (sne) hostgalaxies when we assume that the core-collapse sne trace star formation. whenwe assume that grbs occur only in a low-metallicity environment with $z\lesssim0.1 \zsun$, grbs occur in lower luminosity galaxies, and the simulatedluminosity pdf becomes quantitatively consistent with the observed luminositypdf. the observational bias against the host galaxies of optically dark grbsowing to dust extinction may be another reason for the lower luminosities ofgrb host galaxies, but the observed luminosity pdf of grb host galaxies cannotbe reproduced solely by the dust bias in our simulation.

1008.4842	lyman alpha emitters at z=7 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field:  photometric candidates and luminosity function	we conducted a deep narrowband nb973 (fwhm = 200 a centered at 9755 a) surveyof z=7 lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field,using the fully depleted ccds newly installed on the subaru telescopesuprime-cam, which is twice more sensitive to z=7 lyman alpha at ~ 1 micronthan the previous ccds. reaching the depth 0.5 magnitude deeper than ourprevious survey in the subaru deep field that led to the discovery of a z=6.96lae, we detected three probable z=7 lae candidates. even if all the candidatesare real, the lyman alpha luminosity function (lf) at z=7 shows a significantdeficit from the lf at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. the lae number andlyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those atz=5.7 to the lyman alpha line luminosity limit of l(ly-alpha) &gt;~ 9.2 x 10^{42}erg s^{-1}. this could be due to evolution of the lae population at theseepochs as a recent galaxy evolution model predicts that the lae modestlyevolves from z=5.7 to 7. however, even after correcting for this effect ofgalaxy evolution on the decrease in lae number density, the z=7 lyman alpha lfstill shows a deficit from z=5.7 lf. this might reflect the attenuation oflyman alpha emission by neutral hydrogen remaining at the epoch of reionizationand suggests that reionization of the universe might not be complete yet atz=7. if we attribute the density deficit to reionization, the intergalacticmedium (igm) transmission for lyman alpha photons at z=7 would be 0.4 &lt;=t_{ly-alpha}^{igm} &lt;= 1, supporting the possible higher neutral fraction at theearlier epochs at z &gt; 6 suggested by the previous surveys of z=5.7-7 laes, z ~6 quasars and z &gt; 6 gamma-ray bursts.

1103.5402	infrared spectral energy distribution of galaxies in the akari all sky  survey: correlations with galaxy properties, and their physical origin	we have studied the properties of more than 1600 low-redshift galaxies byutilizing high-quality infrared flux measurements of the akari all-sky surveyand physical quantities based on optical and 21-cm observations. our goal is tounderstand the physics determining the infrared spectral energy distribution(sed). the ratio of the total infrared luminosity l_tir, to the star-formationrate (sfr) is tightly correlated by a power-law to specific sfr (ssfr), andl_tir is a good sfr indicator only for galaxies with the largest ssfr. wediscovered a tight linear correlation for normal galaxies between the radiationfield strength of dust heating, estimated by infrared sed fits (u_h), and thatof galactic-scale infrared emission (u_tir ~ l_tir/r^2), where r is the opticalsize of a galaxy. the dispersion of u_h along this relation is 0.3 dex,corresponding to 13% dispersion in the dust temperature. this scaling and theu_h/u_tir ratio can be explained physically by a thin layer of heating sourcesembedded in a thicker, optically-thick dust screen. the data also indicate thatthe heated fraction of the total dust mass is anti-correlated to the dustcolumn density, supporting this interpretation. in the large u_tir limit, thedata of circumnuclear starbursts indicate the existence of an upper limit onu_h, corresponding to the maximum sfr per gas mass of ~ 10 gyr^{-1}. we findthat the number of galaxies sharply drops when they become optically thinagainst dust-heating radiation, suggesting that a feedback process to galaxyformation (likely by the photoelectric heating) is working when dust-heatingradiation is not self-shielded on a galactic scale. implications are discussedfor the m_hi-size relation, the kennicutt-schmidt relation, and galaxyformation in the cosmological context.

0709.3877	the cosmic mev gamma-ray background and hard x-ray spectra of active  galactic nuclei: implications for the origin of hot agn coronae	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation at 1-10 mev isstill unknown. although the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) up to a few hundredskev can be accounted for by the sum of active galactic nuclei (agns), currentmodels of agn spectra cannot explain the background spectrum beyond ~1 mev,because of the thermal exponential cutoff of electron energy distributionassumed in the models. here we construct a new spectral model by calculatingthe comptonization process including nonthermal electrons, which are expectedto exist in an agn hot corona if it is heated by magnetic reconnections. weshow that the mev background spectrum can nicely be explained by our model,when coronal electrons have a nonthermal power-law component whose total energyis a few percent of the thermal component and whose spectral index is d(lnn_e)/d(ln e_e) ~ -4. although the mev gamma-ray flux from such a component innearby agn spectra is below the detection limit of past observations, it couldbe detected by planned future mev detectors. we point out that the amount ofthe nonthermal component and its electron index are similar to those found forelectrons accelerated by magnetic reconnections in solar flares and the earthmagnetosphere, giving a support to the reconnection hypothesis for the originof hot agn coronae.

1307.4985	cosmological fast radio bursts from binary neutron star mergers	fast radio bursts (frbs) at cosmological distances have recently beendiscovered, whose duration is about milliseconds. we argue that the observedshort duration is difficult to explain by giant flares of soft gamma-rayrepeaters, though their event rate and energetics are consistent with frbs.here we discuss binary neutron star (ns-ns) mergers as a possible origin offrbs. the frb rate is within the plausible range of ns-ns merger rate and itscosmological evolution, while a large fraction of ns-ns mergers must produceobservable frbs. a likely radiation mechanism is coherent radio emission likeradio pulsars, by magnetic braking when magnetic fields of neutron stars aresynchronized to binary rotation at the time of coalescence. magnetic fields ofthe standard strength (~ 10^{12-13} g) can explain the observed frb fluxes, ifthe conversion efficiency from magnetic braking energy loss to radio emissionis similar to that of isolated radio pulsars. corresponding gamma-ray emissionis difficult to detect by current or past gamma-ray burst satellites. sincefrbs tell us the exact time of mergers, a correlated search would significantlyimprove the effective sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.

1308.6087	on the systematic errors of cosmological-scale gravity tests using  redshift space distortion: non-linear effects and the halo bias	redshift space distortion (rsd) observed in galaxy redshift surveys is apowerful tool to test gravity theories on cosmological scales, but thesystematic uncertainties must carefully be examined for future surveys withlarge statistics. here we employ various analytic models of rsd and estimatethe systematic errors on measurements of the structure growth-rate parameter,$f\sigma_8$, induced by non-linear effects and the halo bias with respect tothe dark matter distribution, by using halo catalogues from 40 realisations of$3.4 \times 10^8$ comoving $h^{-3}$mpc$^3$ cosmological n-body simulations. weconsider hypothetical redshift surveys at redshifts z=0.5, 1.35 and 2, anddifferent minimum halo mass thresholds in the range of $5.0 \times 10^{11}$ --$2.0 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} m_\odot$. we find that the systematic error of$f\sigma_8$ is greatly reduced to ~5 per cent level, when a recently proposedanalytical formula of rsd that takes into account the higher-order couplingbetween the density and velocity fields is adopted, with a scale-dependentparametric bias model. dependence of the systematic error on the halo mass, theredshift, and the maximum wavenumber used in the analysis is discussed. we alsofind that the wilson-hilferty transformation is useful to improve the accuracyof likelihood analysis when only a small number of modes are available in powerspectrum measurements.

1312.3934	probing intergalactic neutral hydrogen by the lyman alpha red damping  wing of gamma-ray burst 130606a afterglow spectrum at z = 5.913	the unprecedentedly bright optical afterglow of grb 130606a located by swiftat a redshift close to the reionization era (z = 5.913) provides a newopportunity to probe the ionization status of intergalactic medium (igm). herewe present an analysis of the red ly alpha damping wing of the afterglowspectrum taken by subaru/focas during 10.4-13.2 hr after the burst. we findthat the minimal model including only the baseline power-law and hi absorptionin the host galaxy does not give a good fit, leaving residuals showing concavecurvature in 8400-8900 a with an amplitude of about 0.6% of the flux. such acurvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either byextinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature ofafterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observedspectrum. the red damping wing by intervening hi gas outside the host canreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance. we find that adamped ly alpha system is not favored as the origin of this intervening hiabsorption, from the observed ly beta and metal absorption features. thereforeabsorption by diffuse igm remains as a plausible explanation. a fit by a simpleuniform igm model requires hi neutral fraction of f_hi ~ 0.1-0.5 depending onthe distance to the grb host, implying high f_hi igm associated with theobserved dark gunn-peterson (gp) troughs. this gives a new evidence that thereionization is not yet complete at z ~ 6.

1402.0075	galaxy luminosity function and its cosmological evolution: testing a new  feedback model depending on galaxy-scale dust opacity	we present a new version of a semi-analytic model of cosmological galaxyformation, incorporating a star formation law with a feedback depending on thegalaxy-scale mean dust opacity and metallicity, motivated by recentobservations of star formation in nearby galaxies and theoreticalconsiderations. this new model is used to investigate the effect of such afeedback on shaping the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution. starformation activity is significantly suppressed in dwarf galaxies by the newfeedback effect, and the faint-end slope of local luminosity functions can bereproduced with a reasonable strength of supernova feedback, which is incontrast to the previous models that require a rather extreme strength ofsupernova feedback. our model can also reproduce the early appearance ofmassive galaxies manifested in the bright-end of high redshift k-bandluminosity functions. though some of the previous models also succeeded inreproducing this, they assumed a star formation law depending on thegalaxy-scale dynamical time, which is not supported by observations. we arguethat the feedback depending on dust opacity (or metal column density) isessential, rather than that simply depending on gas column density, to getthese results.

1405.6198	field: an automated emission-line detection software for subaru/fmos  near-infrared spectroscopy	we describe the development of automated emission line detection software forthe fiber multi-object spectrograph (fmos), which is a near-infraredspectrograph fed by $400$ fibers from the $0.2$ deg$^2$ prime focus field ofview of the subaru telescope. the software, field (fmos software forimage-based emission line detection), is developed and tested mainly for thefastsound survey, which is targeting h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at $z \sim1.3$ to measure the redshift space distortion as a test of general relativitybeyond $z \sim 1$. the basic algorithm is to calculate the line signal-to-noiseratio ($s/n$) along the wavelength direction, given by a 2-d convolution of thespectral image and a detection kernel representing a typical emission lineprofile. a unique feature of fmos is its use of oh airglow suppression masks,requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around the maskregions. bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic-rays areefficiently removed by using the information obtained from the fmos analysispipeline. we limit the range of acceptable line-shape parameters for thedetected candidates to further improve the reliability of line detection. thefinal performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the fastsounddata; the false detection rate of spurious objects is examined by usinginverted frames obtained by exchanging object and sky frames. the falsedetection rate is $&lt; 1$\% at $s/n &gt; 5$, allowing an efficient and objectiveemission line search for fmos data at the line flux level of $\gtrsim 1.0\times 10^{-16}$[erg/cm$^2$/s].

1407.1088	unveiling the origin of fast radio bursts by optical follow up  observations	we discuss how we can detect and identify counterparts of fast radio bursts(frbs) in future optical follow up observations of frbs if real-time alert offrbs becomes available. we consider kilonovae as candidates of frb opticalcounterparts, as expected in the case that frbs originate from mergers ofdouble neutron star binaries. although theoretical predictions on luminositiesof kilonovae are still highly uncertain, recent models suggest that kilonovaecan be detected at redshifts up to z $\sim$ 0.3 within the range of theuncertainties. we expect $\sim$ 1--5 unrelated supernovae (sne) down to asimilar variability magnitude in 5 days interval within the typical errorradius of a frb. we show that, however, a kilonova can be distinguished fromthese sne by its rapid decay and/or color evolution, making it possible toverify the existence of a kilonova associated with a frb. we also discuss thecase that sne ia are frb optical counterparts, as it might be if frbs originatefrom double white dwarf binaries. verification of this scenario is alsopossible, since the chance probability of finding a sne ia having consistentexplosion time with that of a frb within the frb error region is small(typically $\lesssim$ 0.01).

0804.0909	delay time distribution measurement of type ia supernovae by the  subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and implications for the progenitor	the delay time distribution (dtd) of type ia supernovae (sne ia) from starformation is an important clue to reveal the still unknown progenitor system ofsne ia. here we report on a measurement of the sn ia dtd in a delay time rangeof t_ia = 0.1-8.0 gyr by using the faint variable objects detected in thesubaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) down to i' ~ 25.5. we select 65 sncandidates showing significant spatial offset from nuclei of the host galaxieshaving old stellar population at z ~ 0.4-1.2, out of more than 1,000 sxdsvariable objects. although spectroscopic type classification is not availablefor these, we quantitatively demonstrate that more than ~80% of these should besne ia. the dtd is derived using the stellar age estimates of the old galaxiesbased on 9 band photometries from optical to mid-infrared wavelength. combinedwith the observed sn ia rate in elliptical galaxies at the local universe, thedtd in t_ia ~ 0.1-10 gyr is well described by a featureless power-law asf_d(t_ia) \propto t_ia^{-1}. the derived dtd is in excellent agreement with thegeneric prediction of the double-degenerate scenario, giving a strong supportto this scenario. in the single-degenerate (sd) scenario, although predictionsby simple analytic formulations have broad dtd shapes that are similar to theobservation, dtd shapes calculated by more detailed binary population synthesistend to have strong peaks at characteristic time scales, which do not fit theobservation. this result thus indicates either that the sd channel is not themajor contributor to sne ia in old stellar population, or that improvement ofbinary population synthesis theory is required. various sources of systematicuncertainties are examined and tested, but our main conclusions are notaffected significantly.

1502.01776	metal enrichment in the fermi bubbles as a probe of their origin	the fermi bubbles are gigantic gamma-ray structures in our galaxy. thephysical origin of the bubbles is still under debate. the leading scenarios canbe divided into two categories. one is the nuclear star forming activitysimilar to extragalactic starburst galaxies and the other is the past activegalactic nucleus (agn) like activity of the galactic center supermassive blackhole. in this paper, we propose that metal abundance measurements will providean important clue to probe their origin. based on a simple sphericallysymmetric bubble model, we find that the generated metallicity and abundancepattern of the bubbles' gas strongly depend on assumed star formation or agnactivities. star formation scenarios predict higher metallicities and abundanceratios of [o/fe] and [ne/fe] than agn scenarios do because of supernovaeejecta. furthermore, the resultant abundance depends on the gamma-ray emissionprocess because different mass injection histories are required for thedifferent gamma-ray emission processes due to the acceleration and cooling timescales of non-thermal particles. future x-ray missions such as astro-h andathena will give a clue to probe the origin of the bubbles through abundancemeasurements with their high energy resolution instruments.

astro-ph;0004264	unavoidable selection effects in the analysis of faint galaxies in the  hubble deep field: probing the cosmology and merger history of galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the number count and photometricredshift distribution of faint galaxies in the hubble deep field (hdf), payinga special attention to the selection effects including the cosmological dimmingof surface brightness of galaxies. we find a considerably different result fromprevious studies ignoring the selection effects, and these effects shouldtherefore be taken into account in the analysis. we find that the model of pureluminosity evolution (ple) of galaxies in the einstein-de sitter (eds) universepredicts much smaller counts than those observed at faint magnitude limits by afactor of more than 10, so that a very strong number evolution of galaxies with\eta &gt; 3-4 must be invoked to reproduce the i_{814} counts, when parametrizedas \phi^* \propto (1+z)^\eta. however we show that such a strong numberevolution under realistic merging processes of galaxies can not explain thesteep slope of the b_{450} and v_{606} counts, and it is seriously inconsistentwith their photometric redshift distribution. we find that these difficultiesstill persist in an open universe with \omega_0 &gt; 0.2, but are resolved onlywhen we invoke a $\lambda$-dominated flat universe, after examining varioussystematic uncertainties in modeling the formation and evolution of galaxies.the present analysis revitalizes the practice of using faint number counts asan important cosmological test, giving one of the arguments against the edsuniverse and suggests acceleration of the cosmic expansion by vacuum energydensity. while a modest number evolution of galaxies with \eta ~ 1 is stillnecessary even in a lambda-dominated universe, a stronger number evolution with\eta &gt; 1 is rejected from the hdf data, giving a strong constraint on themerger history of galaxies.

astro-ph;0006143	precessing jets interacting with interstellar material as the origin for  the light curves of gamma-ray bursts	we present an internal shock model with external characteristics forexplaining the complicated light curves of gamma-ray bursts. shocks producegamma-rays in the interaction between a precessing beam of relativisticparticles and the interstellar medium. each time the particle beam passes thesame line of sight with the observer the inter stellar medium is pushedoutward. subsequent interactions between the medium and the beam are delayed bythe extra distance to be traveled for the particles before the shock can form.this results in a natural retardation and leads to an intrinsic asymmetry inthe produced light curves for gamma-ray bursts. in addition we account for thecooling of the electron-proton plasma in the shocked region, which gives riseto an exponential decay in the gamma-ray flux. the combination of these effectsand the precessing jet of ultra relativistic particles produces light curveswhich can be directly compared with observed gamma-ray burst light curves. weillustrate the model by fitting a number of observed gamma-ray bursts which arehard to explain with only a precessing jet. with a genetic algorithm we areable to fit several observed gamma-ray bursts with remarkable accuracy. we findthat for different bursts the observed fluence, assuming isotropic emission,easily varies over four orders of magnitude from the energy generatedintrinsically.

astro-ph;0006176	forming clusters of galaxies as the origin of unidentified gev gamma-ray  sources	over half of gev gamma-ray sources observed by the egret experiment have notyet been identified as known astronomical objects. there is an isotropiccomponent of such unidentified sources, whose number is about 60 in the wholesky. here we calculate the expected number of dynamically forming clusters ofgalaxies emitting gamma-rays by high energy electrons accelerated in the shockwave when they form, in the framework of the standard theory of structureformation. we find that a few tens of such forming clusters should bedetectable by egret and hence a considerable fraction of the isotropicunidentified sources can be accounted for, if about 5% of the shock energy isgoing into electron acceleration. we argue that these clusters are verydifficult to detect in x-ray or optical surveys compared with the conventionalclusters, because of their extended angular size of about 1 degree. hence theydefine a new population of ``gamma-ray clusters''. if this hypothesis is true,the next generation gamma-ray telescopes such as glast will detect more than afew thousands of gamma-ray clusters. it would provide a new tracer ofdynamically evolving structures in the universe, in contrast to the x-rayclusters as a tracer of hydrodynamically stabilized systems. we also derive thestrength of magnetic field required for the extragalactic gamma-ray backgroundby structure formation to extend up to 100 gev as observed, that is about10^{-5} of the shock-heated baryon energy density.

astro-ph;0104072	preheating in the universe suppressing high energy gamma-rays from  structure formation	structure formation in the universe can produce high energy gamma-rays fromshock-accelerated electrons, and this process may be the origin of theextragalactic gamma-ray background (egrb) as well as a part of the unidentifiedsources detected by egret in the gev band, if about 5% of the kinetic energy ofthe shock is going into electron acceleration. however, we point out that theproduction of gamma-rays may be severely suppressed if the collapsing matterhas been preheated by external entropy sources at the time of gravitationalcollapse, as can be inferred from the luminosity-temperature (lt) relation ofgalaxy clusters and groups. we also make a rough estimate of this effect by asimple model, showing that the egrb flux may be suppressed by a factor of about30. hence structure formation is difficult to be the dominant origin of egrb ifpreheating is actually responsible for the observed anomary in the lt relation.the detectable number of gamma-ray clusters is also reduced, but about 5-10forming clusters should still be detectable by egret all sky, and this numberis similar to that of the steady and high-latitude unidentified sources in theegret catalog. the future glast mission should detect 10^2-10^3 gamma-rayclusters of galaxies even if the intergalactic medium has been preheated.

astro-ph;0201277	a bridge from optical to infrared galaxies: explaining local properties,  predicting galaxy counts and the cosmic background radiation	we give an explanation for the origin of various properties observed in localinfrared galaxies, and make predictions for galaxy counts and cosmic backgroundradiation (cbr), by a new model extended from that for optical/near-infraredgalaxies. important new characteristics of this study are that (1) mass scaledependence of dust extinction is introduced based on the size-luminosityrelation of optical galaxies, and that (2) the big grain dust temperaturet_dust is calculated based on a physical consideration for energy balance,rather than using the empirical relation between t_dust and total infraredluminosity l_ir found in local galaxies, which has been employed in most ofprevious works. consequently, the local properties of infrared galaxies, i.e.,optical/infrared luminosity ratios, l_ir-t_dust correlation, and infraredluminosity function are outputs predicted by the model. our model indeedreproduces these local properties reasonably well. we then found considerablydifferent results for mir-submm counts and cbr from most of previous worksbased on the empirical l_ir-t_dust relation; especially, it is shown that thedust temperature of starbursting primordial elliptical galaxies is expected tobe very high (40-80k). this indicates that intense starbursts of formingelliptical galaxies should have occurred at z~2-3, in contrast to the previousresults that significant starbursts beyond z~1 tend to overproduce thefar-infrared (fir) cbr detected by cobe/firas. on the other hand, our modelpredicts that the mid-infrared (mir) flux from warm/nonequilibrium dust isrelatively weak in such galaxies making fir cbr, and this effect reconciles theprima facie conflict between the upper limit on mir cbr from tev gamma-rayobservations and the cobe detections of fir cbr.

astro-ph;0204258	orphan afterglows of collimated gamma-ray bursts: rate predictions and  prospects for detection	we make a quantitative prediction for the detection rate of orphan grbafterglows as a function of flux sensitivity in x-ray, optical, and radiowavebands, based on a recent model of collimated grb afterglows. we find thatthe orphan afterglow rate strongly depends on the opening angle of the jet(roughly \propto \theta_jet^{-2}), as expected from simple geometricalconsideration, if the total jet energy is kept constant as suggested by recentstudies. the relative beaming factor b_rel, i.e., the ratio of all afterglowrate including orphans to those associated with observable prompt grbs, couldbe as high as b_rel &gt;~ 100 for searches deeper than r ~ 24, depending onafterglow parameters. to make the most plausible predictions, we average themodel emission for ten sets of afterglow parameters obtained through fits toten well-observed, collimated grb jets, weighted by the sky coverage of eachjet. our model expectations are consistent with the results (or constraints)obtained by all past searches. we estimate the number of orphan afterglows inthe first 1500deg^2 field of the sdss to be about 0.2. the relative beamingfactor b_rel is rapidly increasing with the search sensitivity: b_rel ~ 3 forthe sdss sensitivity to transient objects in the northern sky (r ~ 19), ~14 forthe past high-z supernova searches (r ~ 23), and ~50 for the sensitivity of thesubaru suprime-cam (r ~ 26). predictions are made for the current facilitiesand future projects in x-ray, optical, and radio bands. among them, thesouthern-sky observation of the sdss (sensitive to transients down to r ~ 23)could detect ~40 orphan afterglows during the five-year operation. allentelescope array would find about 200 afterglows in a radio band at ~0.1-1mjywith b_rel ~ 15.

astro-ph;0303621	a failed gamma-ray burst with dirty energetic jets spirited away? new  implications for the grb-sn connection from supernova 2002ap	(abridged) sn 2002ap is an interesting event with broad spectral featureslike the famous sn 1998bw / grb 980425. here we examine the recently proposedjet hypothesis from sn 2002ap by a spectropolarimetric observation. we showthat jets should be moving at about 0.23c with a jet kinetic energy of ~5 x10^{50} erg, a similar energy scale to the grb jets. the weak radio emissionfrom sn 2002ap has been used to argue against the jet hypothesis, but we showthat this problem can be avoided. however, the jet cannot be kept ionizedbecause of adiabatic cooling without external photoionization or heatingsource. we found that only the radioactivity of 56ni is a possible source,indicating that the jet is formed and ejected from central region of the corecollapse. then we point out that the jet will eventually sweep up enoughinterstellar medium and generate shocks in a few to 10 years, producing strongradio emission that can be spatially resolved, giving us a clear test for thejet hypothesis. discussions are given on possible implications for the grb-snconnection in the case that the jet is real. we suggest existence of twodistinct classes of grbs from similar core-collapse events but by completelydifferent mechanisms. cosmologically distant grbs (~10^{50} erg) are collimatedjets generated by central activity of core collapses. sn 2002ap could be afailed grb of this type with a large baryon load. on the other hand, much lessenergetic ones like grb 980425 are rather isotropic, which may be produced byhydrodynamical shock acceleration at the outer envelope. we propose that theradioactive ionization for the sn 2002ap jet may give a new explanation alsofor the x-ray line features often observed in grb afterglows.

astro-ph;0501242	ultra-luminous x-ray sources: evidence for very efficient formation of  population iii stars contributing to the cosmic near-infrared background  excess?	accumulating evidence indicates that some of ultra-luminous x-ray sources(ulxs) are intermediate mass black holes (imbhs), but the formation process ofimbhs is unknown. one possibility is that they were formed as remnants ofpopulation iii (pop iii) stars, but it has been thought that the probability ofbeing an ulx is too low for imbhs distributed in galactic haloes to account forthe observed number of ulxs. here we show that the number of ulxs can beexplained by such halo imbhs passing through a dense molecular cloud, if popiii star formation is very efficient as recently suggested by the excess of thecosmic near-infrared background radiation that cannot be accounted for bynormal galaxy populations. we calculate the luminosity function of x-raysources in our scenario and find that it is consistent with observed data. ourscenario can explain that ulxs are preferentially found at outskirts of largegas concentrations in star forming regions. a few important physical effectsare pointed out and discussed, including gas dynamical friction, radiativeefficiency of accretion flow, and radiative feedback to ambient medium. ulxscould last for ~10^{5-6} yr to emit a total energy of ~10^{53} erg, which issufficient to power the ionized expanding nebulae found by opticalobservations.

astro-ph;0602178	gamma-ray luminosity function of blazars and the cosmic gamma-ray  background: evidence for the luminosity dependent density evolution	we present a comprehensive study for the gamma-ray luminosity function (glf)of blazars and their contribution to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-raybackground (egrb). radio and gamma-ray luminosity correlation is introduced totake into account the radio detectability which is important for the blazaridentification. previous studies considered only pure luminosity evolution(ple) or pure density evolution, but we introduce the luminosity dependentdensity evolution (ldde) model, which is favored from the evolution of x-rayluminosity function (xlf) of agns. the model parameters are constrained bylikelihood analyses about the observed redshift and gamma-ray fluxdistributions of the egret blazars. we find that the ldde model gives a betterfit to the observed distributions than the ple model, indicating that the lddemodel is also appropriate for gamma-ray blazars, and that the jet activity isuniversally correlated with the accretion history of agns. the normalizationbetween the glf and xlf is consistent with the unified picture of agns, whenthe beaming and a reasonable duty cycle of jet activity are taken into account.we then find that only 25--50% of the egrb can be explained by unresolvedblazars with the best-fit ldde parameters. unresolved blazars can account forall the egrb only with a steeper index of the faint-end slope of the glf, whichis marginally consistent with the egret data but inconsistent with that of thexlf. therefore unresolved agns cannot be the dominant source of the egrb,unless there is a new population of gamma-ray emitting agns that evolvesdifferently from the xlf of agns. predictions for the glast mission are made,and we find that the best-fit ldde model predicts about 3000 blazars in theentire sky, which is considerably fewer than a previous estimate.

astro-ph;9509130	spectrum of the supernova relic neutrino background and evolution of  galaxies	the spectrum of the supernova relic neutrino background (srn) fromcollapse-driven supernovae ever occurred in the universe is calculated by usinga realistic, time-dependent supernova rate derived from a standard model ofgalaxy evolution based on the population synthesis method. the srn spectrum weshow here is the most realistic at present, because the largest uncertainty inprevious theoretical predictions has come from unrealistic assumptions of thesupernova rate so far made. the srn is one of the targets of thesuperkamiokande (sk) detector which will be constructed in a year and the srn,if at all detected, would provide a new tool to probe the history of supernovaexplosions in the universe. the expected event rate at the sk is thereforecalculated in this paper. our major results include: (1) the supernova rate ismuch higher in the early phase of evolution of galaxies and there appears ahump in the srn spectrum in the low-energy region of $\ltilde 5$ mev, (2) thesrn flux depends on the hubble constant ($h_0$) in a way approximatelyproportional to $h_0^2$ and only weakly on the density parameter of theuniverse ($\omega_0$) and a cosmological constant ($\lambda_0$), and (3) theplausible event rate at the sk is 1.2 yr$^{-1}$ in the observable energy range.such a low event rate is due mainly to a quite low supernova rate at presentwhich is averaged over the morphological types of galaxies. the most optimisticrate in our model is found to be 4.7 yr$^{-1}$, and if more events aredetected, we will have to reconsider our current understanding ofcollapse-driven supernovae and evolution of galaxies.

astro-ph;9609035	resonant spin-flavor conversion of supernova neutrinos and deformation  of the electron antineutrino spectrum	the neutrino spin-flavor conversion of \bar\nu_e and \nu_\mu which is inducedby the interaction of the majorana neutrino magnetic moment and magnetic fieldsin the collapse-driven supernova is investigated in detail. we calculate theconversion probability by using the latest precollapse models of woosley andweaver (1995), and also those of nomono and hashimoto (1988), changing thestellar mass and metallicity in order to estimate the effect of theastrophysical uncertainties. contour maps of the conversion probability aregiven for all the models as a function of neutrino mass squared difference andthe neutrino magnetic moment times magnetic fields. it is shown that in thesolar metallicity models some observational effects are expected with \deltam^2 = 10^{-5}--10^{-1} [ev^2] and \mu_\nu &gt;~ 10^{-12} (10^9 g / b_0) [\mu_b],where b_0 is the strength of the magnetic fields at the surface of the ironcore. we also find that although the dependence on the stellar models orstellar mass is not so large, the metallicity of precollapse stars hasconsiderable effects on this conversion. such effects may be seen in asupernova in the large or small magellanic clouds, and should be taken intoaccount when one considers an upper bound on \mu_\nu from the sn1987a data.

0705.4349	lyman alpha emitters in the hierarchically clustering galaxy formation	we present a new theoretical model for the luminosity functions (lfs) oflyman alpha (lya) emitting galaxies in the framework of hierarchical galaxyformation. we extend a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation that reproducesa number of observations for local and high-z galaxies, without changing theoriginal model parameters but introducing a physically-motivated modelling todescribe the escape fraction of lya photons from host galaxies (f_esc). thougha previous study using a hierarchical clustering model simply assumed aconstant and universal value of f_esc, we incorporate two new effects on f_esc:extinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow induced as a starformation feedback. it is found that the new model nicely reproduces all theobserved lya lfs of the lya emitters (laes) at different redshifts in z ~ 3-6.especially, the rather surprisingly small evolution of the observed lae lya lfscompared with the dark halo mass function is naturally reproduced. our modelpredicts that galaxies with strong outflows and f_esc ~ 1 are dominant in theobserved lfs. this is also consistent with available observations, while thesimple universal f_esc model requires f_esc &lt;&lt; 1 not to overproduce thebrightest laes. on the other hand, we found that our model significantlyoverpredicts laes at z &gt; 6, and absorption of lya photons by neutral hydrogenin intergalactic medium (igm) is a reasonable interpretation for thediscrepancy. this indicates that the igm neutral fraction x_hi rapidly evolvesfrom x_hi &lt;&lt; 1 at z &lt; 6 to a value of order unity at z ~ 6-7, which is broadlyconsistent with other observational constraints on the reionization history.

astro-ph;9707051	cosmological gamma-ray bursts and evolution of galaxies	evolution of the rate density of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) iscalculated and compared to the batse brightness distribution in the context ofbinary neutron-star mergers as the source of grbs, taking account of therealistic star formation history in the universe and evolution of compactbinary systems. we tried two models of the evolution of cosmic star formationrate (sfr): one is based on recent observations of sfrs at high redshifts,while the other is based on a galaxy evolution model of stellar populationsynthesis that reproduces the present-day colors of galaxies. it is shown thatthe binary merger scenario of grbs naturally results in the comovingrate-density evolution of \propto (1+z)^{2-2.5} up to z ~ 1, that has beensuggested independently from the compatibility between the number-brightnessdistribution and duration-brightness correlation. if the cosmic sfr has itspeak at z ~ 1--2 as suggested by recent observations, the effective power-indexof grb photon spectrum, \alpha &gt;~ 1.5$ is favored, that is softer than therecent observational determination of \alpha = 1.1 \pm 0.3. however, highredshift starbursts (z &gt;~ 5) in elliptical galaxies, that have not yet beendetected, can alleviate this discrepancy. the redshift of grb970508 is likelyabout 2, just below the upper limit that is recently determined, and theabsorption system at z = 0.835 seems not to be the site of the grb.

astro-ph;9710312	luminosity density evolution in the universe and cosmological parameters	star formation history in galaxies is strongly correlated to theirpresent-day colors and the hubble sequence can be considered as a sequence ofdifferent star formation history. therefore we can model the cosmic starformation history based on the colors of local galaxies, and comparison todirect observations of luminosity density evolution at high redshift gives anew test for the cosmological parameters which is insensitive to merger historyof galaxies. the luminosity density evolution in $0&lt;z&lt;1$ observed by thecanada-france redshift survey in three wavebands of 2800{\aa}, 4400{\aa}, and1$\mu$m indicates that the $\lambda$-dominated flat universe with$\lambda_0\sim0.8$ ($&gt;$ 0.53 at 95%cl) is strongly favored. the cosmic starformation rate (sfr) at $z&gt;2$ is also compared to the latest data of the hubbledeep field including new data which were not incorporated in the previous workof totani, yoshii, &amp; sato (1997), and our model of the luminosity density ofspiral galaxies taking account of gas infall is consistent with theobservations. starbursts in elliptical galaxies, which are expected from thegalactic wind model, however overproduce sfrs and hence they should be formedat $z \gtilde 5$ or their uv emission has to be hidden by dust extinction. theamound of metals in galactic winds and escaping ionizing photons are enough tocontaminate the ly$\alpha$ forests or to reionize the universe.

astro-ph;9801105	gamma-ray bursts from neutron star mergers and evolution of galaxies	most of proposed models of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) areassociated to gravitational collapses of massive stars, and hence evolution ofthe grb rate, which is crucially important in grb intensity distributionanalysis, is determined by the cosmic star formation history. here we presentcomplementary results of grb logn-logp analysis, which were omitted in theprevious paper (totani 1997, apj, 486, l71). a unique feature of the binaryneutron-star merger scenario, in contrast to other scenarios associated tosingle stellar collapses, is that a time delay during binary spiral-in phaseemitting gravitational waves is not negligible and makes the rate evolutionflatter than that of star formation rate. we show that binary merger scenariois more favored than single stellar collapses. the estimated peak luminosityand total emitted energy in rest-frame 50-300 kev range is 1--3 $\times 10^{51}(\omega / 4 \pi)$ erg/s and 1--3 $\times 10^{52} (\omega / 4 \pi)$ erg,respectively, where $\omega$ is opening angle of gamma-ray emission. absoluterate comparison between grbs and neutron-star mergers suggests that a beamingfactor of $(\omega/4\pi)^{-1} \sim$ a few hundreds is required. high-$z$ sfrdata ($z&gt;2$) based on uv luminosity need to be corrected upwards by a factor of5--10 for a good fit, and this is likely explained by the dust extinctioneffect.

astro-ph;9805262	does the number density of elliptical galaxies change at z&lt;1?	we have performed a detailed v/vmax test for a sample of the canada-franceredshift survey (cfrs) for the purpose of examining whether the comoving numberdensity of field galaxies changes significantly at redshifts of z&lt;1. takinginto account the luminosity evolution of galaxies which depends on theirmorphological type through different history of star formation, we obtain&lt;v/vmax&gt; \sim 0.5 in the range of 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8, where reliable redshifts weresecured by spectroscopy of either absorption or emission lines for the cfrssample. this indicates that a picture of mild evolution of field galaxieswithout significant mergers is consistent with the cfrs data. early-typegalaxies, selected by their (v-i)_{ab} color, become unnaturally deficient innumber at z&gt;0.8 due to the selection bias, thereby causing a fictitiousdecrease of &lt;v/vmax&gt;. we therefore conclude that a reasonable choice of upperbound of redshift z \sim 0.8 in the v/vmax test saves the picture of passiveevolution for field ellipticals in the cfrs sample, which was rejected bykauffman, charlot, &amp; white (1996) without confining the redshift range.however, about 10% of the cfrs sample consists of galaxies having colors muchbluer than predicted for irregular galaxies, and their \avmax is significantlylarger than 0.5. we discuss this population of extremely blue galaxies in termsof starburst that has just turned on at their observed redshifts.

astro-ph;9805263	probing the cosmic star formation history by brightness distribution of  gamma-ray bursts	brightness distribution of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is studied in detail underthe assumption that grb rate is related to cosmic star formation rate. the twopopulations of the long- and short-duration bursts in the 4b batse catalog areanalyzed separately. taking account of current uncertainties in theobservational estimate of star formation rate (sfr), we have tried variousmodels of the cosmic star formation history and we find that the sfr evolutionin $z$ = 0--1 is strongly constrained by the grb distribution if the standardcandle approximation is valid. the strong sfr evolution by a factor of $\sim$15 from $z$ = 0 to 1 inferred from uv observations is too steep to beconsistent with the grb distribution for any distance scale of grbs. somepossibilities to reconcile this discrepancy are discussed, including theintrinsic luminosity dispersion of grbs and/or modification of star formationhistory estimated by uv observations. we argue that sfr increase factor from$z$ = 0 to 1 may be as low as about 4 if we choose different sets ofcosmological parameters and/or take account of the evolution of metallicity anddust extinction in the uv data, and this would significantly remedy thediscrepancy.

astro-ph;9805264	very strong tev emission as gamma-ray burst afterglows	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and following afterglows are considered to beproduced by dissipation of kinetic energy of a relativistic fireball andradiation process is widely believed as synchrotron radiation or inversecompton scattering of electrons. we argue that the transfer of kinetic energyof ejecta into electrons may be inefficient process and hence the total energyreleased by a grb event is much larger than that emitted in soft gamma-rays, bya factor of \sim (m_p/m_e). we show that, in this case, very strong emission oftev gamma-rays is possible due to synchrotron radiation of protons acceleratedup to \sim 10^{21} ev, which are trapped in the magnetic field of afterglowshock and radiate their energy on an observational time scale of \sim day. thissuggests a possibility that grbs are most energetic in tev range and such tevgamma-rays may be detectable from grbs even at cosmological distances, i.e., z\sim 1, by currently working ground-based telescopes. furthermore, this modelgives a quantitative explanation for the famous long-duration gev photonsdetected from grb940217. if tev gamma-ray emission which is much more energeticthan grb photons is detected, it provides a strong evidence for acceleration ofprotons up to \sim 10^{21} ev.

astro-ph;9810206	tev burst of gamma-ray bursts and ultra high energy cosmic rays	some recent experiments detecting very high energy (vhe) gamma-rays above10-20 tev independently reported vhe bursts for some of bright gamma-ray bursts(grbs). if these signals are truly from grbs, these grbs must emit a muchlarger amount of energy as vhe gamma-rays than in the ordinary photon energyrange of grbs (kev-mev). we show that such extreme phenomena can be reasonablyexplained by synchrotron radiation of protons accelerated to \sim 10^{20-21}ev, which has been predicted by totani (1998a). protons seem to carry about(m_p/m_e) times larger energy than electrons, and hence the total energyliberated by one grb becomes as large as \sim 10^{56} (\delta \omega / 4 \pi)ergs. therefore a strong beaming of grb emission is highly likely. extension ofthe vhe spectrum beyond 20 tev gives a nearly model-independent lower limit ofthe lorentz factor of grbs, as $\gamma \gtilde 500$. furthermore, our modelgives the correct energy range and time variability of ordinary kev-mevgamma-rays of grbs by synchrotron radiation of electrons. therefore the vhebursts of grbs strongly support the hypothesis that ultra high energy cosmicrays observed on the earth are produced by grbs.

astro-ph;9904042	galaxy formation by galactic magnetic fields	galaxies exhibit a sequence of various morphological types, i.e., the hubblesequence, and they are basically composed of spheroidal components (ellipticalgalaxies and bulges in spiral galaxies) and disks. it is known that spheroidalcomponents are found only in relatively massive galaxies with m=10^{10-12}m_sun, and all stellar populations in them are very old, but there is no clearexplanation for these facts. here we present a speculative scenario for theorigin of the hubble sequence, in which magnetic fields ubiquitously seen ingalaxies have played a crucial role. we first start from a strangeobservational fact that magnetic field strengths observed in spiral galaxiessharply concentrate at a few microgauss, for a wide range of galaxy luminosityand types. we then argue that this fact and the observed correlation betweenstar formation activity and magnetic field strength in spiral galaxies suggestthat spheroidal galaxies have formed by starbursts induced by strong magneticfields. then we show that this idea naturally leads to the formation ofspheroidal systems only in massive and high-redshift objects in hierarchicallyclustering universe, giving a simple explanation for various observations.

astro-ph;9907001	pair creation by very high energy photons in gamma-ray bursts: a unified  picture for various energetics of grbs	the extreme energetics of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 990123 has revealed thatsome of grbs emit quite a large amount of energy, and total energy release fromgrbs seems to change from burst to burst by a factor of 10^{2-3} as e_{gamma,iso} \sim 10^{52-55} erg, where e_{gamma, iso} is the observed grb energy whenradiation is isotropic. if all grbs are triggered by similar events, such awide dispersion in energy release seems odd. here we propose a unified picturefor these various energetics of grbs, in which all grb events release roughlythe same amount of energy of e_{iso} \sim 10^{55-56} erg as relativisticmotion, with the baryon load problem almost resolved. a mild dispersion in theinitial lorentz factor (\gamma) results in difference of e_{gamma, iso} up to afactor of m_p/m_e \sim 10^3. protons work as ``a hidden energy reservoir'' ofthe total grb energy, and e_{gamma, iso} depends on the energy transferefficiency from protons into electrons (or positrons) in the internal shock. weshow that this transfer occurs via e^{+-} pair-creation by very high energyphotons of proton-synchrotron radiation, and this efficiency depends quitesensitively on \gamma. we also show that, in spite of the wide dispersion ine_{gamma, iso}, this model predicts roughly a constant photon energy range ofthe e^{+-} pair-synchrotron at \sim mev, which is well consistent with grbobservations. the optical flash of grb 990123 can be explained by the internalshock origin in our model. the apparent no-correlation between e_{gamma, iso}and observed afterglow luminosity is consistent with the expectation of ourscenario.

astro-ph;9910038	evolution of dust extinction and supernova cosmology	we have made a quantitative calculation for the systematic evolution ofaverage extinction by interstellar dust in host galaxies of high-redshift typeia supernovae, by using a realistic model of photometric and chemical evolutionof galaxies and supernova rate histories in various galaxy types. we find thataverage b band extinction &lt;a_b&gt; at z \sim 0.5 is typically 0.1-0.2 mag largerthan present, under a natural assumption that dust optical depth isproportional to gas column density and gas metallicity. this systematicevolution causes average reddening with e(b-v) \sim 0.025-0.05 mag with thestandard extinction curve, and this is comparable with the observationaluncertainty of the reddening of high-redshift supernovae. therefore, our resultdoes not contradict the observations showing no significant reddening in high-zsupernovae. however, the difference in apparent magnitude between an openuniverse and a \lambda-dominated flat universe is only \sim 0.2 mag at z \sim0.5, and hence this systematic evolution of extinction should be taken intoaccount in a reliable measurement of cosmological parameters. considering thisuncertainty, we show that it is difficult to discriminate between an open and\lambda-dominated flat cosmologies from the current data.

0810.3580	the blazar sequence and the cosmic gamma-ray background radiation in the  fermi era	(abridged) we present a new model of the blazar gamma-ray luminosity function(glf) and the spectrum of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (egrb), whichis consistent with the observed distributions of egret blazars. the unifiedsequence of blazar spectral energy distribution (sed) is taken into account tomake a non-trivial prediction for the egrb spectrum and more realisticcomparison with the data than previous studies. we then try to explain the egrbdata by the two agn populations: one is blazars, and the other is non-blazaragns that are responsible for the egrb in the mev band. we find that ~80% ofthe egrb photon flux at &gt; 100 mev can be explained by the sum of the twopopulations, while ~45% can be accounted for only by blazars. the predictedegrb spectrum is in agreement with a wide range of the observed data from x-rayto gev, within the systematic uncertainties in the egrb determination by egret.these results indicate that agns including blazars are the primary source ofegrb. blazars are dominant in egrb at higher energy bands of &gt;100 mev, whilenon-blazar agns dominate at &lt;100 mev. almost all of the egrb flux from blazarswill be resolved into discrete sources by the fermi gamma-ray space telescope,while that from non-blazar agns will largely remain unresolved. therefore,comparison between the integrated source counts and diffuse egrb flux as afunction of photon energy will give a simple and clear test of our model.various quantitative predictions for fermi observations are also made.especially, our model predicts 600-1200 blazars in all sky down to 2e-9photons/cm^-2/s (&gt;100 mev), which is considerably smaller than most of previousstudies.
