0905.4439	the bolometric luminosity of type 2 agn from extinction-corrected  [oiii]: no evidence for eddington-limited sources	there have been recent claims that a significant fraction of type 2 agnaccrete close or even above the eddington limit. in type 2 agn the bolometricluminosity (l_b) is generally inferred from the [oiii] emission line luminosity(l_oiii). the key issue, in order to estimate the bolometric luminosity inthese agn, is therefore to know the bolometric correction to be applied tol_oiii. a complication arises from the fact that the observed l_oiii isaffected by extinction, likely due to dust within the narrow line region. theextinction-corrected [oiii] luminosity (l^c_oiii) is a better estimator of thenuclear luminosity than l_oiii. however, so far only the bolometric correctionto be applied to the uncorrected l_oiii has been evaluated. this paper isdevoted to estimate the bolometric correction c_oiii=l_b/l^c_oiii in order toderive the eddington ratios for the type 2 agn in a sample of sdss objects. wehave collected from the literature 61 sources with reliable estimate of bothl^c_oiii and x-ray luminosities (l_x). to estimate c_oiii, we combined theobserved correlation between l^c_oiii and l_x with the x-ray bolometriccorrection. we found, contrary to previous studies, a linear correlationbetween l^c_oiii and l_x. we estimated c_oiii using the luminosity-dependentx-ray bolometric correction of marconi et al. (2004), and we found a mean valueof c_oiii in the luminosity ranges log l_oiii=38-40, 40-42, and 42-44 of 87,142 and 454 respectively. we used it to calculate the eddington ratiodistribution of type 2 sdss agn at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.4 and we found that these sourcesare not accreting near their eddington limit, contrary to previous claims.

0906.1974	unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies: the case of "naked" agn	hawkins (2004) reported on a class of "naked" agn characterized by strongamplitude optical brightness variability and the complete absence of broademission lines in the optical spectrum. the variability suggests that thenucleus is seen directly, however the absence of broad lines contradicts thesimple formulation of unified models for agn. we present the results ofquasi-simultaneous spectroscopic observations with xmm-newton and ntt (lasilla) of two "naked" agn. we confirm the "naked" nature of q2131-427 for whichno broad emission line components have been detected in the optical spectrumand its x-ray spectrum shows no signs of intrinsic absorption. the optical andx-ray mismatch in this source cannot be ascribed to a high nuclear dust-to-gasratio and a compton thick nature is ruled out on the basis of the highf(x)/f([oiii]) ratio. the broad line region (blr) may be completely absent inthis source, possibly as a consequence of its low eddington ratio. on the otherhand, the optical spectrum of q2130-431 shows h(alpha) and h(beta) broademission line components, revealing the presence of a blr. a mild x-rayabsorption is expected in intermediate type 1.8 seyfert galaxies likeq2130-431, however we put a very low upper limit on the column density (&lt; 2 x10^(20) cm^(-2)), also the low balmer decrement suggests that the blr itselfdoes not suffer from reddening. we propose that in this object the blr isintrinsically weak, making a case of "true" intermediate seyfert galaxy. wealso report on the x-ray detection of the abell 3783 galaxy cluster in thexmm-newton field-of-view of the q2131-427 observation.

1002.0723	a revision of the x-ray absorption nature of the balqsos	broad absorption line quasars (balqsos) are key objects for studying thestructure and emission/absorption properties of agn. however, despite theirfundamental importance, the properties of balqsos are still not wellunderstood. in order to investigate the x-ray nature of these sources, as wellas the correlations between x-ray and rest-frame uv properties, we compile alarge sample of 88 balqsos observed by xmm-newton. we performed a full x-rayspectral analysis on a sample of 39 sources with higher x-ray spectral quality,and an approximate hr analysis on the remaining sources. using availableoptical spectra, we calculate the balnicity index and investigate thedependence between this optical parameter and different x-ray properties.  using the neutral absorption model, we found that 36% of our balqsos have nh&lt; 5x10^21 cm^-2, lower than the expected x-ray absorption for such objects.however, when we used a physically-motivated model for the x-ray absorption inbalqsos, i.e. ionized absorption, \sim 90% of the objects are absorbed. theabsorption properties also suggest that lobals may be physically differentobjects from hibals. in addition, we report on a correlation between theionized absorption column density and bal parameters. there is evidence (at 98%level) that the amount of x-ray absorption is correlated with the strength ofhigh-ionization uv absorption. this correlation, not previously reported, canbe naturally understood in virtually all balqso models, as driven by the totalamount of gas mass flowing towards the observer.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1204.0946	the suzaku x-ray spectrum of ngc 3147. further insights on the best  "true" seyfert 2 galaxy candidate	ngc 3147 is so far the most convincing case of a "true" seyfert 2 galaxy,i.e. a source genuinely lacking the broad line regions. we obtained a suzakuobservation with the double aim to study in more detail the iron line complex,and to check the compton-thick hypothesis for the lack of observed opticalbroad lines.  the suzaku xis and hxd/pin spectra of the source were analysed in detail. theline complex is composed of at least two unresolved lines, one at about 6.45kev and the other one at about 7 kev, most likely identified with fe xvii/xix,the former, and fe xxvi, the latter. the high-ionization line can originateeither in a photoionized matter or in an optically thin thermal plasma. in thelatter case, an unusually high temperature is implied. in the photoionizedmodel case, the large equivalent width can be explained either by an extremeiron overabundance or by assuming that the source is compton-thick. in thecompton-thick hypothesis, however, the emission above 2 kev is mostly due to ahighly ionized reflector, contrary to what is usually found in compton-thickseyfert 2s, where reflection from low ionized matter dominates. moreover, thesource flux varied between the xmm-newton and the suzaku observations, taken3.5 years apart, confirming previous findings and indicating that the size ofthe emitting region must be smaller than a parsec.  the hard x-ray spectrum is also inconclusive on the compton-thick hypothesis.weighting the various arguments, a "true" seyfert 2 nature of ngc 3147 seems tobe still the most likely explanation, even if the "highly ionized reflector"compton-thick hypothesis cannot at present be formally rejected.

1205.6995	the x-ray luminous galaxies optically classified as star forming are  mostly narrow line seyfert 1s	we aim to characterize the nature of galaxies whose optical emission linediagnostics are consistent with star formation, but whose x-ray propertiesstrongly point towards the presence of an agn. understanding these sources isof particular importance in assessing the completeness of agn samples derivedfrom large galaxy surveys, selected solely on the basis of their opticalspectral properties.we construct a large sample of 211 nelgs, which have fwhmshb emission line &lt;1200 km/s from the sdss-dr7 galaxy spectroscopic catalogue,for which we are able to construct a classical diagnostic diagram, [oiii]/hbversus [nii]/ha (hence z&lt;0.4), and that are also detected in the hard energyband and present in the 2xmm catalogue. this sample offers a large database bywhich to investigate potential mismatches between optical diagnostics and x-rayemission. among these 211 objects, which based on our selection criteria areall at z&lt;0.4, we find that 145 galaxies are diagnosed as agns, having 2-10 kevx-ray luminosities that span a wide range, from 10^40 erg/s to above 10^44erg/s. out of the remaining 66 galaxies, which are instead diagnosed as sf, wefind a bimodal distribution in which 28 have x-ray luminosities in excess of10^42 erg/s, large t (&gt;1), and large x/o ratio (&gt;0.1), while the rest areconsistent with being simply sf galaxies. those 28 galaxies exhibit thebroadest hb line fwhms, from ~300 to 1200 km/s, and their x-ray spectrum issteeper than average and often displays a soft excess. we therefore concludethat the population of x-ray luminous nelgs with optical lines consistent withthose of a starforming galaxy (which represent 19% of our whole sample) islargely dominated by nls1s. the occurrence of such sources in the overalloptically selected sample is small (&lt;2%), hence the contamination of opticallyselected galaxies by nls1s is very small.

1307.1471	the xmm-newton deep survey in the cdf-s vi. obscured agn selected as  infrared power-law galaxies	accretion onto smbh is believed to occur mostly in obscured agn. such objectsare proving rather elusive in surveys of distant galaxies, including those atx-ray energies. our main goal is to determine whether the revised irac criteriaof donley et al. (2012) (objects with an ir power-law spectral shape), areeffective at selecting x-ray type-2 agn. we present the results from the x-rayspectral analysis of 147 agn selected by cross-correlating the highest spectralquality ultra-deep xmm-newton and the spitzer/irac catalogues in the cdf-s.consequently it is biased towards sources with high s/n x-ray spectra. in orderto measure the amount of intrinsic absorption in these sources, we adopt asimple x-ray spectral model that includes a power-law modified by intrinsicabsorption and a possible soft x-ray component. we find 21/147 sources to beheavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities donot allow us to confirm their compton-thick nature without resorting toadditional criteria. although ir power-law galaxies are less numerous in oursample than ir non-power-law galaxies (60 versus 87 respectively), we find thatthe fraction of absorbed (n_{h} &gt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}) agn is significantly higher(at about 3 sigma level) for ir-power-law sources ($\sim$2/3) than for thosesources that do not meet this ir selection criteria ($\sim$1/2). this behaviouris particularly notable at low luminosities, but it appears to be present,although with a marginal significance, at all luminosities. we thereforeconclude that the ir power-law method is efficient in finding x-ray-absorbedsources. we would then expect that the long-sought dominant population ofabsorbed agn is abundant among ir power-law spectral shape sources not detectedin x-rays.

0803.1440	x-ray absorption in distant type ii qsos	we present the results of the x-ray spectral analysis of anxmm-newton-selected type ii qso sample with z&gt;0.5 and 0.5-10 kev flux of 0.3-33x 10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2. the distribution of absorbing column densities in typeii qsos is investigated and the dependence of absorption on x-ray luminosityand redshift is studied.  we inspected 51 spectroscopically classified type ii qso candidates from thexmm-newton marano field survey, the xmm-newton-2df wide angle survey (xwas),and the axis survey to set-up a well-defined sample with secure optical type iiidentifications. fourteen type ii qsos were classified and an x-ray spectralanalysis performed. since most of our sources have only ~40 x-ray counts(pn-detector), we carefully studied the fit results of the simulated x-rayspectra as a function of fit statistic and binning method. we determined thatfitting the spectra with the cash-statistic and a binning of minimum one countper bin recovers the input values of the simulated x-ray spectra best. above100 pn counts, the free fits of the spectrum's slope and absorbing hydrogencolumn density are reliable.  we find only moderate absorption (n_h=(2-10) x 10^22 cm^-2) and no obvioustrends with redshift and intrinsic x-ray luminosity. in a few cases acompton-thick absorber cannot be excluded. two type ii objects with no x-rayabsorption were discovered. we find no evidence for an intrinsic separationbetween type ii agn and high x-ray luminosity type ii qso in terms ofabsorption. the stacked x-ray spectrum of our 14 type ii qsos shows no ironk-alpha line. in contrast, the stack of the 8 type ii agn reveals a veryprominent iron k-alpha line at an energy of ~ 6.6 kev and an ew ~ 2 kev.

1406.6009	relativistic reflection in the average x-ray spectrum of agn in the  v\'eron-cetty &amp; v\'eron catalogue	the x-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (agn) unveil properties of matteraround the super massive black hole (smbh). we investigate the x-ray spectra ofagn focusing on compton reflection and fluorescence, important processes ofinteraction between primary radiation and circum-nuclear material. unresolvedemission lines (most notably the fe line) in the x-ray spectra of agn indicatethat this material is located far away from the smbh. contributions from theinner accretion disk, affected by relativistic effects, have also been detectedin several cases.  we studied the average x-ray spectrum of a sample of 263 x-ray unabsorbed agnthat yield 419023 counts in the 2-12 kev rest-frame band distributed among 388xmm-newton spectra. we fitted the average spectrum using a (basically)unabsorbed power law (primary radiation). from second model that represents theinteraction of the primary radiation with matter located far away from thesmbh, we found that it was very significantly detected. finally, we added acontribution from interaction with neutral material in the accretion disk closeto the central smbh, which is therefore smeared by relativistic effects, whichimproved the fit at 6 sigma. the reflection factors are 0.65 for the accretiondisk and 0.25 for the torus. replacing the neutral disk-reflection withlow-ionisation disk reflection, also relativistically smeared, fits the dataequally well, suggesting that we do not find evidence for a significantionisation of the accretion disk.  we detect distant neutral reflection in the average spectrum of unabsorbedagn with z=0.8. adding the disk-reflection component associated with arelativistic fe line improves the data description at 6 sigma confidence level,suggesting that both reflection components are present. the disk-reflectioncomponent accounts for about 70 % of the total reflected flux.

1501.04335	revisiting the relationship between 6 {\mu}m and 2-10 kev continuum  luminosities of agn	we have determined the relation between the agn luminosities at rest-frame 6{\mu}m associated to the dusty torus emission and at 2-10 kev energies using acomplete, x-ray flux limited sample of 232 agn drawn from the bright ultra-hardxmm-newton survey. the objects have intrinsic x-ray luminosities between 10^42and 10^46 erg/s and redshifts from 0.05 to 2.8. the rest-frame 6 {\mu}mluminosities were computed using data from the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer and are based on a spectral energy distribution decomposition into agnand galaxy emission. the best-fit relationship for the full sample isconsistent with being linear, l_6 {\mu}m $\propto$ l_2-10 kev^0.99$\pm$0.032,with intrinsic scatter, ~0.35 dex in log l_6 {\mu}m. the l_6 {\mu}m/l_2-10 kevluminosity ratio is largely independent on the line-of-sight x-ray absorption.assuming a constant x-ray bolometric correction, the fraction of agn bolometricluminosity reprocessed in the mid-ir decreases weakly, if at all, with the agnluminosity, a finding at odds with simple receding torus models. type 2 agnhave redder mid-ir continua at rest-frame wavelengths &lt;12 {\mu}m and areoverall ~1.3-2 times fainter at 6 {\mu}m than type 1 agn at a given x-rayluminosity. regardless of whether type 1 and type 2 agn have the same ordifferent nuclear dusty toroidal structures, our results imply that the agnemission at rest-frame 6 {\mu}m is not isotropic due to self-absorption in thedusty torus, as predicted by agn torus models. thus, agn surveys at rest-frame6 {\mu}m are subject to modest dust obscuration biases.

astro-ph;0302067	cosmological constraints from the cluster contribution to the power  spectrum of the soft x-ray background. new evidence for a low sigma_8	we use the x-ray power spectrum of the rosat all-sky survey in the r6 band(approximately 0.9-1.3 kev) to set an upper limit on the galaxy cluster powerspectrum. the cluster power spectrum is modelled with a minimum number ofrobust assumptions regarding the structure of the clusters. the power spectrumof rosat sets an upper limit on the omega_m-sigma_8 plane which excludes allthe models with sigma_8 above sigma_8 = 0.5/(omega_m^0.38) in a flat lcdmuniverse. we discuss the possible sources of systematic errors in ourconclusions, mainly dominated by the assumed l_x-t relation. alternatively,this relation could be constrained by using the x-ray power spectrum, if thecosmological model is known. our conclusions suggest that only models with alow value of sigma_8 (sigma_8 &lt; 0.8 for omega_m = 0.3) may be compatible withour upper limit. we also find that models predicting lower luminosities ingalaxy clusters are favoured. reconciling our cosmological constraints withthese arising by other methods might require either a high entropy floor orwide-spread presence of cooling flows in the low-redshift clusters.

astro-ph;0506718	xmm-newton observations of the lockman hole iv: spectra of the brightest  agn	this paper presents the results of a detailed x-ray spectral analysis of asample of 123 x-ray sources (46 being type-1 agn and 28 type-2 agn) detectedwith xmm-newton in the lockman hole field. using a single power law model oursources' average spectral slope hardens at faint 0.5-2 kev fluxes but not atfaint 2-10 kev fluxes. we explain the effect in terms of an increase in x-rayabsorption at faint fluxes. the average spectral slope of our sources is ~1.9with an intrinsic dispersion of ~0.28. we detected x-ray absorption in 37% ofthe sources, ~10% in type-1 agn and ~77% in type-2 agn. using x-ray fluxescorrected for absorption, the fraction of absorbed objects and the absorbingcolumn density distribution did not vary with x-ray flux. our type-1 and type-2agn do not appear to have different continuum shapes, but the distribution ofintrinsic absorption is different among both classes. a significant fraction ofour type-2 agn (5 out of 28) were found to display no substantial absorption.we discuss possible interpretations to this in terms of compton-thick agn andintrinsic broad line region properties. an emission line compatible with fekalpha was detected in 8 sources with rest frame equivalent widths 120-1000 ev.the agn continuum or intrinsic absorption did not depend on x-ray luminosityand/or redshift. soft excess emission was detected in 18 objects, but only in 9could we fit this spectral component with a black body model. the 0.5-2 kevluminosities of the fitted black body were not significantly different intype-1 and type-2 agn, although the temperatures were slightly higher in type-2agn than in type-1 agn. for 9 sources (including 1 type-1 agn and 3 type-2 agn)a scattering model provided a better fit of the soft excess emission.

astro-ph;0605236	on the x-ray, optical emission line and black hole mass properties of  local seyfert galaxies	we investigate the relation between x-ray nuclear emission, optical emissionline luminosities and black hole masses for a sample of 47 seyfert galaxies.the sample, which has been selected from the palomar optical spectroscopicsurvey of nearby galaxies (ho, filippenko &amp; sargent 1997), covers a wide rangeof nuclear powers, from l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down to very lowluminosities (l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). best available data from chandra,xmm-newton and, in a few cases, asca observations have been considered. thanksto the good spatial resolution available from these observations and a propermodeling of the various spectral components, it has been possible to obtainaccurate nuclear x-ray luminosities not contaminated by off-nuclear sourcesand/or diffuse emission. x-ray luminosities have then been corrected takinginto account the likely candidate compton thick sources, which are a highfraction (&gt; 30%) among type 2 seyferts in our sample. the main result of thisstudy is that we confirm strong linear correlations between 2-10 kev,[oiii]\lambda5007, h_{alpha} luminosities which show the same slope as quasarsand luminous seyfert galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activitydisplayed. moreover, despite the wide range of eddington ratios (l/l_{edd})tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down to ~ 10^{-7}), nocorrelation is found between the x-ray or optical emission line luminositiesand the black hole mass. our results suggest that seyfert nuclei in our sampleare consistent with being a scaled-down version of more luminous agn.

astro-ph;0701546	the x-ray and radio connection in low-luminosity active nuclei	we present the results of the correlation between the nuclear 2-10 kev x-rayand radio (at 2cm, 6cm and 20cm) luminosities for a well defined sample oflocal seyfert galaxies. we use a sample of low luminosity radio galaxies(llrgs) for comparison. in both seyfert and llrgs samples, x-ray and radioluminosities are significantly correlated over 8 orders of magnitude,indicating that the x-ray and radio emission sources are strongly coupled.moreover, both samples show a similar regression slope, l(x)$\propto$l(r)^(0.97), but seyfert galaxies are three orders of magnitude less luminousin the radio band than llrgs. this suggests that either similar physicalmechanisms are responsible for the observed emission or a combination ofdifferent mechanisms ends up producing a similar correlation slope. indeed, thecommon belief for llrg is that both the x-ray and radio emission are likelydominated by a relativistic jet component, while in seyfert galaxies the x-rayemission probably arises from a disk-corona system and the radio emission isattributed to a jet/outflow component. we investigate the radio loudness issuein the two samples and find that the seyfert galaxies and the llrgs show adifferent distribution of the radio loudness parameters. no correlation isfound between the luminosity and the radio loudness, however the latter isrelated to the black hole mass and anti-correlated with the eddington ratio.the dichotomy in the radio loudness between seyfert and llrg observed down tolow eddington ratios, l(2-10)/l(edd) $\sim$ 10^(-8), does not support the ideathat the origin of the radio loudness is due to a switch in the accretion mode.

astro-ph;0703451	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey iv. the axis x-ray source counts and  angular clustering	axis (an xmm-newton international survey) is a survey of 36 high galacticlatitude xmm-newton observations covering 4.8 deg2 and containing 1433serendipitous x-ray sources detected with 5-sigma significance. we have studiedthe x-ray source counts in four energy bands soft (0.5-2 kev), hard (2-10 kev),xid (0.5-4.5 kev) and ultra-hard (4.5-7.5 kev). we have combined this surveywith shallower and deeper surveys. our source counts results are compatiblewith most previous samples in the soft, xid, ultra-hard and hard bands. thefractions of the xrb resolved in the surveys used in this work are 87%, 85%,60% and 25% in the soft, hard, xid and ultra-hard bands, respectively.extrapolation of our source counts to zero flux are not enough to saturate thexrb intensity. only galaxies and/or absorbed agn may be able contribute theremaining unresolved xrb intensity. our results are compatible, within theerrors, with recent revisions of the xrb intensity in the soft and hard bands.the maximum fractional contribution to the xrb comes from fluxes within about adecade of the break in the source counts (~1e-14 cgs), reaching ~50% of thetotal in the soft and hard bands. using only axis sources, we have studied theangular correlation in those bands using a novel robust technique. angularclustering (widely distributed over the sky and not confined to a few deepfields) is detected at 99-99.9% significance in the soft and xid bands, with nodetection in the hard and ultra-hard band (probably due to the smaller numberof sources). we cannot confirm the detection of significantly strongerclustering in the hard-spectrum hard sources. medium depth surveys such as axisare essential to determine the evolution of the x-ray emission in the universebelow 10 kev.

astro-ph;9405052	on the influence of x-ray galaxy clusters in the fluctuations of the  cosmic microwave background	the negative evolution found in x--ray clusters of galaxies limits the amountof available hot gas for the inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwavebackground (the sunyaev--zel'dovich effect). using a parametrisation of thex-ray luminosity function and its evolution in terms of a coalescence model (aspresented in the analysis of a flux limited x-ray cluster sample by edge et al.1990), as well as a simple virialised structure for the clusters (whichrequires a gas to total mass fraction $\approxgt 0.1$ in order to reproduceobserved properties of nearby clusters) we show that the compton distortion $y$parameter is about two orders of magnitude below the current firas upperlimits. concerning the anisotropies imprinted on arcmin scales they aredominated by the hottest undetected objects. we show that they are negligible(${\delta t\over t}\approxlt 10^{-7}$) at wavelengths $\lambda\approxgt 1$~mm.at shorter wavelengths they become more important (${\delta t\over t}\sim10^{-6}$ at $\lambda\sim 0.3$~mm), but in fact most clusters will produce anisolated and detectable feature in sky maps. after removal of these signals,the fluctuations imprinted by the remaining clusters on the residual radiationare still much smaller. the conclusion is that x-ray clusters can be ignored assources of cosmic microwave background fluctuations.

astro-ph;9412001	nearby galaxies and the ginga x-ray background	we present here the results of cross-correlating the x-ray backgroundmeasured by ginga in the 2-10 kev band with several catalogues of extragalacticobjects. positive signals with an amplitude of a few per cent have been foundfor some catalogues implying that some fraction of the x-ray background isproduced either by the class of catalogued sources or by other classesspatially related to them. detailed x-ray background simulations have been usedto assess the significance of the results and, for the first time, the fullangular shape of the cross-correlation. the inferred x-ray volume emissivity inthe local universe, j_0, has been estimated for two galaxy catalogues (ugc andiras) for which the cross-correlation is highly significant. we obtain j_0=(0.74 +/- 0.07) for ugc and j_0= (1.15 +/- 0.10) for iras, in units of 1.e39 herg/s/mpc3. extrapolating this result back to z~1-4 leads to the conclusionthat &lt;~10-30 per cent of the x-ray background could be produced by anon-evolving population of galaxies. these values are shown to be consistentwith upper limits on the auto correlation function derived here.

astro-ph;9503029	hard x-ray emission from extragalactic iras 12um sources: constraints on  the unified agn model and the synthesis of the x-ray background	we analyze the $2-10$~kev x-ray emission of complete samples of agn andgalaxies selected at 12$\mu$m and recently compiled by rush, malkan \&amp;spinoglio (1993). as a necessary complement we also study the ir emissivity ofthe largest sample of hard x--ray selected agn (grossan 1992). our purposes areto probe the unified scheme of active nuclei and to evaluate the local x--rayvolume emissivity of low luminosity and `hidden' agn. we confirm that x-rayemission is basically restricted to agn, seyfert 1's being much more powerfulemitters than seyfert 2's. we find no signal of x-ray emission for theremaining galaxies selected at $12\mu$m, not even for those having a flatfar-infrared spectrum, which would be prime candidates to host hidden agn. ourresult on the local volume emissivity of the seyfert 1's is fully consistentwith those derived from studies of the hard x--ray luminosity function. howeverthe 95$\%$ upper limits to the local emissivity we derive for the seyfert 2class and for the most likely `hidden' agn candidates, severely constrain (andin some cases exclude) models of the x--ray background based on the unifiedseyfert scheme. we also find that less than $\sim20$\% of seyfert 1-like agnand less than $\sim 50$\% of seyfert 2-like agn can be `hidden' in thenon-seyfert galaxy samples assuming that the x-ray to 12$\mu$m flux ratiosmeasured in the 12$\mu$m selected samples can be considered typical for theseclasses of objects. in this case, the number ratio of seyfert 2 to seyfert 1galaxies ranges from 1 to 2.

astro-ph;9504021	the absorption spectra of q1107+487 and q1442+295	we present the first moderate resolution (approx. 40--120 km/s) spectroscopicobservations of the bright (v&lt;16.7) high-redshift qsos q1107+487 (z_{em} =2.965) and q1442+295 (z_{em} = 2.669) (sanduleak &amp; pesch 1989). the relativelyhigh signal to noise reached in the spectra along with an extensive wavelengthcoverage of the lyman alpha and the lyman beta forest allowed us to obtain,through profile fitting, column densities and doppler parameters of the lymanclouds towards these qsos. the spectral coverage of regions longward of thelyman alpha emission line of the qsos at the expected wavelengths of civ1548,1550 at the redshifts of the lyman alpha forest allowed us to identifysome heavy element absorption systems (hereafter heass) towards these qsos. wehave found no lyman absorption system or heas towards these qsos for which ourdata allow a deuterium measurement or to provide an interesting upper limit forthe d/h ratio. the reason for this is that the lyman lines with high columndensity detected towards these qsos belong to absorption systems showingvelocity structure.

astro-ph;9511131	the proximity effect on the lyman alpha forest due to a a foreground qso	the influence of a foreground qso on the lyman a forest of another qso withhigher redshift has been investigated by analyzing the spectra of three suchobjects at redshifts $z=2 - 2.7$. this influence is not contaminated by anyprojection effects, as opposed to the inverse effect along the line of sight,where incomplete coverage of the qso continuum emitting region by the lyman aclouds could contribute to the relative lack of lines. our results areconsistent with the existence of a proximity effect due to the foreground qso,but due to its weakness we can only reject the absence of such effect at 1sigma level. by modelling this proximity effect assuming that lyman a cloudsare low-density highly ionized objects we find that the best value for the uvphotoinizing intensity at those redshifts is 10^{-20.5}(...) at the lyman limitwhich is consistent with previous estimates of the background based on theinverse effect. we also find an absolute lower limit (at 95% confidence) to theuv intensity at the level of 10^{-21.8}(...) which means the rejection of anumber of models for the uv background.

astro-ph;9601176	strong clustering of high-redshift lyman-alpha forest absorption systems	we use new observations of very weak civ absorption lines associated withhigh-redshift lyman-alpha absorption systems to measure the high-redshiftlyman-alpha line two-point correlation function (tpcf). these very weak civabsorption lines trace small-scale velocity structure that cannot be resolvedby lyman-alpha absorption lines. we find that (1) high-redshift lyman-alphaabsorption systems with n(hi) &gt; 3.10^14 cm^{-2} are strongly clustered inredshift, (2) previous measurements of the lyman-alpha line tpcf underestimatedthe actual clustering of the absorbers due to unresolved blending ofoverlapping velocity components, (3) the present observations are consistentwith the hypothesis that clustering of lyman-alpha absorption systems extendsto lower column densities, but maybe with smaller amplitude in the correlationfunction, and (4) the observed clustering is broadly compatible with thatexpected for galaxies at z \sim 2-3. we interpret these results as suggestingthat many or most lyman-alpha absorbers may arise in galaxies even at highredshifts, and, therefore, that the lyman-alpha forest probes processes ofgalaxy formation and evolution for redshifts \lesssim 5.

astro-ph;9602118	the luminosity function evolution of soft x--ray selected agn in the  rixos survey	a sample of 198 soft x--ray selected active galactic nuclei (agn) from therosat international x--ray optical survey (rixos), is used to investigate thex--ray luminosity function and its evolution. rixos, with a flux limit of 3e-14erg s-1 cm-2 (0.5 to 2.0 kev), samples a broad range in redshift over 20 deg^2of sky, and is almost completely identified; it is used in combination with theeinstein extended medium sensitivity survey (emss), to give a total sample ofover 600 agn. we find the evolution of agn with redshift to be consistent withpure luminosity evolution (ple) models in which the rate of evolution slowsmarkedly or stops at high redshifts z&gt;1.8. we find that this result is notaffected by the inclusion, or exclusion, of narrow emission line galaxies atlow redshift in the rixos and emss samples, and is insensitive to uncertaintiesin the conversion between flux values measured with rosat and einstein. weconfirm, using a model independent ve/va test, that our survey is consistentwith no evolution at high redshifts.

astro-ph;9610236	soft x-ray background fluctuations and large-scale structure in the  universe	we have studied the fluctuations of the soft (0.9-2 kev) x-ray backgroundintensity for ~10 arcmin and ~2 arcmin beam sizes, using 80 high galacticlatitude medium-deep images from the rosat position sensitive proportionalcounter (pspc). these fluctuations are dominated (and well reproduced) byconfusion noise produced by sources unresolved with the beam sizes we used. wefind no evidence for any excess fluctuations which could be attributed tosource clustering. the 95 per cent confidence upper limits on excessfluctuations diclus are: diclus/ixrb_10 arcmin&lt;~ 0.12, diclus/ixrb_2 arcmin&lt;~0.07. we have checked the possibility that low surface brightness extendedobjects (like groups or clusters of galaxies) may have a significantcontribution to excess fluctuations, finding that they are not necessary to fitthe distribution of fluctuations, and obtaining an upper limit on the surfacedensity for this type of source. standard cold dark matter models would producediclus/ixrb larger than the above limits for any value of the density of theuniverse omega=0.1-1, unless the bias parameter of the x-ray emitting matter issmaller than unity, or an important fraction of the sources of the soft x-raybackground (~30 per cent) is at redshifts z&gt;1. limits on the 2-10 kev excessfluctuations are also considered, showing that x-ray sources in that band haveto be at redshifts z&gt;1 unless omega&gt;0.4. finally, if the spatial correlationfunction of the sources that produce these excess fluctuations is instead apower law, the density contrast drho/rho implied by the excess fluctuationsreveals that the universe is smooth and linear on scales of tens of mpc, whileit can be highly non-linear on scales ~1 mpc.

astro-ph;9705180	measuring the power spectrum of density fluctuations at intermediate  redshift with x-ray background observations	the precision of intensity measurements of the extragalactic x-ray background(xrb) on an angular scale of about a degree is dominated by spatialfluctuations caused by source confusion noise. x-ray source counts at the fluxlevel responsible for these fluctuations will soon be accurately measured bynew missions and it will then be possible to detect the weaker fluctuationscaused by the clustering of the fainter, more distant sources which produce thebulk of the xrb. we show here that measurements of these excess fluctuations atthe level of 0.2 per cent are within reach, improving by an order of magnitudeon present upper limits. together with the redshift evolution of the x-rayvolume emissivity in the universe, this can be used to measure the powerspectrum of the density fluctuations at comoving wavevectors 0.01-0.1 h/mpc atz=1-2 with a sensitivity better than the predictions from large-scale structuremodels. a relatively simple x-ray experiment, carried out by a large-areaproportional counter with a 0.5-2 deg^2 collimated field-of-view scanning thewhole sky a few times, would be able to determine the power spectrum of thedensity fluctuations near its expected peak in wavevector with an accuracybetter than 10 per cent.

(1995). there is no evidence that galaxy interactions play an importantrole in distributing tenuous gas around galaxies in most cases. galaxies mightaccount for all \lya absorption systems with $w &gt; 0.3$ \aa, but this depends onthe unknown luminosity function and gaseous cross sections of low-luminositygalaxies as well as on the uncertainties of the observed number density of \lyaabsorption systems.

astro-ph;9711083	deep hard x-ray source counts from a fluctuation analysis of asca sis  images	an analysis of the spatial fluctuations in 15 deep asca sis0 images has beenconducted in order to probe the 2-10 kev x-ray source counts down to a fluxlimit 2e-14 erg/cm2/s. special care has been taken in modelling thefluctuations in terms of the sensitivity maps of every one of the 16 regions(5.6 x 5.6 arcmin2 each) in which the sis0 has been divided, by means ofraytracing simulations with improved optical constants in the x-ray telescope.the very extended `side lobes' (extending up to a couple of degrees) exhibitedby these sensitivity maps make our analysis sensitive to both faint on-axissources and brighter off-axis ones, the former being dominant. the sourcecounts in the range (2-12)e-14 erg/cm2/s are found to be close to a euclideanform which extrapolates well to previous results from higher fluxes and inreasonable agreement with some recent asca surveys. however, our resultsdisagree with the deep survey counts by georgantopoulos et al. (1997). thepossibility that the source counts flatten to a subeuclidean form, as isobserved at soft energies in rosat data, is only weakly constrained to happenat a flux &lt;1.8e-12 erg/cm2/s (90 per cent confidence). down to the sensitivitylimit of our analysis, the integrated contribution of the sources whose imprintis seen in the fluctuations amounts to 35\pm 13 per cent of the extragalactic2-10 kev x-ray background.

astro-ph;9803289	do nuclear starbursts obscure the x-ray background?	we propose a model for the source of the x-ray background (xrb) in which lowluminosity active nuclei (l&lt;10^43 erg/s) are obscured by nuclear starburstswithin the inner 100pc. the obscuring material covers most of the sky as seenfrom the central source, rather than being distributed in a toroidal structure,and hardens the averaged x-ray spectrum by photoelectric absorption. the gas isturbulent with velocity dispersion of a few 100 km/s and cloud-cloud collisionslead to copious star formation. although supernovae tend to produce outflows,most of the gas is trapped in the gravity field of the starforming clusteritself and the central black hole. a hot (t=10^6-10^7 k) virialised phase ofthis gas, comprising a few per cent of the total obscuring material, feeds thecentral engine of 10^7 solar masses through bondi accretion, at a sub-eddingtonrate appropriate for the luminosity of these objects. if starburst-obscuredobjects give rise to the residual xrb, then only 10 per cent of the accretionin active galaxies occurs close to the eddington limit in unabsorbed objects.

0810.0460	average fe k-alpha emission from distant agn	one of the most important parameters in the xrb (x-ray background) synthesismodels is the average efficiency of accretion onto smbh (super-massive blackholes). this can be inferred from the shape of broad relativistic fe lines seenin x-ray spectra of agn (active galactic nuclei). several studies have tried tomeasure the mean fe emission properties of agn at different depths with verydifferent results. we compute the mean fe emission from a large andrepresentative sample of agn x-ray spectra up to redshift ~ 3.5. we developed amethod of computing the rest-frame x-ray average spectrum and applied it to alarge sample (more than 600 objects) of type 1 agn from two complementarymedium sensitivity surveys based on xmm-newton data, the axis and xwas samples.this method makes use of medium-to-low quality spectra without needing to fitcomplex models to the individual spectra but with computing a mean spectrum forthe whole sample. extensive quality tests were performed by comparing real tosimulated data, and a significance for the detection of any feature over anunderlying continuum was derived. we detect with a 99.9% significance anunresolved fe k-alpha emission line around 6.4 kev with an ew ~ 90 ev, but wefind no compelling evidence of any significant broad relativistic emission linein the final average spectrum. deviations from a power law around the narrowline are best represented by a reflection component arising from cold orlow-ionization material. we estimate an upper limit for the ew of anyrelativistic line of 400 ev at a 3 sigma confidence level. we also marginallydetect the so-called iwasawa-taniguchi effect on the ew for the unresolvedemission line, which appears weaker for higher luminosity agn.

0811.1450	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey. vi. the x-ray luminosity function	we present the x-ray luminosity function of agn in three energy bands (soft:0.5-2 kev, hard: 2-10 kev and ultrahard: 4.5-7.5 kev). we have used the xmssurvey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallowersurveys for a total of 1009, 435 and 119 sources in the soft, hard andultrahard bands, respectively. we have modeled the intrinsic absorption of thehard and ultrahard sources (nh function) and computed the intrinsic x-rayluminosity function in all bands using a maximum likelihood fit technique to ananalytical model. we find that the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) is bestdescribed by a luminosity-dependent density evolution (ldde) model. our resultsshow a good overall agreement with previous results in the hard band, althoughwith slightly weaker evolution. our model in the soft band present slightdiscrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day xlfbeing significantly flatter. we find faster evolution in the agn detected inthe ultrahard band than those in the hard band. the fraction of absorbed agn inthe hard and ultrahard bands is dependent on the x-ray luminosity. we findevidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the hard band but notin the ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. our best-fit xlfshows that the high-luminosity agn are fully formed earlier than the lessluminous agn. the latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretionrate and mass density of the universe, according to an anti-hierarchical blackhole growth scenario.
