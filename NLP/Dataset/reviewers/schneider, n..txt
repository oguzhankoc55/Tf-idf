0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0909.2315	fragmentation and mass segregation in the massive dense cores of cygnus  x	we present plateau de bure interferometer observations obtained in continuumat 1.3 and 3.5 mm towards the six most massive and young (ir-quiet) dense coresin cygnus x. located at only 1.7 kpc, the cygnus x region offers theopportunity of reaching small enough scales (of the order of 1700 au at 1.3 mm)to separate individual collapsing objects. the cores are sub-fragmented with atotal of 23 fragments inside 5 cores. only the most compact core, cygx-n63,could actually be a single massive protostar with an envelope mass as large as60 msun. the fragments in the other cores have sizes and separations similar tolow-mass pre-stellar and proto-stellar condensations in nearby protoclusters,and are probably of the same nature. a total of 9 out of these 23 protostellarobjects are found to be probable precursors of ob stars with envelope massesranging from 6 to 23 msun. the level of fragmentation is globally higher thanin the turbulence regulated, monolithic collapse scenario, but is not as highas expected in a pure gravo-turbulent scenario where the distribution of massis dominated by low-mass protostars/stars. here, the fractions of the totalcore masses in the high-mass fragments are reaching values as high as 28, 44,and 100 % in cygx-n12, cygx-n53, and cygx-n63, respectively, much higher thanwhat an imf-like mass distribution would predict. the increase of thefragmentation efficiency as a function of density in the cores is proposed tobe due to the increasing importance of self-gravity leading to gravitationalcollapse at the scale of the dense cores. at the same time, the cores tend tofragment into a few massive protostars within their central regions. we aretherefore probably witnessing here the primordial mass segregation of clustersin formation.

1001.2453	the link between molecular cloud structure and turbulence	we aim to better understand how the spatial structure of molecular clouds isgoverned by turbulence. for that, we study the large-scale spatial distributionof low density molecular gas and search for characteristic length scales. weemploy a 35 square degrees 13co 1-0 molecular line survey of cygnus x andvisual extinction (a_v) maps of 17 galactic clouds to analyse the spatialstructure using the delta-variance method. this sample contains a large varietyof different molecular cloud types with different star forming activity. thedelta-variance spectra obtained from the a_v maps show differences betweenlow-mass star-forming (sf) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (gmc) interms of shape of the spectrum and its power-law exponent beta. low-mass sfclouds have a double-peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc(though with a large scatter around this value) and 4 pc. gmcs show nocharacteristic scale in the a_v-maps, which can partly be ascribed to adistance effect due to a larger line-of-sight (los) confusion. thedelta-variance for cygnus, determined from the 13co survey, showscharacteristic scales at 4 pc and 40 pc, either reflecting the filamentstructure and large-scale turbulence forcing or - for the 4 pc scale - thescale below which the 13co 1-0 line becomes optically thick. though there aredifferent processes that can introduce characteristic scales, i.e. geometry,decaying turbulence the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence(the sonic scale), line-of-sight effects and energy injection due to expandingsupernova shells, outflows, hii-regions, and the relative contribution of theseeffects strongly varies from cloud to cloud, it is remarkable that theresulting turbulent structure of molecular clouds shows similarcharacteristics.

1003.4198	dynamic star formation in the massive dr21 filament	the formation of massive stars is a highly complex process in which it is notclear whether the star-forming gas is in global gravitational collapse or in anequilibrium state, supported by turbulence. by studying one of the most massiveand dense star-forming regions in the galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc,the filament containing the well-known sources dr21 and dr21(oh), we expect tofind observational signatures that allow to discriminate between the two views.we use molecular line data from our 13co 1-0, cs 2-1, and n2h+ 1-0 survey ofthe cygnus x region obtained with the fcrao and high-angular resolutionobservations of co, cs, hco+, n2h+, and h2co, obtained with the iram 30mtelescope. we observe a complex velocity field and velocity dispersion in thedr21 filament in which regions of highest column-density, i.e. dense cores,have a lower velocity dispersion than the surrounding gas and velocitygradients that are not (only) due to rotation. infall signatures in opticallythick line profiles of hco+ and 12co are observed along and across the wholedr21 filament. from modelling the observed spectra, we obtain a typical infallspeed of 0.6 km/s and mass accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-3 msun/yrfor the two main clumps constituting the filament. these massive (4900 and 3300msun) clumps are both gravitationally contracting. all observed kinematicfeatures in the dr21 filament can be explained if it is formed by theconvergence of flows at large scales and is now in a state of globalgravitational collapse. whether this convergence of flows originated fromself-gravity at larger scales or from other processes can not be settled withthe present study. the observed velocity field and velocity dispersion areconsistent with results from (magneto)-hydrodynamic simulations where the coreslie at the stagnation points of convergent turbulent flows.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2634	the herschel first look at protostars in the aquila rift	as part of the science demonstration phase of the herschel mission of thegould belt key program, the aquila rift molecular complex has been observed.the complete ~ 3.3deg x 3.3deg imaging with spire 250/350/500 micron and pacs70/160 micron allows a deep investigation of embedded protostellar phases,probing of the dust emission from warm inner regions at 70 and 160 micron tothe bulk of the cold envelopes between 250 and 500 micron. we used a systematicdetection technique operating simultaneously on all herschel bands to build asample of protostars. spectral energy distributions are derived to measureluminosities and envelope masses, and to place the protostars in an m_env -l_bol evolutionary diagram. the spatial distribution of protostars indicatesthree star-forming sites in aquila, with w40/sh2-64 hii region by far therichest. most of the detected protostars are newly discovered. for a reducedarea around the serpens south cluster, we could compare the herschel census ofprotostars with spitzer results. the herschel protostars are younger than inspitzer with 7 class 0 ysos newly revealed by herschel. for the entire aquilafield, we find a total of ~ 45-60 class 0 ysos discovered by herschel. thisconfirms the global statistics of several hundred class~0 ysos that should befound in the whole gould belt survey.

1005.2746	herschel-spire observations of the polaris flare : structure of the  diffuse interstellar medium at the sub-parsec scale	we present a power spectrum analysis of the herschel-spire observations ofthe polaris flare, a high galactic latitude cirrus cloud midway between thediffuse and molecular phases. the spire images of the polaris flare reveal forthe first time the structure of the diffuse interstellar medium down to 0.01parsec over a 10 square degrees region. these exceptional observationshighlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellarmedium even in diffuse regions of the map. the power spectrum analysis showsthat the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a singlepower law with an exponent of -2.7 +- 0.1 at all scales from 30" to 8 degrees.that the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to thespire angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulenceextends down to the 0.01 pc scale. the power spectrum analysis also allows theidentification of a poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreementwith predictions of the cosmic infrared background level at spire wavelengths.finally, the comparison of the spire and iras 100 micron data of the polarisflare clearly assesses the capability of spire in maping diffuse emission overlarge areas.

1005.3115	filamentary structures and compact objects in the aquila and polaris  clouds observed by herschel	our pacs and spire images of the aquila rift and part of the polaris flareregions, taken during the science demonstration phase of herschel discoveredfascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physicallyrelated to compact cores. we briefly describe a new multi-scale,multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measuretheir parameters in our herschel images. all of the extracted starless cores(541 in aquila and 302 in polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrowfilaments. with its combination of the far-ir resolution and sensitivity,herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in aquilaand 59 arcsec in polaris (9000 au in both regions). our first results ofobservations with herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores mayoriginate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thinfilaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. to unravel the roles of theprocesses, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;these follow-up observations are planned.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3317	clouds, filaments and protostars: the herschel hi-gal milky way	we present the first results from the science demonstration phase for thehi-gal survey, the herschel key-project that will map the inner galactic planeof the milky way in 5 bands. we outline our data reduction strategy and presentsome science highlights on the two observed 2{\deg} x 2{\deg} tilesapproximately centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. the two regions areextremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows awidespread organization in filaments. source seds can be built for hundreds ofobjects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a goodfraction of them where the distance could be estimated. the compact sources(which we will call 'cores' in the following) are found for the most part to beassociated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averagedcolumn density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when athreshold around a_v of about 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l=59{\deg}field; a a_v value between 5 and 10 is found for the l=30{\deg} field, likelydue to the relatively larger distances of the sources. this outlines anexciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, whichlater fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level.in spite of core l/m ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, wefind core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. our results are ingood agreement with recent mhd numerical simulations of filaments forming fromlarge-scale converging flows.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

0708.2774	the earliest phases of high-mass star formation: a 3 square degree  millimeter continuum mapping of cygnus x	we have made an extensive 1.2mm continuum mosaicing study of the cygnus xmolecular cloud complex using the mambo cameras at the iram 30 m telescope. wethen compared our mm maps with mid-ir images, and have made sio(2-1) follow-upobservations of the best candidate progenitors of high-mass stars. our completestudy of cygnus x provides, for the first time, an unbiased census of massiveyoung stellar objects. we discover 129 massive dense cores, among which 42 areprobable precursors of high-mass stars. our study qualifies 17 cores as goodcandidates for hosting massive ir-quiet protostars, while up to 25 corespotentially host high-luminosity ir protostars. we fail to discover thehigh-mass analogs of pre-stellar dense cores in cygnusx, but find severalmassive starless clumps that might be gravitationally bound. since our sampleis derived from a single molecular complex and covers every embedded phase ofhigh-mass star formation, it gives the first statistical estimates of theirlifetime. in contrast to what is found for low-mass class 0 and class i phases,the ir-quiet protostellar phase of high-mass stars may last as long as theirbetter-known high-luminosity ir phase. the statistical lifetimes of high-massprotostars and pre-stellar cores (~ 3 x 10^4 yr and &lt; 10^3 yr) in cygnus x areone and two order(s) of magnitude smaller, respectively, than what is found innearby, low-mass star-forming regions. we therefore propose that high-masspre-stellar and protostellar cores are in a highly dynamic state, as expectedin a molecular cloud where turbulent processes dominate.

1009.0449	discovery of an extremely bright submillimeter galaxy at z=3.93	serendipitously we have discovered a rare, bright submillimeter galaxy (smg)with a flux density of 30 +/- 2 mjy at lambda=1.2mm, using mambo2 at the iram30-meter millimeter telescope. although no optical counterpart is known formm18423+5938, we were able to measure the redshift z=3.92960 +/- 0.00013 fromthe detection of co lines using the iram eight mixer receiver (emir). inaddition, by collecting all available photometric data in the far-infrared andradio to constrain its spectral energy distribution, we derive the firluminosity 4.8 10^14/m lsol and mass 6.0 10^9/m msol for its dust, allowing fora magnification factor m caused by a probable gravitational lens. thecorresponding star-formation rate is 8.3 10^4/m msol/yr. the detection of threelines of the co rotational ladder, and a significant upper limit for a fourthco line, allow us to estimate an h2 mass of between 1.9 10^11/m msol and 1.110^12/m msol. the two lines ci(3p1-3p0) and ci(3p2-3p1) were clearly detectedand yield a [ci]/[h2] number abundance between 1.4 10^-5 and 8.0 10^-5. upperlimits are presented for emission lines of hcn, hco^+, hnc, h_2o and othermolecules observed. the moderate excitation of the co lines is indicative of anextended starburst, and excludes the dominance of an agn in heating thishigh-redshift smg.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

1110.4311	site testing for submillimetre astronomy at dome c, antarctica	over the past few years a major effort has been put into the exploration ofpotential sites for the deployment of submillimetre astronomical facilities.amongst the most important sites are dome c and dome a on the antarcticplateau, and the chajnantor area in chile. in this context, we report onmeasurements of the sky opacity at 200 um over a period of three years at thefrench-italian station, concordia, at dome c, antarctica. we also present somesolutions to the challenges of operating in the harsh polar environ- ment. domec offers exceptional conditions in terms of absolute atmospheric transmissionand stability for submillimetre astron- omy. over the austral winter the pwvexhibits long periods during which it is stable and at a very low level (0.1 to0.3 mm). higher values (0.2 to 0.8 mm) of pwv are observed during the shortsummer period. based on observations over three years, a transmission of around50% at 350 um is achieved for 75% of the time. the 200-um window opens with atypical transmission of 10% to 15% for 25% of the time. dome c is one of thebest accessible sites on earth for submillimetre astronomy. observations at 350or 450 {\mu}m are possible all year round, and the 200-um window opens longenough and with a sufficient transparency to be useful. although the polarenvironment severely constrains hardware design, a permanent observatory withappropriate technical capabilities is feasible. because of the very goodastronomical conditions, high angular resolution and time series (multi-year)observations at dome c with a medium size single dish telescope would enableunique studies to be conducted, some of which are not otherwise feasible evenfrom space.

1111.1522	3d simulations of pillars formation around hii regions: the importance  of shock curvature	radiative feedback from massive stars is a key process to understand how hiiregions may enhance or inhibit star formation in pillars and globules at theinterface with molecular clouds. we aim to contribute to model the interactionsbetween ionization and gas clouds to better understand the processes at work.we study in detail the impact of modulations on the cloud-hii region interfaceand density modulations inside the cloud. we run three-dimensionalhydrodynamical simulations based on euler equations coupled with gravity usingthe heracles code. we implement a method to solve ionization/recombinationequations and we take into account typical heating and cooling processes atwork in the interstellar medium and due to ionization/recombination physics. uvradiation creates a dense shell compressed between an ionization front and ashock ahead. interface modulations produce a curved shock that collapses onitself leading to stable growing pillar-like structures. the narrower theinitial interface modulation, the longer the resulting pillar. we interpretpillars resulting from density modulations in terms of the ability of thesedensity modula- tions to curve the shock ahead the ionization front. the shockcurvature is a key process to understand the formation of structures at theedge of hii regions. interface and density modulations at the edge of the cloudhave a direct impact on the morphology of the dense shell during its formation.deeper in the cloud, structures have less influence due to the high densitiesreached by the shell during its expansion.

1111.7021	herschel observations of a potential core forming clump: perseus b1-e	we present continuum observations of the perseus b1-e region from theherschel gould belt survey. these herschel data reveal a loose grouping ofsubstructures at 160 - 500 micron not seen in previous submillimetreobservations. we measure temperature and column density from these data andselect the nine densest and coolest substructures for follow-up spectral lineobservations with the green bank telescope. we find that the b1-e clump has amass of ~ 100 solar masses and appears to be gravitationally bound.furthermore, of the nine substructures examined here, one substructure (b1-e2)appears to be itself bound. the substructures are typically less than a jeanslength from their nearest neighbour and thus, may interact on a timescale of ~1 myr. we propose that b1-e may be forming a first generation of dense cores,which could provide important constraints on the initial conditions ofprestellar core formation. our results suggest that b1-e may be influenced by astrong, localized magnetic field, but further observations are still required.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

1203.6307	globules and pillars seen in the [cii] 158 micron line with sofia	molecular globules and pillars are spectacular features, found only in theinterface region between a molecular cloud and an hii-region. impactingfar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation creates photon dominated regions (pdrs) ontheir surfaces that can be traced by typical cooling lines. with the greatreceiver onboard sofia we mapped and spectrally resolved the [cii] 158 micronatomic fine-structure line and the highly excited 12co j=11-10 molecular linefrom three objects in cygnus x (a pillar, a globule, and a strong iras source).we focus here on the globule and compare our data with existing spitzer dataand recent herschel open-time pacs data. extended [cii] emission and morecompact co-emission was found in the globule. we ascribe this emission mainlyto an internal pdr, created by a possibly embedded star-cluster with at leastone early b-star. however, external pdr emission caused by the excitation bythe cyg ob2 association cannot be fully excluded. the velocity-resolved [cii]emission traces the emission of pdr surfaces, possible rotation of the globule,and high-velocity outflowing gas. the globule shows a velocity shift of ~2 km/swith respect to the expanding hii-region, which can be understood as theresidual turbulence of the molecular cloud from which the globule arose. thisscenario is compatible with recent numerical simulations that emphazise theeffect of turbulence. it is remarkable that an isolated globule shows thesestrong dynamical features traced by the [cii]-line, but it demands moreobservational studies to verify if there is indeed an embedded cluster ofb-stars.

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1204.4508	a multi-scale, multi-wavelength source extraction method: getsources	we present a multi-scale, multi-wavelength source extraction algorithm calledgetsources. although it has been designed primarily for use in the far-infraredsurveys of galactic star-forming regions with herschel, the method can beapplied to many other astronomical images. instead of the traditional approachof extracting sources in the observed images, the new method analyzes finespatial decompositions of original images across a wide range of scales andacross all wavebands. it cleans those single-scale images of noise andbackground, and constructs wavelength-independent single-scale detection imagesthat preserve information in both spatial and wavelength dimensions. sourcesare detected in the combined detection images by following the evolution oftheir segmentation masks across all spatial scales. measurements of the sourceproperties are done in the original background-subtracted images at eachwavelength; the background is estimated by interpolation under the sourcefootprints and overlapping sources are deblended in an iterative procedure. inaddition to the main catalog of sources, various catalogs and images areproduced that aid scientific exploitation of the extraction results. weillustrate the performance of getsources on herschel images by extractingsources in sub-fields of the aquila and rosette star-forming regions. thesource extraction code and validation images with a reference extractioncatalog are freely available.

1206.1243	the spine of the swan: a herschel study of the dr21 ridge and filaments  in cygnus x	in order to characterise the cloud structures responsible for the formationof high-mass stars, we present herschel observations of the dr21 environment.maps of the column density and dust temperature unveil the structure of thedr21 ridge and several connected filaments. the ridge has column densitieslarger than 1e23/cm^2 over a region of 2.3 pc^2. it shows substructured columndensity profiles and branching into two major filaments in the north. themasses in the studied filaments range between 130 and 1400 msun whereas themass in the ridge is 15000 msun. the accretion of these filaments onto the dr21ridge, suggested by a previous molecular line study, could provide a continuousmass inflow to the ridge. in contrast to the striations seen in e.g., thetaurus region, these filaments are gravitationally unstable and form cores andprotostars. these cores formed in the filaments potentially fall into theridge. both inflow and collisions of cores could be important to drive theobserved high-mass star formation. the evolutionary gradient of star formationrunning from dr21 in the south to the northern branching is traced bydecreasing dust temperature. this evolution and the ridge structure can beexplained by two main filamentary components of the ridge that merged first inthe south.

1207.6400	3d simulations of globules and pillars formation around hii regions:  turbulence and shock curvature	we investigate the interplay between the ionization radiation from massivestars and the turbulence inside the surrounding molecular gas thanks to 3dnumerical simulations. we used the 3d hydrodynamical code heracles to model aninitial turbulent medium that is ionized and heated by an ionizing source.three different simulations are performed with different mean mach numbers (1,2 and 4). a non-equilibrium model for the ionization and the associated thermalprocesses was used. this revealed to be crucial when turbulent ram pressure isof the same order as the ionized-gas pressure. the density structures initiatedby the turbulence cause local curvatures of the dense shell formed by theionization compression. when the curvature of the shell is sufficient, theshell collapse on itself to form a pillar while a smaller curvature leads tothe formation of dense clumps that are accelerated with the shell and thereforeremain in the shell during the simulation. when the turbulent ram pressure ofthe cold gas is sufficient to balance the ionized-gas pressure, some dense-gasbubbles have enough kinetic energy to penetrate inside the ionized medium,forming cometary globules. this suggests a direct relation in the observationsbetween the presence of globules and the relative importance of the turbulencecompared to the ionized-gas pressure. the probability density functions presenta double peak structure when the turbulence is low relative to the ionized-gaspressure. this could be used in observations as an indication of the turbulenceinside molecular clouds.

1210.4930	worldwide site comparison for submillimetre astronomy	the most important limitation for ground-based submillimetre (submm)astronomy is the broad-band absorption of the total water vapour in theatmosphere above an observation site, often expressed as the precipitable watervapour (pwv). a long-term statistic on the pwv is thus mandatory tocharacterize the quality of an existing or potential site for observationalsubmm-astronomy. in this study we present a three-year statistic (2008-2010) ofthe pwv for ground-based telescope sites all around the world and forstratospheric altitudes relevant for sofia (stratospheric observatory forfar-infrared astronomy). the submm-transmission is calculated for typical pwvsusing an atmospheric model. we present the absolute pwv values for each sitesorted by year and time percentage. the pwv corresponding to the first decile(10%) and the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) are calculated and transmission curvesbetween 150 {\mu}m and 3 mm for these values are shown. the antarctic andsouth-american sites present very good conditions for submillimetre astronomy.the 350 {\mu}m and 450 {\mu}m atmospheric windows are open all year longwhereas the 200 {\mu}m atmospheric window opens reasonably for 25 % of the timein antarctica and the extremely high-altitude sites in chile. potentialinteresting new facilities are macon in argentinia and summit in greenland thatshow similar conditions as for example mauna kea (hawaii). for sofia, wepresent in more detail transmission curves for different altitudes (11 to 14km), pwv values, and higher frequencies (up to 5 thz). though the atmosphere atthese altitude is generally very transparent, the absorption at very highfrequencies becomes more important, partly caused by minor species. inconclusion, the method presented in this paper could identify sites on earthwith a great potential for submillimetre astronomy, and guide future sitetesting campaigns in situ.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1307.0022	herschel reveals massive cold clumps in ngc 7538	we present the first overview of the herschel observations of the nearbyhigh-mass star-forming region ngc 7538, taken as part of the herschel imagingstudy of ob young stellar objects (hobys) key programme. these pacs and spiremaps cover an approximate area of one square degree at five submillimeter andfar-infrared wavebands. we have identified 780 dense sources and classified 224of those. with the intention of investigating the existence of cold massivestarless or class 0-like clumps that would have the potential to formintermediate- to high-mass stars, we further isolate 13 clumps as the mostlikely candidates for followup studies. these 13 clumps have masses in excessof 40 m_sun and temperatures below 15 k. they range in size from 0.4 pc to 2.5pc and have densities between 3x10^3 cm^-3 to 4x10^4 cm^-3. spectral energydistributions are then used to characterize their energetics and evolutionarystate through a luminosity-mass diagram. ngc 7538 has a highly filamentarystructure, previously unseen in the dust continuum of existing submillimetersurveys. we report the most complete imaging to date of a large, evacuated ringof material in ngc 7538 which is bordered by many cool sources.

1307.2590	global collapse of molecular clouds as a formation mechanism for the  most massive stars	the relative importance of primordial molecular cloud fragmentation versuslarge-scale accretion still remains to be assessed in the context of massivecore/star formation. studying the kinematics of the dense gas surroundingmassive-star progenitors can tell us the extent to which large-scale flow ofmaterial impacts the growth in mass of star-forming cores. here we present acomprehensive dataset of the 5500(+/-800) msun infrared dark cloudsdc335.579-0.272 (hereafter sdc335) which exhibits a network of cold, dense,parsec-long filaments. atacama large millimeter array (alma) cycle 0observations reveal two massive star-forming cores, mm1 and mm2, sitting at thecentre of sdc335 where the filaments intersect. with a gas mass of545(+770,-385) msun contained within a source diameter of 0.05pc, mm1 is one ofthe most massive, compact protostellar cores ever observed in the galaxy. as awhole, sdc335 could potentially form an ob cluster similar to the trapeziumcluster in orion. alma and mopra single-dish observations of the sdc335 densegas furthermore reveal that the kinematics of this hub-filament system areconsistent with a global collapse of the cloud. these molecular-line data pointtowards an infall velocity v_{inf} =0.7(+/-0.2) km/s, and a total mass infallrate \dot{m}_{inf} = 2.5(+/-1.0) x 10^{-3} msun/yr towards the central pc-sizeregion of sdc335. this infall rate brings 750(+/-300) msun of gas to the centreof the cloud per free-fall time (t_{ff}=3x10^5 yr). this is enough to doublethe mass already present in the central pc-size region in 3.5(+2.2,-1.0) xt_{ff}. these values suggest that the global collapse of sdc335 over the pastmillion year resulted in the formation of an early o-type star progenitor atthe centre of the cloud's gravitational potential well.

1307.4756	young stellar clusters in the rosette molecular cloud. arguments against  triggered star formation	the rosette complex is a well studied region of the galactic plane whichpresents the apparent characteristics of a triggered star forming region. thisis however still debated as no strong evidence corroborates this statement. wefocus on characterizing the young stellar population in the rosette complex toimprove our understanding of the processes that regulate the star formation inthis region. we propose an original method that relies on the joint analysis ofthe star color and density in the near-infrared. it leads to mapping themolecular cloud spatial distribution and detecting the embedded clusters withtheir characterization in terms of member number and age estimation. we haveidentified 13 clusters, 2 of which are new discoveries, and we estimate thatthe total number of young stellar objects in the rosette ranges between 4000and 8000 members. we find that the age distribution of the young clusters isnot consistent with a general triggered scenario for the star formation in thismolecular cloud. this study proves that the rosette complex evolution is notgoverned by the influence of its ob star population. it suggests that thesimple morphological appearance of an active region is not sufficient toconclude much about the triggering role in the star formation process. ourmethod of constraining the cluster properties using ukidss and wise data hasproven efficient, and studies of other regions of the galactic plane woulddefinitely benefit from this approach.

1308.6112	large scale iram 30m co-observations in the giant molecular cloud  complex w43	we aim to give a full description of the distribution and location of densemolecular clouds in the giant molecular cloud complex w43. it has previouslybeen identified as one of the most massive star-forming regions in our galaxy.to trace the moderately dense molecular clouds in the w43 region, we initiatedan iram 30m large program, named w43-hero, covering a large dynamic range ofscales (from 0.3 to 140 pc). we obtained on-the-fly-maps in 13co (2-1) and c18o(2-1) with a high spectral resolution of 0.1 km/s and a spatial resolution of12". these maps cover an area of ~1.5 square degrees and include the two mainclouds of w43, as well as the lower density gas surrounding them. a comparisonwith galactic models and previous distance calculations confirms the locationof w43 near the tangential point of the scutum arm at a distance from the sunof approximately 6 kpc. the resulting intensity cubes of the observed regionare separated into sub-cubes, centered on single clouds which are then analyzedin detail. the optical depth, excitation temperature, and h2 column densitymaps are derived out of the 13co and c18o data. these results are then comparedwith those derived from herschel dust maps. the mass of a typical cloud isseveral 10^4 solar masses while the total mass in the dense molecular gas (&gt;100cm^-3) in w43 is found to be about 1.9e6 solar masses. probability distributionfunctions obtained from column density maps derived from molecular line dataand herschel imaging show a log-normal distribution for low column densitiesand a power-law tail for high densities. a flatter slope for the molecular linedata pdf may imply that those selectively show the gravitationally collapsinggas.

1308.6490	co outflows from high-mass class 0 protostars in cygnus-x	as natural consequences of the accretion process, outflows are one of the few(indirect) tracers of accretion. we used co(2-1) pdbi observations towards 6mdcs in cygnus-x, containing 9 high-mass cores, to investigate what theaccretion process and origin of the material feeding the precursors ofhigh-mass stars are. we compared our sample to low-mass objects from theliterature and developed simple evolutionary models to reproduce theobservables. we find that 8/9 high-mass cores drive clear individual outflowsas true equivalents of class 0 protostars in the high-mass regime. theremaining core has only a tentative outflow detection. it could be amongst thefirst examples of a true individual high-mass prestellar core. we find that themomentum flux of high-mass objects has a linear relation to the envelope mass,as a scale-up of the relations found for low-mass protostars. this suggests afundamental proportionality between accretion rates and mass reservoir,suggesting identical collapse timescales for all masses. we conclude that ifthe pre-collapse evolution is quasi-static, the fragmentation scale (which issimilar for all masses) would limit the size of the initial mass reservoirs,leading to shorter free-fall times for higher mass stars. however, as we findidentical collapse timescales for all masses, a significant turbulent/magneticsupport is needed to slow down the collapse of the more massive envelopes in aquasi-static view. with this support still to be discovered, and withindications of large dynamics in pre-collapse gas for high-mass star formation,we propose that such an identical collapse timescale implies that the initialdensities, which should set the duration of the collapse, should be similar forall masses. this suggests that the mass that incorporates massive stars has tohave been accreted in a dynamical way from larger scales than those of low-massstars.

1309.2332	two mass distributions in the l 1641 molecular clouds: the herschel  connection of dense cores and filaments in orion a	we present the herschel gould belt survey maps of the l1641 molecular cloudsin orion a. we extracted both the filaments and dense cores in the region. weidentified which of dense sources are proto- or pre-stellar, and studied theirassociation with the identified filaments. we find that although most (71%) ofthe pre-stellar sources are located on filaments there is still a significantfraction of sources not associated with such structures. we find that these twopopulations (on and off the identified filaments) have distinctly differentmass distributions. the mass distribution of the sources on the filaments isfound to peak at 4 solar masses and drives the shape of the cmf at highermasses, which we fit with a power law of the form dn/dlogm \proptom^{-1.4+/-0.4}. the mass distribution of the sources off the filaments, on theother hand, peaks at 0.8 solar masses and leads to a flattening of the cmf atmasses lower than ~4 solar masses. we postulate that this difference betweenthe mass distributions is due to the higher proportion of gas that is availablein the filaments, rather than in the diffuse cloud.

1311.3664	pillars and globules at the edges of h ii regions, confronting herschel  observations and numerical simulations	pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, suchas the eagle nebula (m16) and the rosette molecular cloud, and understandingtheir origin will help characterize triggered star formation. the formationmechanisms of these structures are still being debated. recent numericalsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell inon itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulentmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. the goal here is to testthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,m16 and rosette. the column density structure of the interface betweenmolecular clouds and h ii regions was characterized using column density mapsobtained from far-infrared imaging of the herschel hobys key programme. then,the disperse algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layersaround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. finally,their velocity structure was investigated using co data, and all observationalsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established fromsimulations. the column density profiles have revealed the importance ofcompression at the edge of the ionized gas. the velocity properties of thestructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict fromthe numerical simulations. we have identified a good candidate of a nascentpillar in the rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of theshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. globules have abulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initialturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shellcollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1401.7871	properties of starless and prestellar cores in taurus revealed by  herschel spire/pacs imaging	the density and temperature structures of dense cores in the l1495 cloud ofthe taurus star-forming region are investigated using herschel spire and pacsimages in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$mcontinuum bands. a sample consisting of 20 cores, selected using spectral andspatial criteria, is analysed using a new maximum likelihood technique,corefit, which takes full account of the instrumental point spread functions.we obtain central dust temperatures, $t_0$, in the range 6-12 k and find that,in the majority of cases, the radial density falloff at large radial distancesis consistent with the $r^{-2}$ variation expected for bonnor-ebert spheres.two of our cores exhibit a significantly steeper falloff, however, and sinceboth appear to be gravitationally unstable, such behaviour may haveimplications for collapse models. we find a strong negative correlation between$t_0$ and peak column density, as expected if the dust is heated predominantlyby the interstellar radiation field. at the temperatures we estimate for thecore centres, carbon-bearing molecules freeze out as ice mantles on dustgrains, and this behaviour is supported here by the lack of correspondencebetween our estimated core locations and the previously-published positions ofh$^{13}$co$^+$ peaks. on this basis, our observations suggest asublimation-zone radius typically $\sim 10^4$ au. comparison withpreviously-published n$_2$h$^+$ data at 8400 au resolution, however, shows noevidence for n$_2$h$^+$ depletion at that resolution.

1403.2996	understanding star formation in molecular clouds i. effects of  line-of-sight contamination on the column density structure	column-density maps of molecular clouds are one of the most importantobservables in the context of molecular cloud- and star-formation (sf) studies.with the herschel satellite it is now possible to determine the column densityfrom dust emission. we use observations and simulations to demonstrate how loscontamination affects the column density probability distribution function(pdf). we apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to themolecular clouds of auriga, maddalena, carina and ngc3603. in perfect agreementwith the simulations, we find that the pdfs become broader, the peak shifts tolower column densities, and the power-law tail of the pdf flattens aftercorrection. all pdfs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peakat av~2, a deviation point (dp) from the lognormal at av(dp)~4-5, and apower-law tail for higher column densities. assuming a density distributionrho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(pdf)=1.8,1.75, and 2.5 for auriga, carina, and ngc3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistentgravitational collapse). we find that low-mass and high-mass sf clouds displaydifferences in the overall column density structure. massive clouds assemblemore gas in smaller cloud volumes than low-mass sf ones. however, for bothcloud types, the transition of the pdf from lognormal shape into power-law tailis found at the same column density (at av~4-5 mag). low-mass and high-mass sfclouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likelydominated by supersonic turbulence. at higher column densities, collapse andexternal pressure can form the power-law tail. the relative importance of thetwo processes can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differencesin pdf and column density structure.

1404.2285	characterizing the structure of diffuse emission in hi-gal maps	we present a study of the structure of the galactic interstellar mediumthrough the delta-variance technique, related to the power spectrum and thefractal properties of infrared/sub-mm maps. through this method, it is possibleto provide quantitative parameters which are useful to characterize differentmorphological and physical conditions, and to better constrain the theoreticalmodels. in this respect, the herschel infrared galactic plane survey carriedout at five photometric bands from 70 to 500 \mu m constitutes an uniquedatabase for applying statistical tools to a variety of regions across themilky way. in this paper, we derive a robust estimate of the power-law portionof the power spectrum of four contiguous 2{\deg}x2{\deg} hi-gal tiles locatedin the third galactic quadrant (217{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 225{\deg}, -2{\deg} &lt; b &lt;0{\deg}). the low level of confusion along the line of sight testified by coobservations makes this region an ideal case. we find very different values ofthe power spectrum slope from tile to tile but also from wavelength towavelength (2 &lt; \beta &lt; 3), with similarities between fields attributable tocomponents located at the same distance. thanks to the comparison with modelsof turbulence, an explanation of the determined slopes in terms of the fractalgeometry is also provided, and possible relations with the underlying physicsare investigated. in particular, an anti-correlation between ism fractaldimension and star formation efficiency is found for the two main distancecomponents observed in these fields. a possible link between the fractalproperties of the diff?use emission and the resulting clump mass function isdiscussed.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

1406.1801	age, size, and position of h ii regions in the galaxy. expansion of  ionized gas in turbulent molecular clouds	this work aims at improving the current understanding of the interactionbetween h ii regions and turbulent molecular clouds. we propose a new method todetermine the age of a large sample of ob associations by investigating thedevelopment of their associated h ii regions in the surrounding turbulentmedium. using analytical solutions, one-dimensional (1d), and three-dimensional(3d) simulations, we constrained the expansion of the ionized bubble dependingon the turbulent level of the parent molecular cloud. a grid of 1d simulationswas then computed in order to build isochrone curves for h ii regions in apressure-size diagram. this grid of models allowed to date large sample of obassociations and was used on the h ii region discovery survey (hrds).analytical solutions and numerical simulations showed that the expansion of hii regions is slowed down by the turbulence up to the point where the pressureof the ionized gas is in a quasi-equilibrium with the turbulent ram pressure.based on this result, we built a grid of 1d models of the expansion of h iiregions in a profile based on larson laws. the 3d turbulence is taken intoaccount by an effective 1d temperature profile. the ages estimated by theisochrones of this grid agree well with literature values of well-known regionssuch as rosette, rcw 36, rcw 79, and m16. we thus propose that this method canbe used to give ages of young ob associations through the galaxy such as thehrds survey and also in nearby extra-galactic sources.

1406.3134	understanding star formation in molecular clouds ii. signatures of  gravitational collapse of irdcs	we analyse column density and temperature maps derived from herschel dustcontinuum observations of a sample of massive infrared dark clouds(g11.11-0.12, g18.82-0.28, g28.37+0.07, g28.53-0.25). we disentangle thevelocity structure of the clouds using 13co 1-0 and 12co 3-2 data, showing thatthese irdcs are the densest regions in massive giant molecular clouds and notisolated features. the probability distribution function (pdf) of columndensities for all clouds have a power-law distribution over all (high) columndensities, regardless of the evolutionary stage of the cloud: g11.11-0.12,g18.82-0.28, and g28.37+0.07 contain (proto)-stars, while g28.53-0.25 shows nosigns of star formation. this is in contrast to the purely log-normal pdfsreported for near/mid-ir extinction maps. we only find a log-normaldistribution for lower column densities, if we perform pdfs of the columndensity maps of the whole gmc in which the irdcs are embedded. by comparing thepdf slope and the radial column density profile, we attribute the power law tothe effect of large-scale gravitational collapse and to local free-fallcollapse of pre- and protostellar cores. independent from the pdf analysis, wefind infall signatures in the spectral profiles of 12co for g28.37+0.07 andg11.11-0.12, supporting the scenario of gravitational collapse. irdcs are thedensest regions within gmcs, which may be the progenitors of massive stars orclusters. at least some of the irdcs are probably the same features as ridges(high column density regions with n&gt;1e23 cm-2 over small areas), which weredefined for nearby ir-bright gmcs. because irdcs are only confined to thedensest (gravity dominated) cloud regions, the pdf constructed from this kindof a clipped image does not represent the (turbulence dominated) low columndensity regime of the cloud.

1407.6400	sio emission from low- and high-velocity shocks in cygnus-x massive  dense clumps	we used pdbi observations of sio (2-1) to investigate the morphology andprofile of the sio emission within several massive dense clumps (mdcs) incygnus-x. we find that most molecular outflows are detected in both sio and co,although there are some cases of co outflows with no sio counterpart. we find asignificant amount of narrow line sio emission that appears to be unrelated tooutflows. the fraction of the total sio luminosity that is not associated withoutflows is highly variable in the different mdcs (from 10% to 90%); this mightbe a problem when extrapolating outflow properties from sio luminositieswithout resolving individual outflows. the extent of the narrow sio emissionvaries from rather compact (~ 0.03 pc) to widespread (~0.2 pc), and itskinematics often differs from those found by other high-density tracers such ash13co+. we find that the least centrally concentrated clumps with the leastmassive protostellar cores have the most widespread narrow sio emission. inline with previous evidence of sio emission associated with low-velocityshocks, we propose an evolutionary picture to explain the existence anddistribution of narrow sio line profiles. in this scenario, the least centrallycondensed mdcs are at an early stage where the sio emission traces shocks fromthe large-scale collapse of material onto the mdc (e.g. cygx-n40). as the mdccollapses, the sio emission becomes more confined to the close surroundings ofcores, tracing the post-shock material from the infalling mdc against the densecores (e.g. cygx-n3, n12, and n48). at later stages, when single massiveprotostars are formed, the sio luminosity is largely dominated by powerfuloutflows, and the weaker narrow component shows perhaps the last remnants ofthe initial collapse (e.g. cygx-n53 and n63).

1501.05439	first detection of cf+ towards a high-mass protostar	we report the first detection of the j = 1 - 0 (102.6 ghz) rotational linesof cf+ (fluoromethylidynium ion) towards cygx-n63, a young and massiveprotostar of the cygnus x region. this detection occurred as part of anunbiased spectral survey of this object in the 0.8-3 mm range, performed withthe iram 30m telescope. the data were analyzed using a local thermodynamicalequilibrium model (lte model) and a population diagram in order to derive thecolumn density. the line velocity (-4 km s-1) and line width (1.6 km s-1)indicate an origin from the collapsing envelope of the protostar.  we obtain a cf+ column density of 4.10e11 cm-2. the cf+ ion is thought to bea good tracer for c+ and assuming a ratio of 10e-6 for cf+/c+, we derive atotal number of c+ of 1.2x10e53 within the beam. there is no evidence of carbonionization caused by an exterior source of uv photons suggesting that theprotostar itself is the source of ionization. ionization from the protostellarphotosphere is not efficient enough. in contrast, x-ray ionization from theaccretion shock(s) and uv ionization from outflow shocks could provide a largeenough ionizing power to explain our cf+ detection.  surprisingly, cf+ has been detected towards a cold, massive protostar with nosign of an external photon dissociation region (pdr), which means that the onlypossibility is the existence of a significant inner source of c+. this is animportant result that opens interesting perspectives to study the earlydevelopment of ionized regions and to approach the issue of the evolution ofthe inner regions of collapsing envelopes of massive protostars. the existenceof high energy radiations early in the evolution of massive protostars also hasimportant implications for chemical evolution of dense collapsing gas and couldtrigger peculiar chemistry and early formation of a hot core.

1507.02055	herschel observations of the w3 gmc (ii): clues to the formation of  clusters of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for investigating the formation of high-massstars and clusters. this second study of w3 within the hobys key programprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within w3 to further constrain theprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative mass distributions (cmds)were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction av. theshape of the pdf, typically represented with a lognormal function at low av"breaking" to a power-law tail at high av, is influenced by various processesincluding turbulence and self-gravity. the breaks can also be identified, oftenmore readily, in the cmds. the pdf break from lognormal (av(sf)= 6-10 mag)appears to shift to higher av by stellar feedback, so that high-massstar-forming regions tend to have higher pdf breaks. a second break at av &gt; 50mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. because such aprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in w3, this secondbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-massstars/clusters. stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving thelocal evolution and state of regions within w3. a high initial star formationefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leadingto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., collidingflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. this scenario would becompatible with the "convergent constructive feedback" model introduced in ourprevious herschel study.

1507.05926	a census of dense cores in the aquila cloud complex: spire/pacs  observations from the herschel gould belt survey	we present and discuss the results of the herschel gould belt surveyobservations in a ~11 deg^2 area of the aquila molecular cloud complex at d~260pc, imaged with the spire/pacs cameras from 70 to 500 micron. we identify acomplete sample of starless dense cores and embedded protostars in this region,and analyze their global properties and spatial distributions. we find a totalof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellarcores, and they will likely form stars in the future. we also detect 58protostellar cores. the core mass function (cmf) derived for the prestellarcores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (imf),supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the imfand the cmf. the global shift in mass scale observed between the cmf and theimf is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. bycomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 myr. we find a strongcorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and thedensest filaments. about 90% of the herschel-identified prestellar cores arelocated above a background column density corresponding to a_v~7, and ~75% ofthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unitlength &gt;~16 m_sun/pc. these findings support a picture wherein the cores makingup the peak of the cmf (and probably responsible for the base of the imf)result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginallysupercritical filaments. given that filaments appear to dominate the massbudget of dense gas at a_v&gt;7, our findings also suggest that the physics ofprestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic"efficiency" sfr/m_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process indense gas.

1507.08869	detection of two power-law tails in the probability distribution  functions of massive gmcs	we report the novel detection of complex high-column density tails in theprobability distribution functions (pdfs) for three high-mass star-formingregions (cepob3, monr2, ngc6334), obtained from dust emission observed withherschel. the low column density range can be fit with a lognormaldistribution. a first power-law tail starts above an extinction (av) of ~6-14.it has a slope of alpha=1.3-2 for the rho~r^-alpha profile for an equivalentdensity distribution (spherical or cylindrical geometry), and is thusconsistent with free-fall gravitational collapse. above av~40, 60, and 140, wedetect an excess that can be fitted by a flatter power law tail with alpha&gt;2.it correlates with the central regions of the cloud (ridges/hubs) of size ~1 pcand densities above 10^4 cm^-3. this excess may be caused by physical processesthat slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass towards higher densities.possible are: 1. rotation, which introduces an angular momentum barrier, 2.increasing optical depth and weaker cooling, 3. magnetic fields, 4. geometricaleffects, and 5. protostellar feedback. the excess/second power-law tail isclosely linked to high-mass star-formation though it does not imply a universalcolumn density threshold for the formation of (high-mass) stars.

1509.01819	a possible link between the power spectrum of interstellar filaments and  the origin of the prestellar core mass function	two major features of the prestellar cmf are: 1) a broad peak below 1 msun,presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) acharacteristic power-law slope, very similar to the salpeter slope of thestellar initial mass function (imf) at the high-mass end. while recent herschelobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar cmf is close to thethermal jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of thepower-law tail of the cmf/imf at the high-mass end is less clear. inutsuka(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-lawtail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum ofdensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellarturbulence. here, we report the statistical properties of the line-massfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with herschelusing a 1-d power spectrum analysis. the observed filament power spectra werefitted by a power-law function $(p_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ afterremoving the effect of beam convolution at small scales. a gaussian-likedistribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to thatof the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonickolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). an empirical correlation, $p^{0.5}(s_0) \propto&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of eachfilament power spectrum $p(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament$&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;$. finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along eachfilament $\sigma_{\rm m_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length$l$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{m_{line}} \propto l^{0.7}$. overall,our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the cmf/imfresults from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

1511.07145	the atlasgal survey: distribution of cold dust in the galactic plane.  combination with planck data	sensitive ground-based submillimeter surveys, such as atlasgal, provide aglobal view on the distribution of cold dense gas in the galactic plane. herewe use the 353 ghz maps from the planck/hfi instrument to complement theground-based apex/laboca observations with information on larger angularscales. the resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the innergalaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. we find examples of elongatedstructures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. corresponding to &gt;30 pcstructures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are veryextended and show large aspect ratios. furthermore, we assess the fraction ofdense gas ($f_{\rm dg}$), and estimate 2-5% (above a$_{\rm{v}}&gt;$7 mag) onaverage in the galactic plane. pdfs of the column density reveal the typicallyobserved log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high columndensities. as a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sightintegrated n-pdf of the inner galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excessto the total column density of $\sim2.2$%, above $n_{\rm h_2} =2.92\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. taking the total flux density, we provide anindependent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner galaxy of$\sim1\times10^9\,m_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates usingco emission. from the mass and $f_{\rm dg}$ we estimate a galactic sfr of $\dotm = 1.3\,m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the distribution of diffuse gas ishomogenous in the inner galaxy, the cmz stands out with a higher dense gasfraction. the low star formation efficiency of the milky way is well explainedby the low $f_{\rm dg}$ in the galactic ism, while the high $f_{\rm dg}$towards the cmz, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, inthat particular region of our galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneckfor star formation.

astro-ph;0312146	the carbon content in the galactic cygnusx/dr21 star forming region	observations of carbon bearing species are among the most importantdiagnostic probes of ongoing star formation. co is a surrogate for h$_2$ and isfound in the vicinity of star formation sites. there, [ci] emission is thoughtto outline the dense molecular cores and extend into the lower density regions,where the impinging interstellar uv radiation field plays a critical role forthe dissociation and ionization processes. emission of ionized carbon ([cii])is found to be even more extended than [ci] and is linking up with the ionizedmedium. these different tracers emphasize the importance of multi-wavelengthstudies to draw a coherent picture of the processes driving and driven by highmass star formation. until now, large scale surveys were only done with lowresolution, such as the cobe full sky survey, or were biased to a few selectedbright sources (e.g. yamamoto et al. 2001, schneider et al. 2003). a broaderbasis of unbiased, high-resolution observations of [ci], co, and [cii] may playa key role to probe the material processed by uv radiation.
