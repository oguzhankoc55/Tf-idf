0902.2591	the role of dwarf galaxies in building large stellar halos	the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smallergalactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. the pastdecade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, drivenin part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. multi-object spectroscopyenabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the milky wayand m31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. improvements inhigh-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundancepatterns of the milky way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained bygalactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.  these breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearbystars in the milky way and luminous red giant stars in m31 and local groupdwarf satellites. in the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allowobservations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, andthey will enable observations of individual stars far out in the galactic halo.the chemical abundance census now available for the milky way will becomepossible for our nearest neighbor, m31. velocity dispersion measurements nowavailable in m31 will become possible for systems beyond the local group suchas sculptor and m81 group galaxies. detailed studies of a greater number ofindividual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satelliteswill test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemicalevolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses indifferent environments.

0902.2759	galactic dynamics and local dark matter	the concordance lambda cold dark matter (lambda-cdm) model for the formationof structure in the universe, while remarkably successful at describingobservations of structure on large scales, continues to be challenged byobservations on galactic scales. fortunately, cdm models and their variousproposed alternatives make a rich variety of testable predictions that make thelocal group and our own milky way galaxy key laboratories for exploring darkmatter (dm) in this regime. however, some of the most definitive tests of localdm require microarcsecond astrometry of faint sources, an astrometric regimethat is a unique niche of sim lite. this chapter explores the important anddistinct contributions that can be made by sim lite in the exploration ofgalaxy dynamics and dm on galaxy scales and that have cosmologicalconsequences. key areas of potential sim lite exploration include (1) measuringthe shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark halo of themilky way and other nearby galaxies, (2) determining the orbits of galacticsatellites, which may be representatives of late infall from the hierarchicalformation of the milky way, (3) ascertaining the distribution of angularmomentum and orbital anisotropy of stars and globular clusters to the outerreaches of the galactic halo, dynamical properties that hold clues to the earlyhierarchical formation of the galaxy, (4) measuring the physical nature of dmby placing strong constraints on the phase space density in the cores of nearbydsph galaxies, and (5) reconstructing the dynamical history of the local groupthrough the determination of orbits and masses of its constituent galaxies.

0902.2835	properties of dark matter revealed by astrometric measurements of the  milky way and local galaxies	the fact that dark matter (dm), thus far, has revealed itself only on scalesof galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and theresponsibility to confront the age old mystery "what is the nature of matter?"by deriving basic data on the nature of dm - e.g., mass of its particle(s),present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in theuniverse, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering theproperties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantlyextending the standard models of particle physics. determining the mass of thedm particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle familyto which it (or they) belongs. beyond mass, there are issues of stability. thedm particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may becomeunstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. in bothcases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.  some key parameters of dm can most accurately be measured in the very nearbyuniverse because dm dominates the mass in the outer milky way (mw), in othergalaxies in the local group, and in the local group in its entirety. thepresence and amount of dm can be quantified by study of dynamical processesobservable in fine detail within these entities. precise measurements of 3-dvelocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellarsystems out to the edge of the galaxy can reveal "what is the shape,orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as"what is the total mass of the galaxy?"

0902.3197	"an era of precision astrophysics: connecting stars, galaxies and the  universe," an astro2010 science white paper	abridged: the golden age of astrophysics is upon us with both granddiscoveries (extra-solar planets, dark matter, dark energy) and precisioncosmology. fundamental understanding of the working of stars and galaxies iswithin reach, thanks to newly available precision measurements. we highlightthe importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.  distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change ourperception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the heliocentricmodel was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.  distance measurements are directly related to the history &amp; fate of the uni-verse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. the 1stmethod is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi-nosities (distances) are accurately known. the 2nd method relies on cosmolo-gical methods. to 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse h_0.  as stressed by the previous decadal report, "the fundamental goal of ...astrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ...formed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be." these questions canbe answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) galactic archeology: adetailed reconstruction of the formation history of the milky way and otherlocal group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the milky way and the age ofthe universe, and 3) h_0 and concordance cosmology.  these goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from theproposed sim-lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. theresults of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellarastrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics.

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0907.1688	a survey of uv bright sources behind the halo of m31	we have performed a wide-area ultraviolet (uv) imaging survey using thegalaxy evolution explorer (galex) to search for bright, point-like uv sourcesbehind m31's extended halo. our survey consisted of 46 pointings covering aneffective area of ~50 deg^2, in both the far-uv and near-uv channels. wecombined these data with optical r-band observations acquired with the wiynmosaic-1 imager on the kitt peak national observatory 0.9m wiyn telescope. ananalysis of the brightness and colors of sources matched between ourphotometric catalogs yielded ~100 uv-bright quasar candidates. we have obtaineddiscovery spectra for 76 of these targets with the kast spectrometer on thelick 3m telescope and confirm 30 active galactic nuclei and quasars, 29galaxies at z &gt; 0.02 including several early-type systems, 16 galactic stars(hot main-sequence stars), and one featureless source previously identified asa bl lac object. future uv spectroscopy of the brightest targets with thecosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble space telescope will enable asystematic search for diffuse gas in the extended halo of m31.

0908.1111	the dominance of metal-rich streams in stellar halos: a comparison  between substructure in m31 and lambda-cdm models	extensive photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the andromeda galaxy (m31)have discovered tidal debris features throughout m31's stellar halo. we presentstellar kinematics and metallicities in fields with identified substructurefrom our on-going splash survey of m31 red giant branch stars with the deimosspectrograph on the keck ii 10-m telescope. radial velocity criteria are usedto isolate members of the kinematically-cold substructures. the substructuresare shown to be metal-rich relative to the rest of the dynamically hot stellarpopulation in the fields in which they are found. we calculate the meanmetallicity and average surface brightness of the various kinematicalcomponents in each field, and show that, on average, higher surface brightnessfeatures tend to be more metal-rich than lower surface brightness features.simulations of stellar halo formation via accretion in a cosmological contextare used to illustrate that the observed trend can be explained as a naturalconsequence of the observed dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. asignificant spread in metallicity at a given surface brightness is seen in thedata; we show that this is due to time effects, namely the variation in thetime since accretion of the tidal streams' progenitor onto the host halo. weshow that in this theoretical framework a relationship between thealpha-enhancement and surface brightness of tidal streams is expected, whicharises from the varying times of accretion of the progenitor satellites ontothe host halo. thus, measurements of the alpha-enrichment, metallicity, andsurface brightness of tidal debris can be used to reconstruct the luminosityand time of accretion onto the host halo of the progenitors of tidal streams.

0909.3092	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. i.  the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present measurements of fe, mg, si, ca, and ti abundances for 388 radialvelocity member stars in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dsph), asatellite of the milky way. this is the largest sample of individual alphaelement (mg, si, ca, ti) abundance measurements in any single dsph. themeasurements are made from keck/deimos medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 a,r ~ 6500). based on comparisons to published high-resolution (r &gt;~ 20000)spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties ofsigma([fe/h]) = 0.14 and sigma([alpha/fe]) = 0.13. the sculptor [fe/h]distribution has a mean &lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long,metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. sculptorhas a larger fraction of stars with [fe/h] &lt; -2 than the milky way halo. wehave discovered one star with [fe/h] = -3.80 +/- 0.28, which is the mostmetal-poor star known anywhere except the milky way halo, but high-resolutionspectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances. as has beenpreviously reported based on high-resolution spectroscopy, [alpha/fe] insculptor falls as [fe/h] increases. the metal-rich stars ([fe/h] ~ -1.5) havelower [alpha/fe] than galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. thisindicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in sculptor than in thegalactic halo. we also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030 +/- 0.003dex per arcmin in [fe/h] and +0.013 +/- 0.003 dex per arcmin in [alpha/fe] outto 11 arcmin (275 pc). together, these measurements cast sculptor and possiblyother surviving dsphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which themetal-poor tail of the galactic halo formed.

0909.3298	the splash survey: a spectroscopic analysis of the metal-poor,  low-luminosity m31 dsph satellite andromeda x	andromeda x (and x) is a newly discovered low-luminosity m31 dwarf spheroidalgalaxy (dsph) found by zucker et al. (2007) in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss - york et al. 2000). in this paper, we present the first spectroscopicstudy of individual red giant branch stars in and x, as a part of the splashsurvey (spectroscopic and photometric landscape of andromeda's stellar halo).using the keck ii telescope and multiobject deimos spectrograph, we target twospectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocitiesfor ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. the velocityhistogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sightline: foreground milky way dwarfs at small negative velocities, m31 halo redgiants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike''consisting of 22 stars belonging to and x with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. bycarefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of thesestars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsicvelocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for and x, which for itssize, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of m/l =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming themass traces the light. based on the clean sample of member stars, we measurethe median metallicity of and x to be [fe/h] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slightradial metallicity gradient. the dispersion in metallicity is large,sigma([fe/h]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of itschemical enrichment products. we discuss the potential for better understandingthe formation and evolution mechanisms for m31's system of dsphs through(current) kinematic and chemical abundance studies, especially in relation tothe milky way sample.

0909.4540	the splash survey: a spectroscopic portrait of andromeda's giant  southern stream	the giant southern stream (gss) is the most prominent tidal debris feature inm31's stellar halo. the gss is composed of a relatively metal-rich, highsurface-brightness "core" and a lower metallicity, lower surface brightness"envelope." we present keck/deimos spectroscopy of red giant stars in sixfields in the vicinity of m31's gss and one field on stream c, an arc-likefeature on m31's se minor axis at r=60 kpc. several gss-related findings andmeasurements are presented here. we present the innermost kinematical detectionof the gss core to date (r=17 kpc). this field also contains the continuationof a second kinematically cold component originally seen in a gss core field atr=21 kpc. the velocity gradients of the gss and the second component in thecombined data set are parallel over a radial range of 7 kpc, suggesting apossible bifurcation in the line-of-sight velocities of gss stars. we alsopresent the first kinematical detection of substructure in the gss envelope.using kinematically identified samples, we show that the envelope debris has a~0.7 dex lower mean photometric metallicity and possibly higher intrinsicvelocity dispersion than the gss core. the gss is also identified in the fieldof the m31 dsph satellite and i; the gss in this field has a metallicitydistribution identical to that of the gss core. we confirm the presence of twokinematically cold components in stream c, and measure intrinsic velocitydispersions of ~10 and ~4 km/s. this compilation of the kinematical (meanvelocity, intrinsic velocity dispersion) and chemical properties of stars inthe gss core and envelope, coupled with published surface brightnessmeasurements and wide-area star-count maps, will improve constraints on theorbit and internal structure of the dwarf satellite progenitor.

1001.4560	where do wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers occur? a study of the  environments of close galaxy pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey	we study the environment of wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers at 0.75 &lt; z &lt;1.2 using close pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that thetypical environment of mixed and dry merger candidates is denser than that ofwet mergers, mostly due to the color-density relation. while the galaxycompanion rate (nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using n-bodysimulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually mergedecreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are morecommon in dense environments. after taking into account the merger probabilityof pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environmentdependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshiftrange we have probed. on the other hand, the fractional dry merger rateincreases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of redgalaxies in dense environments. we also find that the environment distributionof k+a galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixedmergers, suggesting a possible connection between k+a galaxies and wet and/orwet+mixed mergers. we conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regionsare the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-dayred-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their massaccretion in the last 8 billion years. our findings suggest that dry mergersare crucial in the mass-assembly of massive red galaxies in dense environments,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in galaxy groups and clusters.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1011.4516	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. ii.  catalog of stars in milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we present a catalog of fe, mg, si, ca, and ti abundances for 2961 red giantstars that are likely members of eight dwarf satellite galaxies of the milkyway (mw): sculptor, fornax, leo i, sextans, leo ii, canes venatici i, ursaminor, and draco. for the purposes of validating our measurements, we alsoobserved 445 red giants in mw globular clusters and 21 field red giants in themw halo. the measurements are based on keck/deimos medium-resolutionspectroscopy combined with spectral synthesis. we estimate uncertainties in[fe/h] by quantifying the dispersion of [fe/h] measurements in a sample ofstars in monometallic globular clusters. we estimate uncertainties in mg, si,ca, and ti abundances by comparing our medium-resolution spectroscopicmeasurements to high-resolution spectroscopic abundances of the same stars. forthis purpose, our deimos sample included 132 red giants with publishedhigh-resolution spectroscopy in globular clusters, the mw halo field, and dwarfgalaxies. the standard deviations of the differences in [fe/h] and [alpha/fe](the average of [mg/fe], [si/fe], [ca/fe], and [ti/fe]) between the two samplesis 0.15 and 0.16, respectively. this catalog represents the largest sample ofmulti-element abundances in dwarf galaxies to date. the next papers in thisseries draw conclusions on the chemical evolution, gas dynamics, and starformation histories from the catalog presented here. the wide range of dwarfgalaxy luminosity reveals the dependence of dwarf galaxy chemical evolution ongalaxy stellar mass.

1011.4937	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra.  iii. metallicity distributions of milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we present metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) for the central regionsof eight dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way: fornax, leo i and ii,sculptor, sextans, draco, canes venatici i, and ursa minor. we use thepublished catalog of abundance measurements from the previous paper in thisseries. the measurements are based on spectral synthesis of iron absorptionlines. for each mdf, we determine maximum likelihood fits for leaky box,pre-enriched, and extra gas (wherein the gas supply available for starformation increases before it decreases to zero) analytic models of chemicalevolution. although the models are too simplistic to describe any mdf indetail, a leaky box starting from zero metallicity gas fits none of thegalaxies except canes venatici i well. the mdfs of some galaxies, particularlythe more luminous ones, strongly prefer the extra gas model to the othermodels. only for canes venatici i does the pre-enriched model fit significantlybetter than the extra gas model. the best-fit effective yields of the lessluminous half of our galaxy sample do not exceed 0.02 z_sun, indicating thatgas outflow is important in the chemical evolution of the less luminousgalaxies. we surmise that the ratio of the importance of gas infall to gasoutflow increases with galaxy luminosity. strong correlations of average [fe/h]and metallicity spread with luminosity support this hypothesis.

1011.5221	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. iv.  alpha element distributions in milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we derive the star formation histories of eight dwarf spheroidal (dsph) milkyway satellite galaxies from their alpha element abundance patterns. nearly 3000stars from our previously published catalog (paper ii) comprise our data set.the average [alpha/fe] ratios for all dsphs follow roughly the same path withincreasing [fe/h]. we do not observe the predicted knees in the [alpha/fe] vs.[fe/h] diagram, corresponding to the metallicity at which type ia supernovaebegin to explode. instead, we find that type ia supernova ejecta contribute tothe abundances of all but the most metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -2.5) stars. we havealso developed a chemical evolution model that tracks the star formation rate,types ii and ia supernova explosions, and supernova feedback. without metalenhancement in the supernova blowout, massive amounts of gas loss define thehistory of all dsphs except fornax, the most luminous in our sample. all six ofthe best-fit model parameters correlate with dsph luminosity but not withvelocity dispersion, half-light radius, or galactocentric distance.

0709.2076	the stellar content of galaxy halos: a comparison between lambdacdm  models and observations of m31	recent observations have revealed that high surface-brightness, metal-richdebris is present over large regions of the andromeda (m31) stellar halo. weuse a set of numerical models to determine whether extended metal-rich debrisis expected to exist in galaxy halos formed in a hierarchical lambdacdmuniverse. we identify tidal debris in the simulations according to the currentbest surface brightness detection limits in m31 and demonstrate that brightfeatures in the outer halo regions usually originate from single satellites,with very little contamination from other sources due to the low probability oftidal streams from two overlapping accretion events. in contrast, high-surfacebrightness features in the inner halo often originate from multipleprogenitors. we also compare the age and metallicity distribution of the debriswith the well-mixed stellar halos in which they reside. we find thathigh-surface brightness tidal debris is produced almost exclusively byrelatively high mass progenitors (mstar ~ 10^7- 10^9 msun) and thus is expectedto be of moderate- to high-metallicity. similarly, in our models the smoothinner halo is expected to be metal-rich as this region has been built up mainlyfrom massive satellites. our results imply that the stellar populations ofsubstructure observed around external galaxies with current techniques shouldnot resemble old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidal satellites, nor the underlyingcomponent of the stellar halo.

1103.1400	hst/acs observations of rr lyrae stars in six ultra-deep fields of m31	we present hst/acs observations of rr lyrae variable stars in six ultra deepfields of the andromeda galaxy (m31), including parts of the halo, disk, andgiant stellar stream. past work on the rr lyrae stars in m31 has focused onvarious aspects of the stellar populations that make up the galaxy's halo,including their distances and metallicities. this study builds upon thisprevious work by increasing the spatial coverage (something that has beenlacking in previous studies) and by searching for these variable stars inconstituents of the galaxy not yet explored. besides the 55 rr lyrae stars wefound in our initial field located 11kpc from the galactic nucleus, we findadditional rr lyrae stars in four of the remaining five ultra deep fields asfollows: 21 in the disk, 24 in the giant stellar stream, 3 in the halo field21kpc from the galactic nucleus, and 5 in one of the halo fields at 35kpc. norr lyrae were found in the second halo field at 35kpc. the rr lyrae populationsof these fields appear to mostly be of oosterhoff i type, although the 11kpcfield appears to be intermediate or mixed. we will discuss the properties ofthese stars including period and reddening distributions. we calculatemetallicities and distances for the stars in each of these fields usingdifferent methods and compare the results, to an extent that has not yet beendone. we compare these methods not just on rr lyrae stars in our m31 fields,but also on a data set of milky way field rr lyrae stars.

0709.3747	m31 transverse velocity and local group mass from satellite kinematics	we present several different statistical methods to determine the transversevelocity vector of m31. the underlying assumptions are that the m31 satelliteson average follow the motion of m31 through space, and that the galaxies in theouter parts of the local group on average follow the motion of the local groupbarycenter through space. we apply the methods to the line-of-sight velocitiesof 17 m31 satellites, to the proper motions of the 2 satellites m33 and ic 10,and to the line-of-sight velocities of 5 galaxies near the local group turnaround radius, respectively. this yields 4 independent but mutually consistentdeterminations of the heliocentric m31 transverse velocities in the west andnorth directions, with weighted averages &lt;v_w&gt; = -78+/-41 km/s and &lt;v_n&gt; =-38+/-34 km/s. the galactocentric tangential velocity of m31 is 42 km/s, with1-sigma confidence interval v_tan &lt;= 56 km/s. the implied m31-milky way orbitis bound if the total local group mass m exceeds 1.72^{+0.26}_{-0.25}x10^{12}solar masses. if indeed bound, then the timing argument combined with the knownage of the universe implies that m = 5.58^{+0.85}_{-0.72}x10^{12} solar masses.this is on the high end of the allowed mass range suggested by cosmologicallymotivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of m31 and the milkyway, respectively. it is therefore possible that the timing mass is anoverestimate of the true mass, especially if one takes into account recentresults from the millennium simulation that show that there is also atheoretical uncertainty of 41 percent (gaussian dispersion) in timing massestimates. the m31 transverse velocity implies that m33 is in a tightly boundorbit around m31. this may have led to some tidal deformation of m33. it willbe worthwhile to search for observational evidence of this.

1107.0911	structure and population of the ngc55 stellar halo from a  subaru/suprime-cam survey	as part of our survey of galactic stellar halos, we investigate the structureand stellar populations of the northern outer part of the stellar halo inngc55, a member galaxy of the sculptor group, using deep and wide-field v- andi-band images taken with subaru/suprime-cam. based on the analysis of thecolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for red-giant-branch (rgb) stars, we derive atip of rgb (trgb)-based distance modulus to the galaxy of (m-m)_0 = 26.58 +/-0.11 (d = 2.1 +/- 0.1 mpc). from the stellar density maps, we detect theasymmetrically disturbed, thick disk structure and two metal-poor overdensesubstructures in the north region of ngc55, which may correspond to mergerremnants associated with hierarchical formation of ngc55's halo. in addition,we identify a diffuse metal-poor halo extended out to at least z ~ 16 kpc fromthe galactic plane. the surface-brightness profiles toward the z-directionperpendicular to the galactic plane suggest that the stellar densitydistribution in the northern outer part of ngc55 is described by a locallyisothermal disk at z &lt;~ 6 kpc and a likely diffuse metal-poor halo with v-bandsurface brightness of mu_v &gt;~ 32 mag arcsec^{-2}, where old rgb stars dominate.we derive the metallicity distributions (mds) of these structures on the basisof the photometric comparison of rgb stars with the theoretical stellarevolutionary models. the mds of the thick disk structures show the peak andmean metallicity of [fe/h]peak ~ -1.4 and [fe/h]mean ~ -1.7, respectively,while the outer substructures show more metal-poor features than the thick diskstructure. combined with the current results with our previous study for m31'shalo, we discuss the possible difference in the formation process of stellarhalos among different hubble types.

1112.1067	the splash survey: spectroscopy of 15 m31 dwarf spheroidal satellite  galaxies	we present a resolved-star spectroscopic survey of 15 dwarf spheroidal (dsph)satellites of the andromeda galaxy (m31) as part of the spectroscopic andphotometric landscape of andromeda's stellar halo (splash) project. we filterforeground contamination from milky way (mw) stars, noting that mw substructureis evident in this contaminant sample. we also filter m31 halo field giantstars, and identify the remainder as probable dsph members. we then use thesemembers to determine the kinematical properties of the dsphs. for the firsttime, we confirm that and xviii, xxi, and xxii show kinematics consistent withbound, dark matter-dominated galaxies. from the velocity dispersions for thefull sample of dsphs we determine masses, which we combine with the size andluminosity of the galaxies to produce mass-size-luminosity scaling relations.with these scalings we determine that the m31 dsphs are fully consistent withthe mw dsphs, suggesting that the well-studied mw satellite population providesa fair sample for broader conclusions. we also estimate dark matter halo massesof the satellites, and find that there is no sign that the luminosity of thesegalaxies depends on their dark halo mass, a result consistent with what is seenfor mw dwarfs. two of the m31 dsphs (and xv, xvi) have estimated maximumcircular velocities smaller than 12 km/s (to 1sigma), which likely places themwithin the lowest mass dark matter halos known to host stars (along with bootesi of the mw). finally, we use the systemic velocities of the m31 satellites toestimate the total mass of the m31 halo: within 139 kpc, m31's mass is 8 +4.1 -3.7 x 10^11 corresponding to a virial mass for m31's dark matter halo of 1.2+0.9 -0.7 x 10^12, consistent with previous results.

1202.2897	internal stellar kinematics of m32 from the splash survey: dark halo  constraints and the formation of compact elliptical galaxies	as part of the splash survey of the andromeda galaxy (m31) and its neighbors,we have obtained keck/deimos spectra of the compact elliptical (ce) satellitem32. this is the first resolved-star kinematical study of any ce galaxy. incontrast to previous studies that extended out to r&lt;30"~1re~100pc, we measurethe rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile out to r~250" and higherorder gauss-hermite moments out to r~70". we achieve this by combiningintegrated-light spectroscopy at small radii (where crowding/blending aresevere) with resolved stellar spectroscopy at larger radii, using spatial andkinematical information to statistically account for m31 contamination. therotation curve and velocity dispersion profile extend well beyond the radius(r~150") where the isophotes are distorted. unlike ngc 205, another close dwarfcompanion of m31, m32's kinematic are regular and symmetric and do not showobvious sharp gradients across the region of isophotal elongation and twists.we interpret m32's kinematics using three-integral axisymmetric dynamicalequilibrium models constructed using schwarzschild's orbit superpositiontechnique. models with a constant m/l can fit the data remarkably well.however, since such a model requires an increasing tangential anisotropy withradius, invoking the presence of an extended dark halo may be more plausible.such an extended dark halo is definitely required to bind a half-dozenfast-moving stars observed at the largest radii, but these stars may not be anequilibrium component of m32. the observed regularity of the stellarkinematics, as well as the possible detection of an extended dark halo, areunexpected if m31 tides are significant at large radii. while these findings bythemselves do not rule out tidal models for ce formation, they suggest thattidal stripping may not be as significant for shaping ce galaxies as has oftenbeen argued.

1203.3192	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: design, observations, data reduction,  and redshifts	we describe the design and data sample from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey,the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z ~ 1completed to date. the survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massivegalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down toabsolute magnitude m_b = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on thedeimos spectrograph at keck observatory. deep2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude ofr_ab=24.1. objects with z &lt; 0.7 are rejected based on bri photometry in threeof the four deep2 fields, allowing galaxies with z &gt; 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. approximatelysixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. most of thetargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z~ 1.45. the deimos 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers highspectral resolution (r~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and uniqueinternal kinematic information. extensive ancillary data are available in thedeep2 fields, particularly in the extended groth strip, which has evolved intoone of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. deep2 surpasses otherdeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshiftaccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. we alsoprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the deep2 survey thus far.this paper is intended as a handbook for users of the deep2 data release 4,which includes all deep2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for thepublicly-available deep2 deimos data reduction pipelines.

1203.3899	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the voronoi-delaunay method catalog of  galaxy groups	we present a public catalog of galaxy groups constructed from thespectroscopic sample of galaxies in the fourth data release from the deep2galaxy redshift survey, including the extended groth strip (egs). the catalogcontains 1165 groups with two or more members in the egs over the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;1.5 and 1295 groups at z&gt;0.6 in the rest of deep2. 25% of egsgalaxies and 14% of high-z deep2 galaxies are assigned to galaxy groups. thegroups were detected using the voronoi-delaunay method, after it has beenoptimized on mock deep2 catalogs following similar methods to those employed ingerke et al. (2005). in the optimization effort, we have taken particular careto ensure that the mock catalogs resemble the data as closely as possible, andwe have fine-tuned our methods separately on mocks constructed for the egs andthe rest of deep2. we have also probed the effect of the assumed cosmology onour inferred group-finding efficiency by performing our optimization on threedifferent mock catalogs with different background cosmologies, finding largedifferences in the group-finding success we can achieve for these differentmocks. using the mock catalog whose background cosmology is most consistentwith current data, we estimate that the deep2 group catalog is 72% complete and61% pure (74% and 67% for the egs) and that the group-finder correctlyclassifies 70% of galaxies that truly belong to groups, with an additional 46%of interloper galaxies contaminating the catalog (66% and 43% for the egs).(abridged)

1204.4455	the splash survey: kinematics of andromeda's inner spheroid	the combination of large size, high stellar density, high metallicity, andsersic surface brightness profile of the spheroidal component of the andromedagalaxy (m31) within r_proj ~ 20 kpc suggest that it is unlike any subcomponentof the milky way. in this work we capitalize on our proximity to and externalview of m31 to probe the kinematical properties of this "inner spheroid." weemploy a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) analysis of resolved stellarkinematics from keck/deimos spectra of 5651 red giant branch stars todisentangle m31's inner spheroid from its stellar disk. we measure the meanvelocity and dispersion of the spheroid in each of five spatial bins afteraccounting for a locally cold stellar disk as well as the giant southern streamand associated tidal debris. for the first time, we detect significant spheroidrotation (v_rot ~ 50 km/s) beyond r_proj ~ 5 kpc. the velocity dispersiondecreases from about 140 km/s at r_proj = 7 kpc to 120 km/s at r_proj = 14 kpc,consistent to 2 sigma with existing measurements and models. we calculate theprobability that a given star is a member of the spheroid and find that thespheroid has a significant presence throughout the spatial extent of oursample. lastly, we show that the flattening of the spheroid is due to velocityanisotropy in addition to rotation. though this suggests that the innerspheroid of m31 more closely resembles an elliptical galaxy than a typicalspiral galaxy bulge, it should be cautioned that our measurements are muchfarther out (2 - 14 r_eff) than for the comparison samples.

1205.6864	the m31 velocity vector. ii. radial orbit towards the milky way and  implied local group mass	we determine the velocity vector of m31 with respect to the milky way and usethis to constrain the mass of the local group, based on hst proper-motionmeasurements presented in paper i. we construct n-body models for m31 tocorrect the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal tom31. we also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using thekinematics of satellite galaxies of m31 and the local group. all estimates aremutually consistent, and imply a weighted average m31 heliocentric transversevelocity of (v_w,v_n) = (-125.2+/-30.8, -73.8+/-28.4) km/s. we correct for thereflex motion of the sun using the most recent insights into the solar motionwithin the milky way. this implies a radial velocity of m31 with respect to themilky way of v_rad = -109.3+/-4.4 km/s, and a tangential velocity v_tan = 17.0km/s (&lt;34.3 km/s at 1-sigma confidence). hence, the velocity vector of m31 isstatistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit towards themilky way. we revise prior estimates for the local group timing mass, includingcorrections for cosmic bias and scatter. bayesian combination with other massestimates yields m_lg = m_mw(vir) + m_m31(vir) = (3.17 +/- 0.57) x 10^12 solarmasses. the velocity and mass results imply at 95% confidence that m33 is boundto m31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations.(abridged)

1206.2619	a spectroscopic survey of andromeda's western shelf	the andromeda galaxy (m31) shows many tidal features in its halo, includingthe giant southern stream (gss) and a sharp ledge in surface density on itswestern side (the w shelf). using deimos on the keck telescope, we obtainradial velocities of m31's giant stars along its nw minor axis, in a radialrange covering the w shelf and extending beyond its edge. in the space ofvelocity versus radius, the sample shows the wedge pattern expected from aradial shell, which is detected clearly here for the first time. this confirmspredictions from an earlier model of formation of the gss, which proposed thatthe w shelf is a shell from the third orbital wrap of the same tidal debrisstream that produces the gss, with the main body of the progenitor lying in thesecond wrap. we calculate the distortions in the shelf wedge pattern expectedfrom its outward expansion and angular momentum, and show that these effectsare echoed in the data. in addition, a hot, relatively smooth spheroidpopulation is clearly present. we construct a bulge-disk-halo n-body model thatagrees with surface brightness and kinematic constraints, and combine it with asimulation of the gss. from the contrasting kinematic signatures of the hotspheroid and shelf components, we decompose the observed stellar metallicitydistribution into contributions from each component using a non-parametricmixture model. the shelf component's metallicity distribution matches previousobservations of the gss superbly, further strengthening the evidence they areconnected and bolstering the case for a massive progenitor of this stream.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

1209.2416	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ii. tracing the inner m31  halo with blue horizontal branch stars	we attempt to constrain the shape of m31's inner stellar halo by tracing thesurface density of blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars at galactocentricdistances ranging from 2 kpc to 35 kpc. our measurements make use of resolvedstellar photometry from a section of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury(phat) survey, supplemented by several archival hubble space telescopeobservations. we find that the ratio of bhb to red giant stars is relativelyconstant outside of 10 kpc, suggesting that the bhb is as reliable a tracer ofthe halo population as the red giant branch. in the inner halo, we do notexpect bhb stars to be produced by the high metallicity bulge and disk, makingbhb stars a good candidate to be a reliable tracer of the stellar halo to muchsmaller galactocentric distances. if we assume a power-law profile r^(-\alpha)for the 2-d projected surface density bhb distribution, we obtain ahigh-quality fit with a 2-d power-law index of \alpha=2.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2} outsideof 3 kpc, which flattens to \alpha&lt;1.2 inside of 3 kpc. this slope isconsistent with previous measurements but is anchored to a radial baseline thatextends much farther inward. finally, assuming azimuthal symmetry and aconstant mass-to-light ratio, the best-fitting profile yields a total halostellar mass of 2.1^{+1.7}_{-0.4} x 10^9 m_sun. these properties are comparablewith both simulations of stellar halo formation formed by satellite disruptionalone, and with simulations that include some in situ formation of halo stars.

1210.3362	global properties of m31's stellar halo from the splash survey. i.  surface brightness profile	we present the surface brightness profile of m31's stellar halo out to aprojected radius of 175 kpc. the surface brightness estimates are based onconfirmed samples of m31 red giant branch stars derived from keck/deimosspectroscopic observations. a set of empirical spectroscopic and photometricm31 membership diagnostics is used to identify and reject foreground andbackground contaminants. this enables us to trace the stellar halo of m31 tolarger projected distances and fainter surface brightnesses than previousphotometric studies. the surface brightness profile of m31's halo follows apower-law with index -2.2 +/- 0.2 and extends to a projected distance of atleast ~175 kpc (~ 2/3 of m31's virial radius), with no evidence of a downwardbreak at large radii. the best-fit elliptical isophotes have b/a=0.94 with themajor axis of the halo aligned along the minor axis of m31's disk, consistentwith a prolate halo, although the data are also consistent with m31's halohaving spherical symmetry. the fact that tidal debris features arekinematically cold is used to identify substructure in the spectroscopic fieldsout to projected radii of 90 kpc, and investigate the effect of thissubstructure on the surface brightness profile. the scatter in the surfacebrightness profile is reduced when kinematically identified tidal debrisfeatures in m31 are statistically subtracted; the remaining profile indicates acomparatively diffuse stellar component to m31's stellar halo exists to largedistances. beyond 90 kpc, kinematically cold tidal debris features can not beidentified due to small number statistics; nevertheless, the significantfield-to-field variation in surface brightness beyond 90 kpc suggests that theoutermost region of m31's halo is also comprised to a significant degree ofstars stripped from accreted objects.

1303.1222	measuring detailed chemical abundances from co-added medium resolution  spectra i. tests using milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies and globular  clusters	the ability to measure metallicities and {\alpha}-element abundances inindividual red giant branch (rgb) stars using medium-resolution spectra ($r\approx 6000$) is a valuable tool for deciphering the nature of milky way dwarfsatellites and the history of the galactic halo. extending such studies to moredistant systems like andromeda is beyond the ability of the current generationof telescopes, but by co-adding the spectra of similar stars, we can attain thenecessary signal-to-noise ratio to make detailed abundance measurements. inthis paper, we present a method to determine metallicities and {\alpha}-elementabundances using the co-addition of medium resolution spectra. we test themethod of spectral co-addition using high-s/n spectra of more than 1300 rgbstars from milky way globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies obtainedwith the keck ii telescope/deimos spectrograph. we group similar stars usingphotometric criteria and compare the weighted ensemble average abundances([fe/h], [mg/fe], [si/fe], [ca/fe] and [ti/fe]) of individual stars in eachgroup with the measurements made on the corresponding co-added spectrum. wefind a high level of agreement between the two methods, which permits us toapply this co-added spectra technique to more distant rgb stars, like stars inthe m31 satellite galaxies. this paper outlines our spectral co-addition andabundance measurement methodology and describes the potential biases in makingthese measurements.

1307.3219	inferring the andromeda galaxy's mass from its giant southern stream  with bayesian simulation sampling	m31 has a giant stream of stars extending far to the south and a great dealof other tidal debris in its halo, much of which is thought to be directlyassociated with the southern stream. we model this structure by means ofbayesian sampling of parameter space, where each sample uses an n-bodysimulation of a satellite disrupting in m31's potential. we combine constraintson stellar surface densities from the isaac newton telescope survey of m31 withkinematic data and photometric distances. this combination of data tightlyconstrains the model, indicating a stellar mass at last pericentric passage oflog(m_s / msun) = 9.5+-0.1, comparable to the lmc. any existing remnant of thesatellite is expected to lie in the ne shelf region beside m31's disk, atvelocities more negative than m31's disk in this region. this rules out theprominent satellites m32 or ngc 205 as the progenitor, but an overdensityrecently discovered in m31's ne disk sits at the edge of the progenitorlocations found in the model. m31's virial mass is constrained in this model tobe log(m200) = 12.3+-0.1, alleviating the previous tension betweenobservational virial mass estimates and expectations from the general galacticpopulation and the timing argument. the techniques used in this paper, whichshould be more generally applicable, are a powerful method of extractingphysical inferences from observational data on tidal debris structures.

1308.4417	hst/wfc3 observations of low-mass globular clusters am 4 and palomar 13:  physical properties and implications for mass loss	we investigate the loss of low-mass stars in two of the faintest globularclusters known, am 4 and palomar 13 (pal 13), using hst/wfc3 f606w and f814wphotometry. to determine the physical properties of each cluster --- age, mass,metallicity, extinction, present day mass function (mf) --- we use the maximumlikelihood color-magnitude diagram (cmd) fitting program match and thedartmouth, padova and basti stellar evolution models. for am 4, the dartmouthmodels provide the best match to the cmd and yield an age of &gt;13 gyr,metallicity log z/z_solar = -1.68 +/- 0.08, a distance modulus (m-m)_v = 17.47+/- 0.03 and reddening a_v = 0.19 +/- 0.02. for pal 13 the dartmouth modelsgive an age of 13.4 +/- 0.5 gyr, log z/z_solar = -1.55 +/- 0.06, (m-m)_v =17.17 +/- 0.02 and a_v = 0.43 +/- 0.01. we find that the systematicuncertainties due to choice in assumed stellar model greatly exceed the randomuncertainties, highlighting the importance of using multiple stellar modelswhen analyzing stellar populations. assuming a single-sloped power law mf, wefind that am 4 and pal 13 have spectral indices alpha = +0.68 +/- 0.34 andalpha = -1.67 +/- 0.25 (where a salpeter mf has alpha = +1.35), respectively.comparing our derived slopes with literature measurements of cluster integratedmagnitude (m_v) and mf slope indicates that am 4 is an outlier. its mf slope issubstantially steeper than clusters of comparable luminosity, while pal 13 hasa mf in line with the general trend. we discuss both primordial and dynamicalorigins for the unusual mf slope of am 4 and tentatively favor the dynamicalscenario. however, mf slopes of more low luminosity clusters are needed toverify this hypothesis.

1402.7264	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury v: ages and masses of the  year 1 stellar clusters	we present ages and masses for 601 star clusters in m31 from the analysis ofthe six filter integrated light measurements from near ultraviolet to nearinfrared wavelengths, made as part of the panchromatic hubble andromedatreasury (phat). we derive the ages and masses using a probabilistic technique,which accounts for the effects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initialmass function. tests on synthetic data show that this method, in conjunctionwith the exquisite sensitivity of the phat observations and their broadwavelength baseline, provides robust age and mass recovery for clusters rangingfrom $\sim 10^2 - 2 \times 10^6 m_\odot$. we find that the cluster agedistribution is consistent with being uniform over the past $100$ myr, whichsuggests a weak effect of cluster disruption within m31. the age distributionof older ($&gt;100$ myr) clusters fall towards old ages, consistent with apower-law decline of index $-1$, likely from a combination of fading anddisruption of the clusters. we find that the mass distribution of the wholesample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of$-1.9 \pm 0.1$ over the range of $10^3-3 \times 10^5 m_\odot$. however, if wesubdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we find that the agedistributions remain unchanged. however, the mass spectral index variessignificantly, showing best fit values between $-2.2$ and $-1.8$, with theshallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. we explore therobustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the clustermass function may vary with respect to environment.

1407.0829	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. progression of large-scale  star formation across space and time in m31	we investigate the clustering of early-type stars younger than 300 myr ongalactic scales in m31. based on the stellar photometric catalogs of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury program that also provides stellarparameters derived from the individual energy distributions, our analysis isfocused on the young stars in three star-forming regions, located atgalactocentric distances of about 5, 10, and 15 kpc, corresponding to the innerspiral arms, the ring structure, and the outer arm, respectively. we apply thetwo-point correlation function to our selected sample to investigate theclustering behavior of these stars across different time- and length-scales. wefind that young stellar structure survives across the whole extent of m31longer than 300 myr. stellar distribution in all regions appears to beself-similar, with younger stars being systematically more strongly clusteredthan the older, which are more dispersed. the observed clustering isinterpreted as being induced by turbulence, the driving source for which isprobably gravitational instabilities driven by the spiral arms, which arestronger closer to the galactic centre.

0803.3476	was the andromeda stream produced by a disk galaxy?	the halo region of m31 exhibits a startling level of stellar inhomogeneities,the most prominent of which is the "giant southern stream". our previousanalysis indicates that this stream, as well as several other observedfeatures, are products of the tidal disruption of a single satellite galaxywith stellar mass ~10^9 solar masses less than 1 gyr ago. here we show that thespecific observed morphology of the stream and halo debris favors a cold,rotating, disk-like progenitor over a dynamically hot, non-rotating one. theseobserved characteristics include the asymmetric distribution of stars along thestream cross-section and its metal-rich core/metal-poor sheath structure. wefind that a disk-like progenitor can also give rise to arc-like features on theminor axis at certain orbital phases that resemble the recently discoveredminor-axis "streams", even reproducing the lower observed metallicity of thesestreams. though interpreted by the discoverers as new, independent tidalstreams, our analysis suggests that these minor-axis streams may alternativelyarise from the progenitor of the giant southern stream. overall, our studypoints the way to a more complete reconstruction of the stream progenitor andits merger with m31, based on the emerging picture that most of the majorinhomogeneities observed in the m31 halo share a common origin with the giantstream.

1409.3843	global properties of m31's stellar halo from the splash survey: ii.  metallicity profile	we present the metallicity distribution of red giant branch (rgb) stars inm31's stellar halo, derived from photometric metallicity estimates for over1500 spectroscopically confirmed rgb halo stars. the stellar sample comes from38 halo fields observed with the keck/deimos spectrograph, ranging from 9 to175 kpc in projected distance from m31's center, and includes 52 confirmed m31halo stars beyond 100 kpc. while a wide range of metallicities is seenthroughout the halo, the metal-rich peak of the metallicity distributionfunction becomes significantly less prominent with increasing radius. themetallicity profile of m31's stellar halo shows a continuous gradient from 9 to~100 kpc, with a magnitude of -0.01 dex/kpc. the stellar velocity distributionsin each field are used to identify stars that are likely associated with tidaldebris features. the removal of tidal debris features does not significantlyalter the metallicity gradient in m31's halo: a gradient is maintained infields spanning 10 to 90 kpc. we analyze the halo metallicity profile, as wellas the relative metallicities of stars associated with tidal debris featuresand the underlying halo population, in the context of current simulations ofstellar halo formation. we argue that the large scale gradient in m31's haloimplies m31 accreted at least one relatively massive progenitor in the past,while the field to field variation seen in the metallicity profile indicatesthat multiple smaller progenitors are likely to have contributed substantiallyto m31's outer halo.

1501.06631	tracing the metal-poor m31 stellar halo with blue horizontal branch  stars	we have analyzed new hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging in f475w and f814w of twopreviously-unobserved fields along the m31 minor axis to confirm our previousconstraints on the shape of m31's inner stellar halo. both of these newdatasets reach a depth of at least f814w$&lt;$27 and clearly detect the bluehorizontal branch (bhb) of the field as a distinct feature of thecolor-magnitude diagram. we measure the density of bhb stars and the ratio ofbhb to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to ourprevious work. we find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of apower-law for the 2-d projected surface density with an index of2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\alpha &lt;$1.2 inside of3 kpc. our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field bhb stars inm31 are part of the halo population. however, the total halo profile is nowknown to differ from this bhb profile, which suggests that we have isolated themetal-poor component. this component appears to have an unbroken power-lawprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halostellar mass. discrepancies between the bhb density profile and othermeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the differentprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than theprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. theseprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of bhb/rgb stars inour observations.

1501.06908	carbon in red giants in globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we present carbon abundances of red giants in milky way globular clusters anddwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). our sample includes measurements of carbonabundances for 154 giants in the clusters ngc 2419, m68, and m15 and 398 giantsin the dsphs sculptor, fornax, ursa minor, and draco. this sample doubles thenumber of dsph stars with measurements of [c/fe]. the [c/fe] ratio in theclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(l/l_sun) ~= 1.6, whichcan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. the same decrease isobserved in dsphs, but the initial [c/fe] of the dsph giants is not uniform.stars in dsphs at lower metallicities have larger [c/fe] ratios. we hypothesizethat [c/fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines withincreasing [fe/h] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield ofasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of type iasupernovae at higher metallicities. we also identified 11 very carbon-richgiants (8 previously known) in three dsphs. however, our selection biasespreclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the milky waystellar halo. nonetheless, the stars with [c/fe] &lt; +1 in dsphs follow adifferent [c/fe] track with [fe/h] than the halo stars. specifically, [c/fe] indsphs begins to decline at lower [fe/h] than in the halo. the difference in themetallicity of the [c/fe] "knee" adds to the evidence from [alpha/fe]distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale forchemical enrichment than the surviving dsphs.

0804.3590	metallicity and alpha-element abundance measurement in red giant stars  from medium resolution spectra	we present a technique that applies spectral synthesis to medium resolutionspectroscopy (mrs, r ~ 6000) in the red (6300 a &lt; lambda &lt; 9100 a) to measure[fe/h] and [alpha/fe] of individual red giant stars over a wide metallicityrange. we apply our technique to 264 red giant stars in seven galactic globularclusters and demonstrate that it reproduces the metallicities and alphaenhancements derived from high resolution spectroscopy (hrs). the mrs techniqueexcludes the three ca ii triplet lines and instead relies on a plethora ofweaker lines. unlike empirical metallicity estimators, such as the equivalentwidth of the ca ii triplet, the synthetic method presented here is applicableover an arbitrarily wide metallicity range and is independent of assumptionsabout the alpha enhancement. estimates of cluster mean [fe/h] from differenthrs studies show typical scatter of ~0.1 dex but can be larger than 0.2 dex formetal-rich clusters. the scatter in hrs abundance estimates among individualstars in a given cluster is also comparable to 0.1 dex. by comparison, thescatter among mrs [fe/h] estimates of individual stars in a given cluster is~0.1 dex for most clusters but 0.17 dex for the most metal-rich cluster, m71(&lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -0.8). a star-by-star comparison of hrs vs. mrs [alpha/fe]estimates indicates that the precision in [alpha/fe]_mrs is 0.05 dex. theerrors in [fe/h]_mrs and [alpha/fe]_mrs increase beyond 0.25 dex only belowsignal-to-noise ratios of 20 a^(-1), which is typical for existing mrs of thered giant stars in leo i, one of the most distant milky way satellites (250kpc).

1502.03820	a clear age-velocity dispersion correlation in andromeda's stellar disk	the stellar kinematics of galactic disks are key to constraining diskformation and evolution processes. in this paper, for the first time, wemeasure the stellar age-velocity dispersion correlation in the inner 20 kpc(3.5 disk scale lengths) of m31 and show that it is dramatically different fromthat in the milky way. we use optical hubble space telescope/advanced camerafor surveys photometry of 5800 individual stars from the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) survey and keck/deimos radial velocity measurementsof the same stars from the spectroscopic and photometric landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey. we show that the averageline-of-sight velocity dispersion is a steadily increasing function of stellarage exterior to r=10 kpc, increasing from 30 km/s for the young upper mainsequence stars to 90 km/s for the old red giant branch stars. this monotonicincrease implies that a continuous or recurring process contributed to theevolution of the disk. both the slope and normalization of the dispersion vs.age relation are significantly larger than in the milky way, allowing for thepossibility that the disk of m31 has had a more violent history than the diskof the milky way, more in line with cosmological predictions. we also findevidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of stars from a second kinematicalcomponent in addition to the dominant disk component. one of the largest andhottest high-dispersion patches is present in all age bins, and may be thesignature of the end of the long bar.

1502.06621	the high-mass stellar initial mass function in m31 clusters	we have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellarinitial mass function (imf) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) of 85 resolved, young (4 myr &lt; t &lt; 25 myr), intermediate mass starclusters (10^3-10^4 msun), observed as part of the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) program. we fit each cluster's cmd to measure itsmass function (mf) slope for stars &gt;2 msun. for the ensemble of clusters, thedistribution of stellar mf slopes is best described by$\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. the dataalso imply no significant dependencies of the mf slope on cluster age, mass,and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured mfrepresents the imf. this analysis implies that the high-mass imf slope in m31clusters is universal with a slope ($\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that issteeper than the canonical kroupa (+1.30) and salpeter (+1.35) values. usingour inference model on select milky way (mw) and lmc high-mass imf studies fromthe literature, we find $\gamma_{\rm mw} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\gamma_{\rm lmc}\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. thus, while thehigh-mass imf in the local group may be universal, systematics in literatureimf studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations ofthe high-mass imf in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of thehigh-mass imf slope to date. we have grafted the m31 high-mass imf slope ontowidely used sub-solar mass kroupa and chabrier imfs and show that commonly useduv- and halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses &gt;8 msun are ~25% fewer thanexpected for a salpeter/kroupa imf.

1504.03338	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xi: the spatially-resolved  recent star formation history of m31	we measure the recent star formation history (sfh) across m31 using opticalimages taken with the \texit{hubble space telescope} as part of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat). we fit the color-magnitudediagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the nequadrant of m31. we show that the sfhs vary significantly on these smallspatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in thesfh back to ~500 myr, most notably in m31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. we findthat the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 myr old, showing ongoing star formationover the past ~500 myr. this indicates the presence of molecular gas in thering over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. we also find that thering's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at thelevel of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due todiffusion of stars into the disk. based on existing models of m31's ringfeatures, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purelycollisional ring origin highly unlikely. we find that the global sfr has beenfairly constant over the last ~500 myr, though it does show a small increase at50 myr that is 1.3 times the average sfr over the past 100 myr. during the last~500 myr, ~60% of all sf occurs in the 10-kpc ring. finally, we find that inthe past 100 myr, the average sfr over the phat survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total sfr of ~0.7m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of m31's disk. thissfr is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates.

1505.05521	estimation of distances to stars with stellar parameters from lamost	we present a method to estimate distances to stars with spectroscopicallyderived stellar parameters. the technique is a bayesian approach withlikelihood estimated via comparison of measured parameters to a grid of stellarisochrones, and returns a posterior probability density function for eachstar's absolute magnitude. this technique is tailored specifically to data fromthe large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope (lamost) survey.because lamost obtains roughly 3000 stellar spectra simultaneously within each~5-degree diameter "plate" that is observed, we can use the stellar parametersof the observed stars to account for the stellar luminosity function and targetselection effects. this removes biasing assumptions about the underlyingpopulations, both due to predictions of the luminosity function from stellarevolution modeling, and from galactic models of stellar populations along eachline of sight. using calibration data of stars with known distances and stellarparameters, we show that our method recovers distances for most stars within~20%, but with some systematic overestimation of distances to halo giants. weapply our code to the lamost database, and show that the current precision oflamost stellar parameters permits measurements of distances with ~40% errorbars. this precision should improve as the lamost data pipelines continue to berefined.

1509.06988	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury viii: a wide-area,  high-resolution map of dust extinction in m31	we map the distribution of dust in m31 at 25pc resolution, using stellarphotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. we develop a newmapping technique that models the nir color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of redgiant branch (rgb) stars. the model cmds combine an unreddened foreground ofrgb stars with a reddened background population viewed through a log-normalcolumn density distribution of dust. fits to the model constrain the medianextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction ofreddened stars. the resulting extinction map has &gt;4 times better resolutionthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of thedust column. there is superb morphological agreement between the new map andmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by draine et al. 2014.however, the widely-used draine &amp; li (2007) dust models overpredict theobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that m31's true dust massis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed indraine et al. (2014). the discrepancy we identify is consistent with similarfindings in the milky way by the planck collaboration (2015), but has a morecomplex dependence on parameters from the draine &amp; li (2007) dust models. wealso show that the discrepancy with the draine et al.

1510.03856	triangulum ii: possibly a very dense ultra-faint dwarf galaxy	laevens et al. recently discovered triangulum ii, a satellite of the milkyway. its galactocentric distance is 36 kpc, and its luminosity is only 450l_sun. using keck/deimos, we measured the radial velocities of six member starswithin 1.2' of the center of triangulum ii, and we found a velocity dispersionof sigma_v = 5.1 -1.4 +4.0 km/s. we also measured the metallicities of threestars and found a range of 0.8 dex in [fe/h]. the velocity and metallicitydispersions identify triangulum ii as a dark matter-dominated galaxy. thegalaxy is moving very quickly toward the galactic center (v_gsr = -262 km/s).although it might be in the process of being tidally disrupted as it approachespericenter, there is no strong evidence for disruption in our data set. theellipticity is low, and the mean velocity, &lt;v_helio&gt; = -382.1 +/- 2.9 km/s,rules out an association with the triangulum-andromeda substructure or thepan-andromeda archaeological survey (pandas) stellar stream. if triangulum iiis in dynamical equilibrium, then it would have a mass-to-light ratio of 3600-2100 +3500 m_sun/l_sun, the highest of any non-disrupting galaxy (those forwhich dynamical mass estimates are reliable). the density within the 3-dhalf-light radius would be 4.8 -3.5 +8.1 m_sun/pc^3, even higher than segue 1.hence, triangulum ii is an excellent candidate for the indirect detection ofdark matter annihilation.

1511.00006	panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xii. mapping stellar metallicity  distributions in m31	we present a study of spatial variations in the metallicity of old red giantbranch stars in the andromeda galaxy. photometric metallicity estimates arederived by interpolating isochrones for over seven million stars in thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey. this is the firstsystematic study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20 kpc of andromeda'sgalactic disk. we see a clear metallicity gradient of $-0.020\pm0.004$ dex/kpcfrom $\sim4-20$ kpc assuming a constant rgb age. this metallicity gradient isderived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completenessand dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects. the unknown agegradient in m31's disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in ourderived metallicity gradient. however, spectroscopic analyses of galaxiessimilar to m31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make thissystematic error comparable to the 1$\sigma$ error on our metallicity gradientmeasurement. in addition to the metallicity gradient, we observe an asymmetriclocal enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3-6 kpc that appears to beassociated with andromeda's elongated bar. this same region also appears tohave an enhanced stellar density and velocity dispersion.

0807.1925	uncovering extremely metal-poor stars in the milky way's ultra-faint  dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies	we present new metallicity measurements for 298 individual red giant branchstars in eight of the least luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs) in themilky way (mw) system. our technique is based on medium resolution keck/deimosspectroscopy coupled with spectral synthesis. we present the firstspectroscopic metallicities at [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 of stars in a dwarf galaxy, withindividual stellar metallicities as low as [fe/h] = -3.3. because our [fe/h]measurements are not tied to empirical metallicity calibrators and aresensitive to arbitrarily low metallicities, we are able to probe this extremelymetal-poor regime accurately. the metallicity distribution of stars in thesedsphs is similar to the mw halo at the metal-poor end. we also demonstrate thatthe luminosity-metallicity relation previously seen in more luminous dsphgalaxies (m_v = -13.4 to -8.8) extends smoothly down to an absolute magnitudeof m_v = -3.7. the discovery of extremely metal-poor stars in dsphs lendssupport to the lcdm galaxy assembly paradigm wherein dwarf galaxies dissolve toform the stellar halo of the mw.

astro-ph;0005192	resolving the controversy over the core radius of 47 tucanae (ngc 104)	this paper investigates the discrepancy between recent measurements of thedensity profile of the globular cluster 47 tuc that have used hst data sets.guhathakurta et al. (1992) used pre-refurbishment wfpc1 v-band images to deriver_c = 23" +/- 2". calzetti et al. (1993) suggested that the density profile isa superposition of two king profiles (r_c = 8" and r_c = 25") based on u-bandfoc images. de marchi et al. (1996) used deep wfpc1 u-band images to derive r_c= 12" +/- 2". differences in the adopted cluster centers are not the cause ofthe discrepancy. our independent analysis of the data used by de marchi et al.reaches the following conclusions: (1) de marchi et al.'s r_c ~ 12" value isspuriously low, a result of radially-varying bias in the star counts in amagnitude limited sample -- photometric errors and a steeply rising stellarluminosity function cause more stars to scatter across the limiting magnitudeinto the sample than out of it, especially near the cluster center wherecrowding effects are most severe. (2) changing the limiting magnitude to themain sequence turnoff, away from the steep part of the luminosity function,partially alleviates the problem and results in r_c = 18". (3) combining such alimiting magnitude with accurate photometry derived from psf fitting, insteadof the less accurate aperture photometry employed by de marchi et al., resultsin a reliable measurement of the density profile which is well fit by r_c = 22"+/- 2". archival wfpc2 data are used to derive a star list with a higher degreeof completeness, greater photometric accuracy, and wider areal coverage thanthe wfpc1 and foc data sets; the wfpc2-based density profile supports the aboveconclusions, yielding r_c = 24" +/- 1.9".

0808.0921	observations of the gas reservoir around a star forming galaxy in the  early universe	we present a high signal-to-noise spectrum of a bright galaxy at z = 4.9 in14 h of integration on vlt fors2. this galaxy is extremely bright, i_850 =23.10 +/- 0.01, and is strongly-lensed by the foreground massive galaxy clusterabell 1689 (z=0.18). stellar continuum is seen longward of the ly-alphaemission line at ~7100 \aa, while intergalactic h i produces strong absorptionshortward of ly-alpha. two transmission spikes at ~6800 angstroms (a) and ~7040a are also visible, along with other structures at shorter wavelengths.although fainter than a qso, the absence of a strong central ultraviolet fluxsource in this star forming galaxy enables a measurement of the h i fluxtransmission in the intergalactic medium (igm) in the vicinity of a highredshift object. we find that the effective h i optical depth of the igm isremarkably high within a large 14 mpc (physical) region surrounding the galaxycompared to that seen towards qsos at similar redshifts. evidently, thishigh-redshift galaxy is located in a region of space where the amount of h i ismuch larger than that seen at similar epochs in the diffuse igm. we argue thatobservations of high-redshift galaxies like this one provide unique insights onthe nascent stages of baryonic large-scale structures that evolve into thefilamentary cosmic web of galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed in thepresent universe.

astro-ph;0111465	tidal interaction of m32 and ngc 205 with m31: surface photometry and  numerical simulations	we investigate the interaction history of the m31 sub-group of galaxies bycomparing surface photometry of its two nearest satellites, m32 and ngc 205,with n-body simulations of satellite destruction. the recent discovery of agiant stream in m31's outer halo, apparently pointed towards m32 and ngc 205,makes such an investigation particularly relevant. the observational componentof this study is based on 1.7 x 5.0 degree b- and i- band ccd mosaic imagescentered on m31 and covering both satellites. the simulation component of thisproject is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical modelsatellites that are tidally disrupted through interactions with their parentgalaxy. generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surfacebrightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, andisophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in thebrightness profile. the satellites m32 and ngc 205 display most of thesefeatures consistently across the b and i bands, strongly suggestive of tidalinteraction and probable stripping by m31. we discuss what these observedfeatures can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories.specifically, m32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away frompericenter. investigating m32's unusual combination of high surface brightnessand low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we conclude onempirical grounds that m32 is not likely to be the residual core of atidally-stripped normal elliptical galaxy as has been suggested, but ratherthat its precursor was intrinsically compact.

astro-ph;0111466	interpreting the morphology of diffuse light around satellite galaxies	recent observations of surface brightness distributions of both milky way andm31 satellite galaxies have revealed many instances of sudden changes or breaksin the slope of the surface brightness profiles (at some break radius,r_break). these breaks are often accompanied by increasingly ellipticalisophotes and sometimes by isophote twisting. we investigate the hypothesis ofa tidal origin for these features by applying the same ellipse fittingtechniques that are used on observed galaxies to numerical simulations of thedestruction of satellites, represented by spherical, single-component systems.we examine how observed quantities such as r_break, ellipticity and positionangle of the fitted ellipses and amplitude of extra-break population vary withthe satellite's orbital eccentricity and phase, and our viewpoint relative tothe orbit. we also look at orbit and viewpoint dependence of the rate of changeof the latter three quantities with radius.  we find that there are trends with orbital phase and eccentricity in allobserved quantities, many of which are preserved through a wide variety ofviewing angles. in particular, a generic feature of all simulations is adepletion zone just interior to an excess zone, regions in which the surfacebrightness is lower and higher, respectively, than the initial profile. a clearinterpretation of any individual image, however, is likely to be hampered bythe dependence of the observable features on these multiple parameters. forexample, breaks can be excited by several physical processes and can occur wellwithin the bound satellite population. nevertheless, we do find we can placeloose constraints on the tidal radius, mass loss rate, orbital type and phaseof the satellite, and nature of breaks using photometric data alone.

astro-ph;0210158	addendum: "hubble space telescope evidence for an intermediate-mass  black hole in the globular cluster m15: ii. kinematical analysis and  dynamical modeling"	it has been reported that there is an error in the figure in dull et al.(1997, d97) that shows the radial m/l profile in fokker-planck models of m15.we discuss how this modifies the interpretation of our kinematical data. theseimply the existence of a dark and compact mass component near the center ofm15, either a single black hole (bh) or a collection of dark remnants that havesunk to the cluster center due to mass segregation. we previously showed thatthe latter interpretation is in conflict with the d97 m/l profile, whichsupported the bh interpretation. we repeat our analysis here with the correctedd97 profile. models without a bh are now found to be statistically acceptable(within 1-sigma), although inclusion of a bh still provides a marginally betterfit. it does not necessarily follow that dark remnants are now the preferredinterpretation of the data. the d97 models, as well as n-body models bybaumgardt et al. (2002), assume that all neutron stars are retained duringcluster evolution. this conflicts with predictions of the neutron-starretention rate (typically below 10 per cent) based on pulsar kick velocities.the presence of a single bh therefore continues to be a viable interpretationof the data. the best fit bh mass with the corrected d97 m/l profile is m_bh =1.7^{+2.7}_{-1.7} x 10^3 solar masses, and with a constant m/l it is m_bh =3.2^{+2.2}_{-2.2} x 10^3 solar masses. a model that includes both neutron starescape and mass segregation would probably yield a value between these numbers.this agrees with the correlation between velocity dispersion and bh massinferred for galaxies. however, with the presently available models and data itis neither uniquely implied nor ruled out that m15 has an intermediate-mass bh.

astro-ph;0211334	a population of intergalactic supernovae in galaxy clusters	we have discovered seven type ia cluster supernovae (sne) in the course ofthe wise observatory optical transients search in the fields of galaxy clusterswith redshifts between z=0.06 and z=0.2. two of these events, sn 1998fc inabell 403 (z=0.10) and sn 2001al in abell 2122/4 (z = 0.066), have no obvioushosts. both events appear projected on the halos of the central cd galaxies,but have velocity offsets of 750-2000 km/s relative to those galaxies,suggesting they are not bound to them. we use deep keck imaging of thelocations of the two sne to put upper limits on the luminosities of possibledwarf hosts, m_r &gt; -14 mag for sn 1998fc and m_r &gt; -11.8 mag for sn 2001al. thefractions of the cluster luminosities in dwarf galaxies fainter than our limitsare less than 3 x 10^-3 and 3 x 10^-4, respectively. thus, 2/7 of the sne wouldbe associated with less than 3 x 10^-3 of the luminosity attributed togalaxies. we argue, instead, that the progenitors of both events were probablymembers of a diffuse population of intergalactic stars, recently detected inlocal clusters via planetary nebulae and red giants. considering the higherdetectability of hostless sne compared to normal sne, we estimate that20^{+12}_{-15} percent of the sn ia parent stellar population in clusters isintergalactic. this fraction is consistent with other measurements of theintergalactic stellar population, and implies that the process that producesintergalactic stars (e.g., tidal disruption of cluster dwarfs) does not disruptor enhance significantly the sn ia formation mechanism. hostless sne arepotentially powerful tracers of the formation of the intergalactic stellarpopulation out to high redshift.

astro-ph;0305586	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: clustering of galaxies in early data	we measure the two-point correlation function xi(r) using a sample of 2219galaxies in an area of 0.32 degrees^2 at z=0.7-1.35 from the first season ofthe deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that xi(r) can be approximated by apower-law, xi(r)=(r/r_0)^-gamma, on scales 0.1-20 mpc/h. in a sample with aneffective redshift of z_eff=0.82, for a lcdm cosmology we find r_0=3.53 +/-0.81mpc/h (comoving) and gamma=1.66 +/-0.12, while in a higher-redshift sample withz_eff=1.14 we find r_0=3.14 +/-0.72 mpc/h and gamma=1.61 +/-0.11. we find thatred, absorption-dominated, passively-evolving galaxies have a larger clusteringscale length, r_0, and more prominent ``fingers of god'' than blue,emission-line, actively star-forming galaxies. intrinsically brighter galaxiesalso cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies at z~1, with a significantluminosity-bias seen for galaxies fainter than m*. our results are suggestiveof evolution in the galaxy clustering within our survey volume and imply thatthe deep2 galaxies, with a median brightness one magnitude fainter than m* havean effective bias b=0.97 +/-0.13 if sigma_{8 dm}=1 today or b=1.20 +/-0.16 ifsigma_{8 dm}=0.8 today. given the strong luminosity-dependence in the bias thatwe measure at z~1, the galaxy bias at m* may be significantly greater. we notethat our star-forming sample at z~1 has very similar selection criteria as thelyman-break galaxies at z~3 and that our red, absorption-line sample displays aclustering strength comparable to the expected clustering of the lyman-breakgalaxy descendants at z~1. our results demonstrate that the clusteringproperties in the galaxy distribution seen in the local universe were largelyin place by z~1.

astro-ph;0305587	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: spectral classification of galaxies at  z~1	we present a principal component analysis (pca)-based spectralclassification, eta, for the first 5600 galaxies observed in the deep2 redshiftsurvey. this parameter provides a very pronounced separation between absorptionand emission dominated galaxy spectra - corresponding to passively evolving andactively star-forming galaxies in the survey respectively. in addition it isshown that despite the high resolution of the observed spectra, this parameteralone can be used to quite accurately reconstruct any given galaxy spectrum,suggesting there are not many `degrees of freedom' in the observed spectra ofthis galaxy population. it is argued that this form of classification, eta,will be particularly valuable in making future comparisons between high andlow-redshift galaxy surveys for which very large spectroscopic samples are nowreadily available, particularly when used in conjunction with high-resolutionspectral synthesis models which will be made public in the near future. we alsodiscuss the relative advantages of this approach to distant galaxyclassification compared to other methods such as colors and morphologies.finally, we compare the classification derived here with that adopted for the2df galaxy redshift survey and in so doing show that the two systems are verysimilar. this will be particularly useful in subsequent analyses when makingcomparisons between results from each of these surveys to study evolution inthe galaxy populations and large-scale structure.

(2002). the f606w (v) and f814w (i) images were obtained inparallel with space telescope imaging spectrograph spectroscopy of g1 (go-9099)and total 7.11 hours of integration time -- the deepest hst field in the outerdisk of m31 to date, reaching to v ~ 28. the color-magnitude diagram of thefield shows a clearly-defined red clump at v = 25.25 and a red giant branchconsistent with [fe/h] ~ -0.7. the lack of a blue horizontal branch contrastswith other m31 halo fields, the andromeda dwarf spheroidals, and with thenearby globular cluster g1. comparing the observed luminosity function to thepadova models, we find that at least some of the stellar population must beyounger than 6 - 8 gyr. the outermost detected neutral hydrogen gas disk of m31lies only 2 kpc in projection from our field. the finding that some giants inthe field have radial velocities close to that of the neutral hydrogen gas(reitzel, guhathakurta, &amp; rich 2003) leads us to conclude that our fieldsamples the old, low-surface-brightness disk rather than the true population iispheroid.

astro-ph;0311510	the chemical composition contrast between m3 and m13 revisited: new  abundances for 28 giant stars in m3	we report new chemical abundances of 23 bright red giants of the globularcluster m3, based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the keck itelescope. combining these data with a previously-reported small sample of m3giants obtained with the lick 3m telescope, we compare [x/fe] ratios for 28 m3giants with 35 m13 giants, and with halo field stars. all three groups exhibitc depletion with advancing evolutionary state beginning at the rgb bump region.but the overall depletion in the clusters is larger than that of the fieldstars. the behaviors of o, na, mg and al are distinctively different among thethree stellar samples. both m3 and m13 show evidence of high-temperature protoncapture synthesis from the on, nena, and mgal cycles, while there is noevidence for such synthesis among halo field stars. but the degree of suchextreme proton-capture synthesis in m3 is smaller than it is in m13, and noindication that o depletions are a function of advancing evolutionary state ashas been claimed for m13. we have also considered ngc 6752, for which mgisotopic abundances have been reported by yong et al. (2003). giants in ngc6752 and m13 satisfy the same anticorrelation of o abundances with the ratio(25mg+26mg)/24mg. this suggests that these abundance ratios arose in theejected material of 3-6 solar mass cluster stars. it also suggests that the lowoxygen abundance seen among the most evolved m13 giants arose in hot-bottom oto n processing in these same intermediate-mass cluster stars. thus mixing isrequired by the dependence of some abundance ratios on luminosity, but anearlier nucleosynthesis process in a hotter environment than giants ormain-sequence stars is required by the variations previously seen in stars nearthe main sequence.

astro-ph;0406145	dynamics and stellar content of the giant southern stream in m31. i.  keck spectroscopy of red giant stars	we present results from a large spectroscopic survey of m31 red giants usingthe keck telescope/deimos. photometric pre-screening, based on the 100a-wideddo51 band centered on the mgb/mgh feature, was used to select spectroscopictargets. red giant candidates were targeted in a small field on m31's giantsouthern tidal stream at a projected distance of 31kpc from the galaxy center.we isolate a clean sample of 68 giants by removing contaminants (foregroundgalactic dwarfs and background galaxies) using spectroscopic, imaging, andphotometric methods. about 65% of the m31 stars are found to be members of thestream, while the rest appear to be members of the general halo population. themean (heliocentric) radial velocity of the stream in our field is -458 km/s, or-158 km/s relative to m31's systemic velocity, in good agreement with recentmeasurements at other stream locations. the intrinsic velocity dispersion ofthe stream is constrained to be 15_{-15}^{+8} km/s (90% confidence limits). thecompanion paper by font et al. (2004, astro-ph/0406146) discusses possibleorbits, implications of the coldness of the stream, and progenitor satelliteproperties. the kinematics (and perhaps [fe/h] distribution) of our halo sampleindicate that it is different from other m31 halo samples; this may be anindication of substructure in the halo. the stream seems to have a higher mean[fe/h] than the halo, -0.51 vs -0.74 dex, and a smaller [fe/h] spread. thestream's high metallicity implies that its progenitor must have been a luminousdwarf galaxy. the caii triplet strengths of the m31 giants are generallyconsistent with photometric estimates of their metallicity (derived by fittingrgb fiducials in the color-magnitude diagram). there is indirect evidence ofintermediate-age stars in the stream.

astro-ph;0406146	dynamics and stellar content of the giant southern stream in m31. ii.  interpretation	we examine the nature of the progenitor of the giant stellar stream in m31using as constraints new radial velocity measurements of stream red giant stars(presented in the companion paper by guhathakurta et al. 2005,astro-ph/0406145) along with other m31 data sets available in the literature.we find that the observations are best fit by orbits that are highly eccentricand close to edge-on, with apo- to peri-center ratios of order 25 - 30, andwith apocenters at or only slightly beyond the southern edge of the currentdata. among these orbits, we are able to find a few that plausibly connect thestream with the northern spur or with the low-surface-brightness feature ofsimilar high metallicity as the stream (originally reported by ferguson et al.2002) to the east of m31's center. in the latter case, if the connection isreal, then the eastern debris should lie well in front of m31 near theapocenter of the orbit. both the width of the debris and velocity dispersionmeasurements imply a rough lower limit on the mass of the progenitor of 10^8m_sun. we use this limit and our orbits to discuss which of m31's satellitescould be plausibly associated with the stream. in addition, we predict that thewidth of the stream should increase beyond the southern edge of the currentdata around the apocenter of the orbit and that the line-of-sight velocitydispersion should exhibit significant variations along the stream.

astro-ph;0512001	deep photometry of andromeda reveals striking similarities in the tidal  stream and spheroid populations	we present a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) for a field in the giant tidalstream of the andromeda galaxy (m31). these observations, taken with theadvanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope, are 50% complete atv~30 mag, reaching 1 mag below the oldest main-sequence turnoff. strikingsimilarities between the stream and a previous spheroid cmd imply they havevery similar age and metallicity distributions, but present something of anenigma; we speculate on possible interpretations of this result, but note thatnone are without problems. distinct multiple turnoffs, as might be expectedfrom pulses of star formation caused by interaction with andromeda, are notapparent in the stream cmd. star formation in both fields lasted about 6billion years, building up to relatively high metallicities and being largelycomplete 6 billion years ago. the close similarity of the spheroid and streamsuggests that both may have derived from the same event; it would be worthexploring to what extent stars in these structures are the remnants of a diskgalaxy that interacted with m31, or even were disrupted from the m31 diskitself by the interaction.

astro-ph;0607053	tracing the dynamical history of the globular cluster 47 tucanae	we use two stellar populations in the globular cluster 47 tucanae to traceits dynamical history: blue stragglers and low mass main sequence stars. weassumed that the blue stragglers were formed through stellar collisions in allregions of the cluster. we find that in the core of the cluster, models ofcollisional blue stragglers agree well with the observations as long as bluestragglers are still continuing to form and the mass function in the cluster isextremely biased towards massive stars (x=-8 where a salpeter mass function hasx=+1.35). we show that such an extreme mass function is supported by directmeasurements of the luminosity function of main sequence stars in the centre ofthe cluster. in the middle region of our dataset (25'' to 130'' from thecluster centre), blue straggler formation seems to have stopped about half agyr ago. in the outskirts of the cluster, our models are least successful atreproducing the blue straggler data. taken at face value, they indicate thatblue straggler formation has been insignificant over the past billion years,and that a salpeter mass function applies. however, it is more likely that thedominant formation mechanism in this part of the cluster is not the collisionalone, and that our models are not appropriate for this region of the cluster. weconclude that blue stragglers can be used as tracers of dynamics in globularclusters, despite our incomplete understanding of how and where they wereformed.

astro-ph;0607512	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: evolution of the color-density  relation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.35	using a sample of 19,464 galaxies drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 1.35. we find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence dependsstrongly on local environment out to z &gt; 1, being larger in regions of greatergalaxy density. at all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measuredoverdensity. the observed correlations between the red fraction and localoverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z &gt; 1 detected at agreater than 5-\sigma level. over the entire redshift regime studied, we findthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies morestrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequencecounterparts at high redshift. at z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weaklycorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to theclustering of ~ l* galaxies at that epoch must be small. our findings addweight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequencehas occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) atz &lt; 1.5. the strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.35suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-densityand color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms(i.e., "nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by "nature'') uponthe galaxy population during their epoch of formation.

astro-ph;0607637	the detailed star formation history in the spheroid, outer disk, and  tidal stream of the andromeda galaxy	using the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope, we haveobtained deep optical images reaching stars well below the oldest main sequenceturnoff in the spheroid, tidal stream, and outer disk of the andromeda galaxy.we have reconstructed the star formation history in these fields by comparingtheir color-magnitude diagrams to a grid of isochrones calibrated to galacticglobular clusters observed in the same bands. each field exhibits an extendedstar formation history, with many stars younger than 10 gyr but few youngerthan 4 gyr. considered together, the star counts, kinematics, and populationcharacteristics of the spheroid argue against some explanations for itsintermediate-age, metal-rich population, such as a significant contributionfrom stars residing in the disk or a chance intersection with the stream'sorbit. instead, it is likely that this population is intrinsic to the innerspheroid, whose highly-disturbed structure is clearly distinct from thepressure-supported metal-poor halo that dominates farther from the galaxy'scenter. the stream and spheroid populations are similar, but not identical,with the stream's mean age being ~1 gyr younger; this similarity suggests thatthe inner spheroid is largely polluted by material stripped from either thestream's progenitor or similar objects. the disk population is considerablyyounger and more metal-rich than the stream and spheroid populations, but notas young as the thin disk population of the solar neighborhood; instead, theouter disk of andromeda is dominated by stars of age 4 - 8 gyr, resembling themilky way's thick disk. the disk data are inconsistent with a populationdominated by ages older than 10 gyr, and in fact do not require any stars olderthan 10 gyr.

astro-ph;0608569	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of the blue fraction in  groups and the field	we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the deep2 survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxiesin groups. the primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in drivingthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. the colour segregation observedbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: deep2groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. at fixed z,there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, suchthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in thefield. in addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction andgroup richness. in terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and thefield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshiftthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field bluefractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. careful tests indicate that thiseffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. to furtherensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock deep2catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensityrelation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods. the convergencebetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that deep2 galaxygroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this resultis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models ofgalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

astro-ph;0610228	supernovae in low-redshift galaxy clusters: the type-ia supernova rate	supernova (sn) rates are a potentially powerful diagnostic of star formationhistory (sfh), metal enrichment, and sn physics, particularly in galaxyclusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials, and simple sfh. however,a low-redshift cluster sn rate has never been published. we derive the sn ratein galaxy clusters at 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.19, based on type ia supernovae (sne ia) thatwere discovered by the wise observatory optical transient survey. as describedin a separate paper, a sample of 140 rich abell clusters was monitored, inwhich six cluster sne ia were found and confirmed spectroscopically. here, wedetermine the sn detection efficiencies of the individual survey images, andcombine the efficiencies with the known spectral properties of sne ia tocalculate the effective visibility time of the survey. the cluster stellarluminosities are measured from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) database inthe griz sdss bands. uncertainties are estimated using monte-carlo simulationsin which all input parameters are allowed to vary over their knowndistributions. we derive sn rates normalized by stellar luminosity, in snuunits (sne per century per 10^10 l_sun) in five photometric bandpasses, of0.36+/-(0.22,0.14)+/-0.02 (b), 0.351+/-(0.210,0.139)+/-0.020 (g),0.288+/-(0.172,0.114)+/-0.018 (r), 0.229+/-(0.137,0.091)+/-0.014 (i),0.186+/-(0.111,0.074)+/-0.010 (z), where the quoted errors are statistical andsystematic, respectively. the sn rate per stellar mass unit, derived using acolor-luminosity-mass relation, is 0.098+/-(0.059,0.039)+/-0.009 sne (century10^10 m_sun)^-1. the low cluster sn rates we find are similar to, andconsistent with, the sn ia rate in local elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0702448	the extended star formation history of the andromeda spheroid at twenty  one kiloparsecs on the minor axis	using the hst acs, we have obtained deep optical images of a southeastminor-axis field in the andromeda galaxy, 21 kpc from the nucleus. in both starcounts and metallicity, this field represents a transition zone between themetal-rich, highly-disturbed inner spheroid that dominates within 15 kpc andthe metal-poor, diffuse population that dominates beyond 30 kpc. thecolor-magnitude diagram reaches well below the oldest main-sequence turnoff inthe population, allowing a reconstruction of the star formation history in thisfield. compared to the spheroid population at 11 kpc, the population at 21 kpcis ~1.3 gyr older and ~0.2 dex more metal-poor, on average. however, like thepopulation at 11 kpc, the population at 21 kpc exhibits an extended starformation history; one third of the stars are younger than 10 gyr, althoughonly a few percent are younger than 8 gyr. the relatively wide range ofmetallicity and age is inconsistent with a single, rapid star-formationepisode, and instead suggests that the spheroid even at 21 kpc is dominated bythe debris of earlier merging events likely occurring more than 8 gyr ago.

astro-ph;0703029	stellar kinematics in the complicated inner spheroid of m31: discovery  of substructure along the southeastern minor axis and its relationship to the  giant southern stream	we present the discovery of a kinematically-cold stellar population along these minor axis of the andromeda galaxy (m31) that is likely the forwardcontinuation of m31's giant southern stream. this discovery was made in thecourse of an on-going spectroscopic survey of red giant branch (rgb) stars inm31 using the deimos instrument on the keck ii 10-m telescope. stellarkinematics are investigated in eight fields located 9-30 kpc from m31's center(in projection). a likelihood method based on photometric and spectroscopicdiagnostics is used to isolate confirmed m31 rgb stars from foreground milkyway dwarf stars: for the first time, this is done without using radial velocityas a selection criterion, allowing an unbiased study of m31's stellarkinematics. the radial velocity distribution of the 1013 m31 rgb stars showsevidence for the presence of two components. the broad (hot) component has avelocity dispersion of 129 km/s and presumably represents m31's virializedspheroid. a significant fraction (19%) of the population is in a narrow (cold)component centered near m31's systemic velocity with a velocity dispersion thatdecreases with increasing radial distance, from 55.5 km/s at r_proj=12 kpc to10.6 km/s at r_proj=18 kpc. the spatial and velocity distribution of the coldcomponent matches that of the "southeast shelf" predicted by the fardal et al.(2007) orbital model of the progenitor of the giant southern stream. themetallicity distribution of the cold component matches that of the giantsouthern stream, but is about 0.2 dex more metal rich on average than that ofthe hot spheroidal component. we discuss the implications of our discovery onthe interpretation of the intermediate-age spheroid population found in thisregion in recent ultra-deep hst imaging studies.

(1994) to exhibit anextraordinarily low scatter of 0.10 mag rms in the i magnitude vs 21-cm widthtfr. using the same i magnitudes with new widths derived from high-qualityh-alpha rotation curves, we measure an rms scatter of 0.14 mag in the tfr. thissuggests that measurement errors and ``astrophysical errors'' (such asnon-circular gas motion) on the h-alpha velocity widths are below 6%, andoptical widths are nearly as good for tfr studies as 21-cm widths. the scatterand form of the tfr are found to be robust under choice of velocitywidth-extraction algorithm, as long as the central portions of the opticalrotation curve are ignored and low-s/n points are not weighted too heavily. inthis small sample there is no evidence that rotation curve shapes varysystematically with rotation velocity, nor that rotation curve shape can beused to reduce the scatter in the tfr.

astro-ph;9907348	magnitude bias of microlensed sources towards the large magellanic cloud	there are lines of evidence suggesting that some of the observed microlensingevents in the direction of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) are caused byordinary star lenses as opposed to dark machos in the galactic halo. efficientlensing by ordinary stars generally requires the presence of one or moreadditional concentrations of stars along the line of sight to the lmc disk. ifsuch a population behind the lmc disk exists, then the source stars (forlensing by lmc disk objects) will be drawn preferentially from the backgroundpopulation and will show systematic differences from lmc field stars. one suchdifference is that the (lensed) source stars will be farther away than theaverage lmc field stars, and this should be reflected in their apparentbaseline magnitudes. we focus on red clump stars: these should appear in thecolor-magnitude diagram at a few tenths of a magnitude fainter than the fieldred clump. suggestively, one of the two near-clump confirmed events,macho-lmc-1, is a few tenths of magnitude fainter than the clump.

astro-ph;9912002	radial color gradient and main sequence mass segregation in m30 (ngc  7099)	it has long been known that the post-core-collapse globular cluster m30 has abluer-inward color gradient, and recent work suggests that the centraldeficiency of bright red giants does not fully account for this gradient. thisstudy uses hubble space telescope wfpc2 images in the f439w and f555w bands,along with ground-based ccd images with a wider field of view for normalizationof the non-cluster background contribution, and finds \delta(b-v) ~ +0.3 magfor the overall cluster starlight over the range r = 2" to &gt;~ 1'. the slope ofthe color profile is: \delta(b-v)/\delta\log(r) = 0.20 +/- 0.07 mag dex^{-1}.we explore various algorithms for artificially redistributing the light ofbright red giants and horizontal branch stars uniformly across the cluster. thetraditional method of redistribution in proportion to the cluster brightnessprofile is shown to be inaccurate. there is no significant residual colorgradient in m30 after proper uniform redistribution of all bright evolvedstars; thus the color gradient in m30's central region appears to be dueentirely to post-main-sequence stars. two classes of plausible dynamicalmodels, fokker-planck and multimass king models, are combined with theoreticalstellar isochrones from bergbusch &amp; vandenberg (1992) and from d'antona et al.to quantify the effect of mass segregation of main sequence stars. in allcases, mass segregation of main sequence stars results in \delta(b-v) ~ -0.06to +0.02 mag over the range r = 20" - 80"; this is consistent with m30'sresidual color gradient within measurement error. the observed fraction ofevolved star light in the b and v bands agrees with the corresponding modelpredictions at small radii but drops below it for r &gt;~ 20".
