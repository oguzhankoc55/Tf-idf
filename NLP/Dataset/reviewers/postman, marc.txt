0902.2973	the history of star formation in galaxies	if we are to develop a comprehensive and predictive theory of galaxyformation and evolution, it is essential that we obtain an accurate assessmentof how and when galaxies assemble their stellar populations, and how thisassembly varies with environment. there is strong observational support for thehierarchical assembly of galaxies, but by definition the dwarf galaxies we seetoday are not the same as the dwarf galaxies and proto-galaxies that weredisrupted during the assembly. our only insight into those disrupted buildingblocks comes from sifting through the resolved field populations of thesurviving giant galaxies to reconstruct the star formation history, chemicalevolution, and kinematics of their various structures. to obtain the detaileddistribution of stellar ages and metallicities over the entire life of agalaxy, one needs multi-band photometry reaching solar-luminosity main sequencestars. the hubble space telescope can obtain such data in the outskirts oflocal group galaxies. to perform these essential studies for a fair sample ofthe local universe will require observational capabilities that allow us toextend the study of resolved stellar populations to much larger galaxy samplesthat span the full range of galaxy morphologies, while also enabling the studyof the more crowded regions of relatively nearby galaxies. with suchcapabilities in hand, we will reveal the detailed history of star formation andchemical evolution in the universe.

0904.0941	advanced technology large-aperture space telescope (atlast): a  technology roadmap for the next decade	the advanced technology large-aperture space telescope (atlast) is a set ofmission concepts for the next generation of uvoir space observatory with aprimary aperture diameter in the 8-m to 16-m range that will allow us toperform some of the most challenging observations to answer some of our mostcompelling questions, including "is there life elsewhere in the galaxy?" wehave identified two different telescope architectures, but with similar opticaldesigns, that span the range in viable technologies. the architectures are atelescope with a monolithic primary mirror and two variations of a telescopewith a large segmented primary mirror. this approach provides us with severalpathways to realizing the mission, which will be narrowed to one as ourtechnology development progresses. the concepts invoke heritage from hst andjwst design, but also take significant departures from these designs tominimize complexity, mass, or both.  our report provides details on the mission concepts, shows the extraordinaryscientific progress they would enable, and describes the most importanttechnology development items. these are the mirrors, the detectors, and thehigh-contrast imaging technologies, whether internal to the observatory, orusing an external occulter. experience with jwst has shown that determinedcompetitors, motivated by the development contracts and flight opportunities ofthe new observatory, are capable of achieving huge advances in technical andoperational performance while keeping construction costs on the same scale asprior great observatories.

0909.4503	comparison of optical observational capabilities for the coming decades:  ground versus space	ground-based adaptive optics (ao) in the infrared has made exceptionaladvances in approaching space-like image quality at higher collecting area.optical-wavelength applications are now also growing in scope. we thereforeprovide here a comparison of the pros and cons of observational capabilitiesfrom the ground and from space at optical wavelengths. with an eye towards thefuture, we focus on the comparison of a ~30m ground-based telescope with an8-16m space-based telescope. we review the current state-of-the-art in ao, andsummarize the expected future improvements in image quality, field of view,contrast, and low-wavelength cut-off. we discuss the exciting advances inextreme ao for exoplanet studies and explore what the theoretical limitationsin achievable contrast might be. our analysis shows that extreme ao techniquesface both fundamental and technological hurdles to reach the contrast of 1e-10necessary to study an earth-twin at 10 pc. based on our assessment of thecurrent state-of-the-art, the future technology developments, and the inherentdifficulty of observing through a turbulent atmosphere, we conclude that therewill continue to be a strong complementarity between observations from theground and from space at optical wavelengths in the coming decades. there willcontinue to be subjects that can only be studied from space, including imagingand (medium-resolution) spectroscopy at the deepest magnitudes, and theexceptional-contrast observations needed to characterize terrestrial exoplanetsand search for biomarkers.

1105.0444	a precise cluster mass profile averaged from the highest-quality lensing  data	we outline our methods for obtaining high precision mass profiles, combiningindependent weak-lensing distortion, magnification, and strong-lensingmeasurements. for massive clusters the strong and weak lensing regimescontribute equal logarithmic coverage of the radial profile. the utility ofhigh-quality data is limited by the cosmic noise from large scale structurealong the line of sight. this noise is overcome when stacking clusters, as tooare the effects of cluster asphericity and substructure, permitting a stringenttest of theoretical models. we derive a mean radial mass profile of foursimilar mass clusters of high-quality hst and subaru images, in the ranger=40kpc/h to 2800kpc/h, where the inner radial boundary is sufficiently largeto avoid smoothing from miscentering effects. the stacked mass profile isdetected at 58-sigma significance over the entire radial range, with thecontribution from the cosmic noise included. we show that the projected massprofile has a continuously steepening gradient out to beyond the virial radius,in remarkably good agreement with the standard navarro-frenk-white formpredicted for the family of cdm-dominated halos in gravitational equilibrium.the central slope is constrained to lie in the range,-dln{\rho}/dln{r}=0.89^{+0.27}_{-0.39}. the mean concentration isc_{vir}=7.68^{+0.42}_{-0.40} (at a mean virial mass 1.54^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\times10^{15} m_{sun}/h), which is high for relaxed, high-mass clusters, butconsistent with lcdm when a sizable projection bias estimated from n-bodysimulations is considered. this possible tension will be more definitivelyexplored with new cluster surveys, such as clash, locuss, subaru hsc, andxxm-xxl, to construct the c-m relation over a wider mass range.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1106.6048	profiles of dark matter velocity anisotropy in simulated clusters	we report statistical results for dark matter (dm) velocity anisotropy,\beta, from a sample of some 6000 cluster-size halos (at redshift zero)identified in a \lambda cdm hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulationperformed with the enzo code. these include profiles of \beta\ in clusters withdifferent masses, relaxation states, and at several redshifts, modeled both asspherical and triaxial dm configurations. specifically, although we find alarge scatter in the dm velocity anisotropy profiles of different halos (acrosselliptical shells extending to at least ~$1.5 r_{vir}$), universal patterns arefound when these are averaged over halo mass, redshift, and relaxation stage.these are characterized by a very small velocity anisotropy at the halo center,increasing outward to about 0.27 and leveling off at about $0.2 r_{vir}$.indirect measurements of the dm velocity anisotropy fall on the upper end ofthe theoretically expected range. though measured indirectly, the estimationsare derived by using two different surrogate measurements - x-ray and galaxydynamics. current estimates of the dm velocity anisotropy are based on verysmall cluster sample. increasing this sample will allow testing theoreticalpredictions, including the speculation that the decay of dm particles resultsin a large velocity boost. we also find, in accord with previous works, thathalos are triaxial and likely to be more prolate when unrelaxed, whereasrelaxed halos are more likely to be oblate. our analysis does not indicate thatthere is significant correlation (found in some previous studies) between theradial density slope, \gamma, and \beta\ at large radii, $0.3 r_{vir} &lt; r &lt;r_{vir}$.

1201.1616	clash: precise new constraints on the mass profile of abell 2261	we precisely constrain the inner mass profile of abell 2261 (z=0.225) for thefirst time and determine this cluster is not "over-concentrated" as foundpreviously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\lambda}cdmexpectations. these results are based on strong lensing analyses of new 16-bandhst imaging obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of subaruwide field imaging with 5-band subaru + kpno photometry, we place tight newconstraints on the halo virial mass m_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70(within r \approx 3 mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming aspherical halo. this agrees broadly with average c(m,z) predictions from recent{\lambda}cdm simulations which span 5 &lt;~ &lt;c&gt; &lt;~ 8. our most significantsystematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. to estimatethis, we also derive a mass profile based on archival chandra x-rayobservations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile atr2500 ~ 600 kpc. agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axisratio along our line of sight. for this elongated halo model, we find m_vir =1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lowerlimits on these values. the need for halo elongation can be partially obviatedby non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors inthe x-ray mass measurements. we estimate the effect of background structuresbased on mmt/hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lowermvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1204.3630	clash: mass distribution in and around macs j1206.2-0847 from a full  cluster lensing analysis	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster macsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification,and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field subaru bvriz' imaging and our recent16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) program. we find goodagreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensingmass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuringconsistency. the subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scalestructure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east(nw-se), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showingelongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. our full-lensingmass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\sigma/dlnr\sim -1 at clusteroutskirts (r&gt;1mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the nw-se excessregions steepens further out, well described by the navarro-frenk-white form.assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass m_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm0.1)\times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range4&lt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;7 of average c(m,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent lambdacold dark matter simulations. our full lensing results are found to be inagreement with x-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and whencombined with chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas massfraction of 13.7^{+4.5}_{-3.0}% at 0.7mpc/h (\approx 1.7r_{2500}), a typicalvalue observed for high mass clusters.

1205.3839	a brightest cluster galaxy with an extremely large flat core	hubble space telescope images of the galaxy cluster abell 2261, obtained aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble, show that thebrightest galaxy in the cluster, a2261-bcg, has the largest core yet detectedin any galaxy. the cusp radius of a2261-bcg is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as thenext largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the mostluminous bcgs. the morphology of the core in a2261-bcg is also unusual, havinga flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, ratherthan the typical shallow cusp. this implies that the galaxy has a core withconstant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. interpretation of thecore as an end product of the "scouring" action of a binary supermassive blackhole implies a total black hole mass ~1e+10 m_sun from the extrapolation ofmost relationships between core structure and black hole mass. the core falls1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. its large sizein real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. theflat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. thecore is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1306.5240	galaxy halo truncation and giant arc surface brightness reconstruction  in the cluster macsj1206.2-0847	in this work we analyze the mass distribution of macsj1206.2-0847, especiallyfocusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. the cluster appearsrelaxed in its x-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intraclusterlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scaleinteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. the clusterlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$into a giant arc and its counterimage. the multiple image positions and thesurface brightness distribution (sfb) of the arc which is bent around severalcluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. we modelthe cluster mass distribution with a nfw profile and the galaxy halos with twoparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assumingscalings with their observed nir--light. we match the multiple image positionsat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the sfb distribution ofthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this clustermodel. the length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrainedis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamicaland field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weaklensing results on the other hand. the velocity dispersion and halo size of agalaxy with $m_{\rm 160w,ab}=19.2$ or $m_{\rm b,vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\approx 26\pm 6 \rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of thecluster galaxies are tidally stripped. we also reconstruct the unlensed source(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increaseof morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy haslikely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1404.1375	clash: weak-lensing shear-and-magnification analysis of 20 galaxy  clusters	we present a joint shear-and-magnification weak-lensing analysis of a sampleof 16 x-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters at 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.69selected from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). ouranalysis uses wide-field multi-color imaging, taken primarily with suprime-camon the subaru telescope. from a stacked shear-only analysis of thex-ray-selected subsample, we detect the ensemble-averaged lensing signal with atotal signal-to-noise ratio of ~25 in the radial range of 200 to 3500kpc/h. thestacked tangential-shear signal is well described by a family of standarddensity profiles predicted for dark-matter-dominated halos in gravitationalequilibrium, namely the navarro-frenk-white (nfw), truncated variants of nfw,and einasto models. for the nfw model, we measure a mean concentration of$c_{200c}=4.01^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ at $m_{200c}=1.34^{+0.10}_{-0.09}10^{15}m_{\odot}$. we show this is in excellent agreement with lambdacold-dark-matter (lcdm) predictions when the clash x-ray selection function andprojection effects are taken into account. the best-fit einasto shape parameteris $\alpha_e=0.191^{+0.071}_{-0.068}$, which is consistent with thenfw-equivalent einasto parameter of $\sim 0.18$. we reconstruct projected massdensity profiles of all clash clusters from a joint likelihood analysis ofshear-and-magnification data, and measure cluster masses at severalcharacteristic radii. we also derive an ensemble-averaged total projected massprofile of the x-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual massprofiles. the stacked total mass profile, constrained by theshear+magnification data, is shown to be consistent with our shear-basedhalo-model predictions including the effects of surrounding large-scalestructure as a two-halo term, establishing further consistency in the contextof the lcdm model.

1405.7876	clash-x: a comparison of lensing and x-ray techniques for measuring the  mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we present profiles of temperature (tx), gas mass, and hydrostatic massestimated from new and archival x-ray observations of clash clusters. wecompare measurements derived from xmm and chandra observations with one anotherand compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with clash hstand ground-based lensing data. radial profiles of chandra and xmm electrondensity and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differencesin hydrostatic masses inferred from x-ray observations arise from differencesin tx measurements. encouragingly, cluster txs are consistent with one anotherat ~100-200 kpc radii but xmm tx systematically decline relative to chandra txat larger radii. the angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additionalinvestigation on systematics such as the xmm point spread function correction,vignetting and off-axis responses. we present the clash-x mass-profilecomparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independentcircular-velocity profiles. ratios of chandra hse mass profiles to clashlensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 mpc range.however, the mean mass biases inferred from the wl and sawlens data aredifferent. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 mpc is &lt;b&gt; = 0.12 for the wlcomparison and &lt;b&gt; = -0.11 for the sawlens comparison. the ratios of xmm hsemass profiles to clash lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence inthe 0.3-1.0 mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to&lt;b&gt;~0.3 at ~1 mpc for the wl comparison and &lt;b&gt; of 0.25 for sawlens comparison.the enclosed gas mass profiles from both chandra and xmm rise to a value 1/8times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 mpc and remainconstant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xmgas] profiles may be anexcellent proxy for total-mass profiles at &gt;0.5 mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

1407.2260	brightest cluster galaxies at the present epoch	we have observed 433 z&lt;=0.08 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in a full-skysurvey of abell clusters. the bcg hubble diagram is consistent to within 2% ofa omega_m=0.3, lambda=0.7 hubble relation. the l_m-alpha relation for bcgs,which uses alpha, the log-slope of the bcg photometric curve of growth, topredict metric luminosity, l_m, has 0.27 mag residuals. we measure centralstellar velocity dispersions, sigma, of the bcgs, finding the faber-jacksonrelation to flatten as the metric aperture grows to include an increasingfraction of the total bcg luminosity. a 3-parameter "metric plane" relationusing alpha and sigma together gives the best prediction of l_m, with 0.21 magresiduals. the projected spatial offset, r_x, of bcgs from the x-ray-definedcluster center is a gamma=-2.33 power-law over 1&lt;r_x&lt;10^3 kpc. the medianoffset is ~10 kpc, but ~15% of the bcgs have r_x&gt;100 kpc. the absolutecluster-dispersion normalized bcg peculiar velocity |delta v_1|/sigma_c followsan exponential distribution with scale length 0.39+/-0.03. both l_m and alphaincrease with sigma_c. the alpha parameter is further moderated by both thespatial and velocity offset from the cluster center, with larger alphacorrelated with the proximity of the bcg to the cluster mean velocity orpotential center. at the same time, position in the cluster has little effecton l_m. the luminosity difference between the bcg and second-ranked galaxy, m2,increases as the peculiar velocity of the bcg within the cluster decreases.further, when m2 is a close luminosity "rival" of the bcg, the galaxy that isclosest to either the velocity or x-ray center of the cluster is most likely tohave the larger alpha. we conclude that the inner portions of the bcgs areformed outside the cluster, but interactions in the heart of the galaxy clustergrow and extend the envelopes of the bcgs.

1411.1414	hubble space telescope combined strong and weak lensing analysis of the  clash sample: mass and magnification models and systematic uncertainties	we present results from a comprehensive lensing analysis in hst data, of thecomplete clash cluster sample. we identify new multiple-images previouslyundiscovered allowing improved or first constraints on the cluster inner massdistributions and profiles. we combine these strong-lensing constraints withweak-lensing shape measurements within the hst fov to jointly constrain themass distributions. the analysis is performed in two different commonparameterizations (one adopts light-traces-mass for both galaxies and darkmatter while the other adopts an analytical, elliptical nfw form for the darkmatter), to provide a better assessment of the underlying systematics - whichis most important for deep, cluster-lensing surveys, especially when studyingmagnified high-redshift objects. we find that the typical (median), relativesystematic differences throughout the central fov are $\sim40\%$ in the(dimensionless) mass density, $\kappa$, and $\sim20\%$ in the magnification,$\mu$. we show maps of these differences for each cluster, as well as the massdistributions, critical curves, and 2d integrated mass profiles. for theeinstein radii ($z_{s}=2$) we find that all typically agree within $10\%$between the two models, and einstein masses agree, typically, within$\sim15\%$. at larger radii, the total projected, 2d integrated mass profilesof the two models, within $r\sim2\arcmin$, differ by $\sim30\%$. stacking thesurface-density profiles of the sample from the two methods together, we obtainan average slope of $d\log (\sigma)/d\log(r)\sim-0.64\pm0.1$, in the radialrange [5,350] kpc. lastly, we also characterize the behavior of the averagemagnification, surface density, and shear differences between the two models,as a function of both the radius from the center, and the best-fit values ofthese quantities.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

1504.00598	ultraviolet morphologies and star-formation rates of clash brightest  cluster galaxies	brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) are usually quiescent, but many exhibitstar formation. here we exploit the opportunity provided by rest-frame uvimaging of galaxy clusters in the clash (cluster lensing and supernovae withhubble) multi-cycle treasury project to reveal the diversity of uv morphologiesin bcgs and to compare them with recent simulations of the cool, star-forminggas structures produced by precipitation-driven feedback. all of the clash bcgsare detected in the rest-frame uv (280 nm), regardless of their star-formationactivity, because evolved stellar populations produce a modest amount of uvlight that traces the relatively smooth, symmetric, and centrally peakedstellar distribution seen in the near infrared. ultraviolet morphologies amongthe bcgs with strong uv excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongatedclumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from thesmooth profiles of the uv-quiet bcgs. these structures, which are similar tothose seen in the few star-forming bcgs observed in the uv at low redshift, aresuggestive of bi-polar streams of clumpy star formation, but not of spiral armsor large, kpc-scale disks. based on the number of streams and lack of culpritcompanion galaxies, these streams are unlikely to have arisen from multiplecollisions with gas-rich galaxies. these star-forming uv structures aremorphologically similar to the cold-gas structures produced in simulations ofprecipitation-driven agn feedback in which jets uplift low-entropy gas togreater altitudes, causing it to condense. unobscured star-formation ratesestimated from clash uv images using the kennicutt relation range up to 80solar masses per year in the most extended and highly structured systems. thecircumgalactic gas-entropy threshold for star formation in clash bcgs atz~0.2-0.5 is indistinguishable from that for clusters at z &lt; 0.2.

1511.04002	the detection and statistics of giant arcs behind clash clusters	we developed an algorithm to find and characterize gravitationally lensedgalaxies (arcs) to perform a comparison of the observed and simulated arcabundance. observations are from the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). simulated clash images are created using the moka package andalso clusters selected from the high resolution, hydrodynamical simulations,music, over the same mass and redshift range as the clash sample. thealgorithm' s arc elongation accuracy, completeness and false positive rate aredetermined and used to compute an estimate of the true arc abundance. we derivea lensing efficiency of $4 \pm 1$ arcs (with length $\ge 6"$ andlength-to-width ratio $\ge 7$) per cluster for the x-ray selected clash sample,$4 \pm 1$ arcs per cluster for the moka simulated sample and $3 \pm 1$ arcs percluster for the music simulated sample. the observed and simulated arcstatistics are in full agreement. we measure the photometric redshifts of alldetected arcs and find a median redshift $z_s = 1.9$ with 33% of the detectedarcs having $z_s &gt; 3$. we find that the arc abundance does not depend stronglyon the source redshift distribution but is sensitive to the mass distributionof the dark matter halos (e.g. the $c-m$ relation). our results show thatconsistency between the observed and simulated distributions of lensed arcsizes and axial ratios can be achieved by using cluster-lensing simulationsthat are carefully matched to the selection criteria used in the observations.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0110383	the alignment effect of brightest cluster galaxies in the sdss	one of the most vital observational clues for unraveling the origin ofbrightest cluster galaxies (bcg) is the observed alignment of the bcgs withtheir host cluster and its surroundings. we have examined the bcg-clusteralignment effect, using clusters of galaxies detected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we find that the bcgs are preferentially aligned with theprincipal axis of their hosts, to a much higher redshift (z &gt;~ 0.3) than probedby previous studies (z &lt;~ 0.1). the alignment effect strongly depends on themagnitude difference of the bcg and the second and third brightest clustermembers: we find a strong alignment effect for the dominant bcgs, while lessdominant bcgs do not show any departure from random alignment with respect tothe cluster. we therefore claim that the alignment process originates from thesame process that makes the bcg grow dominant, be it direct mergers in theearly stage of cluster formation, or a later process that resembles thegalactic cannibalism scenario. we do not find strong evidence for (or against)redshift evolution between 0&lt;z&lt;0.45, largely due to the insufficient samplesize (&lt; 200 clusters). however, we have developed a framework by which we canexamine many more clusters in an automated fashion for the upcoming sdsscluster catalogs, which will provide us with better statistics for systematicinvestigations of the alignment with redshift, richness and morphology of boththe cluster and the bcg.

astro-ph;0205513	the kpno/deeprange distant cluster survey: i. the catalog &amp; the space  density of intermediate redshift clusters	we have conducted an automated search for galaxy clusters within a contiguous16 square degree i-band survey in the north galactic hemisphere. a matchedfilter detection algorithm identifies 444 cluster candidates in the range 0.2&lt;= z &lt;= 1.2. the full catalog is presented along with the results from afollow-up spectroscopic survey. the estimated redshift distribution of thecluster candidates is consistent with a constant comoving density over therange 0.2 &lt;= z_est &lt;= 0.8. a decline in the cluster space density by more thana factor of 3 over this redshift range is rejected at &gt;99.9% confidence level.we find that the space density of lambda_cl &gt;= 40 clusters in our survey liesin the range (1.6 - 1.8) x 10^{-5} h_{75}^{3} mpc^{-3}, ~1.5 times higher thanthe local distribution of comparably rich abell rc &gt;= 0 clusters. the lambda_cldistribution is consistent with a power-law. the discrepancy between the spacedensity of abell clusters and the clusters in this survey declines quickly aslambda_cl increases, suggesting that the difference at lower richness is due tosignificant incompleteness in the abell catalog. a percolation analysis revealsthat 10 - 20% of the spectroscopically confirmed distant clusters are linkedinto superclusters at overdensities between 10 &lt; {\delta\rho \over \rho} &lt; 50,similar to what is seen in the local cluster distribution. this suggests thatthere has been little evolution of the cluster-cluster correlation length for z&lt;= 0.5.

astro-ph;0211074	hubble space telescope imaging of brightest cluster galaxies	we used the hst wfpc2 to obtain i-band images of the centers of 81 brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs), drawn from a volume-limited sample of nearby bcgs. theimages show a rich variety of morphological features, including multiple ordouble nuclei, dust, stellar disks, point source nuclei, and central surfacebrightness depressions. high resolution surface brightness profiles could beinferred for 60 galaxies. of those, 88% have well-resolved cores. twelvepercent of the bcg sample lacks a well-resolved core; all but one of these bcgshave ``power-law'' profiles. some of these galaxies have higher luminositiesthan any power-law galaxy identified by faber et al. (1997), and have physicalupper limits on the break radius well below the values observed for coregalaxies of the same luminosity. these results support the idea that thecentral structure of early-type galaxies is bimodal in its physical properties,but also suggest that there exist high luminosity galaxies with power-lawprofiles (or unusually small cores). the bcgs in the latter category tend tofall at the low end of the bcg luminosity function and tend to have low valuesof the quantity alpha (the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as afunction of radius, at 10 kpc). since theoretical calculations have shown thatthe luminosities and alpha values of bcgs grow with time as a result ofaccretion, this suggests a scenario in which elliptical galaxies evolve frompower-law profiles to core profiles through accretion and merging. this isconsistent with theoretical scenarios that invoke the formation of massiveblack hole binaries during merger events (abridged).

astro-ph;0604082	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  early-type galaxies in the lynx supercluster at z~1.26	color-magnitude relations have been derived in the clusters rx j0849+4452 andrx j0848+4453 at z~1.26. the color-magnitude relation was determined fromadvanced camera for surveys imaging in the wfc f775w (i_775) and f850lp (z_850)filters combined with ground-based spectroscopy. early-type cluster candidateshave been identified according to the postman et al. morphologicalclassification. in both clusters the bright red early-type population defines atight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusterspresent different x-ray luminosities and shapes, with rx j0849+4452 being threetimes more x-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two timeshigher. the elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (cmr) in rx j0849+4452and rx j0848+4453 show an intrinsic (i_775-z_850) color scatter of 0.026 +/-0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (~1mpc atz=1.26) from the cluster x-ray emission centers. simple modeling of thescatters using stellar population models from bruzual and charlot, gives a meanluminosity-weighted age t &gt; 2.5 gyr (z_f &gt; 2.75). s0 galaxies follow theelliptical cmr; they show larger scatters about the cmr.  the intrinsic scatter decreases and the cmr slopes are steeper at smallerradii, within both clusters. we conclude that old stellar populations incluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the moreevolved cluster rx j0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion rx j0848+4453.even at a lookback time of 9 gyr, in the early merging and buildup of massiveclusters, the bulk of the stellar content of the bright elliptical galaxypopulation was in place - apparently formed some 2.5~gyr earlier at z~3

astro-ph;0606739	the masses of nuclear black holes in luminous elliptical galaxies and  implications for the space density of the most massive black holes	black hole masses predicted from the mbh-sigma relationship conflict withthose predicted from the mbh-l relationship for the most luminous galaxies,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). this is because stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with l for bcgs and other giantellipticals. the mbh-l relationship predicts that the most luminous bcgs mayhave mbh approaching 10^{10}m_sol, while the m-sigma relationship alwayspredicts mbh&lt;3x10^9m_sol. we argue that the mbh-l relationship is a plausibleor even preferred description for bcgs and other galaxies of similarluminosity. if cores in central stellar density are formed by binary bhs, thenthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of mbh.using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxiesobserved by hst, we argue that l is superior to sigma as an indicator ofr_gamma in luminous galaxies. the observed r_gamma-mbh relationship for 11 coregalaxies with measured mbh appears to be consistent with the mbh-l relationshipfor bcgs. bcgs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities thatmay be difficult to generate with the modest bh masses inferred from thembh-sigma relationship. mbh~l may be expected to hold for bcgs, if they wereformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of bh to stellarmass. this picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigmawith l and the more rapid increase in effective radii with l seen in bcgs. ifbcgs have large bhs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local bhmass function for mbh&gt;3x10^9m_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richerthan that inferred from the mbh-sigma relationship. the volume density of qsosat earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the mbh-l relationship.

(1997). the bcgglobular cluster luminosity functions give distances essentially identical tothe sbf results. using the velocities and sbf distances of the four bcg alonegives h_0 = 82 +/- 8 km/s/mpc in the cmb frame, valid on ~4,500 km/s scales.use of bcg as photometric redshift estimators allows the bcg hubble diagram tobe calibrated independently of recession velocities, yielding a far field h_0 =89 +/- 10 km/s/mpc with an effective depth of ~11,000 km/s. the error in thiscase is dominated by the photometric cosmic scatter in using bcg as distanceestimators. the concordance of the present results with other recent h_0determinations, and a review of theoretical treatments on perturbations in thenear field hubble flow, argue that going to the far field removes an importantsource of uncertainty, but that there is not a large systematic error to becorrected for to begin with. further improvements in h_0 depend more onunderstanding nearby calibrators than on improved sampling of the distant flow.

0810.1917	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters at z ~1  from the acs intermediate redshift cluster survey	we apply detailed observations of the color-magnitude relation (cmr) with theacs/hst to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z~1. the early-type redsequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similarcmrs. we analyze cmr parameters as a function of redshift, galaxy propertiesand cluster mass. for bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -21mag), the cmr scatter of theelliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the s0population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes. while thebright s0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals,the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. if weinterpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxiesin cluster cores are on average older than s0 galaxies and peripheralelliptical galaxies (by about 0.5gyr). cmr zero point, slope, and scatter inthe (u-b)_z=0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~1.3nor significant dependence on cluster mass. two of our clusters display cmrzero points that are redder (by ~2sigma) than the average (u-b)_z=0 of oursample. we also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find that, while in the majority of theclusters most (80% to 90%) of the cmr population is composed of early-typegalaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster of our sample, the cmrlate-type/early-type fractions are similar (~50%), with most of the late-typepopulation composed of galaxies classified as s0/a. this trend is notcorrelated with the cluster's x-ray luminosity, nor with its velocitydispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift.
