0904.1200	blast: correlations in the cosmic far-infrared background at 250, 350,  and 500 microns reveal clustering of star-forming galaxies	we detect correlations in the cosmic far-infrared background due to theclustering of star-forming galaxies in observations made with the balloon-bornelarge aperture submillimeter telescope, blast, at 250, 350, and 500 microns. weperform jackknife and other tests to confirm the reality of the signal. themeasured correlations are well fit by a power law over scales of 5-25arcminutes, with delta i/i = 15.1 +/- 1.7%. we adopt a specific model forsubmillimeter sources in which the contribution to clustering comes fromsources in the redshift ranges 1.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 2.2, 1.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 2.7, and 1.7 &lt;= z&lt;= 3.2, at 250, 350, and 500 microns, respectively. with these distributions,our measurement of the power spectrum, p(k_theta), corresponds to linear biasparameters, b = 3.8 +/- 0.6, 3.9 +/- 0.6 and 4.4 +/- 0.7, respectively. wefurther interpret the results in terms of the halo model, and find that at thesmaller scales, the simplest halo model fails to fit our results. one way toimprove the fit is to increase the radius at which dark matter halos areartificially truncated in the model, which is equivalent to having somestar-forming galaxies at z &gt;= 1 located in the outskirts of groups andclusters. in the context of this model we find a minimum halo mass required tohost a galaxy is log (m_min / m_sun) = 11.5 (+0.4/-0.1), and we deriveeffective biases $b_eff = 2.2 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.2, and 2.6 +/- 0.2, andeffective masses log (m_eff / m_sun) = 12.9 +/- 0.3, 12.8 +/- 0.2, and 12.7 +/-0.2, at 250, 350, and 500 microns, corresponding to spatial correlation lengthsof r_0 = 4.9, 5.0, and 5.2 +/- 0.7 h^-1 mpc, respectively. finally, we discussimplications for clustering measurement strategies with herschel and planck.

0904.1201	over half of the far-infrared background light comes from galaxies at z  &gt;= 1.2	submillimetre surveys during the past decade have discovered a population ofluminous, high-redshift, dusty starburst galaxies. in the redshift range 1 &lt;= z&lt;= 4, these massive submillimetre galaxies go through a phase characterized byoptically obscured star formation at rates several hundred times that in thelocal universe. half of the starlight from this highly energetic process isabsorbed and thermally re-radiated by clouds of dust at temperatures near 30 kwith spectral energy distributions peaking at 100 microns in the rest frame. at1 &lt;= z &lt;= 4, the peak is redshifted to wavelengths between 200 and 500 microns.the cumulative effect of these galaxies is to yield extragalactic optical andfar-infrared backgrounds with approximately equal energy densities. since theinitial detection of the far-infrared background (firb), higher-resolutionexperiments have sought to decompose this integrated radiation into thecontributions from individual galaxies. here we report the results of anextragalactic survey at 250, 350 and 500 microns. combining our results at 500microns with those at 24 microns, we determine that all of the firb comes fromindividual galaxies, with galaxies at z &gt;= 1.2 accounting for 70 per cent ofit. as expected, at the longest wavelengths the signal is dominated byultraluminous galaxies at z &gt; 1.

0904.1203	a bright submillimeter source in the bullet cluster (1e0657--56) field  detected with blast	we present the 250, 350, and 500 micron detection of bright submillimeteremission in the direction of the bullet cluster measured by the balloon-bornelarge aperture submillimeter telescope (blast). the 500 micron centroid iscoincident with an aztec 1.1 mm point-source detection at a position close tothe peak lensing magnification produced by the cluster. however, the 250 micronand 350 micron centroids are elongated and shifted toward the south with adifferential shift between bands that cannot be explained by pointinguncertainties. we therefore conclude that the blast detection is likelycontaminated by emission from foreground galaxies associated with the bulletcluster. the submillimeter redshift estimate based on 250-1100 micronphotometry at the position of the aztec source is z_phot = 2.9 (+0.6 -0.3),consistent with the infrared color redshift estimation of the most likely iraccounterpart. these flux densities indicate an apparent far-infrared luminosityof l_fir = 2e13 lsun. when the amplification due to the gravitational lensingof the cluster is removed, the intrinsic far-infrared luminosity of the sourceis found to be l_fir &lt;= 10^12 lsun, consistent with typical luminous infraredgalaxies.

0904.1205	blast: resolving the cosmic submillimeter background	the balloon-borne large aperture submillimeter telescope (blast) has made onesquare degree, deep, confusion limited maps at three different bands, centeredon the great observatories origins deep survey south field. by calculating thecovariance of these maps with catalogs of 24 micron sources from thefar-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (fidel), we have determined thatthe total submillimeter intensities are 8.60 +/- 0.59, 4.93 +/- 0.34, and 2.27+/- 0.20 nw m^2 sr^(-1) at 250, 350, and 500 micron, respectively. thesenumbers are more precise than previous estimates of the cosmic infraredbackground (cib) and are consistent with 24 micron-selected galaxies generatingthe full intensity of the cib.  we find that the fraction of the cib that originates from sources at z &gt;= 1.2increases with wavelength, with 60% from high redshift sources at 500 micron.at all blast wavelengths, the relative intensity of high-z sources is higherfor 24 micron-faint sources than it is for 24 micron-bright sources. galaxiesidentified as active galactic nuclei (agn) by their infrared array camera(irac) colors are 1.6-2.6 times brighter than the average population at 250-500micron, consistent with what is found for x-ray-selected agn. bzk-selectedgalaxies are found to be moderately brighter than typical 24 micron-selectedgalaxies in the blast bands. these data provide high precision constraints formodels of the evolution of the number density and intensity of star forminggalaxies at high redshift.

0904.1206	blast: a far-infrared measurement of the history of star formation	we directly measure redshift evolution in the mean physical properties(far-infrared luminosity, temperature, and mass) of the galaxies that producethe cosmic infrared background (cib), using measurements from the balloon-bornelarge aperture sub-millimeter telescope (blast), and spitzer which constrainthe cib emission peak. this sample is known to produce a surface brightness inthe blast bands consistent with the full cib, and photometric redshifts areidentified for all of the objects. we find that most of the 70 micronbackground is generated at z &lt;~ 1 and the 500 micron background generated at z&gt;~ 1. a significant growth is observed in the mean luminosity from ~ 10^9 -10^12 l_sun, and in the mean temperature by 10 k, from redshifts 0&lt; z &lt; 3.however, there is only weak positive evolution in the comoving dust mass inthese galaxies across the same redshift range. we also measure the evolution ofthe far-infrared luminosity density, and the star-formation rate history forthese objects, finding good agreement with other infrared studies up to z ~1,exceeding the contribution attributed to optically-selected galaxies.

0904.1207	blast: the mass function, lifetimes, and properties of intermediate mass  cores from a 50 square degree submillimeter galactic survey in vela (l =  ~265)	we present first results from an unbiased 50 deg^2 submillimeter galacticsurvey at 250, 350, and 500 micron from the 2006 flight of the balloon-bornelarge aperture submillimeter telescope (blast). the map has resolution rangingfrom 36 arcsec to 60 arcsec in the three submillimeter bands spanning thethermal emission peak of cold starless cores. we determine the temperature,luminosity, and mass of more than one thousand compact sources in a range ofevolutionary stages and an unbiased statistical characterization of thepopulation. from comparison with c^(18)o data, we find the dust opacity per gasmass, kappa r = 0.16 cm^2 g^(-1) at 250 micron, for cold clumps. we find that2% of the mass of the molecular gas over this diverse region is in cores colderthan 14 k, and that the mass function for these cold cores is consistent with apower law with index alpha = -3.22 +/- 0.14 over the mass range 14 m_sun &lt; m &lt;80 m_sun. additionally, we infer a mass-dependent cold core lifetime of t_c(m)= 4e6 (m/20 m_sun)^(-0.9) years - longer than what has been found in previoussurveys of either low or high mass cores, and significantly longer than freefall or likely turbulent decay times. this implies some form of non-thermalsupport for cold cores during this early stage of star formation.

0906.0981	submillimeter number counts from statistical analysis of blast maps	we describe the application of a statistical method to estimate submillimetergalaxy number counts from confusion limited observations by the balloon-bornelarge aperture submillimeter telescope (blast). our method is based on amaximum likelihood fit to the pixel histogram, sometimes called 'p(d)', anapproach which has been used before to probe faint counts, the difference beingthat here we advocate its use even for sources with relatively highsignal-to-noise ratios. this method has an advantage over standard techniquesof source extraction in providing an unbiased estimate of the counts from thebright end down to flux densities well below the confusion limit. wespecifically analyse blast observations of a roughly 10 sq. deg. map centeredon the great observatories origins deep survey south (goods-s) field. weprovide estimates of number counts at the three blast wavelengths, 250, 350,and 500 microns; instead of counting sources in flux bins we estimate thecounts at several flux density nodes connected with power-laws. we observe agenerally very steep slope for the counts of about -3.7 at 250 microns and -4.5at 350 and 500 microns, over the range ~0.02-0.5 jy, breaking to a shallowerslope below about 0.015 jy at all three wavelengths. we also describe how toestimate the uncertainties and correlations in this method so that the resultscan be used for model-fitting. this method should be well-suited for analysisof data from the herschel satellite.

0907.4156	blast: the redshift survey	the balloon-borne large aperture submillimeter telescope (blast) has recentlysurveyed ~8.7 deg^2 centered on goods-south at 250, 350, and 500 microns. indye et al. (2009) we presented the catalogue of sources detected at 5-sigma inat least one band in this field and the probable counterparts to these sourcesin other wavebands. in this paper, we present the results of a redshift surveyin which we succeeded in measuring redshifts for 82 of these counterparts. thespectra show that the blast counterparts are mostly star-forming galaxies butnot extreme ones when compared to those found in the sloan digital sky survey.roughly one quarter of the blast counterparts contain an active nucleus. wehave used the spectroscopic redshifts to carry out a test of the ability ofphotometric redshift methods to estimate the redshifts of dusty galaxies,showing that the standard methods work well even when a galaxy contains a largeamount of dust. we have also investigated the cases where there are twopossible counterparts to the blast source, finding that in at least half ofthese there is evidence that the two galaxies are physically associated, eitherbecause they are interacting or because they are in the same large-scalestructure. finally, we have made the first direct measurements of theluminosity function in the three blast bands. we find strong evolution out toz=1, in the sense that there is a large increase in the space-density of themost luminous galaxies. we have also investigated the evolution of thedust-mass function, finding similar strong evolution in the space-density ofthe galaxies with the largest dust masses, showing that the luminosityevolution seen in many wavebands is associated with an increase in thereservoir of interstellar matter in galaxies.

0910.1091	blast: the far-infrared/radio correlation in distant galaxies	we investigate the correlation between far-infrared (fir) and radioluminosities in distant galaxies, a lynchpin of modern astronomy. we use datafrom the balloon-borne large aperture submillimetre telescope (blast), spitzer,the large apex bolometer camera (laboca), the very large array (vla) and thegiant metre-wave radio telescope (gmrt) in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs). for a catalogue of blast 250-micron-selected galaxies, were-measure the 70--870-micron flux densities at the positions of their mostlikely 24-micron counterparts, which have a median [interquartile] redshift of0.74 [0.25, 1.57]. from these, we determine the monochromatic flux densityratio, q_250 = log_10 (s_250micron / s_1400mhz), and the bolometric equivalent,q_ir. at z ~= 0.6, where our 250-micron filter probes rest-frame 160-micronemission, we find no evolution relative to q_160 for local galaxies. we alsostack the fir and submm images at the positions of 24-micron- andradio-selected galaxies. the difference between q_ir seen for 250-micron- andradio-selected galaxies suggests star formation provides most of the irluminosity in ~&lt; 100-ujy radio galaxies, but rather less for those in the mjyregime. for the 24-micron sample, the radio spectral index is constant across 0&lt; z &lt; 3, but q_ir exhibits tentative evidence of a steady decline such thatq_ir is proportional to (1+z)^(-0.15 +/- 0.03) - significant evolution,spanning the epoch of galaxy formation, with major implications for techniquesthat rely on the fir/radio correlation. we compare with model predictions andspeculate that we may be seeing the increase in radio activity that gives riseto the radio background.

1010.1025	the atacama cosmology telescope: cosmology from galaxy clusters detected  via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample ofsunyaev-zel'dovich-selected galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wavesurvey by the atacama cosmology telescope. the cluster sample used in thisanalysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising thehigh-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 squaredegrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 ghz. we focus on the most massivesystems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics andcosmology derived from sz surveys. we describe the scaling relation betweencluster mass and sz signal with a 4-parameter fit. marginalizing over thevalues of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 =0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wcdm cosmologicalmodel with wmap 7-year priors on cosmological parameters. this gives a modestimprovement in statistical uncertainty over wmap 7-year constraints alone.fixing the scaling relation between cluster mass and sz signal to a fiducialrelation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by x-rayobservations, we find sigma_8 = 0.821 +/- 0.044 and w = -1.05 +/- 0.20. theseresults are consistent with constraints from wmap 7 plus baryon acousticoscillations plus type ia supernoava which give sigma_8 = 0.802 +/- 0.038 and w= -0.98 +/- 0.053. a stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample comparedto clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement.these results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both theastrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived fromthem are broadly consistent with current models.

1010.1176	a monte carlo approach to evolution of the far-infrared luminosity  function with blast	we constrain the evolution of the rest-frame far-infrared (fir) luminosityfunction out to high redshift, by combining several pieces of complementaryinformation provided by the deep balloon-borne large-aperture submillimetertelescope surveys at 250, 350 and 500 micron, as well as other fir andmillimetre data. unlike most other phenomenological models, we characterise theuncertainties in our fitted parameters using monte carlo markov chains. we usea bivariate local luminosity function that depends only on fir luminosity and60-to-100 micron colour, along with a single library of galaxy spectral energydistributions indexed by colour, and apply simple luminosity and densityevolution. we use the surface density of sources, cosmic infrared background(cib) measurements and redshift distributions of bright sources, for whichidentifications have been made, to constrain this model. the precise evolutionof the fir luminosity function across this crucial range has eluded studies atlonger wavelengths (e.g., using scuba and mambo) and at shorter wavelengths(e.g., spitzer), and should provide a key piece of information required for thestudy of galaxy evolution. our adoption of monte carlo methods enables us notonly to find the best-fit evolution model, but also to explore correlationsbetween the fitted parameters. our model-fitting approach allows us to focus onsources of tension coming from the combination of data-sets. we specificallyfind that our choice of parameterisation has difficulty fitting the combinationof cib measurements and redshift distribution of sources near 1 mm. existingand future data sets will be able to dramatically improve the fits, as well asbreak strong degeneracies among the models.

1108.4614	power-law template for ir point source clustering	we perform a combined fit to angular power spectra of unresolved infrared(ir) point sources from the planck satellite (at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz,over angular scales 100 &lt; l &lt; 2200), the balloon-borne large-aperturesubmillimeter telescope (blast; 250, 350 and 500 um; 1000 &lt; l &lt; 9000), and fromcorrelating blast and atacama cosmology telescope (act; 148 and 218 ghz) maps.we find that the clustered power over the range of angular scales andfrequencies considered is well fit by a simple power law of the form c_l\propto l^-n with n = 1.25 +/- 0.06. while the ir sources are understood to lieat a range of redshifts, with a variety of dust properties, we find that thefrequency dependence of the clustering power can be described by the square ofa modified blackbody, nu^beta b(nu,t_eff), with a single emissivity index beta= 2.20 +/- 0.07 and effective temperature t_eff = 9.7 k. our predictions forthe clustering amplitude are consistent with existing act and south poletelescope results at around 150 and 220 ghz, as is our prediction for theeffective dust spectral index, which we find to be alpha_150-220 = 3.68 +/-0.07 between 150 and 220 ghz. our constraints on the clustering shape andfrequency dependence can be used to model the ir clustering as a contaminant incosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements. the combined planck andblast data also rule out a linear bias clustering model.

1112.5433	evidence for environmental changes in the submillimeter dust opacity	the submillimeter opacity of dust in the diffuse galactic interstellar medium(ism) has been quantified using a pixel-by-pixel correlation of images ofcontinuum emission with a proxy for column density. we used three blast bandsat 250, 350, and 500 \mu m and one iras at 100 \mu m. the proxy is thenear-infrared color excess, e(j-ks), obtained from 2mass. based on observationsof stars, we show how well this color excess is correlated with the totalhydrogen column density for regions of moderate extinction. the ratio ofemission to column density, the emissivity, is then known from thecorrelations, as a function of frequency. the spectral distribution of thisemissivity can be fit by a modified blackbody, whence the characteristic dusttemperature t and the desired opacity \sigma_e(1200) at 1200 ghz can beobtained. we have analyzed 14 regions near the galactic plane toward the velamolecular cloud, mostly selected to avoid regions of high column density (n_h &gt;10^{22} cm^-2) and small enough to ensure a uniform t. we find \sigma_e(1200)is typically 2 to 4 x 10^{-25} cm^2/h and thus about 2 to 4 times larger thanthe average value in the local high galactic latitude diffuse atomic ism. thisis strong evidence for grain evolution. there is a range in total power per hnucleon absorbed (re-radiated) by the dust, reflecting changes in theinterstellar radiation field and/or the dust absorption opacity. these changesaffect the equilibrium t, which is typically 15 k, colder than at highlatitudes. our analysis extends, to higher opacity and lower t, the trend ofincreasing opacity with decreasing t that was found at high latitudes. therecognition of changes in the emission opacity raises a cautionary flag becauseall column densities deduced from dust emission maps, and the masses of compactstructures within them, depend inversely on the value adopted.

0711.0274	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- vi. 350 micron  mapping of submillimetre galaxies	a follow-up survey using the submillimetre high-angular resolution camera(sharc-ii) at 350 microns has been carried out to map the regions aroundseveral 850 micron-selected sources from the submillimetre half degreeextragalactic survey (shades). these observations probe the infraredluminosities and hence star-formation rates in the largest existing, mostrobust sample of submillimetre galaxies (smgs). we measure 350 micron fluxdensities for 24 850 micron sources, seven of which are detected at &gt;2.5-sigmawithin a 10 arcsec search radius of the 850 micron positions. when results fromthe literature are included the total number of 350 micron flux densityconstraints of shades smgs is 31, with 15 detections. we fit a modifiedblackbody to the far-infrared (fir) photometry of each smg, and confirm thattypical smgs are dust-rich (mdust~9x10^8 msun), luminous (lfir~2x10^12 lsun),star-forming galaxies with intrinsic dust temperatures of ~35 k andstar-formation rates of ~400 msun/yr. we have measured the temperaturedistribution of smgs and find that the underlying distribution is slightlybroader than implied by the error bars, and that most smgs are at 28 k with afew hotter. we also place new constraints on the 350 micron source counts,n350(&gt;25mjy)~200-500 deg^-2.

1205.2369	the atacama cosmology telescope: relation between galaxy cluster optical  richness and sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present the measured sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) flux from 474optically-selected maxbcg clusters that fall within the atacama cosmologytelescope (act) equatorial survey region. the act equatorial region used inthis analysis covers 510 square degrees and overlaps stripe 82 of the sloandigital sky survey. we also present the measured sz flux stacked on 52x-ray-selected mcxc clusters that fall within the act equatorial region and anact southern survey region covering 455 square degrees. we find that themeasured sz flux from the x-ray-selected clusters is consistent withexpectations. however, we find that the measured sz flux from theoptically-selected clusters is both significantly lower than expectations andlower than the recovered sz flux measured by the planck satellite. since wefind a lower recovered sz signal than planck, we investigate the possibilitythat there is a significant offset between the optically-selected brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs) and the sz centers, to which act is more sensitive dueto its finer resolution. such offsets can arise due to either an intrinsicphysical separation between the bcg and the center of the gas concentration orfrom misidentification of the cluster bcg. we find that the entire discrepancyfor both act and planck can be explained by assuming that the bcgs are offsetfrom the sz maxima with a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1.5 mpc.such large offsets between gas peaks and bcgs for optically-selected clustersamples seem unlikely given that we find the physical separation between bcgsand x-ray peaks for an x-ray-selected subsample of maxbcg clusters to have amuch narrower distribution that peaks within 0.2 mpc. it is possible that othereffects are lowering the act and planck signals by the same amount, withoffsets between bcgs and sz peaks explaining the remaining difference betweenmeasurements.

1311.1515	the 2nd generation z(redshift) and early universe spectrometer part i:  first-light observation of a highly lensed local-ulirg analog at high-z	we report first science results from our new spectrometer, the 2nd generationz(redshift) and early universe spectrometer (zeus-2), recently commissioned onthe atacama pathfinder experiment telescope (apex). zeus-2 is a submillimetergrating spectrometer optimized for detecting the faint and broad lines fromdistant galaxies that are redshifted into the telluric windows from 200 to 850microns. it utilizes a focal plane array of transition-edge sensed bolometers,the first use of these arrays for astrophysical spectroscopy. zeus-2 promisesto be an important tool for studying galaxies in the years to come due to itssynergy with alma and its capabilities in the short submillimeter windows thatare unique in the post herschel era. here we report on our first detection ofthe [cii] 158 $\mu m$ line with zeus-2. we detect the line at z ~ 1.8 fromh-atlas j091043.1-000322 with a line flux of $(6.44 \pm 0.42) \times 10^{-18} wm^{-2}$. combined with its far-infrared luminosity and a new herschel-pacsdetection of the [oi] 63 $\mu m $ line we model the line emission as comingfrom a photo-dissociation region with far-ultraviolet radiation field, $g\approx 2 \times 10^{4} g_{0}$, gas density, $n \approx 1 \times 10^{3}cm^{-3}$ and size between ~ 0.4 and 1 kpc. based on this model, we concludethat h-atlas j091043.1-000322 is a high redshift analogue of a localultra-luminous infrared galaxy, i.e. it is likely the site of a compactstarburst due to a major merger. further identification of these mergingsystems is important for constraining galaxy formation and evolution models.

1312.7834	cold dust in hot regions	we mapped five massive star forming regions with the scuba-2 camera on thejames clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). temperature and column density maps areobtained from the scuba-2 450 and 850 $\mu$m images. most of the dense clumpswe find have central temperatures below 20 k with some as cold as 8 k,suggesting that they have no internal heating due to the presence of embeddedprotostars. this is surprising, because at the high densities inferred fromthese images and at these low temperatures such clumps should be unstable,collapsing to form stars and generating internal heating. the column densitiesat the clump centres exceed 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and the derived peak visualextinction values are from 25-500 mag for $\beta$ = 1.5-2.5, indicating highlyopaque centres. the observed cloud gas masses range from $\sim$ 10 to 10$^{3}$m$_{\odot}$. the outer regions of the clumps follow an $r^{-2.36\pm0.35}$density distribution and this power-law structure is observed outside oftypically 10$^{4}$ au. all these findings suggest that these clumps arehigh-mass starless clumps and most likely contain high-mass starless cores.

1406.2288	canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment (chime) pathfinder	a pathfinder version of chime (the canadian hydrogen intensity mappingexperiment) is currently being commissioned at the dominion radio astrophysicalobservatory (drao) in penticton, bc. the instrument is a hybrid cylindricalinterferometer designed to measure the large scale neutral hydrogen powerspectrum across the redshift range 0.8 to 2.5. the power spectrum will be usedto measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale across this poorlyprobed redshift range where dark energy becomes a significant contributor tothe evolution of the universe. the instrument revives the cylinder design inradio astronomy with a wide field survey as a primary goal. modern low-noiseamplifiers and digital processing remove the necessity for the analogbeamforming that characterized previous designs. the pathfinder consists of twocylinders 37\,m long by 20\,m wide oriented north-south for a total collectingarea of 1,500 square meters. the cylinders are stationary with no moving parts,and form a transit instrument with an instantaneous field of view of$\sim$100\,degrees by 1-2\,degrees. each chime pathfinder cylinder has afeedline with 64 dual polarization feeds placed every $\sim$30\,cm whichnyquist sample the north-south sky over much of the frequency band. the signalsfrom each dual-polarization feed are independently amplified, filtered to400-800\,mhz, and directly sampled at 800\,msps using 8 bits. the correlator isan fx design, where the fourier transform channelization is performed in fpgas,which are interfaced to a set of gpus that compute the correlation matrix. thechime pathfinder is a 1/10th scale prototype version of chime and is designedto detect the bao feature and constrain the distance-redshift relation.

1407.1880	pointing control for the spider balloon-borne telescope	we present the technology and control methods developed for the pointingsystem of the spider experiment. spider is a balloon-borne polarimeter designedto detect the imprint of primordial gravitational waves in the polarization ofthe cosmic microwave background radiation. we describe the two main componentsof the telescope's azimuth drive: the reaction wheel and the motorized pivot. a13 khz pi control loop runs on a digital signal processor, with feedback fromfibre optic rate gyroscopes. this system can control azimuthal speed with &lt;0.02 deg/s rms error. to control elevation, spider uses stepper-motor-drivenlinear actuators to rotate the cryostat, which houses the optical instruments,relative to the outer frame. with the velocity in each axis controlled in thisway, higher-level control loops on the onboard flight computers can implementthe pointing and scanning observation modes required for the experiment. wehave accomplished the non-trivial task of scanning a 5000 lb payloadsinusoidally in azimuth at a peak acceleration of 0.8 deg/s$^2$, and a peakspeed of 6 deg/s. we can do so while reliably achieving sub-arcminute pointingcontrol accuracy.

1407.2584	the primordial inflation polarization explorer (piper)	the primordial inflation polarization explorer (piper) is a balloon-bornecosmic microwave background (cmb) polarimeter designed to search for evidenceof inflation by measuring the large-angular scale cmb polarization signal.bicep2 recently reported a detection of b-mode power corresponding to thetensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.2 on ~2 degree scales. if the bicep2 signal iscaused by inflationary gravitational waves (igws), then there should be acorresponding increase in b-mode power on angular scales larger than 18degrees. piper is currently the only suborbital instrument capable of fullytesting and extending the bicep2 results by measuring the b-mode power spectrumon angular scales $\theta$ = ~0.6 deg to 90 deg, covering both the reionizationbump and recombination peak, with sensitivity to measure the tensor-to-scalarratio down to r = 0.007, and four frequency bands to distinguish foregrounds.piper will accomplish this by mapping 85% of the sky in four frequency bands(200, 270, 350, 600 ghz) over a series of 8 conventional balloon flights fromthe northern and southern hemispheres. the instrument has background-limitedsensitivity provided by fully cryogenic (1.5 k) optics focusing the sky signalonto four 32x40-pixel arrays of time-domain multiplexed transition-edge sensor(tes) bolometers held at 140 mk. polarization sensitivity and systematiccontrol are provided by front-end variable-delay polarization modulators(vpms), which rapidly modulate only the polarized sky signal at 3 hz and allowpiper to instantaneously measure the full stokes vector (i, q, u, v) for eachpointing. we describe the piper instrument and progress towards its firstflight.

astro-ph;0302471	estimates of confusion and gravitational lensing limits in  sunyaev-zel'dovich increment measurements	we present estimates of the confusion limit of measurements of thesunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sz) increment near its peak intensity based on montecarlo simulations of sub-millimetre observations of galaxy clusters.specifically, we evaluate the contribution of gravitational lensing of highredshift background sources by a target cluster to its inferred sz signal. wefind that the background confusion limit is 0.6 mjy per beam without anylensing. with gravitational lensing, the confusion limit increases to 0.9 mjyper beam. removing bright sources in the gravitationally lensed fieldsdecreases the confusion limit to 0.7 mjy per beam, essentially backgroundlevels. these limits are found by removing exceptionally poor fits to theexpected sz profile, which are due to the different structure of the sz andlensing angular profiles.  we conclude that experiments designed to measure the sz increment must havehigh enough angular resolution to identify background point sources whilesurveying enough of the sky to determine the sz profile. observations of the szincrement with scuba, which has sufficient sensitivity and resolution for thetask, should be straight forward.

astro-ph;0306300	measurement of the sunyaev-zel'dovich increment in massive galaxy  clusters	we have detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) increment at 850 microns in twogalaxy clusters (cl 0016+16 and ms 1054.4-0321) using scuba (sub-millimetrecommon user bolometer array) on the james clerk maxwell telescope. fits to theisothermal \beta model yield a central compton y parameter of (2.2 \pm 0.7) x10^{-4} and a central 850 micron flux of \delta i_{0} = 2.2 \pm 0.7 mjy/beam incl 0016. this can be combined with decrement measurements to infer y = (2.38\pm_{0.34}^{0.36}) x 10^{-4} and v_{pec} = 400 \pm_{1400}^{1900} km/s. in ms1054 we find a peak 850 micron flux of \delta i_{0} = 2.0 \pm 1.0 mjy/beam andy = (2.0 \pm 1.0) x 10^{-4}. to be successful such measurements require largechop throws and non-standard data analysis techniques. in particular, the 450micron data are used to remove atmospheric variations in the 850 micron data.an explicit annular model is fit to the scuba difference data in order toextract the radial profile, and separately fit to the model differences tominimize the effect of correlations induced by our scanning strategy. we havedemonstrated that with sufficient care, scuba can be used to measure the szincrement in massive, compact galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;9909092	a search for the submillimetre counterparts to lyman break galaxies	we have carried out targetted sub-mm observations as part of a programme toexplore the connection between the rest-frame uv and far-ir properties ofstar-forming galaxies at high redshift, which is currently poorly understood.on the one hand the lyman break technique is very effective at selecting z~3galaxies. on the other hand `blank field' imaging in the sub-mm seems to turnup sources routinely, amongst which some are star forming galaxies at similarredshifts. already much work has been done searching for opticalidentifications of objects detected using the scuba instrument. here we havetaken the opposite approach, performing sub-mm photometry for a sample of lymanbreak galaxies whose uv properties imply high star formation rates.  the total signal from our lyman break sample is undetected in the sub-mm, atan rms level of 0.5 mjy, which implies that the population of lyman breakgalaxies does not constitute a large part of the recently detected blank-fieldsub-mm sources. however, our one detection suggests that with reasonable scubaintegrations we might expect to detect those few lbgs that are far-irbrightest.
