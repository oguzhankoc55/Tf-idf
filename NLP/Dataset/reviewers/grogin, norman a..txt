1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

1008.3384	a new extensive catalog of optically variable agn in the goods fields  and a new statistical approach to variability selection	variability is a property shared by practically all agn. this makesvariability selection a possible technique for identifying agn. given thatvariability selection makes no prior assumption about spectral properties, itis a powerful technique for detecting both low-luminosity agn in which the hostgalaxy emission is dominating and agn with unusual spectral properties. in thispaper, we will discuss and test different statistical methods for the detectionof variability in sparsely sampled data that allow full control over the falsepositive rates. we will apply these methods to the goods north and south fieldsand present a catalog of variable sources in the z band in both goods fields.out of 11931 objects checked, we find 155 variable sources at a significancelevel of 99.9%, corresponding to about 1.3% of all objects. after rejection ofstars and supernovae, 139 variability selected agn remain. their magnitudesreach down as faint as 25.5 mag in z. spectroscopic redshifts are available for22 of the variability selected agn, ranging from 0.046 to 3.7. the absolutemagnitudes in the rest-frame z-band range from ~ -18 to -24, reachingsubstantially fainter than the typical luminosities probed by traditional x-rayand spectroscopic agn selection in these fields. therefore, this is a powerfultechnique for future exploration of the evolution of the faint end of the agnluminosity function up to high redshifts.

1009.3504	a detailed study of photometric redshifts for goods-south galaxies	we use the deepest and the most comprehensive photometric data currentlyavailable for goods-south galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. thephotometry includes vlt/vimos (u-band), hst/acs (f435w, f606w, f775w, andf850lp bands), vlt/isaac (j-, h-, and ks-bands), and four spitzer/irac channels(3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron). the catalog is selected in the z-band (f850lp)and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed tfitalgorithm, which performs psf matched photometry uniformly across differentinstruments and filters, despite large variations in psfs and pixel scales.photometric redshifts are derived using the goodz code, which is based on thetemplate fitting method using priors. the code also implements "training" ofthe template sed set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order tominimize systematic differences between the templates and the seds of theobserved galaxies. our final catalog covers an area of 153 sq. arcmin andincludes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. the scatterbetween our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma=0.040with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing tosigma=0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit m(z)&lt;24.5. this isconsistent with the best results previously published for goods-s galaxies,however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and providesphotometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits andhigher redshifts than earlier works. furthermore, we show that the photometricredshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent withthose expected based on the lyman break technique.

1101.0843	color and stellar population gradients in passively evolving galaxies at  z~2 from hst/wfc3 deep imaging in the hubble ultra deep field	we report the detection of color gradients in six massive (stellar mass &gt;10^{10} m_{sun}) and passively evolving (specific sfr &lt; 10^{-11}/yr) galaxiesat redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.5 identified in the hudf using hst acs and wfc3/ir images.after matching different psfs, we obtain color maps and multi-bandoptical/near-ir photometry (bvizyjh) in concentric annuli, from the smallestresolved radial (~1.7 kpc) up to several times the h-band effective radius. wefind that the inner regions of these galaxies have redder rest-frameuv--optical colors than the outer parts. the slopes of the color gradientsmildly depend on the overall dust obscuration and rest-frame (u-v) color, withmore obscured or redder galaxies having steeper color gradients. the z~2 colorgradients are also steeper than those of local early-types. the gradient of asingle parameter (age, extinction or metallicity) cannot fully explain theobserved color gradients. fitting spatially resolved hst seven-band photometryto stellar population synthesis models, we find that, regardless of assumptionsfor metallicity gradient, the redder inner regions of the galaxies haveslightly higher dust obscuration than the bluer outer regions, although themagnitude depends on the assumed extinction law. the derived age gradientdepends on the assumptions for metallicity gradient. we discuss theimplications of a number of assumptions for metallicity gradient on theformation and evolution of these galaxies. we find that the evolution of themass--size relationship from z~2 to z~0 cannot be driven by in--situ extendedstar formation, implying that accretion or merger is mostly responsible for theevolution. the lack of a correlation between color gradient and stellar massargues against the metallicity gradient predicted by the monolithic collapse,which would require significant major mergers to evolve into the one observedat z~0.

1105.3753	candels: the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy  survey	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over theapproximate redshift (z) range 8--1.5. it will image &gt;250,000 distant galaxiesusing three separate cameras on the hubble space telescope, from themid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure type iasupernovae at z&gt;1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles forcosmology. five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each withextensive ancillary data. the use of five widely separated fields mitigatescosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples ofgalaxies down to a stellar mass of 10^9 m_\odot to z \approx 2, reaching theknee of the ultraviolet luminosity function (uvlf) of galaxies to z \approx 8.the survey covers approximately 800 arcmin^2 and is divided into two parts. thecandels/deep survey (5\sigma\ point-source limit h=27.7 mag) covers \sim 125arcmin^2 within goods-n and goods-s. the candels/wide survey includes goods andthree additional fields (egs, cosmos, and uds) and covers the full area to a5\sigma\ point-source limit of h \gtrsim 27.0 mag. together with the hubbleultra deep fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding cake" approachthat has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. data from the survey arenonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. inthis paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the candels teamscience goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selectionand geometry, and the observing design. the hubble data processing and productsare described in a companion paper.

1108.6075	a candels wfc3 grism study of emission-line galaxies at z~2: a mix of  nuclear activity and low-metallicity star formation	we present hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 slitless grismspectroscopy of 28 emission-line galaxies at z~2, in the goods-s region of thecosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). thehigh sensitivity of these grism observations, with 1-sigma detections ofemission lines to f &gt; 2.5x10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2, means that the galaxies in thesample are typically ~7 times less massive (median m_* = 10^{9.5} m_sun) thanpreviously studied z~2 emission-line galaxies. despite their lower mass, thegalaxies have oiii/hb ratios which are very similar to previously studied z~2galaxies and much higher than the typical emission-line ratios of localgalaxies. the wfc3 grism allows for unique studies of spatial gradients inemission lines, and we stack the two-dimensional spectra of the galaxies forthis purpose. in the stacked data the oiii emission line is more spatiallyconcentrated than the hb emission line with 98.1 confidence. we additionallystack the x-ray data (all sources are individually undetected), and find thatthe average l(oiii)/l(0.5-10 kev) ratio is intermediate between typical z~0obscured active galaxies and star-forming galaxies. together the compactness ofthe stacked oiii spatial profile and the stacked x-ray data suggest that atleast some of these low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies harbor weak activegalactic nuclei.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.3801	rest-frame uv--optically selected galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5: searching for  dusty star-forming and passively-evolving galaxies	a new set of color selection criteria (vjl) analogous with the bzk method isdesigned to select both star-forming galaxies (sfgs) and passively-evolvinggalaxies (pegs) at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 by using rest-frame uv--optical (v-j vs. j-l)colors. the criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar populationsynthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluatetheir efficiency and contamination. we apply the well-tested vjl criteria tothe hst/wfc3 early release science field and study the physical properties ofselected galaxies. the redshift distribution of selected sfgs peaks at z~2.7,slightly lower than that of lyman break galaxies at z~3. comparing the observedmid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellaremission, we find that our vjl method is effective at selecting massive dustysfgs that are missed by the lyman break technique. about half of the starformation in massive (m_{star}&gt;10^{10}m_{sun}) galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 iscontributed by dusty (extinction e(b-v)&gt;0.4) sfgs, which however, only accountfor ~20% of the number density of massive sfgs. we also use the mid-infraredfluxes to clean our peg sample, and find that galaxy size can be used as asecondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty sfgs.the redshift distribution of the cleaned peg sample peaks at z~2.5. we find 6peg candidates at z&gt;3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them fromdusty contamination. we conclude that at least part of our candidates are realpegs at z~3, implying that this type of galaxies began to form their stars atz&gt;5. we measure the integrated stellar mass density of pegs at z~2.5 and setconstraints on it at z&gt;3. we find that the integrated stellar mass densitygrows by at least about factor of 10 in 1 gyr at 3&lt;z&lt;5 and by another factor of10 in next 3.5 gyr (1&lt;z&lt;3).

1110.4057	goods-herschel and candels: the morphologies of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies at z~2	using deep 100-160 micron observations in goods-s from the goods-h survey,combined with hst/wfc3 nir imaging from candels, we present the firstmorphological analysis of a complete, fir selected sample of 52 ulirgs at z~2.we also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies without herschel detectionsbut with the same z and magnitude distribution. our visual classifications ofthese two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroidmorphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ulirgs. the combination of diskand irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactionsand minor mergers could play an important role in ulirgs at z~2. we comparethese fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range andfind that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with l_ir while thefraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.at comparable luminosities, the fraction of ulirgs with various morphologicalclassifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. we investigate the position of theulirgs, along with 70 lirgs, on the specific star formation rate versusredshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of3 above the main sequence relation). the morphologies of starbursts aredominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). if irregular disks areincluded as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starburstsare involved in a merger or interaction at some level. although the finalcoalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities ofulirgs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at allstages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation ratesof ulirgs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.

1111.2135	clustering properties of bzk-selected galaxies in goods-n: environmental  quenching and triggering of star formation at z ~ 2	using a sample of bzk-selected galaxies at z~2 identified from thecfht/wircam near-infrared survey of goods-north, we discuss the relationbetween star formation rate (sfr), specific star formation rate (ssfr), andstellar mass (m_{*}), and the clustering of galaxies as a function of theseparameters. for star-forming galaxies (sbzks), the uv-based sfr, corrected forextinction, scales with the stellar mass as sfr ~ m_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =0.74+/-0.20 down to m_{*} ~ 10^{9} m_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence onthe stellar mass of the ssfr. we also measure the angular correlation functionand hence infer the correlation length for sbzk galaxies as a function ofm_{*}, sfr, and ssfr, as well as k-band apparent magnitude. we show thatpassive galaxies (pbzks) are more strongly clustered than sbzk galaxies at agiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lowerredshifts. we also find that the correlation length of sbzk galaxies rangesfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}mpc, being a strong function of m_{k}, m_{*}, and sfr. onthe other hand, the clustering dependence on ssfr changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}yr^{-1}, which is the typical value for "main sequence" star-forming galaxiesat z~2. we show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at thischaracteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and largerssfrs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of thesemi-analytical models. our results suggest that there are two types ofenvironmental effects at work at z~2. stronger clustering for relativelyquiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role inquenching star formation. at the same time, stronger clustering for galaxieswith elevated ssfrs ("starbursts") might be attributed to an increasedefficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.

1201.1012	survey design for spectral energy distribution fitting: a fisher matrix  approach	the spectral energy distribution (sed) of a galaxy contains information onthe galaxy's physical properties, and multi-wavelength observations are neededin order to measure these properties via sed fitting. in planning thesesurveys, optimization of the resources is essential. the fisher matrixformalism can be used to quickly determine the best possible experimental setupto achieve the desired constraints on the sed fitting parameters. however,because it relies on the assumption of a gaussian likelihood function, it is ingeneral less accurate than other slower techniques that reconstruct theprobability distribution function (pdf) from the direct comparison betweenmodels and data. we compare the uncertainties on sed fitting parameterspredicted by the fisher matrix to the ones obtained using the more thorough pdffitting techniques. we use both simulated spectra and real data, and consider alarge variety of target galaxies differing in redshift, mass, age, starformation history, dust content, and wavelength coverage. we find that theuncertainties reported by the two methods agree within a factor of two in thevast majority (~ 90%) of cases. if the age determination is uncertain, thetop-hat prior in age used in pdf fitting to prevent each galaxy from beingolder than the universe needs to be incorporated in the fisher matrix, at leastapproximately, before the two methods can be properly compared. we concludethat the fisher matrix is a useful tool for astronomical survey design.

1206.0735	candels: the contribution of the observed galaxy population to cosmic  reionization	we present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from asample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. these galaxies were selected from new deepnear-infrared hst imaging from the candels, hudf09 and ers programs. incontrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that thedistribution of galaxy ultraviolet (uv) luminosities follows a schechterdistribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below ourobservable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxieswhich we can observe, free from these assumptions. we find that the observablepopulation of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized igm at z=6, if the averageionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. a number of previous studieshave measured uv luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5x, withmany concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless alarge population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, orextremely high values of f_esc were present. the observed uv luminosity densityfrom our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fullyreionized igm unless f_esc&gt;50%. combining our observations with constraints onthe emission rate of ionizing photons from ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,we can constrain f_esc&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the onlycontributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity functionextends to m_uv = -13. these escape fractions are sufficient to completereionization by z=6. these constraints imply that the volume ionized fractionof the igm becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number ofcomplementary reionization probes. if faint galaxies dominate reionization,future jwst observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing anindirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1304.0768	the discovery of the most distant known type ia supernova at redshift  1.914	we present the discovery of a type ia supernova (sn) at redshift $z = 1.914$from the candels multi-cycle treasury program on the \textit{hubble spacetelescope (hst)}. this sn was discovered in the infrared using the wide-fieldcamera 3, and it is the highest-redshift type ia sn yet observed. we classifythis object as a sn\,ia by comparing its light curve and spectrum with those ofa large sample of type ia and core-collapse supernovae (sne). its apparentmagnitude is consistent with that expected from the $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. we discuss the use of spectral evidence for classification of $z &gt;1.5$ sne\,ia using {\it hst} grism simulations, finding that spectral dataalone can frequently rule out sne\,ii, but distinguishing between sne\,ia andsne\,ib/c can require prohibitively long exposures. in such cases, aquantitative analysis of the light curve may be necessary for classification.our photometric and spectroscopic classification methods can aid thedetermination of sn rates and cosmological parameters from the fullhigh-redshift candels sn sample.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1305.2204	the redshift and mass dependence on the formation of the hubble sequence  at z&gt;1 from candels/uds	in this paper we present a detailed study of the structures and morphologiesof a sample of 1188 massive galaxies with mstar&gt;10^10msun between redshiftsz=1-3 within the ultra deep survey (uds) region of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) field. using thissample we determine how galaxy structure and morphology evolve with time. wevisually classify our sample into disks, ellipticals and peculiar systems andcorrect for redshift effects on our classifications through simulations. wefind evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual classification asa function of redshift. the peculiar population is dominant at z&gt;2 with asubstantial spheroid population, and a negligible disk population. we computethe transition redshift, ztrans, where the combined fraction of spheroids anddisks is equal to that of peculiar galaxies, as ztrans=1.86+/-0.62 for galaxiesin our stellar mass range. we find that this changes as a function of stellarmass, with hubble-type systems becoming dominant at higher redshifts for highermass galaxies (ztrans=2.22+/-0.82), than for the lower mass galaxies(ztrans=1.73+/-0.57). higher mass galaxies become morphologically settledbefore their lower mass counterparts, a form of morphological downsizing. wefurthermore compare our visual classifications with sersic index, theconcentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (cas) parameters, star formation rateand rest frame u-b colour. we find links between the colour of a galaxy, itsstar formation rate and how extended or peculiar it appears. finally, wediscuss the negligible z&gt;2 disk fraction based on visual morphologies andspeculate that this is an effect of forming disks appearing peculiar throughprocesses such as violent disk instabilities or mergers. we conclude that toproperly define high redshift morphology a new and more exact classificationscheme is needed.

1305.6931	structural evolution of early-type galaxies to z=2.5 in candels	projected axis ratio measurements of 880 early-type galaxies at redshifts1&lt;z&lt;2.5 selected from candels are used to reconstruct and model their intrinsicshapes. the sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors toreflect low star-formation activity. we demonstrate that these galaxies as anensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth lightprofiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. similar to theirpresent-day counterparts, the z&gt;1 early-type galaxies show a variety ofintrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributionscannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with verysimilar intrinsic shapes. however, a two-population model for the intrinsicshapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat(c/a~0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratiodistributions of both present-day and z&gt;1 early-type galaxies. we find that theproportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies'stellar mass, and - at a given mass - on redshift. for present-day and z&lt;1early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. at z&gt;1this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here(10^10&lt;m*/m_sun&lt;10^11), because the oblate fraction among massive (m*~10^11m_sun) was much higher in the past: 0.59+-0.10 at z&gt;1, compared to 0.20+-0.02at z~0.1. in contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies(log(m*/m_sun)&lt;10.5) increased toward the present, from 0.38+-0.11 at z&gt;1 to0.72+-0.06 at z=0.

1307.3247	evidence for a correlation between the sizes of quiescent galaxies and  local environment to z ~ 2	we present evidence for a strong relationship between galaxy size andenvironment for the quiescent population in the redshift range 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.environments were measured using projected galaxy overdensities on a scale of400 kpc, as determined from ~ 96,000 k-band selected galaxies from the ukidssultra deep survey (uds). sizes were determined from ground-based k-bandimaging, calibrated using space-based candels hst observations in the centre ofthe uds field, with photometric redshifts and stellar masses derived from11-band photometric fitting. from the resulting size-mass relation, we confirmthat quiescent galaxies at a given stellar mass were typically ~ 50 % smallerat z ~ 1.4 compared to the present day. at a given epoch, however, we find thatpassive galaxies in denser environments are on average significantly larger ata given stellar mass. the most massive quiescent galaxies (m_stellar &gt; 2 x10^11 m_sun) at z &gt; 1 are typically 50 % larger in the highest densityenvironments compared to those in the lowest density environments. using montecarlo simulations, we reject the null hypothesis that the size-mass relation isindependent of environment at a significance &gt; 4.8 sigma for the redshift range1 &lt; z &lt; 2. in contrast, the evidence for a relationship between size andenvironment is much weaker for star-forming galaxies.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1310.5702	a candels - 3d-hst synergy: resolved star formation patterns at 0.7 &lt; z  &lt; 1.5	we analyze the resolved stellar populations of 473 massive star-forminggalaxies at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, with multi-wavelength broad-band imaging fromcandels and halpha surface brightness profiles at the same kiloparsecresolution from 3d-hst. together, this unique data set sheds light on how theassembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars arebeing formed. we find the halpha morphologies to resemble more closely thoseobserved in the acs i band than in the wfc3 h band, especially for the largersystems. we next derive a novel prescription for halpha dust corrections, whichaccounts for extra extinction towards hii regions. the prescription leads toconsistent sfr estimates and reproduces the observed relation between thehalpha/uv luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel andon a galaxy-integrated level. we find the surface density of star formation tocorrelate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatiallyresolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of starformation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. deviations from thisrelation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions ofgalaxies. clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated withenhanced halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific starformation rates compared to the underlying disk. their halpha/uv luminosityratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the acs clumpselection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formationactivity that are the least obscured by dust. our analysis emphasizes thatmonochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited bymass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous starformation histories.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1402.0866	bulge growth and quenching since z = 2.5 in candels/3d-hst	exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 candels fields, andaccurate redshift information provided by 3d-hst, we investigate the relationbetween structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764galaxies above 10^10 msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. for thefirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single sersic fit andtwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the h-band lightdistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolvedstellar population modeling. we confirm that the increased bulge prominenceamong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-opticalobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellarmass. moreover, we observe an increase of the typical sersic index andbulge-to-total ratio (with median b/t reaching 40-50%) among star-forminggalaxies above 10^11 msun. given that quenching for these most massive systemsis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growthprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. we demonstrate thatthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a morereliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy thanthe total stellar mass. the same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-artsemi-analytic model by somerville et al. in the latter, bulges and black holesgrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and agn-feedbackshuts off star formation. further observations will be required to pin downstar formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must beinternal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.

1410.5439	the evolution of the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function  over the first two billion years	we present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet(uv) luminosity function at z=4-8. we use deep hubble space telescope imagingover the candels/goods fields, the hubble ultra deep field and the year 1hubble frontier field deep parallel observations. these surveys provides aneffective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us toperform a robust search for faint (m_uv=-18) and bright (m_uv &lt; -21) galaxies.we select candidate galaxies using a well-tested photometric redshift techniquewith careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446 galaxies at3.5&lt;z&lt;8.5, with &gt;1000 galaxies at z~6-8. we measure the luminosity functionusing a markov chain monte carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. atthe faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higherabundance of uv-bright galaxies at z&gt;6, with m* ~ -21 at z&gt;5, different thanthat inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. at z=8, a singlepower-law provides an equally good fit to the uv luminosity function, while atz=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. wecompare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in m* isconsistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-endof the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. we measure theevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dustattenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z&gt;4,consistent with observations at z&gt;9. our observations are consistent with areionization history that starts at z&gt;10, completes at z&gt;6, and reaches amidpoint (x_hii = 0.5) at 6.7&lt;z&lt;9.4. finally, our observations predict that theabundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies.

1411.3339	deconstructing the galaxy stellar mass function with ukidss and candels:  the impact of colour, structure and environment	we combine photometry from the uds, and candels uds and candels goods-ssurveys to construct the galaxy stellar mass function probing both the low andhigh mass end accurately in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3. the advantages of usinga homogeneous concatenation of these datasets include meaningful measures ofenvironment in the uds, due to its large area (0.88 deg^2), and the highresolution deep imaging in candels (h_160 &gt; 26.0), affording us robust measuresof structural parameters. we construct stellar mass functions for the entiresample as parameterised by the schechter function, and find that there is adecline in the values of phi and of alpha with higher redshifts, and a nearlyconstant m* up to z~3. we divide the galaxy stellar mass function by colour,structure, and environment and explore the links between environmentalover-density, morphology, and the quenching of star formation. we find that adouble schechter function describes galaxies with high sersic index (n&gt;2.5),similar to galaxies which are red or passive. the low-mass end of the n&gt;2.5stellar mass function is dominated by blue galaxies, whereas the high-mass endis dominated by red galaxies. this hints that possible links betweenmorphological evolution and star formation quenching are only present inhigh-mass galaxies. this is turn suggests that there are strong mass dependentquenching mechanisms. in addition, we find that the number density of high masssystems is elevated in dense environments, suggesting that an environmentalprocess is building up massive galaxies quicker in over densities than in lowerdensities.

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1508.00948	eco and resolve: galaxy disk growth in environmental context	we study the relationships between galaxy environments and galaxy propertiesrelated to disk (re)growth, considering two highly complete samples that areapproximately baryonic mass limited into the high-mass dwarf galaxy regime, theenvironmental context (eco) catalog (data release herein) and the b-semesterregion of the resolved spectroscopy of a local volume (resolve) survey. wequantify galaxy environments using both group identification and smoothedgalaxy density field methods. we use by-eye and quantitative morphologicalclassifications plus atomic gas content measurements and estimates. we findthat blue early-type (e/s0) galaxies, gas-dominated galaxies, and uv-brightdisk host galaxies all become distinctly more common below group halo mass~10^11.5 msun, implying that this low group halo mass regime may be a preferredregime for significant disk growth activity. we also find that blue early-typeand blue late-type galaxies inhabit environments of similar group halo mass atfixed baryonic mass, consistent with a scenario in which blue early types canregrow late-type disks. in fact, we find that the only significant differencein the typical group halo mass inhabited by different galaxy classes is forsatellite galaxies with different colors, where at fixed baryonic mass redearly and late types have higher typical group halo masses than blue early andlate types. more generally, we argue that the traditionalmorphology-environment relation (i.e., that denser environments tend to havemore early types) can be largely attributed to the morphology-galaxy massrelation for centrals and the color-environment relation for satellites.

1509.06381	probing the physical properties of z=4.5 lyman alpha emitters with  spitzer	we present the results from a stellar population modeling analysis of asample of 162 z=4.5, and 14 z=5.7 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) in thebootes field, using deep spitzer/irac data at 3.6 and 4.5 um from the spitzerlyman alpha survey, along with hubble space telescope nicmos and wfc3 imagingat 1.1 and 1.6 um for a subset of the laes. this represents one of the largestsamples of high-redshift laes imaged with spitzer irac. we find that 30/162(19%) of the z=4.5 laes and 9/14 (64%) of the z=5.7 laes are detected at&gt;3-sigma in at least one irac band. individual z=4.5 irac-detected laes have alarge range of stellar mass, from 5x10^8 to 10^11 msol. one-third of theirac-detected laes have older stellar population ages of 100 myr - 1 gyr, whilethe remainder have ages &lt; 100 myr. a stacking analysis of irac-undetected laesshows this population to be primarily low mass (8 -- 20 x 10^8 msol) and young(64 - 570 myr). we find a correlation between stellar mass and thedust-corrected ultraviolet-based star-formation rate (sfr) similar to that atlower redshifts, in that higher mass galaxies exhibit higher sfrs. however, thez=4.5 lae correlation is elevated 4-5 times in sfr compared tocontinuum-selected galaxies at similar redshifts. the exception is the mostmassive laes which have sfrs similar to galaxies at lower redshifts suggestingthat they may represent a different population of galaxies than the traditionallower-mass laes, perhaps with a different mechanism promoting lyman alphaphoton escape.

astro-ph;0309039	observing the formation of the hubble sequence in the great  observatories origins deep survey	understanding the physical formation of the hubble sequence remains one ofthe most important unsolved astrophysical problems. searches for proto-disksand proto-ellipticals can now be effectively done using deep wide-field hubblespace telescope images taken with the new advanced camera for surveys. throughan analysis of concentrations (c), asymmetries (a) and clumpiness values (s)(cas) of galaxies found in the goods field south, we are able to identifyobjects possibly forming onto the hubble sequence. using this approach, wedetect a sizeable population of star forming luminous diffuse objects and starforming luminous asymmetric objects between redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2. thesegalaxies have extremely low light concentrations, or high asymmetries, withabsolute magnitudes m_b &lt; -19. the luminous diffuse objects are found inabundance between z = 1 - 2, with fewer objects at z &gt; 2 and z &lt; 1. theluminous asymmetric objects are found at a similar abundance, with a peak atz~1. we argue that these galaxies are a subset of modern disks and ellipticalsin formation. the co-moving volume density of the luminous diffuse objectsbetween z = 1 - 2 is similar to the local density of bright disk galaxies, withvalues ~5*10^{5} gpc^{-3}. the seds of these objects are mostly consistent withstarbursts, or star-forming normal galaxies, with average uncorrected forextinction star formation rates of ~4 m_0 yr^{-1}. these galaxies also host35-40% of the star formation activity at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. we briefly discuss theimplications of these objects for understanding the origin of the hubblesequence.

astro-ph;0309187	morphologies and spectral energy distributions of extremely red galaxies  in the goods-south field	using u'- through ks-band imaging data in the goods-south field, we constructa large, complete sample of 275 ``extremely red objects'' (eros; k_s&lt;22.0,r-k_s&gt;3.35; ab), all with deep hst/acs imaging in b_435, v_606, i_775, andz_850, and well-calibrated photometric redshifts. quantitative concentrationand asymmetry measurements fail to separate eros into distinct morphologicalclasses. we therefore visually classify the morphologies of all eros into fourbroad types: ``early'' (elliptical-like), ``late'' (disk galaxies),``irregular'' and ``other'' (chain galaxies and low surface brightnessgalaxies), and calculate their relative fractions and comoving space densities.for a broad range of limiting magnitudes and color thresholds, the relativenumber of early-type eros is approximately constant at 33-44%, and the comovingspace densities of early- and late-type eros are comparable. mean rest-framespectral energy distributions (seds) at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1.2 um areconstructed for all eros. the seds are extremely similar in their range ofshapes, independent of morphological type. the implication is that anydifferences between the broad-band seds of early-type eros and the other typesare relatively subtle, and there is no robust way of photometricallydistinguishing between different morphological types with usualoptical/near-infrared photometry.

astro-ph;0408070	high-redshift extremely red objects in the hst ultra deep field revealed  by the goods irac observations	using early data from the infrared array camera (irac) on the spitzer spacetelescope, taken for the great observatories origins deep survey (goods), weidentify and study objects that are well-detected at 3.6um, but are very faint(and in some cases, invisible) in the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) acs andnicmos images and in very deep vlt ks-band imaging. we select a sample of 17objects with f_nu(3.6um)/f_nu(z_{850})&gt;20. the analysis of their spectralenergy-distributions (seds) from 0.4 to 8.0um shows that the majority of theseobjects cannot be satisfactorily explained without a well-evolved stellarpopulation. we find that most of them can be well fitted by a simpletwo-component model, where the primary component represents a massive, oldpopulation that dominates the strong ir emission, while the secondary componentrepresents a low amplitude, on-going star-formation process that accounts forthe weak optical fluxes. their estimated photometric redshifts (z_p) range from1.6 to 2.9, with the median at z_p=2.4. for the simple star formation historiesconsidered here, their corresponding stellar masses range from 0.1 to 1.6e11m_sun for a chabrier initial mass function (imf). their median rest-frameks-band absolute magnitude is -22.9 mag in ab system, or 1.5xl*(k) forpresent--day elliptical galaxies. in the scenario of pure luminosity evolution,such objects may be direct progenitors for at least 14 to 51% of the localpopulation of early--type galaxies. due to the small cosmic volume of the hudf,however, this simple estimate could be affected by other effects such as cosmicvariance and the strong clustering of massive galaxies. a full analysis of theentire goods area is now underway to assess such effects.

astro-ph;0512007	spitzer number counts of agn in the goods fields	we present mid-infrared observations of agn in the goods fields, performedwith the spitzer space telescope. these are the deepest infrared and x-rayfields to date and cover a total area of ~0.1 square degrees. agn are selectedon the basis of their hard (2-8 kev) x-ray emission. the median agn infraredluminosity is at least 10 times larger than the median for normal galaxies withthe same redshift distribution, suggesting that the infrared emission isdominated by the central nucleus. the x-ray to infrared luminosity ratios ofgoods agn, most of which are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5, are similar to the values obtainedfor agn in the local universe. the observed infrared flux distribution has anintegral slope of ~1.5 and there are 1000 sources per square degree brighterthan ~50 ujy at 3-6 microns. the counts approximately match the predictions ofmodels based on agn unification, in which the majority of agn are obscured.this agreement confirms that the faintest x-ray sources, which are dominated bythe host galaxy light in the optical, are obscured agn. using these spitzerdata, the agn contribution to the extragalactic infrared background light iscalculated by correlating the x-ray and infrared catalogues. this is likely tobe a lower limit given that the most obscured agn are missed in x-rays. weestimate the contribution of agn missed in x-rays, using a population synthesismodel, to be ~45% of the observed agn contribution, making the agn contributionto the infrared background at most ~2-10% in the 3-24 micron range, dependingon wavelength, lower than most previous estimates. the agn contribution to theinfrared background remains roughly constant with source flux in the irac bandsbut decreases with decreasing flux in the mips 24 um band, where the galaxypopulation becomes more important.

astro-ph;9512156	a new model of the gravitational lens 0957+561 and a limit on the hubble  constant	we present a simple mass model for the lensing galaxy in the gravitationallylensed quasar 0957+561. the model is a generalization of the singularisothermal sphere and includes a core radius, $r_c$, and a power-law index,$\eta$, defined such that mass increases as $r^\eta$ at large radius. weapproximate the galaxy cluster surrounding the lensing galaxy with a quadraticpotential described by its convergence $\kappa$ and shear $\gamma$. we fit themodel to a recent high resolution vlbi map of the two images of 0957+561. weobtain a tight constraint on the radial index, $1.07 &lt; \eta &lt;1.18$, which meansthat the lens galaxy is nearly isothermal with increasing mass-to-light ratioout to $15 h^{-1}$ kpc. we also obtain an upper limit on the core radius, $r_c&lt; 330 h^{-1}$ pc. we use the model to calculate the hubble constant $h_0$ as afunction of the time delay $\delta\tau_{ba}$ between the two images: $h_0 =\left({ 82.5^{+5.9} _{-3.0} }\right) (1 - \kappa) \left({ \delta\tau_{ba}/1.1\,{\rm yr} }\right)^{-1}$ km/s/mpc. once $\delta \tau_{ba}$ is measured, thiswill provide an upper bound on $h_0$ since $\kappa$ cannot be negative. inaddition, the model degeneracy due to $\kappa$ can be eliminated if theone-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the lensing galaxy is measured.we then have $h_0 = \left({ 82.5^{+8.7} _{-5.6} }\right) (\sigma / 322\,{\rmkm/s})^2 \left({ \delta \tau_{ba} /1.1 \,{\rm yr} }\right)^{-1}$ km/s/mpc. weinvestigate the effects of ellipticity in the lensing galaxy and clumpiness inthe lensing cluster and find that these cause little change in our results.

astro-ph;9804326	lyman-alpha absorption systems and the nearby galaxy distribution	we study the galaxy number density (smoothed on a 5h^{-1} mpc scale) around18 low-redshift lyman-alpha absorbers previously observed with hst. theabsorbers lie in the foregrounds of mrk 335, mrk 421, mrk 501, i zw 1, and 3c273, all within regions where there are now complete redshift surveys tom_{zw}=15.5. we construct a smoothed galaxy number density field from theredshift survey data and determine the distribution of densities at thelyman-alpha absorber locations. we also find the distribution of galaxy numberdensity for a variety of test samples: all galaxy locations within the centerfor astrophysics redshift survey (cfa2), cfa2 galaxy locations along randomlyselected lines of sight (los), and randomly chosen redshifts along random los.  the lyman-alpha absorbers are present in dense regions of the survey, butoccur far more frequently in underdense regions than do typical luminousgalaxies. the distribution of smoothed galaxy density around the lyman-alphaabsorbers is inconsistent at the 4-sigma level with the density distributionaround survey galaxies. it is highly consistent with a density distribution atrandomly chosen redshifts along random los. this supports earlier evidence thatthe nearby, low column density (log n_{hi} &lt; 14) lyman-alpha forest systems arespatially distributed at random; they are not well correlated with the locallarge-scale structure.
