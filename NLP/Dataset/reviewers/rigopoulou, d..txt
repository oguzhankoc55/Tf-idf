0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0909.3950	on the stellar masses of irac detected lyman break galaxies at z~3	we present results of a large survey of the mid--ir properties of 248 lymanbreak galaxies with confirmed spectroscopic redshift using deep spitzer/iracobservations in six cosmological fields. we model the spectral energydistributions (seds) employing a revised version of the bruzual and charlotsynthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the tp--agbphase (cb07). our primary aim is to investigate the impact of the agb phase inthe stellar masses of the lbgs, and compare our new results with previousstellar mass estimates. based on the new cb07 code we find that the stellarmasses of lbgs are smaller on average by a factor of ~1.4 compared to previousestimates. lbgs with 8um and/or 24um detections show higher masses (m~10^11 mo)than lbgs faint in the irac bands (m~10^9 mo). the ages of these massive lbgsare considerably higher than the rest of the population, indicating that theyhave been star-forming for at least ~1 gyr. we also show how the addition ofthe irac bands, improves the accuracy of the estimated stellar masses andreduced the scatter on the derived m/l ratios. in particular, we present atight correlation between the 8um irac band (rest-frame k for galaxies at z~3)and the stellar mass. we calculate the number density of massive (m &gt; 10^11 mo)lbgs and find it to be $\phi$= (1.12 $\pm$ 0.4) x 10^(-5) mpc^(-3), ~1.5 timeslower than that found by previous studies. finally, based on uv-corrected sfrswe investigate the sfr-stellar mass correlation at z~3, find it similar to theone observed at other redshifts and show that our data place the peak of theevolution of the specific star formation rate at z~3.

1005.1071	herschel and scuba-2 imaging and spectroscopy of a bright, lensed  submillimetre galaxy at z = 2.3	we present a detailed analysis of the far-ir properties of the bright,lensed, z = 2.3, smg, smm j2135-0102, using new observations with herschel,scuba-2 and the vla. these data allow us to constrain the galaxy's sed and showthat it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000um luminosity, l(bol), of (2.3 +/-0.2) x 10^12 l(sun) and a likely sfr of ~400 m(sun)/yr. the galaxy sits on thefar-ir/radio correlation for far-ir-selected galaxies. at ~&gt;70um, the sed canbe described adequately by dust components with t(d) ~ 30 and 60k. usingspire's fourier transform spectrometer we report a detection of the [cii] 158umcooling line. if the [cii], co and far-ir continuum arise in photo-dissociationregions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and a far-uvradiation field, g_0, 10^3x stronger than the milky way. l([cii])/l(bol) issignificantly higher than in local ulirgs but similar to the values found inlocal star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. this is consistent with smmj2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc,evidence that smgs are not simply scaled-up ulirgs. our results show thatspire's fts has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscuredgalaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not becompetitive with ground-based co-line searches. it will, however, allowdetailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as wellas the chemistry of their ism, once more suitably bright candidates have beenfound.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1007.3846	a first glimpse into the far-ir properties of high-z uv-selected  galaxies: herschel/pacs observations of z~3 lbgs	we present first insights into the far-ir properties for a sample of irac andmips-24um detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3, as derived fromobservations in the northern field of the great observatories origins survey(goods-n) carried out with the pacs instrument on board the herschel spaceobservatory. although none of our galaxies are detected by herschel, we employa stacking technique to construct, for the first time, the average spectralenergy distribution of infrared luminous lbgs from uv to radio wavelengths. wederive a median ir luminosity of l_{ir} = 1.6 x 10^12 lo, placing thepopulation in the class of ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs).complementing our study with existing multi-wavelength data, we put constraintson the dust temperature of the population and find that for their l_{ir},mips-lbgs are warmer than submm-luminous galaxies while they fall in the locusof the l_{ir}-t_{d} relation of the local ulirgs. this, along with estimatesbased on the average sed, explains the marginal detection of lbgs in currentsub-mm surveys and suggests that these latter studies introduce a bias towardsthe detection of colder ulirgs in the high-z universe, while missing high-zulirgs with warmer dust.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1103.0862	mesmer: meerkat search for molecules in the epoch of reionization	[abridged] observations of molecular gas at all redshifts are critical formeasuring the cosmic evolution in molecular gas density and understanding thestar-formation history of the universe. the 12co molecule (j=1-0 transition =115.27 ghz) is the best proxy for extragalactic h2, which is the gas reservoirfrom which star formation occurs, and has been detected out to z~6. typically,redshifted high-j lines are observed at mm-wavelengths, the most commonlytargeted systems exhibiting high sfrs (e.g. submm galaxies), and far-ir-brightqsos. while the most luminous objects are the most readily observed, detectionsof more typical galaxies with modest sfrs are essential for completing thepicture. alma will be revolutionary in terms of increasing the detection rateand pushing the sensitivity limit down to include such galaxies, however thelimited fov when observing at such high frequencies makes it difficult to usealma for studies of the large-scale structure traced out by molecular gas ingalaxies. this article introduces a strategy for a systematic search formolecular gas during the eor (z~7 and above), capitalizing on the fact that thej=1-0 transition of 12co enters the upper bands of cm-wave instruments athigh-z. the fov advantage gained by observing at such frequencies, coupled withmodern broadband correlators allows significant cosmological volumes to beprobed on reasonable timescales. in this article we present an overview of ourfuture observing programme which has been awarded 6,500 hours as one of thelarge survey projects for meerkat, the forthcoming south african ska pathfinderinstrument. its large fov and correlator bandwidth, and high-sensitivityprovide unprecedented survey speed for such work. an existing astrophysicalsimulation is coupled with instrumental considerations to demonstrate thefeasibility of such observations and predict detection rates.

1105.0646	hermes: lyman break galaxies individually detected at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 in  goods-n with herschel/spire	as part of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey we haveinvestigated the rest-frame far-infrared (fir) properties of a sample of morethan 4800 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the great observatories origins deepsurvey north field. most lbgs are not detected individually, but we do detect asub-sample of 12 objects at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and one object at z ~ 2.0.  the ones detected by herschel spire have redder observed nuv-u and u-r colorsthan the others, while the undetected ones have colors consistent with averagelbgs at z &gt; 2.5. the uv-to-fir spectral energy distributions of the objectsdetected in the rest-frame fir are investigated using the code cigale toestimate physical parameters. we find that lbgs detected by spire are highmass, luminous infrared galaxies.  it appears that lbgs are located in a triangle-shaped region in the a_fuv vs.log l_fuv diagram limited by a_fuv=0 at the bottom and by a diagonal followingthe temporal evolution of the most massive galaxies from the bottom-right tothe top-left of the diagram. this upper envelop can be used as upper limits forthe uv dust attenuation as a function of l_fuv}. the limits of this region arewell explained using a closed-box model, where the chemical evolution ofgalaxies produces metals, which in turn lead to higher dust attenuation whenthe galaxies age.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1108.0838	goods-herschel a population of 24micron dropout sources at z &lt; 2	using extremely deep pacs 100- and 160um herschel data from thegoods-herschel program, we identify 21 infrared bright galaxies previouslymissed in the deepest 24um surveys performed by mips. these mips dropouts arepredominantly found in two redshift bins, centred at z ~0.4 and ~1.3. theirs_100/s_24 flux density ratios are similar to those of local lirgs and ulirgs,whose silicate absorption features at 18um (at z ~ 0.4) and 9.7um (at z ~ 1.3)are shifted into the 24um mips band at these redshifts. the high-z sub-sampleconsists of 11 infrared luminous sources, accounting for ~2% of the wholegoods-herschel sample and putting strong upper limits on the fraction oflirgs/ulirgs at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7 that are missed by the 24um surveys. we find that as_100/s_24 &gt; 43 colour cut selects galaxies with a redshift distributionsimilar to that of the mips dropouts and when combined with a second colourcut, s_16/s_8 &gt; 4, isolates sources at 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.7. we show that thesesources have elevated specific star formation rates (ssfr) compared to mainsequence galaxies at these redshifts and are likely to be compact starburstswith moderate/strong 9.7um silicate absorption features in their mid-irspectra. herschel data reveal that their infrared luminosities extrapolatedfrom the 24um flux density are underestimated, on average, by a factor of ~3.these silicate break galaxies account for 16% (8%) of the ulirg (lirg)population in the goods fields, indicating a lower limit in their space densityof 2.0 \times 10^(-5) mpc^(-3). finally, we provide estimates of the fractionof z &lt; 2 mips dropout sources as a function of the 24-, 100-, 160-, 250- and350um sensitivity limits, and conclude that previous predictions of apopulation of silicate break galaxies missed by the major 24um extragalacticsurveys have been overestimated.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1211.6668	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: blank-field number counts of  450um-selected galaxies and their contribution to the cosmic infrared  background	the first deep blank-field 450um map (1-sigma~1.3mjy) from the scuba-2cosmology legacy survey (s2cls), conducted with the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt) is presented. our map covers 140 arcmin^2 of the cosmos field,in the footprint of the hst candels area. using 60 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) detected at &gt;3.75-sigma, we evaluate the number counts of 450um-selectedgalaxies with flux densities s_450&gt;5mjy. the 8-arcsec jcmt beam and highsensitivity of scuba-2 now make it possible to directly resolve a largerfraction of the cosmic infrared background (cib, peaking at ~200um) into theindividual galaxies responsible for its emission than has previously beenpossible at this wavelength. at s_450&gt;5mjy we resolve (7.4[+/-]0.7)x10^-2mjy/sr of the cib at 450um (equivalent to 16[+/-]7% of the absolute brightnessmeasured by cobe at this wavelength) into point sources. a further ~40% of thecib can be recovered through a statistical stack of 24um emitters in thisfield, indicating that the majority (~60%) of the cib at 450um is emitted bygalaxies with s_450&gt;2mjy. the average redshift of 450um emitters identifiedwith an optical/near-infrared counterpart is estimated to be &lt;z&gt;=1.3, implyingthat the galaxies in the sample are in the ultraluminous class (l_ir~1.1x10^12l_sun). if the galaxies contributing to the statistical stack lie at similarredshifts, then the majority of the cib at 450um is emitted by galaxies in thelirg class with l_ir&gt;3.6x10^11 l_sun.

1212.1234	multi-wavelength study of a complete irac 3.6micron-selected galaxy  sample: a fair census of red and blue populations at redshifts 0.4-1	we present a multi-wavelength study of a 3.6 $\mu$m-selected galaxy sample inthe extended groth strip. the sample is complete for galaxies with stellar mass$&gt;10^{9.5}$ \msun and redshift $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2$. in this redshift range, the irac3.6 $\mu$m band measures the rest-frame near-infrared band, permitting nearlyunbiased selection with respect to both quiescent and star-forming galaxies.the numerous spectroscopic redshifts available in the egs are used to train anartificial neural network to estimate photometric redshifts. the distributionof photometric redshift errors is gaussian with standard deviation${\sim}0.025(1+z)$, and the fraction of redshift failures (${&gt;}3\sigma$ errors)is about 3.5%. a new method of validation based on pair statistics confirms theestimate of standard deviation even for galaxies lacking spectroscopicredshifts. basic galaxy properties measured include rest-frame $u-b$ colors,$b$- and $k$-band absolute magnitudes, and stellar masses. we divide the sampleinto quiescent and star-forming galaxies according to their rest-frame $u-b$colors and 24 to 3.6 \micron\ flux density ratios and derive rest $k$-bandluminosity functions and stellar mass functions for quiescent, star forming,and all galaxies. the results show that massive, quiescent galaxies were inplace by $z\approx1$, but lower mass galaxies generally ceased their starformation at later epochs.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

0712.3121	the host galaxies and black holes of typical z~0.5-1.4 agn	we study the stellar and star formation (sf) properties of the host galaxiesof 58 x-ray selected agn in the goods portion of the chandra deep field south(cdf-s) region at z~0.5-1.4. the agn are selected such that their rest-frame uvto near-ir seds are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the agn emission 'contamination'. this agnpopulation comprises approximately 50% of the x-ray selected agn at theseredshifts. using models of stellar and dust emission we model their seds toderive stellar masses (m*) and total (uv+ir) star formation rates (sfr). agnreside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. theircharacteristic stellar masses (m*~7.8x10^10 msun and m*~1.2x10^11 msun atmedian z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of thex-ray selected agn population at these redshifts, and are intermediate betweenthose of local type 2 agn and high redshift (z~2) agn. the inferred black holemasses (mbh~ 2x10^8 msun) of typical agn are similar to those of opticallyidentified quasars at similar redshifts. since the agn in our sample are muchless luminous (l(2-10kev)&lt;10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical agn have loweddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). this suggests that, at least at intermediatez, the cosmic agn 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristicstellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. finallythere is no strong evidence in agn host galaxies for either highly suppressedsf (expected if agn played a role in quenching sf) or elevated sf when comparedto mass selected (i.e., irac-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses andredshifts. this may be explained by the fact that galaxies with m*~5x 10^10 -5x10^11 msun are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here.

1304.4593	far-ir emission from dust-obscured galaxies	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are a uv-faint, ir-bright galaxy populationthat reside at z~2 and are believed to be in a phase of dusty star-forming andagn activity. we present far-ir observations of a complete sample of dogs inthe 2 deg2 of cosmos. the 3077 dogs have &lt;z&gt;=1.9+/-0.3 and are selected from24um and r+ observations using a color cut of r+ - [24]&gt;=7.5 (ab mag) ands24&gt;=100ujy. based on the near-ir seds, 47% are star-formation dominated and10% are agn-dominated. we use spire far-ir photometry from hermes to calculatethe ir luminosity and characteristic dust temperature for the 1572 (51%) dogsthat are detected at 250um (&gt;=3{\sigma}). for the remaining 1505 (49%) that areundetected, we perform a median stacking analysis to probe fainterluminosities. detected and undetected dogs have average ir luminosities of(2.8+/-0.4) x 1012 lsun and (0.77+-0.08)x10^12lsun, and dust temperatures of34+/-7 k and 37+/-3 k, respectively. the ir luminosity function of dogs withs24&gt;=100ujy is calculated, using far-ir observations and stacking. dogscontribute 10-30% to the total star formation rate density of the universe atz=1.5-2.5, dominated by 250um detected and bump dogs. for comparison, dogscontribute 30% to the star-formation rate density of the universe for allgalaxies at z=1.5-2.5 with s24&gt;=100ujy. dogs have a large scatter about thestar-formation main sequence and their specific star-formation rates show thatthe observed phase of star-formation could be responsible for their observedstellar mass at z~2.

0801.0454	the properties of 70micron selected high-redshift galaxies in the  extended groth strip	we examine the infrared properties of 43 high redshift (0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2),infrared-luminous galaxies in the extended groth strip (egs), selected by adeep 70 micron survey with the multiband imaging photometer on spitzer (mips).in addition and with reference to starburst-type spectral energy distributions(seds), we derive a set of equations for estimating the total infraredluminosity (l_ir) in the range 8-1000 microns using photometry from at leastone mips band. 42 out of 43 of our sources' optical/infrared seds(lambda_observed &lt; 160 microns) are starburst-type, with only one objectdisplaying a prominent power-law near-infrared continuum. for a quantitativeanalysis, models of radiation transfer in dusty media are fit onto the infraredphotometry, revealing that the majority of galaxies are represented by highextinction, a_v&gt;35 and for a large fraction (~50 per cent) the sed turns overinto the rayleigh-jeans regime at wavelengths longward of 90 microns. forcomparison, we also fit semi-empirical templates based on local galaxy data,however, these underestimate the far-infrared sed shape by a factor of at least2 and in extreme cases up to 10 for the majority (~70 per cent) of the sources.further investigation of sed characteristics reveals that the mid-infrared(70/24 microns) continuum slope is decoupled from various galaxy propertiessuch as the total infrared luminosity and far-infrared peak, quantified by thel_160/l_70 ratio. in view of these results, we propose that these high-redshiftgalaxies have different properties to their local counterparts, in the sensethat large amounts of dust cause heavy obscuration and are responsible for anadditional cold emissive component, appearing as a far-infrared excess in theirseds.

1306.5485	herschel-spire-fourier transform spectroscopy of the nearby spiral  galaxy ic342	we present observations of the nearby spiral galaxy ic342 with the herschelspectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire) fourier transformspectrometer. the spectral range afforded by spire, 196-671 microns, allows usto access a number of 12co lines from j=4--3 to j=13--12 with the highest jtransitions observed for the first time. in addition we present measurements of13co, [ci] and [nii]. we use a radiative transfer code coupled with bayesianlikelihood analysis to model and constrain the temperature, density and columndensity of the gas. we find two 12co components, one at 35 k and one at 400 kwith co column densities of 6.3x10^{17} cm^{-2} and 0.4x10^{17} cm^{-2} and cogas masses of 1.26x10^{7} msolar and 0.15x10^{7} msolar, for the cold and warmcomponents, respectively. the inclusion of the high-j 12co line observations,indicate the existence of a much warmer gas component (~400 k) confirmingearlier findings from h_{2} rotational line analysis from iso and spitzer. themass of the warm gas is 10% of the cold gas, but it likely dominates the columinosity. in addition, we detect strong emission from [nii] 205microns andthe {3}p_{1}-&gt;{3}p_{0} and {3}p_{2} -&gt;{3}p_{1} [ci] lines at 370 and 608microns, respectively. the measured 12co line ratios can be explained byphoton-dominated region (pdr) models although additional heating by e.g. cosmicrays cannot be excluded. the measured [ci] line ratio together with the derived[c] column density of 2.1x10^{17} cm^{-2} and the fact that [ci] is weaker thanco emission in ic342 suggests that [ci] likely arises in a thin layer on theoutside of the co emitting molecular clouds consistent with pdrs playing animportant role.

1307.6224	diagnostics of agn-driven molecular outflows in ulirgs from  herschel-pacs observations of oh at 119um	we report on our observations of the 79 and 119um doublet transitions of ohfor 24 local (z&lt;0.262) ulirgs observed with herschel-pacs as part of theherschel ulirg survey (herus). some oh119 profiles display a clear p-cygnishape and therefore imply outflowing oh gas, other profiles are predominantlyin absorption or are completely in emission. we find that the relative strengthof the oh emission component decreases as the silicate absorption increases.this locates the oh outflows inside the obscured nuclei. the maximum outflowvelocities for our sources range from less than 100 to 2000 km/s, with 15/24(10/24) sources showing oh absorption at velocities exceeding 700 km/s (1000km/s). three sources show maximum oh outflow velocities exceeding that ofmrk231. since outflow velocities above 500-700 km/s are thought to require anactive galactic nucleus (agn) to drive them, about 2/3 of our ulirg sample mayhost agn-driven molecular outflows. this finding is supported by thecorrelation we find between the maximum oh outflow velocity and the ir-derivedbolometric agn luminosity. no such correlation is found with the ir-derivedstar formation rate. the highest outflow velocities are found among sourceswhich are still deeply embedded. we speculate that the molecular outflows inthese sources may be in an early phase of disrupting the nuclear dust veilbefore these sources evolve into less obscured agn. four of our sources showhigh-velocity wings in their [c ii] fine-structure line profiles implyingneutral gas outflow masses of at least 2-4.5 x 10^8 msun.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1401.6079	hermes: spectral energy distributions of submillimeter galaxies at z &gt;4	we present a study of the infrared properties for a sample of sevenspectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies at $z&gt;$4.0. by combiningground-based near-infrared, spitzer irac and mips, herschel spire, andground-based submillimeter/millimeter photometry, we construct their spectralenergy distributions (sed) and a composite model to fit the seds. the modelincludes a stellar emission component at $\lambda_{\rm rest} &lt;$ 3.5$ \mu$m; ahot dust component peaking at $\lambda_{rest} \sim$ 5$\,\mu$m; and cold dustcomponent which becomes significant for $\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt;$ 50$\,\mu$m. sixobjects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350$ \mu$m. the dust temperaturesfor the sources in this sample are in the range of 40$-$80 k, and their $l_{\rmfir}$ $\sim$ 10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$ qualifies them as hyper$-$luminous infraredgalaxies (hyperlirgs). the mean fir-radio index for this sample is around $&lt; q&gt; = 2.2$ indicating no radio excess in their radio emission. most sources inthe sample have 24$ \mu$m detections corresponding to a rest-frame 4.5$ \mu$mluminosity of log$_{10}$(l$_{4.5}$ / l$_{\odot}$) = 11 $\sim$ 11.5. theirl$_{\rm 4.5}$/$l_{\rm fir}$ ratios are very similar to those of starburstdominated submillimeter galaxies at $z \sim$ 2. the $l_{\rm co}-l_{\rm fir}$relation for this sample is consistent with that determined for local ulirgsand smgs at $z \sim$ 2. we conclude that submillimeter galaxies at $z &gt;$ 4 arehotter and more luminous in the fir, but otherwise very similar to those at $z\sim$ 2. none of these sources show any sign of the strong qso phase beingtriggered.

1407.6712	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: the submillimetre properties of  lyman break galaxies at z=3-5	we present statistically significant detections at 850um of the lyman breakgalaxy (lbg) population at z=3, 4, and 5 using data from the submillimetrecommon user bolometer array 2 (scuba-2) cosmology legacy survey (s2cls) in theunited kingdom infrared deep sky survey ultra deep survey (ukidss-uds) field.we employ a stacking technique to probe beneath the survey limit to measure theaverage 850um flux density of lbgs at z=3, 4, and 5 with typical ultravioletluminosities of l(1700a)~10^29 erg/s/hz. we measure 850um flux densities of(0.25 +/- 0.03, (0.41 +/- 0.06), and (0.88 +/- 0.23) mjy respectively, and findthat they contribute at most 20 per cent to the cosmic far-infrared backgroundat 850um. fitting an appropriate range of spectral energy distributions to thez=3, 4, and 5 lbg stacked 24-850um fluxes, we derive infrared (ir) luminositiesof l(8-1000um)~3.2, 5.5, and 11.0x10^11 lsun (corresponding to star formationrates of ~50-200 msun/yr) respectively. we find that the evolution in the irluminosity density of lbgs is broadly consistent with model predictions for theexpected contribution of luminous ir galaxy (lirg) to ultraluminous ir galaxy(ulirg) type systems at these epochs. we also see a strong positive correlationbetween stellar mass and ir luminosity. our data are consistent with the mainsequence of star formation showing little or no evolution from z=3 to 5. wehave also confirmed that, for a fixed mass, the reddest lbgs (uv slope beta -&gt;0) are indeed redder due to dust extinction, with sfr(ir)/sfr(uv) increasing byapproximately an order of magnitude over -2&lt;beta&lt;0 such that sfr(ir)/sfr(uv)~20for the reddest lbgs. furthermore, the most massive lbgs also tend to havehigher obscured-to-unobscured ratio, hinting at a variation in the obscurationproperties across the mass range.

1409.5605	a far-infrared spectroscopic survey of intermediate redshift (ultra)  luminous infrared galaxies	we present herschel far-ir photometry and spectroscopy as well as groundbased co observations of an intermediate redshift (0.21 &lt; z &lt; 0.88) sample ofherschel-selected (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies (l_ir &gt; 10^11.5l_sun).with these measurements we trace the dust continuum, far-ir atomic lineemission, in particular [cii]\,157.7microns, as well as the molecular gas ofz~0.3 (u)lirgs and perform a detailed investigation of the interstellar mediumof the population. we find that the majority of herschel-selected intermediateredshift (u)lirgs have l_cii/l_fir ratios that are a factor of about 10 higherthan that of local ulirgs and comparable to that of local normal and high-$z$star forming galaxies. using our sample to bridge local and high-z [cii]observations, we find that the majority of galaxies at all redshifts and allluminosities follow a l_cii-l_fir relation with a slope of unity, from whichlocal ulirgs and high-z agn dominated sources are clear outliers. we alsoconfirm that the strong anti-correlation between the l_cii/l_fir ratio and thefar-ir color l_60/l_100 observed in the local universe holds over a broad rangeof redshifts and luminosities, in the sense that warmer sources exhibit lowerl_cii/l_fir at any epoch. intermediate redshift ulirgs are also characterisedby large molecular gas reservoirs and by lower star formation efficienciescompared to that of local ulirgs. the high l_cii/l_fir ratios, the moderatestar formation efficiencies (l_lir/l_co or l_ir/m_gas) and the relatively lowdust temperatures of our sample (which are also common characteristics ofhigh-z star forming galaxies with ulirg-like luminosities) indicate that theevolution of the physical properties of (u)lirgs between the present day and z&gt; 1 is already significant by z ~ 0.3.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0201510	observations of the hubble deep field south with the infrared space  observatory - ii. associations and star formation rates	we present results from a deep mid-ir survey of the hubble deep field south(hdf-s) region performed at 7 and 15um with the cam instrument on board iso. wefound reliable optical/near-ir associations for 32 of the 35 sources detectedin this field by oliver et al. (2002, paper i): eight of them were identifiedas stars, one is definitely an agn, a second seems likely to be an agn, too,while the remaining 22 appear to be normal spiral or starburst galaxies. usingmodel spectral energy distributions (seds) of similar galaxies, we comparemethods for estimating the star formation rates (sfrs) in these objects,finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) ir luminosityreproduces the model sfrs best. applying this estimator to model fits to theseds of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are formingstars at rates of ~1-100 m_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40m_sol/yr, assumingan einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of 50 km/s/mpc, andstar formation taking place according to a salpeter (1955) imf across the massrange 0.1-100m_sol. we split the redshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.6 into two equal-volumebins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed bythese sources, assuming the same cosmology and imf as above and computingerrors based on estimated uncertainties in the sfrs of individual galaxies. wecompare these results with other estimates of the sfr density made with thesame assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of flores etal. (1999) from their iso survey of the cfrs 1415+52 field. however, therelatively small volume of our survey means that our sfr density estimatessuffer from a large sampling variance, implying that our results, bythemselves, do not place tight constraints on the global mean sfr density.

astro-ph;0206135	an iso--sws survey of molecular hydrogen in starburst and seyfert  galaxies	we present results from a survey of molecular hydrogen emission from a sampleof starburst and seyfert galaxies carried out with the infrared spaceobservatory (iso). pure rotational h_2 emission has been detected in a numberof extragalactic objects and a variety of environments. a number of transitionsfrom s(7) to s(0) are detected in both starbursts and seyferts. usingexcitation diagrams we derive temperatures and masses of the ``warm'' molecularhydrogen. we find that the temperature of the ``warm'' gas is similar instarbursts and seyferts (those seyferts for which we have firm detections ofthe s(0) line) with a value of around t~150 k. this ``warm'' gas accounts foras much as 10% of the total galactic mass (as probed by co molecularobservations) in starbursts. the fraction of ``warm'' gas is overall higher inseyferts, ranging between 2--35%. we then investigate the origin of the warmh_2 emission. comparison with published theoretical models and galactictemplates implies that although emission from photodissociation regions (pdr)alone could explain the emission from starbursts and seyferts, most likely acombination of pdr, shock emission and gas heated by x-rays (mostly for theseyferts) is responsible for h_2 excitation in extragalactic environments.finally, we find that although pah and h_2 line emission correlate well instarbursts and the large scale emission in agn, h_2 emission is much strongercompared to pah emission in cases where a ``pure'' agn dominates the energyoutput.

astro-ph;0207405	ultr-luminous infrared galaxies: qsos in formation?	we present new near-infrared keck and vlt spectroscopic data on the stellardynamics in late stage, ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) mergers . we nowhave information on the structural and kinematic properties of 18 ulirgs, 8 ofwhich contain qso-like active galactic nuclei. the host properties (velocitydispersion, effective radius, effective surface brightness, m_k) ofagn-dominated and star formation dominated ulirgs are similar. ulirgs fallremarkably close to the fundamental plane of early type galaxies. they populatea wide range of the plane, are on average similar to l*-rotating ellipticals,but are well offset from giant ellipticals and optically/uv bright, low-zqsos/radio galaxies. ulirgs and local qsos/radio galaxies are very similar intheir distributions of bolometric and extinction corrected near-irluminosities, but ulirgs have smaller effective radii and velocity dispersionsthan the local qso/radio galaxy population. hence, their host masses andinferred black hole masses are correspondingly smaller. the latter are moreakin to those of local seyfert galaxies. ulirgs thus resemble local qsos intheir near-ir and bolometric luminosities because they are (much more)efficiently forming stars and/or feeding their black holes, and not becausethey have qso-like, very massive black holes. we conclude that ulirgs as aclass cannot evolve into optically bright qsos. they will more likely becomequiescent, moderate mass field ellipticals or, when active, might resemble thex-ray bright, early type galaxies that have recently been found by the chandraobservatory.

astro-ph;0405612	extremely red objects in the lockman hole	we investigate extremely red objects (eros) using near- and mid-infraredobservations in five passbands (3.6 to 24 micron) obtained from the spitzerspace telescope, and deep ground-based r and k imaging. the great sensitivityof the irac camera allows us to detect 64 eros in only 12 minutes of iracexposure time, by means of an r-[3.6] color cut (analogous to the traditionalred r-k cut). a pure infrared k-[3.6] red cut detects a somewhat differentpopulation and may be more effective at selecting z &gt; 1.3 eros. we find 17% ofall galaxies detected by irac at 3.6 or 4.5 micron to be eros. thesepercentages rise to about 40% at 5.8 micron, and about 60% at 8.0 micron. weutilize the spectral bump at 1.6 micron to divide the eros into broad redshiftslices using only near-infrared colors (2.2/3.6/4.5 micron). we conclude thattwo-thirds of all eros lie at redshift z &gt; 1.3. detections at 24 micron implythat at least 11% of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 eros and at least 22% of z &gt; 1.3 eros aredusty star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0406158	spitzer observations of mambo galaxies: weeding out active nuclei in  starbursting proto-ellipticals	we present spitzer observations in five wavebands between 3.6 and 24um of anunbiased sample of 9 luminous, dusty galaxies selected at 1200um by the mambocamera on the iram 30-m telescope, a population akin to the well-known submm or`scuba' galaxies (hereafter smgs). owing to the coarse resolution of submm/mminstrumentation, smgs have traditionally been difficult to identify at otherwavelengths. we compare our multi-wavelength catalogs to show that the overlapbetween 24 and 1200um must be close to complete at these flux levels. we findthat all (4/4) of the most secure &gt;=4sigma smgs have robust &gt;=4sigmacounterparts at 1.4ghz, while the fraction drops to 7/9 using all &gt;=3sigmasmgs. we show that combining mid-ir and marginal (&gt;=3sigma) radio detectionsprovides plausible identifications in the remaining cases, enabling us toidentify the complete sample. accretion onto an obscured central engine isbetrayed by the shape of the mid-ir continuum emission for several sources,confirming spitzer's potential to weed out active galaxies. we demonstrate thepower of a s(24um)/s(8um) vs s(8um)/s(4.5um) color-color plot as a diagnosticfor this purpose. however, we conclude that the majority (~75%) of smgs haverest-frame mid-/far-ir seds commensurate with obscured starbursts. sensitive24-um observations are clearly a useful route to identify and characterizereliable counterparts to high-redshift far-ir-bright galaxies, complementingwhat is possible via deep radio imaging.

astro-ph;0410632	sub-mm detection of a high redshift type 2 qso	we report on the first scuba detection of a type 2 qso at z=3.660 in thechandra deep field south. this source is x-ray absorbed, shows only narrowemission lines in the optical spectrum and is detected in the sub-mm: it is theideal candidate in an evolution scheme for agn (e.g. fabian (1999); page et al.(2004)) of an early phase corresponding to the main growth of the host galaxyand formation of the central black hole. the overall photometry (from the radioto the x-ray energy band) of this source is well reproduced by the spectralenergy distribution (sed) of ngc 6240, while it is incompatible with thespectrum of a type 1 qso (3c273) or a starburst galaxy (arp 220). its sub-mm(850 \mu m) to x-ray (2 kev) spectral slope (alpha_sx) is close to thepredicted value for a compton-thick agn in which only 1% of the nuclearemission emerges through scattering. using the observed flux at 850 \mu m wehave derived a sfr=550--680 m$_odot/yr and an estimate of the dust mass,m$_dust=4.2 10^8 m_odot

astro-ph;0412706	nir spectroscopy of luminous infrared galaxies and the hydrogen  recombination photon deficit	we report on near-infrared medium-resolution spectroscopy of a sample ofluminous and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs-ulirgs), carried out withsofi at the eso 3.5m new technology telescope. because of wavelength dependenceof the attenuation, the detection of the pa_alfa or br_gamma line in the ksband should provide relevant constraints on sfr and the contribution of an agn.we find, however, that the intensities of the pa_alfa and br_gamma lines, evencorrected for slit losses, are on average only 10% and 40%, respectively, ofthat expected from a normal starburst of similar bolometric luminosity. thecorresponding star formation rates, after correcting for the attenuationderived from the nir-optical emission line ratios, are 14% and 60% of thatexpected if the far infrared luminosity were entirely powered by the starburst.this confirms the existence of a recombination photon deficit, particularly inthe case of the pa_alfa line, already found in the br_gamma line in otherinfrared galaxies of similar luminosity. in discussing the possible causes ofthe discrepancy, we find unlikely that it is due to the presence of an agn,though two objects show evidence of broadening of the pa_alfa line and of thepresence of coronal line emission. in fact, from our own observations and datacollected from the literature we argue that the studied galaxies appear to bepredominantly powered by a nuclear starburst. two scenarios compatible with thepresent data are that either there exists a highly attenuated nuclear starforming region, and/or that a significant fraction of the ionizing photons areabsorbed by dust within the hii regions. we suggest that observations in thebr_alpha spectral region could constitute a powerful tool to disentangle thesetwo possibilities.

astro-ph;0511507	infrared power-law galaxies in the chandra deep field south: agn and  ulirgs	we investigate the nature of a sample of 92 spitzer/mips 24 micron selectedgalaxies in the cdfs, showing power law-like emission in the spitzer/irac 3.6-8micron bands. the main goal is to determine whether the galaxies not detectedin x-rays (47% of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population ofobscured agn not detected even in deep x-ray surveys. the majority of the irpower-law galaxies are ulirgs at z&gt;1, and those with lirg-like ir luminositiesare usually detected in x-rays. the optical to ir spectral energy distributions(seds) of the x-ray detected galaxies are almost equally divided between ablagn sed class (similar to an optically selected qso) and a nlagn sed (similarto the blagn sed but with an obscured uv/optical continuum). a small fractionof seds resemble warm ulirg galaxies (e.g., mrk231). most galaxies not detectedin x-rays have seds in the nlagn+ulirg class as they tend to be opticallyfainter, and possibly more obscured. moreover, the ir power-law galaxies haveseds significantly different from those of high-z (z_sp&gt;1) ir (24 micron)selected and optically bright (vvds i_ab&lt;=24) star-forming galaxies whose sedsshow a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron. the galaxies detected inx-rays have 2-8 kev rest-frame luminosities typical of agn. the galaxies notdetected in x-rays have global x-ray to mid-ir sed properties that make themgood candidates to contain ir bright x-ray absorbed agn. if all these sourcesare actually obscured agn, we would observe a ratio of obscured to unobscured24 micron detected agn of 2:1, whereas models predict a ratio of up to 3:1.additional studies using spitzer to detect x-ray-quiet agn are likely to findmore such obscured sources.

astro-ph;9711255	what powers ultra-luminous iras galaxies?	we present an iso sws and isophot-s, mid-infrared spectroscopic survey of 15ultra-luminous iras galaxies. we combine the survey results with a detailedcase study, based on near-ir and mm imaging spectroscopy, of one of the samplegalaxies (ugc 5101). we compare the near- and mid-ir characteristics of theseultra-luminous galaxies to iso and literature data of thirty starburst andactive galactic nuclei (agn), template galaxies. we find that  1) 70-80% of the ultra-luminous iras galaxies in our sample are predominantlypowered by recently formed massive stars. 20-30% are powered by a central agn.these conclusions are based on a new infrared 'diagnostic diagram' involvingthe ratio of high to low excitation mid-ir emission lines on the one hand, andon the strength of the 7.7um pah feature on the other hand.  2) at least half of the sources probably have simultaneously an activenucleus and starburst activity in a 1-2 kpc diameter circum-nuclear disk/ring.  3) the mid-infrared emitting regions are highly obscured. after correctionfor these extinctions, we estimate that the star forming regions in ulirgs haveages between 10^7 and 10^8 years, similar to but somewhat larger than thosefound in lower luminosity starburst galaxies.  4) in the sample we have studied there is no obvious trend for the agncomponent to dominate in the most compact, and thus most advanced mergers.instead, at any given time during the merger evolution, the time dependentcompression of the circum-nuclear interstellar gas, the accretion rate onto thecentral black hole and the associated radiation efficiency may determinewhether star formation or agn activity dominates the luminosity of the system.
