0901.2096	physical conditions in the ionized gas of 30 doradus	we present a mid-infrared spectroscopic data cube of the central part of 30doradus, observed with spitzer's irs and mips/sed mode. aromatic dust emissionfeatures and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected butnot particularly strong. the dominant spectral features are emission lines frommoderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used todetermine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. the ionized gasexcitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which canplausibly be associated with individual hot stars. we fit the ionic linestrengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionizationdominates in the region. the ionization parameter u traces the rim of thecentral bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and atleast one quiescent clump. the hardness of the ionizing radiation field t_radreveals several "hot spots" that are either the result of individual very hotstars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through thesurrounding neutral cloud. consistent with other measurements of giantmolecular hydrogen regions, log(u) ranges between -3 and -0.75, and t_radbetween 30000 and 85000k.

0901.4351	a multi-wavelength infrared study of ngc 891	we present a multi-wavlength infrared study of the nearby, edge-on, spiralgalaxy ngc 891. we have examined 20 independent, spatially resolved ir imagesof this galaxy, 14 of which are newly reduced and/or previously unpublishedimages. these images span a wavelength regime from 1.2 microns in which theemission is dominated by cool stars, through the mir, in which emission isdominated by pahs, to 850 microns, in which emission is dominated by cold dustin thermal equilibrium with the radiation field. the changing morphology of thegalaxy with wavelength illustrates the changing dominant components. we detectextra-planar dust emission in this galaxy, consistent with previously publishedresults, but now show that pah emission is also in the halo, to a verticaldistance of z &gt;= 2.5 kpc. we compare the vertical extents of various componentsand find that the pahs (from 7.7 and 8 micron data) and warm dust (24 microns)extend to smaller z heights than the cool dust (450 microns). for six locationsin the galaxy for which the s/n was sufficient, we present seds of the iremission, including two in the halo - the first time a halo sed in an externalgalaxy has been presented. we have modeled these seds and find that the pahfraction is similar to galactic values (within a factor of two), with thelowest value at the galaxy's center, consistent with independent results ofother galaxies. in the halo environment, the fraction of dust exposed to acolder radiation field, is of order unity, consistent with an environment inwhich there is no star formation. the source of excitation is likely fromphotons escaping from the disk.

0911.0532	ice chemistry in embedded young stellar objects in the large magellanic  cloud	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 15 embedded youngstellar objects (ysos) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these observationswere obtained with the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) as part of thesage-spec legacy program. we analyze the two prominent ice bands in the irsspectral range: the bending mode of co_2 ice at 15.2 micron and the ice bandbetween 5 and 7 micron that includes contributions from the bending mode ofwater ice at 6 micron amongst other ice species. the 5-7 micron band isdifficult to identify in our lmc sample due to the conspicuous presence of pahemission superimposed onto the ice spectra. we identify water ice in thespectra of two sources; the spectrum of one of those sources also exhibits the6.8 micron ice feature attributed to ammonium and methanol. we model the co_2band in detail, using the combination of laboratory ice profiles available inthe literature. we find that a significant fraction (&gt; 50%) of co_2 ice islocked in a water-rich component, consistent with what is observed for galacticsources. the majority of the sources in the lmc also require a pure-co_2contribution to the ice profile, evidence of thermal processing. there is asuggestion that co_2 production might be enhanced in the lmc, but the size ofthe available sample precludes firmer conclusions. we place our results in thecontext of the star formation environment in the lmc.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1565	the physical properties of the dust in the rcw 120 hii region as seen by  herschel	context. rcw 120 is a well-studied, nearby galactic hii region with ongoingstar formation in its surroundings. previous work has shown that it displays abubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer ofcollected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. given the well-definedphoto-dissociation region (pdr) boundary and collected layer, it is anexcellent laboratory to study the "collect and collapse" process of triggeredstar formation. using herschel space observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 micron, in combination with spitzer and apex-laboca data, we can forthe first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an hii region athigh angular resolution. aims. we seek a better understanding of rcw120 and itslocal environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. additionally,we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to thedust temperature. methods. we determine dust temperatures in selected regionsof the rcw 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (sed),derived using aperture photometry. additionally, we fit the sed extracted froma grid of positions to create a temperature map. results. we find a gradient indust temperature, ranging from &gt;30 k in the interior of rcw 120, to ~20k forthe material collected in the pdr, to ~10k toward local infrared dark cloudsand cold filaments. our results suggest that rcw 120 is in the process ofdestroying the pdr delineating its bubble morphology. the leaked radiation fromits interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. wefind support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,in rough agreement with what has been found previously. the extended wavelengthcoverage of the herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1010.3134	statistical study of dust properties in lmc molecular clouds	the objective of this paper is to construct a catalog providing the dustproperties and the star formation efficiency (sfe) of the molecular clouds inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc). we use the infrared (ir) data obtained withthe spitzer telescope as part of the ``surveying the agents of a galaxy'sevolution'' (sage) legacy survey as well as the iras data. we also work withextinction (av) maps of the lmc. a total of 272 molecular clouds have beendetected in the lmc in a previous molecular survey, accounting for 230 giantmolecular clouds and 42 smaller clouds. we perform correlations between the iremission/extinction, and atomic and molecular gas tracers. we compare theatomic gas that surrounds the molecular cloud with the molecular gas in thecloud. using a dust emission model, we derive the physical properties of dustin and outside the clouds: equilibrium temperature, emissivity and extinction.we also determine the luminosity of the interstellar radiation fieldintercepted by the cloud, and the total ir luminosity. statistically, we do notfind any significant difference in the dust properties between the atomic andthe molecular phases. in particular we do not find evidence for a systematicdecrease of the dust temperature in the molecular phase, with respect to thesurrounding, presumably atomic gas. this is probably because giant molecularclouds are the sites of star formation, which heat the dust, while the smallestclouds are unresolved. the ratio between the ir luminosity and the cloud mass(ldust/mgas) does not seem to correlate with mgas. the highest value of theratio we derived is 18.1 lsol/msol in the 30 doradus region, which is known tobe the most prominent star formation region of the lmc, while the most likelyvalue is 0.5 and is representative of quiescent clouds. we provide aprescription to associate the various stages of star formation with itsldust/mgas.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1012.1728	influence of the environment on pah emission in star-forming regions	we investigate the emission properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(pahs) in various metallicity environments with the infrared spectrograph onboard spitzer. local giant hii regions are used as references as they enableaccess to the distinct interstellar medium components that contribute to themid-infrared spectrum of star-forming galaxies: photodissociation regions(pdrs), photoionized gas, stellar clusters, and embedded regions. three objectsare considered, ngc3603 in the milky way, 30doradus in the large magellaniccloud, and n66 in the small magellanic cloud. from the variations of thepah/14um ratio, we find that pahs are destroyed in the ionized gas for aradiation field such that [neiii]/[neii]&gt;3. from the variations of thepah/hu-alpha ratio, we find that the pah emission sources in the giant hiiregions follow the same photodestruction law regardless of metallicity. we thencompare these results with observations of starburst galaxies, hii galaxies,and blue compact dwarf galaxies (bcds). while the integrated mid-infraredspectra of bcds are reminiscent of a warm dusty ionized gas, we observe asignificant contribution to the pah emission in starburst galaxies that is notarising from pdrs.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1201.2178	the dust &amp; gas properties of m83	we examine the dust and gas properties of the nearby, barred galaxy m83,which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey. using images from the pacs andspire instruments of herschel, we examine the dust temperature and dust masssurface density distribution. we find that the nuclear, bar and spiral armregions exhibit higher dust temperatures and masses compared to interarmregions. however, the distribution of dust temperature and mass are notspatially coincident. assuming a trailing spiral structure, the dusttemperature peaks in the spiral arms lie ahead of the dust surface densitypeaks. the dust mass surface density correlates well with the distribution ofmolecular gas as traced by co (j=3-2) images (jcmt) and the star formation rateas traced by h?2 with a correction for obscured star formation using 24 micronemission. using hi images from things to trace the atomic gas component, wemake total gas mass surface density maps and calculate the gas-to-dust ratio.we find a mean gas-to-dust ratio of 84 \pm 4 with higher values in the innerregion assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion factor. we also examine thegas-to-dust ratio using co-to-h2 conversion factor that varies withmetallicity.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1304.3128	star formation &amp; dust heating in the fir bright sources of m83	we investigate star formation and dust heating in the compact fir brightsources detected in the herschel maps of m83. we use the source extraction codegetsources to detect and extract sources in the fir, as well as theirphotometry in the mir and h{\alpha}. by performing infrared sed fitting andapplying an h{\alpha} based star formation rate (sfr) calibration, we derivethe dust masses and temperatures, sfrs, gas masses and star formationefficiencies (sfes). the detected sources lie exclusively on the spiral armsand represent giant molecular associations (gmas), with gas masses and sizes of10^6-10^8 solar masses and 200-300 pc, respectively. the inferred parametersshow little to no radial dependence and there is only a weak correlationbetween the sfrs and gas masses, which suggests that more massive clouds areless efficient at forming stars. dust heating is mainly due to local starformation. however, although the sources are not optically thick, the totalintrinsic young stellar population luminosity can almost completely account forthe dust luminosity. this suggests that other radiation sources contribute tothe dust heating as well and approximately compensate for the unabsorbedfraction of uv light.

1309.6338	cold dust but warm gas in the unusual elliptical galaxy ngc 4125	data from the herschel space observatory have revealed an unusual ellipticalgalaxy, ngc 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission fromcold dust but only very strict upper limits to its co and hi emission.depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 msun. whilethe neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (&lt; 12-30), including theionized gas traced by [cii] emission raises this limit to &lt; 39-100. the dustemission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust tostellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearbyelliptical galaxies. we suggest that ngc 4125 is currently in an unusual phasewhere evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation arepumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. in thisscenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas beingheated to temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k faster than the dust is evaporated. ifgalaxies like ngc 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutralgas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could havesignificant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies andgalaxy evolution.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1311.1774	the herschel virgo cluster survey xvi: a cluster inventory	herschel fir observations are used to construct virgo cluster galaxyluminosity functions and to show that the cluster lacks the very bright and thenumerous faint sources detected in field galaxy surveys. the far-infrared sedsare fitted to obtain dust masses and temperatures and the dust mass function.the cluster is over dense in dust by about a factor of 100 compared to thefield. the same emissivity (beta) temperature relation applies for differentgalaxies as that found for different regions of m31. we use optical and hi datato show that virgo is over dense in stars and atomic gas by about a factor of100 and 20 respectively. metallicity values are used to measure the mass ofmetals in the gas phase. the mean metallicity is about 0.7 solar and 50% of themetals are in the dust. for the cluster as a whole the mass density of stars ingalaxies is 8 times that of the gas and the gas mass density is 130 times thatof the metals. we use our data to consider the chemical evolution of theindividual galaxies, inferring that the measured variations in effective yieldare due to galaxies having different ages, being affected to varying degrees bygas loss. four galaxy scaling relations are considered: mass-metallicity,mass-velocity, mass-star formation rate and mass-radius - we suggest thatinitial galaxy mass is the prime driver of a galaxy's ultimate destiny.finally, we use x-ray observations and galaxy dynamics to assess the dark andbaryonic matter content compared to the cosmological model.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1412.8384	free-flight experiments in lisa pathfinder	the lisa pathfinder mission will demonstrate the technology of drag-free testmasses for use as inertial references in future space-based gravitational wavedetectors. to accomplish this, the pathfinder spacecraft will perform drag-freeflight about a test mass while measuring the acceleration of this primary testmass relative to a second reference test mass. because the reference test massis contained within the same spacecraft, it is necessary to apply forces on itto maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. these forcesare a potential source of acceleration noise in the lisa pathfinder system thatare not present in the full lisa configuration. while lisa pathfinder has beendesigned to meet it's primary mission requirements in the presence of thisnoise, recent estimates suggest that the on-orbit performance may be limited bythis `suspension noise'. the drift-mode or free-flight experiments provide anopportunity to mitigate this noise source and further characterize theunderlying disturbances that are of interest to the designers of lisa-likeinstruments. this article provides a high-level overview of these experimentsand the methods under development to analyze the resulting data.

1511.07430	the bolometric and uv attenuation in normal spiral galaxies of the  herschel reference survey	the dust in nearby galaxies absorbs a fraction of theuv-optical-near-infrared radiation produced by stars. this energy isconsequently re-emitted in the infrared. we investigate the portion of thestellar radiation absorbed by spiral galaxies from the hrs by modelling theiruv-to-submillimetre spectral energy distributions. our models provide anattenuated and intrinsic sed from which we find that on average 32 % of allstarlight is absorbed by dust. we define the uv heating fraction as thepercentage of dust luminosity that comes from absorbed uv photons and find thatthis is 56 %, on average. this percentage varies with morphological type, withlater types having significantly higher uv heating fractions. we find a strongcorrelation between the uv heating fraction and specific star formation rateand provide a power-law fit. our models allow us to revisit the irx-afuvrelations, and derive these quantities directly within a self-consistentframework. we calibrate this relation for different bins of nuv-r colour andprovide simple relations to relate these parameters. we investigated therobustness of our method and we conclude that the derived parameters arereliable within the uncertainties which are inherent to the adopted sed model.this calls for a deeper investigation on how well extinction and attenuationcan be determined through panchromatic sed modelling.

astro-ph;0104087	the impact of bars on the mid-infrared dust emission of spiral galaxies:  global and circumnuclear properties	we study the mid-infrared properties of a sample of 69 nearby spiralgalaxies, selected to avoid seyfert activity contributing a significantfraction of the central energetics, or strong tidal interaction, and to havenormal infrared luminosities. these observations were obtained with isocam,which provides an angular resolution of the order of 10 arcsec (half-powerdiameter of the point spread function) and low-resolution spectro-imaginginformation. between 5 and 18 microns, we mainly observe two dust phases,aromatic infrared bands and very small grains, both out of thermal equilibrium.on this sample, we show that the global f15/f7 colors of galaxies are veryuniform, the only increase being found in early-type strongly barred galaxies,consistent with previous iras studies. the f15/f7 excesses are unambiguouslydue to galactic central regions where bar-induced starbursts occur. however,the existence of strongly barred early-type galaxies with normal circumnuclearcolors indicates that the relationship between a distortion of thegravitational potential and a central starburst is not straightforward. as thephysical processes at work in central regions are in principle identical inbarred and unbarred galaxies, and since this is where the mid-infrared activityis mainly located, we investigate the mid-infrared circumnuclear properties ofall the galaxies in our sample. we show how surface brightnesses and colors arerelated to both the available molecular gas content and the mean age of stellarpopulations contributing to dust heating. therefore, the star formation historyin galactic central regions can be constrained by their position in acolor-surface brightness mid-infrared diagram.

astro-ph;0206150	mid-infrared observations of the ultraluminous galaxies iras14348-1447,  iras19254-7245, and iras23128-5919	we present a study of the three ultraluminous infrared galaxiesiras14348-1447, iras19254-7245, and iras23128-5919, based on mid-infrared (mir)spectro-imaging (5-18microns) observations performed with isocam. we find thatthe mir emission from each system, which consists of a pair of interacting latetype galaxies, is principally confined to the nuclear regions with diameters of1-2kpc and can account for more than 95% of their iras 12micron flux. in eachinteracting system, the galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (agn)dominates the total spectrum and shows stronger dust continuum (12-16microns)relative to the unidentified infrared band (uib) emission (6-9microns),suggestive of its enhanced radiation field. the mir dominant galaxy alsoexhibits elevated 15micron/halpha and 15micron/k ratios which trace the highextinction due to the large quantities of molecular gas and dust present in itscentral regions. using only diagnostics based on our mid-infrared spectra, wecan establish that the seyfert galaxy iras19254-7245 exhibits mir spectralfeatures of an agn while the mir spectrum of the seyfert (or liner) member ofiras23128-5919 is characteristic of dust emission principally heated by starforming regions.

astro-ph;0609830	extragalactic science with herschel-spire	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is one of threeinstruments to fly on esa's herschel space observatory. it contains athree-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 360 and 520 microns, and animaging fourier transform spectrometer (fts) covering 200-670 microns. it willbe used for many extragalactic science programmes, a number of which will beimplemented as herschel key projects. the spire consortium's guaranteed time(gt) programme will devote more than 1000 hours to key projects covering thehigh-z universe and local galaxies. it is also expected that substantialamounts of herschel open time will be used for further extragalacticinvestigations. the high-z part of the spire gt programme will focus onblank-field surveys with a range of depths and areas optimised to sample theluminosity-redshift plane and characterise the bolometric luminosity density ofthe universe at high z. fields will be selected that are well covered at otherwavelengths to facilitate source identifications and enable detailed studies ofthe redshifts, spectral energy distributions, and infrared properties ofdetected galaxies. the local galaxies programme will include a detailedspectral and photometric study of a sample of well resolved nearby galaxies, asurvey of more than 300 local galaxies designed to provide a statistical surveyof dust in the nearby universe, and a study of the ism in low-metallicityenvironments, bridging the gap between the local universe and primordialgalaxies.

astro-ph;9804020	mid--ir emission of galaxies in the virgo cluster: ii. integrated  properties	we analyse the integrated properties of the mid-ir emission of a complete,optically selected sample of galaxies in the virgo cluster observed with theisocam instrument on board the iso satellite. the analysis shows that themid-ir emission up to 15 mic of optically-selected, normal early-type galaxies(e, s0 and s0a) is dominated by the rayleigh-jeans tail of the cold stellarcomponent. the mid-ir emission of late-type galaxies is instead dominated bythe thermal emission from dust. the small dust grains emitting in the mid-irhave an excess of emission if compared to big grains emitting in the far-ir.while the far-ir emission increases with the intensity of the interstellarradiation field, their mid-ir emission is non--linearly related to the uvradiation field. the spectral energy distributions of the target galaxiesindicate that there is a linear relationship between the uv radiation field andthe mid-ir emission of galaxies for low or intermediate activities of starformation, while the emission from the hot dust seems to drop for strong uvfields. the mid-ir colour of late-type galaxies is not related to theiractivity of star formation. the properties of the dust emission in the mid-irseem more related to the mass than to the morphological type of the targetgalaxy. since the activity of star formation is anticorrelated to the mass ofgalaxies, this reflects a relationship between the emission of dust in themid-ir and the uv radiation field: galaxies with the lowest mid-ir emission fora given uv field are low mass, dwarf galaxies. these observational evidencesare easily explained if the carriers of the unidentified infrared bands thatdominate the 6.75 mic emission are destroyed by the intense uv radiation fieldof dwarf galaxies, although abundance effects can also play a role.

astro-ph;9811126	dust in an extremely metal-poor galaxy: mid-infrared observations of sbs  0335-052	the metal deficient (z = z_sun/41) blue compact dwarf galaxy (bcd) sbs0335-052 was observed with isocam between 5 and 17 mic. with a l_12mic/l_bratio of 2.15, the galaxy is unexpectedly bright in the mid-infrared for such alow-metallicity object. the mid-infrared spectrum shows no sign of theunidentified infrared bands, which we interpret as an effect of the destructionof their carriers by the very high uv energy density in sbs 0335-052. thespectral energy distribution (sed) is dominated by a very strong continuumwhich makes the ionic lines of [siv] and [neiii] very weak. from 5 to 17 mic,the sed can be fitted with a grey-body spectrum, modified by an extinction lawsimilar to that observed toward the galactic center, with an optical depth ofa_v~19-21 mag. such a large optical depth implies that a large fraction (asmuch as ~ 75%) of the current star-formation activity in sbs 0335-052 is hiddenby dust with a mass between 3x10^3 m_sun and 5x10^5 m_sun. silicate grains arepresent as silicate extinction bands at 9.7 and 18 mic can account for theunusual shape of the mir spectrum of sbs 0335-052. it is remarkable that such anearly primordial environment contains as much dust as galaxies which are 10times more metal-rich. if the hidden star formation in sbs 0335-052 is typicalof young galaxies at high redshifts, then the cosmic star formation ratederived from uv/optical fluxes would be underestimated.
