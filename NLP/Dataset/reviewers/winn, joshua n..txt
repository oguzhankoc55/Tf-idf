0902.0737	exoplanetary spin-orbit alignment: results from the ensemble of  rossiter-mclaughlin observations	one possible diagnostic of planet formation, orbital migration, and tidalevolution is the angle psi between a planet's orbital axis and the spin axis ofits parent star. in general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planetsone can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axesvia the rossiter-mclaughlin effect. here, we show how to combine measurementsof lambda in different systems to derive statistical constraints on psi. weapply the method to 11 published measurements of lambda, using two differentsingle-parameter distributions to describe the ensemble. first, assuming arayleigh distribution (or more precisely, a fisher distribution on a sphere),we find that the peak value is less than 22 degrees with 95% confidence.second, assuming a fraction f of the orbits have random orientations relativeto the stars, and the remaining fraction (1-f) are perfectly aligned, we findf&lt;0.36 with 95% confidence. this latter model fits the data better than therayleigh distribution, mainly because the xo-3 system was found to be stronglymisaligned while the other 10 systems are consistent with perfect alignment. ifthe xo-3 result proves robust, then our results may be interpreted as evidencefor two distinct modes of planet migration.

0902.1542	near-infrared transit photometry of the exoplanet hd 149026b	the transiting exoplanet hd 149026b is an important case for theories ofplanet formation and planetary structure, because the planet's relatively smallsize has been interpreted as evidence for a highly metal-enriched composition.we present observations of 4 transits with the near infrared camera andmulti-object spectrometer on the hubble space telescope, within a wavelengthrange of 1.1--2.0 $\mu$m. analysis of the light curve gives the most preciseestimate yet of the stellar mean density, $\rho_\star =0.497^{+0.042}_{-0.057}$ g cm$^{-3}$. by requiring agreement between theobserved stellar properties (including $\rho_\star$) and stellar evolutionarymodels, we refine the estimate of the stellar radius: $r_\star =1.541^{+0.046}_{-0.042}$ $r_\sun$. we also find a deeper transit than has beenmeasured at optical and mid-infrared wavelengths. taken together, thesefindings imply a planetary radius of $r_p = 0.813^{+0.027}_{-0.025}$ $r_{\rmjup}$, which is larger than earlier estimates. models of the planetary interiorstill require a metal-enriched composition, although the required degree ofmetal enrichment is reduced. it is also possible that the deeper nicmos transitis caused by wavelength-dependent absorption by constituents in the planet'satmosphere, although simple model atmospheres do not predict this effect to bestrong enough to account for the discrepancy. we use the 4 newly-measuredtransit times to compute a refined transit ephemeris.

0902.3461	on the spin-orbit misalignment of the xo-3 exoplanetary system	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 feb. 2transit of the exoplanet xo-3b. the new data show that the planetary orbitalaxis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by hebrardand coworkers. we find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes tobe 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15deg. the significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there areindications of systematic effects. xo-3b is the first exoplanet known to have ahighly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, andas such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration ofmassive planets into close-in orbits. we revisit the statistical analysis ofspin-orbit alignment in hot-jupiter systems. assuming the stellar obliquitiesto be drawn from a single rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of thedistribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. however, it remains the case that a modelrepresenting two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawnfrom a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropicdistribution--is favored over a single rayleigh distribution.

0907.5205	the transit ingress and the tilted orbit of the extraordinarily  eccentric exoplanet hd 80606b	we present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009june 5 transit of the exoplanet hd 80606b. we report the first detection of thetransit ingress, revealing the transit duration to be 11.64 +/- 0.25 hr andallowing more robust determinations of the system parameters. keck spectraobtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift, giving definitiveevidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary orbital axis are misaligned.the keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle is between 32-87 degwith 68.3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99.73% confidence. thus theorbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0.93), but is also tiltedaway from the equatorial plane of its parent star. a large tilt had beenpredicted, based on the idea that the planet's eccentric orbit was caused bythe kozai mechanism. independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planetson eccentric orbits, suggesting that those systems migrate differently thanlower-mass planets on circular orbits.

0909.2861	misaligned spin and orbital axes cause the anomalous precession of di  herculis	the orbits of binary stars precess as a result of general relativisticeffects, forces arising from the asphericity of the stars, and forces fromadditional stars or planets in the system. for most binaries, the theoreticaland observed precession rates are in agreement. one system, however -- diherculis -- has resisted explanation for 30 years. the observed precession rateis a factor of four slower than the theoretical rate, a disagreement that oncewas interpreted as evidence for a failure of general relativity. among thecontemporary explanations are the existence of a circumbinary planet and alarge tilt of the stellar spin axes with respect to the orbit. here we reportthat both stars of di herculis rotate with their spin axes nearly perpendicularto the orbital axis (contrary to the usual assumption for close binary stars).the rotationally induced stellar oblateness causes precession in the directionopposite to that of relativistic precession, thereby reconciling thetheoretical and observed rates.

0910.2365	analytic description of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets: cross-correlation method and comparison with simulated data	we obtain analytical expressions for the velocity anomaly due to therossiter- mclaughlin effect, for the case when the anomalous radial velocity isobtained by cross-correlation with a stellar template spectrum. in the limit ofvanishing width of the stellar absorption lines, our result reduces to theformula derived by ohta et al. (2005), which is based on the first moment ofdistorted stellar lines. our new formula contains a term dependent on thestellar linewidth, which becomes important when rotational line broadening isappreciable. we generate mock transit spectra for four existing exoplanetarysystems (hd17156, tres-2, tres- 4, and hd209458) following the procedure ofwinn et al. (2005), and find that the new formula is in better agreement withthe velocity anomaly extracted from the mock data. thus, our result provides amore reliable analytical description of the velocity anomaly due to therossiter-mclaughlin effect, and explains the previously observed dependence ofthe velocity anomaly on the stellar rotation velocity.

0912.1594	empirical constraints on the oblateness of an exoplanet	we show that the gas giant exoplanet hd 189733b is less oblate than saturn,based on spitzer space telescope photometry of seven transits. the observablemanifestations of oblatenesswould have been slight anomalies during the ingressand egress phases, as well as variations in the transit depth due to spinprecession. our nondetection of these effects gives the first empiricalconstraints on the shape of an exoplanet. the results are consistent with thetheoretical expectation that the planetary rotation period and orbital periodare synchronized, in which case the oblateness would be an order of magnitudesmaller than our upper limits. conversely, if hd 189733b is assumed to be in asynchronous, zero-obliquity state, then the data give an upper bound on thequadrupole moment of the planet (j2 &lt; 0.068 with 95% confidence) that is tooweak to constrain the interior structure of the planet. an appendix describes afast algorithm for computing the transit light curve of an oblate planet, whichwas necessary for our analysis.

0912.3229	a super-earth transiting a nearby low-mass star	a decade ago, the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planetprovided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door tospectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. as suchcharacterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are bothnearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large,nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. doppler studies andmicrolensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of1.9-10 times the earth's mass (m_earth), called super-earths. the firstconstraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was affordedby corot-7b, but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studiesin the foreseeable future. here we report observations of the transiting planetgj 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55 m_earth and a radius 2.68 times earth'sradius (r_earth), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between earthand the ice giants of the solar system. we find that the planetary mass andradius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by ahydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. theatmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it hasundergone significant evolution during its history. as the star is small andonly 13 parsecs away, the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study withcurrent observatories.

1005.1663	the detectability of transit depth variations due to exoplanetary  oblateness and spin precession	knowledge of an exoplanet's oblateness and obliquity would give clues aboutits formation and internal structure. in principle, a light curve of atransiting planet bears information about the planet's shape, but previous workhas shown that the oblateness-induced signal will be extremely difficult todetect. here we investigate the potentially larger signals due to planetaryspin precession. the most readily detectable effects are transit depthvariations (t$\delta$v) in a sequence of light curves. for a planet as oblateas jupiter or saturn, the transit depth will undergo fractional variations oforder 1%. the most promising systems are those with orbital periods ofapproximately 15--30 days, which is short enough for the precession period tobe less than about 40 years, and long enough to avoid spin-down due to tidalfriction. the detectability of the t$\delta$v signal would be enhanced by moons(which would decrease the precession period) or planetary rings (which wouldincrease the amplitude). the kepler mission should find several planets forwhich precession-induced t$\delta$v signals will be detectable. due to modelingdegeneracies, kepler photometry would yield only a lower bound on oblateness.the degeneracy could be lifted by observing the oblateness-induced asymmetry inat least one transit light curve, or by making assumptions about the planetaryinterior.

1007.4212	the light curve of the weakly-accreting t tauri binary kh 15d from  2005-10: insights into the nature of its protoplanetary disk	photometry of the unique pre-main sequence binary system kh 15d is presented,spanning the years 2005-2010. this system has exhibited photometric variationsand eclipses over the last 50 years caused by a precessing circumbinary disk.advancement of the occulting edge across the binary orbit has continued and thephotospheres of both stars are now completely obscured at all times. the systemis now visible only by scattered light, and yet it continues to show a periodicvariation on the orbital cycle with an amplitude exceeding two magnitudes. thisvariation, which depends only on the binary phase, has likely been present inthe data since at least 1995. it can, by itself, account for shoulders on thelight curve prior to ingress and following egress, obviating the need forcomponents of extant models such as a scattering halo around star a or forwardscattering from a fuzzy disk edge. a plausible source for the variablescattering component is reflected light from the far side of a warped occultingdisk. we have detected color changes in v-i of several tenths of a magnitude toboth the blue and red that occur during times of minima. these may indicate thepresence of a third source of light (faint star) within the system, or a changein the reflectance properties of the disk as the portion being illuminatedvaries with the orbital motion of the stars. the data support a picture of thecircumbinary disk as a geometrically thin, optically thick layer of perhaps mmor cm-sized particles that has been sculpted by the binary stars and possiblyother components into a decidedly nonplanar configuration. a simple (infinitelysharp) knife-edge model does a good job of accounting for all of the recent(2005-2010) occultation data.

1008.3803	the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of the transiting exoplanet xo-4b	we report photometric and radial velocity observations of the xo-4 transitingplanetary system, conducted with the flwo 1.2m telescope and the 8.2m subarutelescope. based on the new light curves, the refined transit ephemeris ofxo-4b is $p = 4.1250828 \pm 0.0000040$ days and $t_c [bjd_tdb] = 2454485.93323\pm 0.00039$. we measured the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of xo-4b and estimatedthe sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbitalaxis to be $\lambda = -46.7^{\circ} ^{+8.1^{\circ}}_{-6.1^{\circ}}$. thismeasurement of $\lambda$ is less robust than in some other cases because theimpact parameter of the transit is small, causing a strong degeneracy between$\lambda$ and the projected stellar rotational velocity. nevertheless, ourfinding of a spin-orbit misalignment suggests that the migration process forxo-4b involved few-body dynamics rather than interaction with a gaseous disk.in addition, our result conforms with the pattern reported by winn et al.(2010, apjl, 718, l145) that high obliquities are preferentially found forstars with effective temperatures hotter than 6250~k.

1106.2548	two upper limits on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, with differing  implications: wasp-1 has a high obliquity and wasp-2 is indeterminate	we present precise radial-velocity measurements of wasp-1 and wasp-2throughout transits of their giant planets. our goal was to detect therossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed duringeclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities ofplanet-hosting stars. for wasp-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detectedwith ~2sigma confidence, and for wasp-2 no signal was detected. the resultingupper bounds on the rm amplitude have different implications for these twosystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.because wasp-1 is an f7v star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, themost probable reason for the suppression of the rm effect is that the star isviewed nearly pole-on. this implies the wasp-1 star has a high obliquity withrespect to the edge-on planetary orbit. because wasp-2 is a k1v star, and isexpected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about thestellar obliquity. our data and our analysis contradict an earlier claim thatwasp-2b has a retrograde orbit, thereby revoking this system's status as anexception to the pattern that cool stars have low obliquities.

1107.5750	the hot-jupiter kepler-17b: discovery, obliquity from stroboscopic  starspots, and atmospheric characterization	this paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting hotgiant exoplanet kepler-17b. the planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, andradial velocity measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het) show adoppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. from a transit-based estimate of the hoststar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effectivetemperature t_eff=5630+/-100 k from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellarhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 m_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 r_jup.we estimate the planet mass and radius to be mp=2.450+/-0.114 m_jup andrp=1.312+/-0.018 r_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. the host star isactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. thecontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio producesstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. the temporal pattern of thesespot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star'sobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. we detected planetary occultations ofkepler-17b with both the kepler and spitzer space telescopes. we use theseobservations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistentwith a circular orbit (e&lt;0.0011). the brightness temperatures of the planet theinfrared bandpasses are t_3.6um=1880+/-100 k and t4.5um=1770+/-150 k. wemeasure the optical geometric albedo a_g in the kepler bandpass and find a_g =0.10+/-0.02. the observations are best described by atmospheric models forwhich most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

1108.4430	improved modeling of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets	we present an improved formula for the anomalous radial velocity of the starduring planetary transits due to the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect. theimprovement comes from a more realistic description of the stellar absorptionline profiles, taking into account stellar rotation, macroturbulence, thermalbroadening, pressure broadening, and instrumental broadening. although theformula is derived for the case in which radial velocities are measured bycross-correlation, we show through numerical simulations that the formulaaccurately describes the cases where the radial velocities are measured withthe iodine absorption-cell technique. the formula relies on prior knowledge ofthe parameters describing macroturbulence, instrumental broadening and otherbroadening mechanisms, but even 30% errors in those parameters do notsignificantly change the results in typical circumstances. we show that the newanalytic formula agrees with previous ones that had been computed on acase-by-case basis via numerical simulations. finally, as one application ofthe new formula, we reassess the impact of the differential rotation on the rmvelocity anomaly. we show that differential rotation of a rapidly rotating starmay have a significant impact on future rm observations.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1205.3233	measurements of stellar inclinations for kepler planet candidates	we present an investigation of spin-orbit angles for planetary systemcandidates reported by kepler. by combining the rotational period $p_s$inferred from the flux variation due to starspots and the projected rotationalvelocity $v\sin i_s$ and stellar radius obtained by a high resolutionspectroscopy, we attempt to estimate the inclination $i_s$ of the stellar spinaxis with respect to the line-of-sight. for transiting planetary systems, inwhich planetary orbits are edge-on seen from us, the stellar inclination $i_s$can be a useful indicator of a spin-orbit alignment/misalignment. we newlyconducted spectroscopic observations with subaru/hds for 15 koi systems, whoselightcurves show periodic flux variations. after detailed analyses of theirlightcurves and spectra, it turned out that some of them are binaries, or theflux variations are too coherent to be caused by starspots, probablyrepresenting ellipsoidal variations, and consequently we could constrainstellar inclinations $i_s$ for eight systems. among them, koi-262 and 280 arein good agreement with $i_s=90^\circ$ suggesting a spin-orbit alignment, whileat least one system, koi-261, shows a possible spin-orbit misalignment. we alsoobtain a small $i_s$ for koi-1463, but the transiting companion seems to be astar rather than a planet. the results for koi-257, 269, 367, and 974 areambiguous, and can be explained with either misalignments or moderatedifferential rotation. since our method can be applied to any system havingstarspots regardless of the planet size, future observations will allow for theexpansion of the parameter space in which the spin-orbit relations areinvestigated.

1206.4695	rapid dynamical chaos in an exoplanetary system	we report on the long-term dynamical evolution of the two-planet kepler-36system, which we studied through numerical integrations of initial conditionsthat are consistent with observations of the system. the orbits are chaoticwith a lyapunov time of only ~10 years. the chaos is a consequence of aparticular set of orbital resonances, with the inner planet orbiting 34 timesfor every 29 orbits of the outer planet. the rapidity of the chaos is due tothe interaction of the 29:34 resonance with the nearby first order 6:7resonance, in contrast to the usual case in which secular terms in thehamiltonian play a dominant role. only one contiguous region of phase space,accounting for ~4.5% of the sample of initial conditions studied, correspondsto planetary orbits that do not show large scale orbital instabilities on thetimescale of our integrations (~200 million years). the long-lived subset ofthe allowed initial conditions are those that satisfy the hill stabilitycriterion by the largest margin. any successful theory for the formation ofthis system will need to account for why its current state is so close tounstable regions of phase space.

0711.2304	a technique for detecting starlight scattered from transiting extrasolar  planets with application to hd 209458b	we present a new technique for detecting scattered starlight from transiting,close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (cegps) that has the virtues ofsimplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. given a series ofstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goalis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative tothe component coming directly from the star. we use two complementarystrategies, both of which rely on the predictable doppler shifts of bothcomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and manyexposures. in the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrumthat are free of direct absorption lines and add them after doppler-shiftinginto the planetary frame. in the second strategy, we compare the distributionof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. bothstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled dopplershifts are applied to the spectral segments. as an illustrative test case, weapply our technique to spectra of hd 209458 taken when the planet was nearopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. thiscorresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase functionof a lambert sphere. although the result is not statistically significant, theachieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is basedare very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scatteredlight from transiting cegp systems.

1208.1268	improved spectroscopic parameters for transiting planet hosts	we report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effectivetemperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host starsof 56 transiting planets. our analysis is based primarily on the stellarparameter classification (spc) technique. we investigate systematic errors byexamining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been usedin previous studies (sme and moog). the spc and sme results, both based oncomparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strongcorrelations between temperature, [fe/h], and log g when solving for all threequantities simultaneously. in contrast the moog results, based on a moretraditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. to combat thecorrelations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, werepeat the spc analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellardensity that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves.previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have beensubject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and10%, respectively, which can be larger than other observational uncertainties,and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

1211.7065	banana iv: two aligned stellar rotation axes in the young eccentric  binary system ep crucis: primordial orientation and tidal alignment	with observations of the ep cru system, we continue our series ofmeasurements of spin-orbit angles in eclipsing binary star systems, the bananaproject (binaries are not always neatly aligned). we find a close alignmentbetween the sky projections of the rotational and orbital angular momentumvectors for both stars (beta_p = -1.8+-1.6 deg and |beta_s|&lt;17 deg). we alsoderive precise absolute dimensions and stellar ages for this system. the ep cruand di her systems provide an interesting comparison: they have similar stellartypes and orbital properties, but di her is younger and has major spin-orbitmisalignments, raising the question of whether ep cru also had a largemisalignment at an earlier phase of evolution. we show that tidal dissipationis an unlikely explanation for the good alignment observed today, becauserealignment happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, andthe stars in ep cru are far from syncrhonization (they are spinning 9 times tooquickly). therefore it seems that some binaries form with aligned axes, whileother superficially similar binaries are formed with misaligned axes.

1301.6289	the stellar obliquity and the long-period planet in the hat-p-17  exoplanetary system	we present the measured projected obliquity -- the sky-projected anglebetween the stellar spin axis and orbital angular momentum -- of the innerplanet of the hat-p-17 multi-planet system. we measure the sky-projectedobliquity of the star to be \lambda=19+/-15 degrees by modeling therossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect in keck/hires radial velocities (rvs). theanomalous rv time series shows an asymmetry relative to the midtransit time,ordinarily suggesting a nonzero obliquity -- but in this case at least part ofthe asymmetry may be due to the convective blueshift, increasing theuncertainty in the determination of \lambda. we employ the semi-analyticalapproach of hirano et al. (2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model theanomaly in the net rv caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planetformation and migration. to date, the measured obliquities of ~50 jovianplanets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbitingcool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetaryorbits. our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidalinteractions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. inaddition, our 1.8 years of new rvs for this system show that the orbit of theouter planet is more poorly constrained than previously thought, with anorbital period now in the range of 10-36 years.

1302.4443	low stellar obliquities in compact multiplanet systems	we measure the sky-projected stellar obliquities (\lambda) in themultiple-transiting planetary systems koi-94 and kepler-25, using therossiter-mclaughlin effect. in both cases the host stars are well-aligned withthe orbital planes of the planets. for koi-94 we find \lambda=-11+-11 deg,confirming a recent result by hirano and coworkers. kepler-25 was a morechallenging case because the transit depth is unusually small (0.13 %). toobtain the obliquity it was necessary to use prior knowledge of the star'sprojected rotation rate, and apply two different analysis methods toindependent wavelength regions of the spectra. the two methods gave consistentresults, \lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.  there are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars ofsystems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent withspin-orbit alignment. this alignment is unlikely to be the result of tidalinteractions, because of the relatively large orbital distances and lowplanetary masses in the systems. in this respect the multiplanet host starsdiffer from hot-jupiter host stars, which commonly have large spin-orbitmisalignments whenever tidal interactions are weak. in particular the weak-tidesubset of hot-jupiter hosts have obliquities consistent with an isotropicdistribution (p=0.6), but the multiplanet hosts are incompatible with such adistribution (p~10^-6). this suggests that high obliquities are confined tohot-jupiter systems, and provides further evidence that hot jupiter formationinvolves processes that tilt the planetary orbit.

1302.5084	orbital phase variations of the eccentric giant planet hat-p-2b	we present the first secondary eclipse and phase curve observations for thehighly eccentric hot jupiter hat-p-2b in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 \mu m bandsof the spitzer space telescope. the 3.6 and 4.5 \mu m data sets span an entireorbital period of hat-p-2b, making them the longest continuous phase curveobservations obtained to date and the first full-orbit observations of a planetwith an eccentricity exceeding 0.2. we present an improved non-parametricmethod for removing the intrapixel sensitivity variations in spitzer data at3.6 and 4.5 \mu m that robustly maps position-dependent flux variations. wefind that the peak in planetary flux occurs at 4.39+/-0.28, 5.84+/-0.39, and4.68+/-0.37 hours after periapse passage with corresponding maxima in theplanet/star flux ratio of 0.1138%+/-0.0089%, 0.1162%+/-0.0080%, and0.1888%+/-0.0072% in the 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 \mu m bands respectively. we compareour measured secondary eclipse depths to the predictions from a one-dimensionalradiative transfer model, which suggests the possible presence of a transientday side inversion in hat-p-2b's atmosphere near periapse. we also deriveimproved estimates for the system parameters, including its mass, radius, andorbital ephemeris. our simultaneous fit to the transit, secondary eclipse, andradial velocity data allows us to determine the eccentricity and argument ofperiapse of hat-p-2b's orbit with a greater precision than has been achievedfor any other eccentric extrasolar planet. we also find evidence for along-term linear trend in the radial velocity data. this trend suggests thepresence of another substellar companion in the hat-p-2 system, which couldhave caused hat-p-2b to migrate inward to its present-day orbit via the kozaimechanism.

1305.3281	relative photometry of hat-p-1b occultations	we present hst stis observations of two occultations of the transitingexoplanet hat-p-1b. by measuring the planet to star flux ratio near opposition,we constrain the geometric albedo of the planet, which is strongly linked toits atmospheric temperature gradient. an advantage of hat-p-1 as a target isits binary companion ads 16402 a, which provides an excellent photometricreference, simplifying the usual steps in removing instrumental artifacts fromhst time-series photometry. we find that without this reference star, we wouldneed to detrend the lightcurve with the time of the exposures as well as thefirst three powers of hst orbital phase, and this would introduce a strong biasin the results for the albedo. however, with this reference star, we only needto detrend the data with the time of the exposures to achieve the sameper-point scatter, therefore we can avoid most of the bias associated withdetrending. our final result is a 2 sigma upper limit of 0.64 for the geometricalbedo of hat-p-1b between 577 and 947 nm.

1306.0567	evidence for the tidal destruction of hot jupiters by subgiant stars	tidal transfer of angular momentum is expected to cause hot jupiters tospiral into their host stars. although the timescale for orbital decay is veryuncertain, it should be faster for systems with larger and more evolved stars.indeed, it is well established that hot jupiters are found less frequentlyaround subgiant stars than around main-sequence stars. however, theinterpretation of this finding has been ambiguous, because the subgiants arealso thought to be more massive than the f- and g-type stars that dominate themain-sequence sample. consequently it has been unclear whether the absence ofhot jupiters is due to tidal destruction, or inhibited formation of thoseplanets around massive stars. here we show that the galactic space motions ofthe planet-hosting subgiant stars demand that on average they be similar inmass to the planet-hosting main-sequence f- and g-type stars. therefore the twosamples are likely to differ only in age, and provide a glimpse of the sameexoplanet population both before and after tidal evolution. as a result, thelack of hot jupiters orbiting subgiants is clear evidence for their tidaldestruction. questions remain, though, about the interpretation of otherreported differences between the planet populations around subgiants andmain-sequence stars, such as their period and eccentricity distributions andoverall occurrence rates.

1307.4080	the roche limit for close-orbiting planets: minimum density, composition  constraints, and application to the 4.2-hour planet koi 1843.03	the requirement that a planet must orbit outside of its roche limit gives alower limit on the planet's mean density. the minimum density depends almostentirely on the orbital period and is immune to systematic errors in thestellar properties. we consider the implications of this density constraint forthe newly-identified class of small planets with periods shorter than half aday. when the planet's radius is known accurately, this lower limit to thedensity can be used to restrict the possible combinations of iron and rockwithin the planet. applied to koi 1843.03, with a radius of 0.6 earth radii andthe shortest known orbital period of 4.245 hr, the planet's mean density mustbe greater than approximately 7 g/cm^3. by modeling the planetary interiorsubject to this constraint, we find the composition of the planet must bemostly iron, with at most a modest fraction of silicates (less thanapproximately 30% by mass).

1307.8128	kepler-63b: a giant planet in a polar orbit around a young sun-like star	we present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting theyoung sun-like star kepler-63 (koi-63, $m_{\rm kp} = 11.6$, $t_{\rm eff} =5576$ k, $m_\star = 0.98\, m_\odot$). the planet transits every 9.43 days, withapparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots.the planet's radius is $6.1 \pm 0.2 r_{\earth}$, based on the transit lightcurve and the estimated stellar parameters. the planet's mass could not bemeasured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level ofstellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit we can place a rough upperbound of $120 m_{\earth}$ (3$\sigma$). the host star has a high obliquity($\psi$ = $104^{\circ}$), based on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and ananalysis of starspot-crossing events. this result is valuable because almostall previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets andshorter-period orbits. in addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined withan analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polarstarspot. such spots have previously been inferred using doppler tomography,and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young sun-like stars.

0801.3952	the central component of gravitational lens q0957+561	in 1981, a faint radio source (g') was detected near the center of thelensing galaxy of the famous "twin quasar" q0957+561. it is still unknownwhether this central radio source is a third quasar image or an active nucleusof the lensing galaxy, or a combination of both. in an attempt to resolve thisambiguity, we observed q0957+561 at radio wavelengths of 13cm, 18cm, and 21cm,using the very long baseline array in combination with the phased very largearray and the green bank telescope. we measured the spectrum of g' for thefirst time and found it to be significantly different from the spectra of thetwo bright quasar images. this finding suggests that the central component isprimarily or entirely emission from the foreground lens galaxy, but thespectrum is also consistent with the hypothesis of a central quasar imagesuffering free-free absorption. in addition, we confirm the previously-reportedvlbi position of g' just north of the optical center of the lens galaxy. theposition slightly favors the hypothesis that g' originates in the lens, but isnot conclusive. we discuss the prospects for further clarification of thisissue.

1310.7988	a rocky composition for an earth-sized exoplanet	planets with sizes between that of earth (with radius r$_\oplus$) and neptune(about 4 r$_\oplus$) are now known to be common around sun-like stars. mostsuch planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which theplanet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by theplanet as it passes in front of its star. measuring the planet's mass-and henceits density, which is a clue to its composition-is more difficult. planets ofsize 2-4 r$_\oplus$ have proven to have a wide range of densities, implying adiversity of compositions, but these measurements did not extend down toplanets as small as earth. here we report doppler spectroscopic measurements ofthe mass of the earth-sized planet kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every8.5 hours. given a radius of 1.20 $\pm$ 0.09 r$_\oplus$ and mass of 1.69 $\pm$0.41 m$_\oplus$, the planet's mean density of 5.3 $\pm$ 1.8 g cm$^{-3}$ issimilar to the earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron.

1401.1229	measurements of stellar inclinations for kepler planet candidates ii:  candidate spin-orbit misalignments in single and multiple-transiting systems	we present a test for spin-orbit alignment for the host stars of 25 candidateplanetary systems detected by the {\it kepler} spacecraft. the inclinationangle of each star's rotation axis was estimated from its rotation period,rotational line broadening, and radius. the rotation periods were determinedusing the {\it kepler} photometric time series. the rotational line broadeningwas determined from high-resolution optical spectra with subaru/hds. those samespectra were used to determine the star's photospheric parameters (effectivetemperature, surface gravity, metallicity) which were then interpreted withstellar-evolutionary models to determine stellar radii. we combine the newsample with the 7 stars from our previous work on this subject, finding thatthe stars show a statistical tendency to have inclinations near 90$^\circ$, inalignment with the planetary orbits. possible spin-orbit misalignments are seenin several systems, including three multiple-planet systems (koi-304, 988,2261). ideally these systems should be scrutinized with complementarytechniques---such as the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, starspot-crossinganomalies or asteroseismology---but the measurements will be difficult owing tothe relatively faint apparent magnitudes and small transit signals in thesesystems.

1403.0583	the banana project. v. misaligned and precessing stellar rotation axes  in cv velorum	as part of the banana project (binaries are not always neatly aligned), wehave found that the eclipsing binary cv velorum has misaligned rotation axes.based on our analysis of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, we find sky-projectedspin-orbit angles of $\beta_{\rm p} = -52\pm6^{\circ}$ and $\beta_{\rm s}=3\pm7^{\circ}$ for the primary and secondary stars (b2.5v $+$ b2.5v, $p=6.9$d). we combine this information with several measurements of changing projectedstellar rotation speeds ($v \sin i_{\star}$) over the last $30$ years, leadingto a model in which the primary star's obliquity is $\approx65^{\circ}$, andits spin axis precesses around the total angular momentum vector with a periodof about $140$ years. the geometry of the secondary star is less clear,although a significant obliquity is also implicated by the observed timevariations in the $v \sin i_{\star}$. by integrating the secular tidalevolution equations backward in time, we find that the system could haveevolved from a state of even stronger misalignment similar to di herculis, ayounger but otherwise comparable binary.

1403.2379	a study of the shortest-period planets found with kepler	we present the results of a survey aimed at discovering and studyingtransiting planets with orbital periods shorter than one day(ultra--short-period, or usp, planets), using data from the {\em kepler}spacecraft. we computed fourier transforms of the photometric time series forall 200,000 target stars, and detected transit signals based on the presence ofregularly spaced sharp peaks in the fourier spectrum. we present a list of 106usp candidates, of which 18 have not previously been described in theliterature. in addition, among the objects we studied, there are 26 uspcandidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do notpass our various tests. all 106 of our candidates have passed several standardtests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. a low falsepositive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates forwhich more than one transiting planet signal was detected. by assuming thesemulti-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are ableto infer that the usp planets are typically accompanied by other planets withperiods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot jupiters which very rarelyhave companions in that same period range. another clear pattern is that almostall usp planets are smaller than 2 $r_\oplus$, possibly because gas giants invery tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subjectto extremely strong stellar irradiation. based on our survey statistics, uspplanets exist around approximately $(0.51\pm 0.07)\%$ of g-dwarf stars, and$(0.83\pm 0.18)\%$ of k-dwarf stars.

1511.05570	are tidal effects responsible for exoplanetary spin-orbit alignment?	the obliquities of planet-hosting stars are clues about the formation ofplanetary systems. previous observations led to the hypothesis that forclose-in giant planets, spin-orbit alignment is enforced by tidal interactions.here, we examine two problems with this hypothesis. first, mazeh and coworkersrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-inducedphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common evenfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides wereresponsible. we re-examine the data and find a statistically significantcorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period thatis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. however it is stilldifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effectivefor periods as long as tens of days. second, rogers and lin argued against aparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrogradesystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observedprevalence of prograde systems. we investigate a simple model that overcomesthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and theequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. we identify a region ofparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works forclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. thus, while we find bothproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still hasserious shortcomings.

astro-ph;0001022	a multipole-taylor expansion for the potential of gravitational lens mg  j0414+0534	we employ a multipole-taylor expansion to investigate how tightly thegravitational potential of the quadruple-image lens mg j0414+0534 isconstrained by recent vlbi observations. these observations revealed that eachof the four images of the background radio source contains four distinctcomponents, thereby providing more numerous and more precise constraints on thelens potential than were previously available. we expand the two-dimensionallens potential using multipoles for the angular coordinate and a modifiedtaylor series for the radial coordinate. after discussing the physicalsignificance of each term, we compute models of mg j0414+0534 using only vlbipositions as constraints. the best-fit model has both interior and exteriorquadrupole moments as well as exterior m=3 and m=4 multipole moments. thedeflector centroid in the models matches the optical galaxy position, and thequadrupoles are aligned with the optical isophotes. the radial distribution ofmass could not be well constrained. we discuss the implications of these modelsfor the deflector mass distribution and for the predicted time delays betweenlensed components.

astro-ph;0001141	ctq 839: candidate for the smallest projected separation binary quasar	we report the discovery of the new double quasar ctq 839. this b = 18.3,radio quiet quasar pair is separated by 2.1" in brih filters with magnitudedifferences of delta m_b = 2.5, delta m_r = delta m_i = 1.9, and delta m_h =2.3. spectral observations reveal both components to be z = 2.24 quasars, withrelative redshifts that agree at the 100 km/s level, but exhibit pronounceddifferences in the equivalent widths of related emission features, as well asan enhancement of blue continuum flux in the brighter component longward of thely alpha emission feature. in general, similar redshift double quasars can bethe result of a physical binary pair, or a single quasar multiply imaged bygravitational lensing. empirical psf subtraction of r and h band images of ctq839 reveal no indication of a lensing galaxy, and place a detection limit of r= 22.5 and h = 17.4 for a third component in the system. for an einstein-desitter cosmology and sis model, the r band detection limit constrains thecharacteristics of any lensing galaxy to z_lens &gt;= 1 with a correspondingluminosity of l &gt;~ 5 l_*, while an analysis based on the redshift probabilitydistribution for the lensing galaxy argues against the existence of a z_lens &gt;~1 lens at the 2 sigma level. a similar analysis for a lambda dominatedcosmology, however, does not significantly constrain the existence of anylensing galaxy. the broadband flux differences, spectral dissimilarities, andfailure to detect a lensing galaxy make the lensing hypothesis for ctq 839unlikely. the similar redshifts of the two components would then argue for aphysical quasar binary. at a projected separation of 8.3/h kpc (omega_matter =1), ctq 839 would be the smallest projected separation binary quasar currentlyknown.

astro-ph;0002333	a close separation double quasar lensed by a gas-rich galaxy	in the course of a cycle 8 snapshot survey, we have discovered that thez=1.565 quasar he 0512-3329 is a double with image separation 0.644", almostcertainly due to gravitational lensing. the two components differ in brightnessby only 0.4 magnitudes and a high signal-to-noise ground-based compositeoptical spectrum shows no trace of any stellar features at zero redshift,essentially ruling out the possibility that one of the two components is anordinary galactic star. the optical spectrum shows strong absorption featuresof mgii, mgi, feii, fei, and cai, all at an identical intervening redshift ofz=0.9313, probably due to the lensing object. the strength of the mgii and thepresence of the other low ionization absorption features is strong evidence fora damped lyman alpha system, likely the disk of a spiral galaxy. point spreadfunction fitting to remove the two quasar components from the stis image leadsto a tentative detection of a third object which may be the nucleus of thelensing galaxy. the brighter component is significantly redder than thefainter, due to either differential extinction or microlensing.

astro-ph;0008036	pmn j1838-3427: a new gravitationally lensed quasar	we report the discovery of a new double-image quasar that was found during asearch for gravitational lenses in the southern sky. radio source pmnj1838-3427 is composed of two flat-spectrum components with separation 1", fluxdensity ratio 14:1 and matching spectral indices, in vla and vlba images.ground-based bri images show the optical counterpart (total i=18.6) is alsodouble with the same separation and position angle as the radio components. anhst/wfpc2 image reveals the lens galaxy. the optical flux ratio (27:1) ishigher than the radio value probably due to differential extinction of thecomponents by the lens galaxy. an optical spectrum of the bright componentcontains quasar emission lines at z=2.78 and several absorption features,including prominent ly-alpha absorption. the lens galaxy redshift could not bemeasured but is estimated to be z=0.36 +/- 0.08. the image configuration isconsistent with the simplest plausible models for the lens potential. the flatradio spectrum and observed variability of pmn j1838-3427 suggest the timedelay between flux variations of the components is measurable, and could thusprovide an independent measurement of h_0.

astro-ph;0201551	pks 1830-211: a face-on spiral galaxy lens	we present new hubble space telescope images of the gravitational lens pks1830-211, which allow us to characterize the lens galaxy and update thedetermination of the hubble constant from this system. the i-band image showsthat the lens galaxy is a face-on spiral galaxy with clearly delineated spiralarms. the southwestern image of the background quasar passes through one of thespiral arms, explaining the previous detections of large quantities ofmolecular gas and dust in front of this image. the lens galaxy photometry isconsistent with the tully-fisher relation, suggesting the lens galaxy is atypical spiral galaxy for its redshift. the lens galaxy position, which was themain source of uncertainty in previous attempts to determine h_0, is now knownprecisely. given the current time delay measurement and assuming the lensgalaxy has an isothermal mass distribution, we compute h_0 = 44 +/- 9 km/s/mpcfor an omega_m = 0.3 flat cosmological model. we describe some possiblesystematic errors and how to reduce them. we also discuss the possibilityraised by courbin et al. (2002), that what we have identified as a single lensgalaxy is actually a foreground star and two separate galaxies.

astro-ph;0212423	investigation of the possible third image and mass models of the  gravitational lens pmn j1632-0033	we present multi-frequency vlba observations of pmn j1632-0033, one of thefew gravitationally lensed quasars suspected of having a central ``odd'' image.the central component has a different spectral index than the two bright quasarimages. therefore, either the central component is not a third image, and isinstead the active nucleus of the lens galaxy, or else it is a third imagewhose spectrum is inverted by free-free absorption in the lens galaxy. ineither case, we have more constraints on mass models than are usually availablefor a two-image lens, especially when combined with the observed orientationsof the radio jets of the two bright quasars. if there is no third quasar image,the simplest permitted model is a singular isothermal sphere in an externalshear field: beta=2.05^{+0.23}_{-0.10}, where rho(r) \propto r^{-beta}. if thecentral component is a third image, a hypothesis which can be tested withfuture high-frequency observations, then the density distribution is onlyslightly shallower than isothermal: beta=1.91 +/- 0.02. we also derive limitson the size of a constant-density core, and the break radius and exponent of aninner density cusp.

astro-ph;0302364	the quintuple quasar: radio and optical observations	we present results from high-resolution radio and optical observations of pmnj0134-0931, a gravitational lens with a unique radio morphology and anextremely red optical counterpart. our data support the theory of keeton &amp; winn(2003): five of the six observed radio components are multiple images of asingle quasar, produced by a pair of lens galaxies. multi-frequency vlba mapsshow that the sixth and faintest component has a different radio spectrum thanthe others, confirming that it represents a second component of the backgroundsource rather than a sixth image. the lens models predict that there should beadditional faint images of this second source component, and we find evidencefor one of the predicted images. the previously-observed large angular sizes oftwo of the five bright components are not intrinsic (which would have excludedthe possibility that they are lensed images), but are instead due to scatterbroadening. both the extended radio emission observed at low frequencies, andthe intrinsic image shapes observed at high frequencies, can be explained bythe lens models. the pair of lens galaxies is marginally detected in hstimages. the differential extinction of the quasar images suggests that theextreme red color of the quasar is at least partly due to dust in the lensgalaxies.

astro-ph;0302366	the quintuple quasar: mass models and interpretation	the strange morphology of the six-component gravitational lens pmn j0134-0931has resisted explanation. we present the first successful quantitative modelsfor the system, based on the idea that there are two lens galaxies and twocomponents of the background source. one source is quintuply imaged andcorresponds to the five brightest observed radio components. the other sourceis triply imaged and corresponds to the sixth component, along with two otherstoo faint to have been detected. the models reproduce the observed imagepositions and fluxes, and make falsifiable predictions about other propertiesof the system. some of these predictions have been confirmed by high-resolutionradio and optical observations, as described in the companion paper by winn etal. (2003). although we cannot determine the lens model uniquely with currentdata, we predict that the lens galaxies are spiral galaxies with roughly equalvelocity dispersions sigma~120km/s and a projected separation of only 0.4" (2/hkpc at z_l=0.76). this system is the first known lens with five images of asingle quasar, and the second with more than four images.

astro-ph;0312136	the central image of a gravitationally lensed quasar	a galaxy can act as a gravitational lens, producing multiple images of abackground object. theory predicts there should be an odd number of images but,paradoxically, almost all observed lenses have 2 or 4 images. the missing imageshould be faint and appear near the galaxy's center. these ``central images''have long been sought as probes of galactic cores too distant to resolve withordinary observations. there are five candidates, but in one case the thirdimage is not necessarily a central image, and in the others, the centralcomponent might be a foreground source rather than a lensed image. here wereport the most secure identification of a central image, based on radioobservations of pmn j1632-0033, one of the latter candidates. lens modelsincorporating the central image show that the mass of the lens galaxy's centralblack hole is less than 2 x 10^8 m_sun, and the galaxy's surface density at thelocation of the central image is more than 20,000 m_sun per square parsec, inagreement with expectations based on observations of galaxies hundreds of timescloser to the earth.

astro-ph;0504555	measurement of spin-orbit alignment in an extrasolar planetary system	we determine the stellar, planetary, and orbital properties of the transitingplanetary system hd 209458, through a joint analysis of high-precision radialvelocities, photometry, and timing of the secondary eclipse. of primaryinterest is the strong detection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, thealteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occultspart of the rotating surface of the star. we develop a new technique formodeling this effect, and use it to determine the inclination of the planetaryorbit relative to the apparent stellar equator [lambda = (-4.4 +/- 1.4)degrees], and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star [v*sin(i) = (4.70+/- 0.16) km/s]. the uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by anorder of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by queloz andcollaborators. the small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of theplanet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidalcoplanarization is larger than the age of the star. our determination ofv*sin(i) is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolatedfrom other broadening mechanisms.

astro-ph;0608071	prospects for the characterization and confirmation of transiting  exoplanets via the rossiter-mclaughlin effect	the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect is the distortion of stellar spectrallines that occurs during eclipses or transits, due to stellar rotation. weassess the future prospects for using the rm effect to measure the alignment ofplanetary orbits with the spin axes of their parent stars, and to confirmexoplanetary transits. we compute the achievable accuracy for the parameters ofinterest, in general and for the 5 known cases of transiting exoplanets withbright host stars. we determine the requirements for detecting the effects ofdifferential rotation. for transiting planets with small masses or long periods(as will be detected by forthcoming satellite missions), the velocity anomalyproduced by the rm effect can be much larger than the orbital velocity of thestar. for a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star foundby the kepler mission, it will be difficult to use the rm effect to confirmtransits with current instruments, but it still may be easier than measuringthe spectroscopic orbit.
