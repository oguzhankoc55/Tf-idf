0902.4701	the sins survey: modeling the dynamics of z~2 galaxies and the high-z  tully-fisher relation	we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forminggalaxies at z ~ 2 from halpha line emission. the galaxies are selected from thelarger sample of the sins survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotationalmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. the quality ofthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated byrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitableexponential disk models. we obtain a good correlation between the dynamicalmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions mgas~m*) arerequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. we use thederived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity vmax from the modeling toconstruct for the first time the stellar mass tully-fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lowerredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. we find that at z ~ 2.2there is an offset in log(m*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11with respect to the local universe. this result is consistent with thepredictions of the latest n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formationand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filamentsand cooling flows. this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidencefrom sins, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce theobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

0903.0313	stellar and molecular gas kinematics of ngc1097: inflow driven by a  nuclear spiral	we present spatially resolved distributions and kinematics of the stars andmolecular gas in the central 320pc of ngc1097. the stellar continuum confirmsthe previously reported 3-arm spiral pattern extending into the central 100pc.the stellar kinematics and the gas distribution imply this is a shadowingeffect due to extinction by gas and dust in the molecular spiral arms. themolecular gas kinematics show a strong residual (i.e. non-circular) velocity,which is manifested as a 2-arm kinematic spiral. linear models indicate thatthis is the line-of-sight velocity pattern expected for a density wave in gasthat generates a 3-arm spiral morphology. we estimate the inflow rate along thearms. using hydrodynamical models of nuclear spirals, we show that whenderiving the accretion rate into the central region, outflow in the disk planebetween the arms has to be taken into account. for ngc1097, despite the inflowrate along the arms being ~1.2msun/yr, the net gas accretion rate to thecentral few tens of parsecs is much smaller. the numerical models indicate thatthe inflow rate could be as little as ~0.06msun/yr. this is sufficient togenerate recurring starbursts, similar in scale to that observed, every20-150myr. the nuclear spiral represents a mechanism that can feed gas into thecentral parsecs of the galaxy, with the gas flow sustainable for timescales ofa gigayear.

0704.1374	a close look at star formation around active galactic nuclei	we analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 seyfert galaxies at spatialresolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than10pc in some objects. our data were taken mostly with the near infraredadaptive optics integral field spectrograph sinfoni. the stellar light profilestypically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. in two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. in thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300myr. the stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the agn in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. the surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}l_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4m_sun/pc^2. the intense starbursts were probably eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. the data hint at a delay of 50--100myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. we discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. while a significant mass is ejected by ob winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.on the other hand winds from agb stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

0907.4777	high-redshift star-forming galaxies: angular momentum and baryon  fraction, turbulent pressure effects and the origin of turbulence	the structure of a sample of high-redshift (z=2), rotating galaxies with highstar formation rates and turbulent gas velocities of sigma=40-80 km/s isinvestigated. fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with amo, mao, white (1998) (mmw) model requires unusually large disk spin parameterslambda_d&gt;0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmicbaryon fraction. the galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with1&lt;vmax/sigma&lt;3, maximum rotational velocities vmax&lt;200 km/s and disk half-lightradii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax&gt;200 km/s,vmax/sigma&gt;3 and rd=4-8 kpc. for the dispersion-dominated sample, radialpressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing therotational velocities. including this pressure effect in the mmw model,dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lflambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and withlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05. these values are in good agreement withcosmological expectations. for the rotation-dominated sample however pressureeffects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spinparameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in thevisible disk regime (2-3*rd) is smaller than predicted by the mmw model. weargue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matterhalos if the halos did not contract adiabatically in response to diskformation. it is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of thegalaxies are consistent with a toomre instability parameter q=1 which is equalto the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be themajor driver of turbulence. the dominant energy source of turbulence is thenthe potential energy of the gas in the disk.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

0912.1858	the impact of cold gas accretion above a mass floor on galaxy scaling  relations	using the cosmological baryonic accretion rate and normal star formationefficiencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies (sfgs)that accounts for the mass and redshift dependencies of the sfr-mass andtully-fisher relations from z=2 to the present. the time evolution follows fromthe fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the sfrfollows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. the key feature of the model is ahalo mass floor m_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order tosimultaneously account for the observed slopes of the sfr-mass andtully-fischer relations. the same successes cannot be achieved via astar-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the sf efficiency or thefeedback efficiency. combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due tovirial shock heating, the mass floor m_{min} explains galaxy "downsizing",where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.it turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon andgas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic sfr density fromz~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor m_{min}. the modelhelps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate thatdrives the decrease of cosmic sfr density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise ofthe cosmic sfr density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameterm_{min}~10^{11} solar masses. among the physical mechanisms that could beresponsible for the mass floor, we view that photo-ionization feedback (fromfirst in-situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efficiency is likely to play alarge role.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.3846	a first glimpse into the far-ir properties of high-z uv-selected  galaxies: herschel/pacs observations of z~3 lbgs	we present first insights into the far-ir properties for a sample of irac andmips-24um detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3, as derived fromobservations in the northern field of the great observatories origins survey(goods-n) carried out with the pacs instrument on board the herschel spaceobservatory. although none of our galaxies are detected by herschel, we employa stacking technique to construct, for the first time, the average spectralenergy distribution of infrared luminous lbgs from uv to radio wavelengths. wederive a median ir luminosity of l_{ir} = 1.6 x 10^12 lo, placing thepopulation in the class of ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs).complementing our study with existing multi-wavelength data, we put constraintson the dust temperature of the population and find that for their l_{ir},mips-lbgs are warmer than submm-luminous galaxies while they fall in the locusof the l_{ir}-t_{d} relation of the local ulirgs. this, along with estimatesbased on the average sed, explains the marginal detection of lbgs in currentsub-mm surveys and suggests that these latter studies introduce a bias towardsthe detection of colder ulirgs in the high-z universe, while missing high-zulirgs with warmer dust.

1104.5023	the role of secular evolution in the black hole growth of narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxies	narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies show extreme properties with respect tothe other seyfert galaxies. indeed, they are thought to be accreting ateddington rates and to possess low mass black holes. therefore, they mayrepresent a key class of objects for understanding the co-evolution of blackholes and their host galaxies. we propose that nls1s represent a class of agnin which the black hole growth is, and has always been, dominated by secularevolution. firstly, by looking at the nls1 host galaxy properties in theliterature, we show that the evolution of nls1s is presently driven by secularprocesses, much more so than for broad-line seyfert 1s (bls1s). secondly, westudy the bulges of nls1 and bls1 galaxies. our results demonstrate that nls1host bulges are pseudo-bulges and are statistically different from bls1 bulges.this difference points to the particular importance of secular processes in thepast evolution of their hosts. we build on this result to understand theimplications on their evolution and the duration of their duty cycle. we showthat nls1s are not necessarily in a special phase of black hole growth and thatseveral gyr are required for their black hole masses to become similar tobls1s. finally, in the light of our results, we discuss the location of nls1galaxies on the mbh-\sigma plane and speculate about the connection between thenls1 galaxy properties and their black hole spin.

1105.1731	massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in ulirgs observed by  herschel-pacs	mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei are a key element inmany current models of galaxy evolution. they may produce the observed blackhole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in thehost galaxy and black hole accretion. however, observational evidence of suchfeedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star forming moleculargas is still scarce. here we report the detection of massive molecularoutflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (oh), in far-infrared spectra ofulirgs obtained with herschel-pacs as part of the shining key project. in someof these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km/s, and theiroutflow rates (up to ~1200 m_sol/yr) are several times larger than their starformation rates. we compare the outflow signatures in different types of ulirgsand in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (agn orstarburst) of these outflows. we report preliminary evidence that ulirgs with ahigher agn luminosity (and higher agn contribution to l_ir) have higherterminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales. the outflows in theobserved ulirgs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres ofthese objects within ~1e6-1e8 years.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1107.4618	enriched haloes at redshift $z=2$ with no star-formation: implications  for accretion and wind scenarios	[abridged] in order to understand which process (e.g. galactic winds, coldaccretion) is responsible for the cool (t~10^4 k) halo gas around galaxies, weembarked on a program to study the star-formation properties of galaxiesselected by their mgii absorption signature in quasar spectra. specifically, wesearched for the h-alpha line emission from galaxies near very strong z=2 mgiiabsorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width ew&gt;2 \aa) because these could bethe sign-posts of outflows or inflows. surprisingly, we detect h-alpha fromonly 4 hosts out of 20 sight-lines (and 2 out of the 19 hi-selectedsight-lines), despite reaching a star-formation rate (sfr) sensitivity limit of2.9 m/yr (5-sigma) for a chabrier initial mass function. this low success rateis in contrast with our z=1 survey where we detected 66%\ (14/21) of the mgiihosts. taking into account the difference in sensitivity between the twosurveys, we should have been able to detect &gt;11.4 of the 20 z=2 hosts whereaswe found only 4 galaxies. interestingly, all the z=2 detected hosts haveobserved sfr greater than 9 m/yr, well above our sensitivity limit, while atz=1 they all have sfr less than 9 m/yr, an evolution that is in good agreementwith the evolution of the sfr main sequence. moreover, we show that the z=2undetected hosts are not hidden under the quasar continuum after stacking ourdata and that they also cannot be outside our surveyed area. hence, strong mgiiabsorbers could trace star-formation driven winds in low-mass halos (mhalo &lt;10^{10.6} msun). alternatively, our results imply that z=2 galaxies traced bystrong mgii absorbers do not form stars at a rate expected (3--10 m/yr) fortheir (halo or stellar) masses, supporting the existence of a transition inaccretion efficiency at mhalo ~ 10^{11} msun. this scenario can explain boththe detections and the non-detections.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1202.5746	herschel-pacs observations of far-ir co line emission in ngc 1068:  highly excited molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk	we report the detection of far-ir co rotational emission from theprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. using herschel-pacs, we have detected11 transitions in the j_upper=14-30 (e_upper/k_b = 580-2565 k) range, all ofwhich are consistent with arising from within the central 10" (700 pc). thedetected transitions are modeled as arising from 2 different components: amoderate excitation (me) component close to the galaxy systemic velocity, and ahigh excitation (he) component that is blueshifted by ~80 km s^{-1}. we employa large velocity gradient (lvg) model and derive n_h2~10^{5.6} cm^{-3},t_kin~170 k, and m_h2~10^{6.7} m_sun for the me component, and n_h2~10^{6.4}cm^{-3}, t_kin~570 k, and m_h2~10^{5.6} m_sun for the he component, althoughfor both components the uncertainties in the density and mass are plus/minus(0.6-0.9) dex. we compare the co line profiles with those of other moleculartracers observed at higher spatial and spectral resolution, and find that theme transitions are consistent with these lines arising in the ~200 pc diameterring of material traced by h_2 1-0 s(1) observations. the blueshift of the helines may also be consistent with the bluest regions of this h_2 ring, but abetter kinematic match is found with a clump of infalling gas ~40 pc north ofthe agn. we discuss the prospects of placing the he component near the agn, andconclude that while the moderate thermal pressure precludes an association withthe ~1 pc radius h_2o maser disk, the he component could potentially be locatedonly a few parsecs more distant from the agn, and might then provide then_h~10^{25} cm^{-2} column obscuring the nuclear hard x-rays. finally, we alsoreport sensitive upper limits extending up to j_upper=50, which placeconstraints on a previous model prediction for the co emission from the x-rayobscuring torus.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1211.5064	excited oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220	we report on herschel/pacs observations of absorption lines of oh+, h2o+ andh3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220. excited lines of oh+ and h2o+ with e_lower of atleast 285 and \sim200 k, respectively, are detected in both sources, indicatingradiative pumping and location in the high radiation density environment of thenuclear regions. abundance ratios oh+/h2o+ of 1-2.5 are estimated in the nucleiof both sources. the inferred oh+ column and abundance relative to h nuclei are(0.5-1)x10^{16} cm-2 and \sim2x10^{-8}, respectively. additionally, in arp 220,an extended low excitation component around the nuclear region is found to haveoh+/h2o+\sim5-10. h3o+ is detected in both sources withn(h3o+)\sim(0.5-2)x10^{16} cm-2, and in arp 220 the pure inversion, metastablelines indicate a high rotational temperature of ~500 k, indicative of formationpumping and/or hot gas. simple chemical models favor an ionization sequencedominated by h+ - o+ - oh+ - h2o+ - h3o+, and we also argue that the h+production is most likely dominated by x-ray/cosmic ray ionization. the fullset of observations and models leads us to propose that the molecular ionsarise in a relatively low density (\gtrsim10^4 cm-3) interclump medium, inwhich case the ionization rate per h nucleus (including secondary ionizations)is zeta&gt;10^{-13} s-1, a lower limit that is severalx10^2 times the highest rateestimates for galactic regions. in arp 220, our lower limit for zeta iscompatible with estimates for the cosmic ray energy density inferred previouslyfrom the supernova rate and synchrotron radio emission, and also with theexpected ionization rate produced by x-rays. in ngc 4418, we argue that x-rayionization due to an agn is responsible for the molecular ion production.

1212.2401	the surprising absence of absorption in the far-ultraviolet spectrum of  mrk 231	mrk 231, the nearest (z = 0.0422) quasar, hosts both a galactic-scale windand a nuclear-scale iron low-ionization broad absorption line (felobal)outflow. we recently obtained a far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectrum of this objectcovering ~1150 - 1470 a with the cosmic origins spectrograph on board thehubble space telescope. this spectrum is highly peculiar, highlighted by thepresence of faint (~&lt; 2% of predictions based on h-alpha), broad (&gt;~ 10,000km/s at the base), and highly blueshifted (centroid at ~ -3500 km/s) ly-alphaemission. the fuv continuum emission is slightly declining at shorterwavelengths (consistent with f_lambda ~ lambda^1.7) and does not show thepresence of any obvious photospheric or wind stellar features. surprisingly,the fuv spectrum also does not show any unambiguous broad absorption features.it thus appears to be dominated by the agn, rather than hot stars, andvirtually unfiltered by the dusty felobal screen. the observed ly-alphaemission is best explained if it is produced in the outflowing bal cloudsystem, while the balmer lines arise primarily from the standard broad emissionline region seen through the dusty (a_v ~ 7 mag.) broad absorption line region.two possible geometric models are discussed in the context of these newresults.

1302.1202	nuclear activity is more prevalent in star-forming galaxies	we explore the question of whether low and moderate luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially found in galaxies that are undergoinga transition from active star formation to quiescence. this notion has beensuggested by studies of the uv-to-optical colors of agn hosts, which find themto be common among galaxies in the so-called "green valley", a region of galaxycolor space believed to be composed mostly of galaxies undergoingstar-formation quenching. combining the deepest current x-ray and herschel.pacs far-infrared (fir) observations of the two chandra deep fields (cdfs) withredshifts, stellar masses and rest-frame photometry derived from the extensiveand uniform multi-wavelength data in these fields, we compare the rest-frameu-v color distributions and sfr distributions of agns and carefully constructedsamples of inactive control galaxies. the uv-to-optical colors of agns areconsistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z~2, butwe show that such colors are poor tracers of star formation. while the firdistributions of both star-forming agns and star-forming inactive galaxies arestatistically similar, we show that agns are preferentially found instar-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, agns are less likely to befound in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. we postulate that, amongx-ray selected agns of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply ofcold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclearblack holes.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1410.0006	high-j co sleds in nearby infrared bright galaxies observed by  herschel-pacs	we report the detection of far-infrared (fir) co rotational emission fromnearby active galactic nuclei (agn) and starburst galaxies, as well as severalmerging systems and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). usingherschel-pacs, we have detected transitions in the j$_{upp}$ = 14 - 20 range($\lambda \sim$ 130 - 185 $\mu$m, $\nu \sim$ 1612 - 2300 ghz) with upper limitson (and in two cases, detections of) co line fluxes up to j$_{upp}$ = 30. thepacs co data obtained here provide the first well-sampled fir extragalactic cosleds for this range, and will be an essential reference for future highredshift studies. we find a large range in the overall sled shape, even amongstgalaxies of similar type, demonstrating the uncertainties in relying solely onhigh-j co diagnostics to characterize the excitation source of a galaxy.  combining our data with low-j line intensities taken from the literature, wepresent a co ratio-ratio diagram and discuss its potential diagnostic value indistinguishing excitation sources and physical properties of the molecular gas.the position of a galaxy on such a diagram is less a signature of itsexcitation mechanism, than an indicator of the presence (or absence) of warm,dense molecular gas. we then quantitatively analyze the co emission from asubset of the detected sources with large velocity gradient (lvg) radiativetransfer models to fit the co sleds. using both single-component andtwo-component lvg models to fit the kinetic temperature, velocity gradient,number density and column density of the gas, we derive the molecular gas massand the corresponding co-to-h$_2$ conversion factor, $\alpha_{co}$, for eachrespective source. for the ulirgs we find $\alpha$ values in the canonicalrange 0.4 - 5 m$_\odot$/(k kms$^{-1}$pc$^2$), while for the other objects,$\alpha$ varies between 0.2 and 14.} finally, we compare our best-fit lvg model..

1504.01104	obscuration in agns: near-infrared luminosity relations and dust colors	we combine two approaches to isolate the agn luminosity at near-infraredwavelengths and relate the near-ir pure agn luminosity to other tracers of theagn. using integral-field spectroscopic data of an archival sample of 51 localagns, we estimate the fraction of non-stellar light by comparing the nuclearequivalent width of the stellar 2.3 micron co absorption feature with theintrinsic value for each galaxy. we compare this fraction to that derived froma spectral decomposition of the integrated light in the central arc second andfind them to be consistent with each other. using our estimates of the near-iragn light, we find a strong correlation with presumably isotropic agn tracers.we show that a significant offset exists between type 1 and type 2 sources inthe sense that type 1 sources are 7 (10) times brighter in the near-ir at logl_mir = 42.5 (log l_x = 42.5). these offsets only becomes clear when treatinginfrared type 1 sources as type 1 agns.  all agns have very red near-to-mid-ir dust colors. this, as well as the rangeof observed near-ir temperatures, can be explained with a simple model withonly two free parameters: the obscuration to the hot dust and the ratio betweenthe warm and hot dust areas. we find obscurations of a_v (hot) = 5 - 15 mag forinfrared type 1 sources and a_v (hot) = 15 - 35 mag for type 2 sources. theratio of hot dust to warm dust areas of about 1000 is nicely consistent withthe ratio of radii of the respective regions as found by infraredinterferometry.

1505.00536	insights on the dusty torus and neutral torus from optical and x-ray  obscuration in a complete volume limited hard x-ray agn sample	we describe a complete volume limited sample of nearby active galaxiesselected by their 14-195kev luminosity, and outline its rationale for studyingthe mechanisms regulating gas inflow and outflow. we describe also acomplementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the agn hostgalaxy properties. the active sample appears to have no bias in terms of agntype, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is twoorders of magnitude greater for the seyfert 2s. in the luminosity range spannedby the sample, log l_{14-195kev} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscuredand x-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65%. the similarity of these fractions tomore distant spectroscopic agn samples, although over a limited luminosityrange, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. oursample confirms that x-ray unabsorbed seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not morethan a few percent of the seyfert 2 population. at higher luminosities, theoptically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dustsublimation radius), but the x-ray absorbed fraction changes little. we arguethat the cold x-ray absorption in these seyfert 1s can be accounted for byneutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (blr)emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-existswith the blr and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.

1508.07165	a deep herschel/pacs observation of co(40-39) in ngc 1068: a search for  the molecular torus	emission from high-j co lines in galaxies has long been proposed as a tracerof x-ray dominated regions (xdrs) produced by agn. of particular interest isthe question of whether the obscuring torus, which is required by agnunification models, can be observed via high-j co cooling lines. here we reporton the analysis of a deep herschel-pacs observation of an extremely high j cotransition (40-39) in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. the line was not detected,with a derived 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $2 \times10^{-17}\,\text{w}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. we apply an xdr model in order toinvestigate whether the upper limit constrains the properties of a moleculartorus in ngc 1068. the xdr model predicts the co spectral line energydistributions for various gas densities and illuminating x-ray fluxes. in ourmodel, the co(40-39) upper limit is matched by gas with densities $\sim10^{6}-10^{7}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, located at $1.6-5\,\text{pc}$ from the agn,with column densities of at least $10^{25}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. at such highcolumn densities, however, dust absorbs most of the co(40-39) line emission at$\lambda = 65.69\, \mu$m. therefore, even if ngc 1068 has a molecular toruswhich radiates in the co(40-39) line, the dust can attenuate the line emissionto below the pacs detection limit. the upper limit is thus consistent with theexistence of a molecular torus in ngc 1068. in general, we expect that theco(40-39) is observable in only a few agn nuclei (if at all), because of therequired high gas column density, and absorption by dust.

astro-ph;0201104	properties of mm galaxies: constraints from k-band blank fields	we have used the iram plateau de bure mm interferometer to locate withsubarcsecond accuracy the dust emission of three of the brightest 1.2mm sourcesin the ntt deep field (ndf) selected from our 1.2mm mambo survey at the iram30m telescope. we combine these results with deep b to k imaging and vlainterferometry. strikingly, none of the three accurately located mm galaxiesmmj120546-0741.5, mmj120539-0745.4, and mmj120517-0743.1 has a k-bandcounterpart down to the faint limit of k&gt;21.9. this implies that these threegalaxies are either extremely obscured and/or are at very high redshifts(z&gt;~4). we combine our results with literature data for 11 more (sub)mmgalaxies that are identified with similar reliability. in terms of their k-bandproperties, the sample divides into three roughly equal groups: (i) undetectedto k~22, (ii) detected in the near-infrared but not the optical and (iii)detected in the optical with the possibility of optical follow-up spectroscopy.we find a trend in this sample between near-infrared to submm and submm toradio spectral indices, which in comparison to spectral energy distributions(seds) of low redshift infrared luminous galaxies suggests that the mostplausible primary factor causing the extreme near-infrared faintness of ourobjects is their high redshift. we show that the near-infrared to radio seds ofthe sample are inconsistent with seds that resemble local far-infrared coolgalaxies with moderate luminosities, which were proposed in some models of thesubmm sky. we briefly discuss the implications of the results for ourunderstanding of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0310681	the nuclear gas dynamics and star formation of ngc 7469	we report interferometric radio co2-1 observations at a resolution of 0.7",and 0.085" resolution adaptive optics k-band spectroscopy of the inner fewarcseconds of ngc7469. the co2-1 map shows a ring of molecular clouds and abright extended nucleus, with a bar or pair of spiral arms between them. thedynamical structure of both the radio co2-1 and the k-band h2 1-0s(1) lines canbe reproduced using an axisymmetric mass model comprising 3 components: a broaddisk, a ring 4-5" across, and an inner nuclear ring about 0.5" across. nonon-circular motions faster than the velocity residuals of 25 km/s are seen,although this may be because in some cases a secondary bar is not expected tocause gas inflow. from the dynamical mass and estimates of the stellar mass wefind that the co-to-h_2 conversion is 0.4-0.8 times that for the milky way. theh2 1-0s(1) morphology peaks at the nucleus, although there is no strong nuclearmass concentration. the 1-0s(1) is likely to originate in x-ray of gas by theagn rather than via star formation. using the 2.3um stellar co2-0 absorptionand the continuum slope we have directly resolved the nuclear star cluster tobe 0.15-0.20" across, and find that it is asymmetric. this cluster has an ageof less than about 60myr and contributes 20-30% of the nuclear k-band light,and about 10% of the nuclear bolometric luminosity. within a radius of ~4" gascontributes more than half the total mass; but in the nucleus, within a radiusof 0.1", it is likely that most of the mass is due to stars
