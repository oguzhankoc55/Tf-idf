0903.5166	jets from black hole x-ray binaries: testing, refining and extending  empirical models for the coupling to x-rays	in this paper we study the relation of radio emission to x-ray spectral andvariability properties for a large sample of black hole x-ray binary systems.this is done to test, refine and extend -- notably into the timing properties-- the previously published `unified model' for the coupling of accretion andejection in such sources. in 14 outbursts from 11 different sources we findthat in every case the peak radio flux, on occasion directly resolved intodiscrete relativistic ejections, is associated with the bright hard to softstate transition near the peak of the outburst. we also note the association ofthe radio flaring with periods of x-ray flaring during this transition in most,but not all, of the systems. in the soft state, radio emission is in nearly allcases either undetectable or optically thin, consistent with the suppression ofthe core jet in these states and `relic' radio emission from interactions ofpreviously ejected material and the ambient medium. however, these data cannotrule out an intermittent, optically thin, jet in the soft state. in attemptingto associate x-ray timing properties with the ejection events we find a close,but not exact, correspondence between phases of very low integrated x-rayvariability and such ejections. in summary we find no strong evidence againstthe originally proposed model, confirming and extending some aspects of it witha much larger sample, but note that several aspects remain poorly tested.(abridged)

0908.2451	the evolution of the high-energy cut-off in the x-ray spectrum of the gx  339-4 across a hard-to-soft transition	we report on x-ray observations of the black-hole candidate gx 339-4 duringits 2006/2007 outburst. the hardness-intensity diagram of all rxte/pca datacombined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.the evolution through the hid suggests that in the early phase of the outburstthe source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the softstate, which is supported by our timing analysis. broadband (4-200 kev)spectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hardspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the softstate. the high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 kev duringthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 kev during thesoftening in the hard intermediate state. in the short-lived soft intermediatestate the cutoff energy was ~ 130 kev, but was no longer detected in the softstate. this is one of the first times that the high-energy cut-off has beenfollowed in such detail across several state transitions. we find that incomparison to several other spectral parameters, the cut-off energy changesmore rapidly, just like the timing properties. the observed behaviour of thehigh energy cutoff of gx 339-4 is also similar to that observed withrxte-integral-swift during the 2005 outburst of gro j1655-40. these resultsconstitute a valuable reference to be considered when testing theoreticalmodels for the production of the hard component in these systems.

0909.2632	following the 2008 outburst decay of the black hole candidate h1743-322  in x-ray and radio	in this paper we report on radio (vla and atca) and x-ray (rxte, chandra andswift) observations of the outburst decay of the transient black hole candidateh1743-322 in early 2008. we find that the x-ray light curve followed anexponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. the exponentialdecay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosityof 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. this together with the relation betweenquiescent x-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literaturesuggests that h1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. both theradio and x-ray light curve show evidence for flares. the radio - x-raycorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. this is muchlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black holetransients before. the radio spectral index measured during one of the radioflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, whichindicates that the radio emission is optically thin. this is unlike what hasbeen found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. we attribute theradio flares and the low index for the radio - x-ray correlation to thepresence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection eventsearlier in the outburst. we find no evidence for a change in x-ray power lawspectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of n_h=2.3x10^22 cm^-2 limits the detected number of soft photons and thus theaccuracy of the spectral fits.

1007.0247	further x-ray observations of exo 0748-676 in quiescence: evidence for a  cooling neutron star crust	in late 2008, the quasi-persistent neutron star x-ray transient and eclipsingbinary exo 0748-676 started a transition from outburst to quiescence, after ithad been actively accreting for more than 24 years. in a previous work, wediscussed chandra and swift observations obtained during the first five monthsafter this transition. here, we report on further x-ray observations of exo0748-676, extending the quiescent monitoring to 1.6 years. chandra andxmm-newton data reveal quiescent x-ray spectra composed of a soft, thermalcomponent that is well-fitted by a neutron star atmosphere model. an additionalhard powerlaw tail is detected that changes non-monotonically over time,contributing between 4 and 20 percent to the total unabsorbed 0.5-10 kev flux.the combined set of chandra, xmm-newton and swift data reveals that the thermalbolometric luminosity fades from ~1e34 to 6e33 (d/7.4 kpc)^2 erg/s, whereas theinferred neutron star effective temperature decreases from ~124 to 109 ev. weinterpret the observed decay as cooling of the neutron star crust and show thatthe fractional quiescent temperature change of exo 0748-676 is markedly smallerthan observed for three other neutron star x-ray binaries that underwentprolonged accretion outbursts.

0708.2296	linking jet emission, x-ray states and hard x-ray tails in the neutron  star x-ray binary gx 17+2	we present the results from simultaneous radio (very large array) and x-ray(rossi-x-ray timing explorer) observations of the z-type neutron star x-raybinary gx~17+2. the aim is to assess the coupling between x-ray and radioproperties throughout its three rapidly variable x-ray states and during thetime-resolved transitions. these observations allow us, for the first time, toinvestigate quantitatively the possible relations between the radio emissionand the presence of the hard x-ray tails and the x-ray state of the source. theobservations show: 1) a coupling between the radio jet emission and the x-raystate of the source, i.e. the position in the x-ray hardness-intensity diagram(hid); 2) a coupling between the presence of a hard x-ray tail and the positionin the hid, qualitatively similar to that found for the radio emission; 3) anindication for a quantitative positive correlation between the radio fluxdensity and the x-ray flux in the hard-tail power law component; 4) evidencefor the formation of a radio jet associated with the flaring branch-to-normalbranch x-ray state transition; 5) that the radio flux density of thenewly-formed jet stabilizes when also the normal-branch oscillation (nbo) inthe x-ray power spectrum stabilizes its characteristic frequency, suggesting apossible relation between x-ray variability associated to the nbo and the jetformation. we discuss our results in the context of jet models.

1104.3423	x-ray softening in the new x-ray transient xte j1719-291 during its 2008  outburst decay	the x-ray transient xte j1719-291 was discovered with rxte/pca during itsoutburst in 2008 march, which lasted at least 46 days. its 2-10 kev peakluminosity is 7e35 erg/s assuming a distance of 8 kpc, which classifies thesystem as a very faint x-ray transient. the outburst was monitored with swift,rxte, chandra and xmm-newton. we analysed the x-ray spectral evolution duringthe outburst. we fitted the overall data with a simple power-law modelcorrected for absorption and found that the spectrum softened with decreasingluminosity. however, the xmm-newton spectrum can not be fitted with a simpleone-component model, but it can be fitted with a thermal component (black bodyor disc black body) plus power-law model affected by absorption. therefore, thesoftening of the x-ray spectrum with decreasing x-ray luminosity might be dueto a change in photon index or alternatively it might be due to a change in theproperties of the soft component. assuming that the system is an x-ray binary,we estimated a long-term time-averaged mass accretion rate of ~ 7.7e-13m_sun/yr for a neutron star as compact object and ~ 3.7e10-13 m_sun/yr in thecase of a black hole. although no conclusive evidence is available about thenature of the accretor, based on the x-ray/optical luminosity ratio wetentatively suggest that a neutron star is present in this system.

1108.0540	low frequency oscillations in black holes: a spectral-timing approach to  the case of gx 339-4	we analyzed rxte/pca and hexte data of the transient black hole binary gx339-4, col- lected over a time span of eight years. we studied the propertiesand the behavior of low frequency quasi periodic oscillations (qpos) as afunction of the integrated broad-band variability and the spectral parametersduring four outbursts (2002, 2004, 2007, 2010). most of the qpos could beclassified following the abc classification that has been proposed before. ourresults show that the abc classification can be extended to include spectraldependencies and that the three qpo types have indeed intrinsically differentproperties. in terms of the relation between qpo frequency and power-law flux,type-a and -c qpos may follow the same relation, whereas the type-b qpos traceout a very different relation. type-b qpo frequencies clearly correlate withthe powerlaw-flux and are connected to local increases of the count rate. thefrequency of all qpos observed in the rising phase of the 2002, 2007 and 2010outburst correlate with the disk flux. our results can be interpreted withinthe framework of recently proposed qpo models involving lense-thirringprecession. we suggest that type- c and -a qpos might be connected and could beinterpreted as being the result of the same phenomenon observed at differentstages of the outburst evolution, while a different physical process producestype-b qpos.

1109.3654	a late jet rebrightening revealed from multi-wavelength monitoring of  the black hole candidate xte j1752-223	we present optical monitoring of the black hole candidate xte j1752-223during its 2009 - 2010 outburst and decay to quiescence. the optical lightcurve can be described by an exponential decay followed by a plateau, then amore rapid fade towards quiescence. the plateau appears to be due to an extracomponent of optical emission that brightens and then fades over ~ 40 days. weshow evidence for the origin of this optical 'flare' to be the synchrotron jetduring the decaying hard state, and we identify and isolate both disc and jetcomponents in the spectral energy distributions. the optical flare has the samemorphology and amplitude as a contemporaneous x-ray rebrightening. thissuggests a common origin, but no firm conclusions can be made favouring ordisfavouring the jet producing the x-ray flare. the quiescent opticalmagnitudes are b &gt;= 20.6, v &gt;= 21.1, r &gt;= 19.5, i' &gt;= 19.2. from the opticaloutburst amplitude we estimate a likely orbital period of &lt; 22 h. we alsopresent near-infrared (nir) photometry and polarimetry and rare mid-infraredimaging (8 - 12 microns) when the source is nearing quiescence. the fading jetcomponent, and possibly the companion star may contribute to the nir flux. wederive deep mid-ir flux upper limits and nir linear polarization upper limits.with the inclusion of radio data, we measure an almost flat jet spectral indexbetween radio and optical; f_nu ~ nu^(~ +0.05). the data favour the jet breakto optically thin emission to reside in the infrared, but may shift tofrequencies as high as the optical or uv during the peak of the flare.

1204.5840	maxi j1659-152: the shortest orbital period black-hole transient in  outburst	maxi j1659-152 is a bright x-ray transient black-hole candidate binary systemdiscovered in september 2010. we report here on maxi, rxte, swift, andxmm-newton observations during its 2010/2011 outburst. we find that during thefirst one and a half week of the outburst the x-ray light curves display dropsin intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. aboutthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. these dipshave, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips,and are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transitiondips). the absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414+/-0.005 hrs, which weinterpret as the orbital period of the system. this implies that maxi j1659-152is the shortest period black-hole candidate binary known to date. theinclination of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight isestimated to be 65-80 degrees. we propose the companion to the black-holecandidate to be close to an m5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of about0.15-0.25 m_sun and 0.2-0.25 r_sun, respectively. we derive that the companionhad an initial mass of about 1.5 m_sun, which evolved to its current mass inabout 5-6 billion years. the system is rather compact (orbital separation oflarger than ~1.33 r_sun), and is located at a distance of 8.6+/-3.7 kpc, with aheight above the galactic plane of 2.4+/-1.0 kpc. the characteristics of shortorbital period and high galactic scale height are shared with two othertransient black-hole candidate x-ray binaries, i.e., xte j1118+480 and swiftj1735.5-0127. we suggest that all three are kicked out of the galactic planeinto the halo, rather than being formed in a globular cluster.

1210.2949	superexpansion as a possible probe of accretion in 4u 1820-30	the ultracompact x-ray binary 4u 1820-30 is well known for its ~170-dsuperorbital modulation in x-ray flux and spectrum, and the exclusiveness ofbursting behavior to the low hard 'island' state. in may-june 2009, there wasan exceptionally long 51-d low state. this state was well covered by x-rayobservations and 12 bursts were detected, 9 with the high-throughput rxte. weinvestigate the character of these x-ray bursts and find an interesting changein their photospheric expansion behavior. at the lowest inferred mass accretionrates, this expansion becomes very large in 4 bursts and reaches the so-calledsuperexpansion regime. we speculate that this is due to the geometry of theinner accretion flow being spherical and a decreasing accretion rate: when theflow geometry nearest to the neutron star is spherical and the accretion rateis low, the ram pressure of the accretion disk may become too low to counteractthat of the photospheric expansion. in effect, this may provide a novel meansto probe the accretion flow. additionally, we observe a peculiar effect: thewell-known cessation of x-ray bursts in the high state is too quick to beconsistent with a transition to stable helium burning. we suggest analternative explanation, that the cessation is due to the introduction of anon-nuclear heat source in the neutron star ocean.

1211.1655	jet spectral breaks in black hole x-ray binaries	in x-ray binaries, compact jets are known to commonly radiate at radio toinfrared frequencies, whereas at optical to gamma-ray energies, thecontribution of the jet is debated. the total luminosity, and hence power ofthe jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum,between optically thick (self-absorbed) and optically thin synchrotronemission. this break, or turnover, has been reported in just one black holex-ray binary (bhxb) thus far, gx 339-4, and inferred via spectral fitting intwo others, a0620-00 and cyg x-1. here, we collect a wealth of multiwavelengthdata from the outbursts of bhxbs during hard x-ray states, in order to searchfor jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions. inparticular, we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum ofv404 cyg during its 1989 outburst, at nu_b = (1.8 +- 0.3) x 10^14 hz (1.7 +-0.2 microns). we increase the number of bhxbs with measured jet breaks fromthree to eight. jet breaks are found at frequencies spanning more than twoorders of magnitude, from nu_b = (4.5 +- 0.8) x 10^12 hz for xte j1118+480during its 2005 outburst, to nu_b &gt; 4.7 x 10^14 hz for v4641 sgr in outburst. apositive correlation between jet break frequency and luminosity is expectedtheoretically; nu_b \propto l_nu,jet^~0.5 if other parameters are constant.with constraints on the jet break in a total of 12 bhxbs including twoquiescent systems, we find a large range of jet break frequencies at similarluminosities and no obvious global relation (but such a relation cannot beruled out for individual sources). we speculate that different magnetic fieldstrengths and/or different radii of the acceleration zone in the inner regionsof the jet are likely to be responsible for the observed scatter betweensources.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

1306.1776	a change in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of the neutron star low-mass  x-ray binary mxb 1659-29	the quasi-persistent neutron star low-mass x-ray binary mxb 1659-29 went intoquiescence in 2001, and we have followed its quiescent x-ray evolution since.observations over the first 4 years showed a rapid drop in flux and temperatureof the neutron star atmosphere, interpreted as cooling of the neutron starcrust which had been heated during the 2.5 year outburst. however, observationstaken approximately 1400 and 2400 days into quiescence were consistent witheach other, suggesting the crust had reached thermal equilibrium with the core.here we present a new chandra observation of mxb 1659-29 taken 11 years intoquiescence and 4 years since the last chandra observation. this new observationshows an unexpected factor of ~3 drop in count rate and change in spectralshape since the last observation, which cannot be explained simply by continuedcooling. two possible scenarios are that either the neutron star temperaturehas remained unchanged and there has been an increase in the column density,or, alternatively the neutron star temperature has dropped precipitously andthe spectrum is now dominated by a power-law component. the first scenario maybe possible given that mxb 1659-29 is a near edge-on system, and an increase incolumn density could be due to build-up of material in, and a thickening of, atruncated accretion disk during quiescence. but, a large change in disk heightmay not be plausible if standard accretion disk theory holds during quiescence.alternatively, the disk may be precessing, leading to a higher column densityduring this latest observation.

1306.2345	continued neutron star crust cooling of the 11 hz x-ray pulsar in terzan  5: a challenge to heating and cooling models?	the transient neutron star low-mass x-ray binary and 11 hz x-ray pulsar igrj17480-2446 in the globular cluster terzan 5 exhibited an 11-week accretionoutburst in 2010. chandra observations performed within five months after theend of the outburst revealed evidence that the crust of the neutron star becamesubstantially heated during the accretion episode and was subsequently coolingin quiescence. this provides the rare opportunity to probe the structure andcomposition of the crust. here, we report on new chandra observations of terzan5 that extend the monitoring to ~2.2 yr into quiescence. we find that thethermal flux and neutron star temperature have continued to decrease, butremain significantly above the values that were measured before the 2010accretion phase. this suggests that the crust has not thermally relaxed yet,and may continue to cool. such behavior is difficult to explain within ourcurrent understanding of heating and cooling of transiently accreting neutronstars. alternatively, the quiescent emission may have settled at a higherobserved equilibrium level (for the same interior temperature), in which casethe neutron star crust may have fully cooled.

1308.4332	broadband monitoring tracing the evolution of the jet and disk in the  black hole candidate x-ray binary maxi j1659-152	maxi j1659-152 was discovered on 2010 september 25 as a new x-ray transient,initially identified as a gamma-ray burst, but was later shown to be a newx-ray binary with a black hole as the most likely compact object. dips in thex-ray light curves have revealed that maxi j1659-152 is the shortest periodblack hole candidate identified to date. here we present the results of a largeobserving campaign at radio, sub-millimeter, near-infrared (nir), optical andultraviolet (uv) wavelengths. we have combined this very rich data set with theavailable x-ray observations to compile a broadband picture of the evolution ofthis outburst. we have performed broadband spectral modeling, demonstrating thepresence of a spectral break at radio frequencies and a relationship betweenthe radio spectrum and x-ray states. also, we have determined physicalparameters of the accretion disk and put them into context with respect to theother parameters of the binary system. finally, we have investigated theradio-x-ray and nir/optical/uv-x-ray correlations up to ~3 years after theoutburst onset to examine the link between the jet and the accretion disk, andfound that there is no significant jet contribution to the nir emission whenthe source is in the soft or intermediate x-ray spectral state, consistent withour detection of the jet break at radio frequencies during these states.

1403.2385	probing the crust of the neutron star in exo 0748-676	x-ray observations of quiescent x-ray binaries have the potential to provideinsight into the structure and the composition of neutron stars. exo 0748-676had been actively accreting for over 24 yr before its outburst ceased in late2008. subsequent x-ray monitoring revealed a gradual decay of the quiescentthermal emission that can be attributed to cooling of the accretion-heatedneutron star crust. in this work, we report on new chandra and swiftobservations that extend the quiescent monitoring to ~5 yr post-outburst. wefind that the neutron star temperature remained at ~117 ev between 2009 and2011, but had decreased to ~110 ev in 2013. this suggests that the crust hasnot fully cooled yet, which is supported by the lower temperature of ~95 evthat was measured ~4 yr prior to the accretion phase in 1980. comparing thedata to thermal evolution simulations reveals that the apparent lack of coolingbetween 2009 and 2011 could possibly be a signature of convection driven byphase separation of light and heavy nuclei in the outer layers of the neutronstar.

0802.3882	initial measurements of black hole spin in gx 339-4 from suzaku  spectroscopy	we report on a deep suzaku observation of the stellar-mass black hole gx339-4 in outburst. a clear, strong, relativistically-shaped iron emission linefrom the inner accretion disk is observed. the broad-band disk reflectionspectrum revealed is one of the most sensitive yet obtained from an accretingblack hole. we fit the suzaku spectra with a physically-motivated diskreflection model, blurred by a new relativistic line function in which theblack hole spin parameter is a variable. this procedure yielded a black holespin parameter of a = 0.89 +/- 0.04. joint modeling of these suzaku spectra andprior xmm-newton spectra obtained in two different outburst phases yields aspin parameter of a = 0.93 +/- 0.01. the degree of consistency between theseresults suggests that disk reflection models allow for spin measurements thatare not strongly biased by scattering effects. we suggest that the best valueof the black hole spin parameter is a = 0.93 +/- 0.01 (statistical) +/- 0.04(systematic). although preliminary, these results represent the first directmeasurement of non-zero spin in a stellar-mass black hole using relativisticline modeling.

0804.3445	bright flares from the x-ray pulsar swift j1626.6-5156	we have performed a timing and spectral analysis of the x-ray pulsar swiftj1626.6-5156 during a major x-ray outburst in order to unveil its nature andinvestigate its flaring activity. epoch- and pulse-folding techniques were usedto derive the spin period. time-average and pulse-phase spectroscopy wereemployed to study the spectral variability in the flare and out-of-flare statesand energy variations with pulse phase. power spectra were obtained toinvestigate the periodic and aperiodic variability. two large flares, with aduration of ~450 seconds were observed on 24 and 25 december 2005. during theflares, the x-ray intensity increased by a factor of 3.5, while thepeak-to-peak pulsed amplitude increased from 45% to 70%. a third, smaller flareof duration ~180 s was observed on 27 december 2005. the flares seen in swiftj1626.6-5156 constitute the shortest events of this kind ever reported in ahigh-mass x-ray binary. in addition to the flaring activity, strong x-raypulsations with pspin=15.3714+-0.0003 s characterise the x-ray emission inswift j1626.6-5156. after the major outburst, the light curve exhibits stronglong-term variations modulated with a 45-day period. we relate this modulationto the orbital period of the system or to a harmonic. power density spectrashow, in addition to the harmonic components of the pulsation, strongband-limited noise with an integrated 0.01-100 hz fractional rms of around 40%that increased to 64% during the flares. a weak qpo (fractional rms 4.7%) withcharacteristic frequency of 1 hz was detected in the non-flare emission. thetiming (short x-ray pulsations, long orbital period) and spectral (power-lawwith cut off energy and neutral iron line) properties of swift j1626.6-5156 arecharacteristic of be/x-ray binaries.

1505.01862	neutron star crust cooling in the terzan 5 x-ray transient swift  j174805.3-244637	when neutron stars reside in transient x-ray binaries, their crustal layersbecome heated during accretion outbursts and subsequently cool in quiescence.observing and modeling this thermal response has yielded valuable insight intothe physics of neutron star crusts. however, one unresolved problem is theevidence in several neutron stars for an extra energy source, located atshallow depth in the crust, that is not accounted for by standard heatingmodels. its origin remains puzzling, and it is currently unclear whether thisadditional heating occurs in all neutron stars, and if the magnitude is alwaysthe same. here, we report on chandra observations that cover two years afterthe 2012 outburst of the transient neutron star x-ray binary swiftj174805.3-244637 in the globular cluster terzan 5. the temperature of theneutron star was elevated during the first two months following its ~8 weekaccretion episode, but had decayed to the pre-outburst level within ~100 days.interpreting this as rapid cooling of the accretion-heated crust, we model theobserved temperature curve with a thermal evolution code. we find that there isno need to invoke shallow heating for this neutron star, although an extraenergy release up to ~1.4 mev/nucleon is allowed by the current data (2-sigmaconfidence). we also present two new data points on the crust cooling curve ofthe 11-hz x-ray pulsar igr j17480-2446 in terzan 5, which was active in 2010.the temperature of this neutron star remained significantly above itspre-outburst level, but we detect no temperature change since the previousmeasurements of 2013 february. this is consistent with the slower coolingexpected several years post-outburst.

1506.03622	swift x-ray telescope study of the black hole binary maxi j1659-152:  variability from a two component accretion flow	we present an energy dependent x-ray variability study of the 2010 outburstof the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1659-152 with the swift x-ray telescope(xrt). the broad-band noise components and the quasi periodic oscillations(qpo) observed in the power spectra show a strong and varied energy dependence.combining swift xrt data with data from the rossi x-ray timing explorer, wereport, for the first time, an rms spectrum (fractional rms amplitude as afunction of energy) of these components in the 0.5-30 kev energy range. we findthat the strength of the low-frequency component (&lt; 0.1 hz) decreases withenergy, contrary to the higher frequency components (&gt; 0.1 hz) whose strengthsincrease with energy. in the context of the propagating fluctuations model forx-ray variability, we suggest that the low-frequency component originates inthe accretion disk (which dominates emission below ~ 2 kev) and the higherfrequency components are formed in the hot flow (which dominates emission above~ 2 kev). as the properties of the qpo suggest that it may have a differentdriving mechanism, we investigate the lense-thirring precession of the hot flowas a candidate model. we also report on the qpo coherence evolution for thefirst time in the energy band below 2 kev. while there are strong indicationsthat the qpo is less coherent at energies below 2 kev than above 2 kev, thecoherence increases with intensity similar to what is observed at energiesabove 2 kev in other black-hole x-ray binaries.

0705.3594	parallel tracks in infrared versus x-ray emission in black hole x-ray  transient outbursts: a hysteresis effect?	we report the discovery of a new hysteresis effect in black hole x-ray binarystate transitions, that of the near-infrared (nir) flux (which most likelyoriginates in the jets) versus x-ray flux. we find, looking at existing datasets, that the infrared emission of black hole x-ray transients appears to beweaker in the low/hard state rise of an outburst than the low/hard statedecline of an outburst at a given x-ray luminosity. we discuss how this effectmay be caused by a shift in the radiative efficiency of the inflowing oroutflowing matter, or variations in the disc viscosity or the spectrum/power ofthe jet. in addition we show that there is a correlation (in slope but not innormalisation) between infrared and x-ray luminosities on the rise and decline,for all three low-mass black hole x-ray binaries with well-sampled infrared andx-ray coverage: l_nir propto l_x^(0.5-0.7). in the high/soft state this slopeis much shallower; l_nir propto lx^(0.1-0.2), and we find that the nir emissionin this state is most likely dominated by the viscously heated (as opposed tox-ray heated) accretion disc in all three sources.

astro-ph;0305161	peculiar spectral and power spectral behaviour of the lmxb gx 13+1	we present results of an analysis of all 480 ks of rossi x-ray timingexplorer proportional counter array data obtained from 17 may 1998 to 11october 1998 on the luminous low mass x-ray binary gx 13+1. we analysed thespectral properties in colour-colour diagrams (cds) and hardness-intensitydiagrams (hids) and fitted the power spectra with a multi-lorentzian model. gx13+1 traces out a curved track in the cds on a time scale of hours, which isvery reminiscent of a standard atoll track containing an island, and lower andupper banana branch. however, both count rate and power spectral propertiesvary along this track in a very unusual way, not seen in any other atoll or zsource. the count rate, which varied by a factor of ~1.6, along a given trackfirst decreases and then increases, causing the motion through the hids to bein the opposite sense to that in the cd, contrary to all other z and atollsources. along a cd track, the very low frequency noise uniquely decreases inamplitude from ~5 to ~2% (rms). the high frequency noise amplitude decreasesfrom ~4% to less than 1% and its characteristic frequency decreases from ~10 to\~5 hz. the 57-69 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) found earlier is alsodetected, and no khz qpos are found. in addition the entire track shows secularmotion on a time scale of about a week. the average count rate as well as theamplitude of the very low frequency noise correlate with this secular motion.we discuss a possible explanation for the peculiar properties of gx 13+1 interms of an unusual orientation or strength of a relativistic jet.

astro-ph;0307394	chandra/hetgs spectroscopy of the galactic black hole gx 339-4: a  relativistic iron line and evidence for a seyfert-like warm absorber	we observed the galactic black hole gx 339-4 with the chandra high energytransmission grating spectrometer (hetgs) for 75 ksec during the decline of its2002-2003 outburst. the sensitivity of this observation provides anunprecedented glimpse of a galactic black hole at about a tenth of theluminosity of the outburst peak. the continuum spectrum is well described by amodel consisting of multicolor disk blackbody (kt = 0.6 kev) and power-law(gamma = 2.5) components. x-ray reflection models yield improved fits. astrong, relativistic fe k-alpha emission line is revealed, indicating that theinner disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. the breadth of theline is sufficient to suggest that gx 339-4 may harbor a black hole withsignificant angular momentum. absorption lines from h-like and he-like o, andhe-like ne and mg are detected, as well as lines which are likely due to ne iiand ne iii. the measured line properties make it difficult to associate theabsorption with the coronal phase of the interstellar medium. a scenariowherein the absorption lines are due to an intrinsic agn-like warm-absorbergeometry -- perhaps produced by a disk wind in an extended disk-dominated state-- may be more viable. we compare our results to chandra observations of thegalactic black hole candidate xte j1650-500, and discuss our findings in termsof prominent models for galactic black hole accretion flows and connections tosupermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0312033	evidence for black hole spin in gx 339-4: xmm-newton epic-pn and rxte  spectroscopy of the very high state	we have analyzed spectra of the galactic black hole gx 339-4 obtained throughsimultaneous 76 ksec xmm-newton/epic-pn and 10 ksec rxte observations during abright phase of its 2002-2003 outburst. an extremely skewed, relativistic fek-alpha emission line and ionized disk reflection spectrum are revealed inthese spectra. self-consistent models for the fe k-alpha emission line profileand disk reflection spectrum rule-out an inner disk radius compatible with aschwarzschild black hole at more than the 8 sigma level of confidence. thebest-fit inner disk radius of 2-3 r_g suggests that gx 339-4 harbors a blackhole with a ~ 0.8-0.9 (where r_g = gm/c^2 and a=cj/gm^2, and assuming thatreflection in the plunging region is relatively small). this confirmsindications for black hole spin based on a chandra spectrum obtained later inthe outburst. the emission line and reflection spectrum also rule-out astandard power-law disk emissivity in gx 339-4; a broken power-law form withenhanced emissivity inside ~6 r_{g} gives improved fits at more than the 8sigma level of confidence. the extreme red wing of the line and steepemissivity require a centrally--concentrated source of hard x-rays which canstrongly illuminate the inner disk. hard x-ray emission from the base of a jet- enhanced by gravitational light bending effects - could create theconcentrated hard x-ray emission; this process may be related to magneticconnections between the black hole and the inner disk. we discuss these resultswithin the context of recent results from analyses of xte j1650-500 andmcg-6-30-15, and models for the inner accretion flow environment around blackholes.

astro-ph;0402600	radio detections of the neutron star x-ray binaries 4u 1820-30 and ser  x-1 in soft x-ray states	we present the analysis of simultaneous x-ray (rxte) and radio (vla)observations of two atoll-type neutron star x-ray binaries: 4u 1820-30 and serx-1. both sources were steadily in the soft (banana) x-ray state during theobservations. we have detected the radio counterpart of 4u 1820-30 at 4.86 ghzand 8.46 ghz at a flux density of ~0.1 mjy. this radio source is positionallycoincident with the radio pulsar psr 1820-30a. however, the pulsar's radioemission falls rapidly with frequency (proportional to \nu^(-3)) and we arguethat the x-ray binary's radio emission is dominant above ~2 ghz. supportingthis interpretation, comparison with previous observations reveals variabilityat the higher radio frequencies that is likely to be due to the x-ray binary.we have detected for the first time the radio counterpart of ser x-1 at 8.46ghz, also at a flux density of ~0.1 mjy. the position of the radio counterparthas allowed us to unambiguously identify its optical counterpart. we brieflydiscuss similarities and differences between the disc-jet coupling in neutronstar and black hole x-ray binaries. in particular, we draw attention to thefact that, contrary to other states, neutron star x-ray binaries seem to bemore radio loud than persistent black hole candidates when the emission is'quenched' in the soft state.

astro-ph;0406272	simultaneous chandra and rxte spectroscopy of the microquasar  h~1743-322: clues to disk wind and jet formation from a variable ionized  outflow	we observed the bright phase of the 2003 outburst of the galactic black holecandidate h 1743-322 in x-rays simultaneously with chandra and rxte on fouroccasions. the chandra/hetgs spectra reveal narrow, variable (he-like) fe xxvand (h-like) fe xxvi resonance absorption lines. in the first observation, thefe xxvi line has a fwhm of 1800 +/- 400 km/s and a blue-shift of 700 +/- 200km/s, suggesting that the highly ionized medium is an outflow. moreover, the fexxv line is observed to vary significantly on a timescale of a few hundredseconds in the first observation, which corresponds to the keplerian orbitalperiod at approximately 1 e+4 gravitational radii. our models for theabsorption geometry suggest that a combination of geometric effects andchanging ionizing flux are required to account for the large changes in lineflux observed between observations, and that the absorption likely occurs at aradius less than 1 e+4 radii for a 10 msun black hole. viable models for theabsorption geometry include cyclic absorption due to an accretion diskstructure, absorption in a clumpy outflowing disk wind, or possibly acombination of these two. if the wind in h 1743-322 has unity filling factor,the highest implied mass outflow rate is 20 percent of the eddington massaccretion rate. this wind may be a hot precursor to the seyfert-like,outflowing "warm absorber" geometries recently found in the galactic blackholes gx 339-4 and xte j1650-500. we discuss these findings in the context ofionized fe absorption lines found in the spectra of other galactic sources, andconnections to warm absorbers, winds, and jets in other accreting systems.

astro-ph;0501371	evidence for a link between fe k-alpha emission line strength and qpo  phase in a black hole	in x-ray binaries, the frequencies revealed in x-ray quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos) are often interpreted as characteristic frequencies in theinner accretion disk, though the exact oscillation mechanism is unknown atpresent. broadened fe k-alpha lines are also excellent diagnostics of the inneraccretion flow, if their broadening is indeed due to inner disk reflection.herein, we present two cases where the flux and equivalent width of the fek-alpha emission lines in spectra of the galactic black hole grs 1915+105 varywith the phase of strong 1 hz and 2 hz qpos in the x-ray flux. these resultsprovide strong evidence that both qpos and the fe-alpha lines originate in theinner disk. if the 1 hz qpo is only a keplerian orbital frequency, the qpocomes from a distance of 84 +/- 26 r_schw from the black hole; the 2 hz qpoimplies a radius of 50 +/- 15 r_schw. at these radii, relativistic shaping of adisk line is inevitable. moreover, the link holds in radio-bright andradio-faint phases, signaling that in systems like grs 1915+105, the fe k-alphaline is a disk line and not a jet line as per ss 433. a particularlyinteresting possibility is that a stable warp in the inner disk, e.g. due tolense-thirring precession, may produce the observed qpos and line modulations.more broadly, the fek-qpo link provides an unprecedented mechanism forrevealing the inner accretion flow and relativistic regime in accretingsystems, in that it gives two measures of radius: for a given disk qpo model,the frequency translates into a specific radius, and relativistic line modelsyield radii directly.

astro-ph;0602633	a long, hard look at the low-hard state in accreting black holes	we present the first results of coordinated multi-wavelength observations ofthe galactic black hole gx 339-4 in a canonical low-hard state, obtained duringits 2004 outburst. xmm-newton observed the source for 2 revolutions, orapproximately 280 ksec; rxte monitored the source throughout this long stare.the resulting data offer the best view yet obtained of the inner accretion flowgeometry in the low-hard state, which is thought to be analogous to thegeometry in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. the xmm-newton spectraclearly reveal the presence of a cool accretion disk component, and arelativistic fe k emission line. the results of fits made to both componentsstrongly suggest that a standard thin disk remains at or near to the innermoststable circular orbit, at least in bright phases of the low-hard state. thesefindings indicate that potential links between the inner disk radius and theonset of a steady compact jet, and the paradigm of a radially-recessed disk inthe low-hard state, do not hold universally. the results of our observationscan best be explained if a standard thin accretion disk fuels a corona which isclosely related to, or consistent with, the base of a compact jet. in a briefexamination of archival data, we show that cygnus x-1 supports this picture ofthe low/hard state. we discuss our results within the context of disk-jetconnections and prevailing models for accretion onto black holes.

astro-ph;0606721	global optical/infrared - x-ray correlations in x-ray binaries:  quantifying disc and jet contributions	the optical/near-infrared (oir) region of the spectra of low-mass x-raybinaries appears to lie at the intersection of a variety of different emissionprocesses. in this paper we present quasi-simultaneous oir - x-ray observationsof 33 xbs in an attempt to estimate the contributions of various emissionprocesses in these sources, as a function of x-ray state and luminosity. aglobal correlation is found between oir and x-ray luminosity for low-mass blackhole candidate xbs (bhxbs) in the hard x-ray state, of the form l_oir isproportional to lx^0.6. this correlation holds over 8 orders of magnitude in lxand includes data from bhxbs in quiescence and at large distances (lmc andm31). a similar correlation is found in low-mass neutron star xbs (nsxbs) inthe hard state. for bhxbs in the soft state, all the near-infrared (nir) andsome of the optical emission is suppressed below the correlation, a behaviourindicative of the jet switching off/on in transition to/from the soft state. wecompare these relations to theoretical models of a number of emissionprocesses. we find that x-ray reprocessing in the disc and emission from thejets both predict a slope close to 0.6 for bhxbs, and both contribute to theoir in bhxbs in the hard state, the jets producing ~90 percent of the niremission at high luminosities. x-ray reprocessing dominates the oir in nsxbs inthe hard state, with possible contributions from the jets (only at highluminosity) and the viscously heated disc. we also show that the opticallythick jet spectrum of bhxbs extends to near the k-band.

astro-ph;0703371	investigating the nature of absorption lines in the chandra x-ray  spectra of the neutron star binary 4u 1820-30	we use four chandra gratings spectra of the neutron star low-mass x-raybinary 4u 1820-30 to better understand the nature of certain x-ray absorptionlines in x-ray binaries, including the neii, neiii, neix, ovii, and oviiilines. the equivalent widths of the lines are generally consistent between theobservations, as expected if these lines originate in the hot interstellarmedium. no evidence was found that the lines were blueshifted, again supportingthe interstellar medium origin, though this may be due to poor statistics.there is apparent variability in the oviii ly-alpha line equivalent widthproviding some evidence that at least some of the oviii absorption ariseswithin the system. however, the significance is marginal (2.4-sigma), and thelack of variation in the other lines casts some doubt on the reality of thevariability. from calculating the equivalent hydrogen column densities for arange of doppler parameters, we find they are consistent with the interstellarorigin of the lines. additionally we fit the spectra with photoionizationmodels for locally absorbing material, and find that they can reproduce thespectrum well, but only when there is an extremely low filling factor. weconclude that both the ism and local absorption remain possible for the originof the lines, but that more sensitive observations are needed to search forlow-level variability.

0809.3171	a search for iron emission lines in the chandra x-ray spectra of neutron  star low-mass x-ray binaries	while iron emission lines are well studied in black hole systems, both inx-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, there has been less of a focus onthese lines in neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). however, recentobservations with suzaku and xmm-newton have revealed broad asymmetric ironline profiles in 4 neutron star lmxbs, confirming an inner disk origin forthese lines in neutron star systems. here, we present a search for iron linesin 6 neutron star lmxbs. for each object we have simultaneous chandra and rxteobservations at 2 separate epochs, allowing for both a high resolutionspectrum, as well as broadband spectral coverage. out of the six objects in thesurvey, we only find significant iron lines in two of the objects, gx 17+2 andgx 349+2. however, we cannot rule out that there are weak, broad lines presentin the other sources. the equivalent width of the line in gx 17+2 is consistentbetween the 2 epochs, while in gx 349+2 the line equivalent width increases bya factor of ~3 between epochs as the source flux decreases by a factor of 1.3.this suggests that the disk is highly ionized, and the line is dominated byrecombination emission. we find that there appears to be no specific locationsin the long-term hardness-intensity diagrams where iron emission lines areformed, though more sources and further observations are required.
