0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

0912.0824	on a new near-infrared method to estimate the absolute ages of star  clusters: ngc3201 as a first test case	we present a new method to estimate the absolute ages of stellar systems.this method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequenceturn-off (msto) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence(msk). this feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption ofmolecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (nir) andin optical-nir color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. we took advantageof deep and accurate nir images collected with the multi-conjugate adaptiveoptics demonstrator temporarily available on the very large telescope and ofoptical images collected with the advanced camera for surveys wide field cameraon the hubble space telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate theabsolute age of the globular ngc3201 using both the msto and thedelta(msto-msk). we have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we foundthat the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.however, the errors of the ages based on the delta(msto-msk) method arepotentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected byuncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.current isochrones appear topredict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) nir and optical-nir colors than observed formagnitudes fainter than the msk.

0912.4384	rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of the gravitationally lensed galaxy  `the 8 o'clock arc': stellar and interstellar medium properties	we present the first detailed analysis of the rest-frame uv spectrum of thegravitationally lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg), the `8 o'clock arc'. thespectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ism)features, and presents several similarities to the well-known ms1512-cb58 lbg.the stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemicredshift, z_sys = 2.7350+/-0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellarmetallicity, z=0.82 z_sol. with a total stellar mass of ~4.2x10^{11} m_sol, the8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z&gt;2star-forming galaxies. the 31 ism absorption lines detected led to theabundance measurements of 9 elements. the metallicity of the ism, z=0.65 z_sol(si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, andsuggests that the ism of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted andenriched by ejecta of ob stars. the ism lines extend over ~1000 km/s and havetheir peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gasoutflows of about -120 km/s. the ly-alpha line is dominated by a dampedabsorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshiftedrelative to the ism lines by about +690 km/s and resulting from multiplybackscattered ly-alpha photons emitted in the hii region surrounded by thecold, expanding ism shell. a homogeneous spherical radiation transfer shellmodel with a constant outflow velocity, determined by the observations, is ableto reproduce the observed ly-alpha line profile and dust content. these resultsfully support the scenario proposed earlier, where the diversity of ly-alphaline profiles in lbgs and ly-alpha emitters, from absorption to emission, ismostly due to variations of hi column density and dust content (abridged).

1202.1745	nebular and global properties of the gravitationally lensed galaxy "the  8 o'clock arc"	we present the analysis of new nir, intermediate-resolution spectra of thegravitationally lensed galaxy "the 8 o'clock arc" at z_sys = 2.7350 obtainedwith vlt/x-shooter. these rest-frame optical data, combined with hst andspitzer images, provide very valuable information, which nicely complement ourprevious detailed rest-frame uv spectral analysis. from high-resolution hstimages, we reconstruct the morphology of the arc in the source plane, andidentify that the source is formed of two majors parts, the main galaxycomponent and a smaller blob separated by 1.2 kpc in projected distance. theblob, with a twice larger magnification factor, is resolved in the spectra. themulti-gaussian fitting of detected nebular emission lines and the spectralenergy distribution modeling of the available multi-wavelength photometryprovide the census of gaseous and stellar dust extinctions, gas-phasemetallicities, star-formation rates (sfrs), and stellar, gas, and dynamicalmasses for both the main galaxy and the blob. as a result, the 8 o'clock arcshows a marginal trend for a more attenuated ionized gas than stars, andsupports a dependence of the dust properties on the sfr. with a high specificstar-formation rate, ssfr = 33+/-19 gyr^{-1}, this lensed lyman-break galaxydeviates from the mass-sfr relation, and is characterized by a young age of40^{+25}_{-20} myr and a high gas fraction of about 72%. the 8 o'clock arcsatisfies the fundamental mass, sfr, and metallicity relation, and favors thatit holds up beyond z~2.5. we believe that the blob, with a gas mass m_gas =(2.2+/-0.9)x10^{9} msun (one order of magnitude lower than the mass of thegalaxy), a half-light radius r1/2 = 0.53+/-0.05 kpc, a star-formation ratesfr_halpha = 33+/-19 msun yr^{-1}, and in rotation around the main core of thegalaxy, is one of these star-forming clumps commonly observed in z&gt;1star-forming galaxies.

(2007) deducedfrom a drift of -180 (+/- 85) m/s at z =1.84, between two sets of feii linesfalling in the two uves arms may be real or induced by other kinds ofsystematics than those investigated here. the proposed technique allows realtime quality check of the spectrograph and should be followed for very accuratemeasurements.

1305.1884	the uves large program for testing fundamental physics: i bounds on a  change in alpha towards quasar he 2217-2818	absorption line systems detected in quasar spectra can be used to compare thevalue of the fine-structure constant, {\alpha}, measured today on earth withits value in distant galaxies. in recent years, some evidence has emerged ofsmall temporal and also spatial variations of {\alpha} on cosmological scaleswhich may reach a fractional level of ~ 10 ppm (parts per million). to testthese claims we are conducting a large program with the vlt uves . we areobtaining high-resolution (r ~ 60000 and high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 100)uves spectra calibrated specifically for this purpose. here we analyse thefirst complete quasar spectrum from this program, that of he 2217-2818. weapply the many multiplet method to measure {\alpha} in 5 absorption systemstowards this quasar: zabs = 0.7866, 0.9424, 1.5558, 1.6279 and 1.6919. the mostprecise result is obtained for the absorber at zabs = 1.6919 where 3 fe iitransitions and al ii {\lambda}1670 have high s/n and provide a wide range ofsensitivities to {\alpha}. the absorption profile is complex, with several verynarrow features, and requires 32 velocity components to be fitted to the data.our final result for the relative variation in {\alpha} in this system isdelta{\alpha}/{\alpha} = +1.3 +/- 2.4stat +/- 1.0sys ppm. this is one of thetightest current bounds on {\alpha} variation from an individual absorber. theabsorbers towards quasar he 2217-2818 reveal no evidence for variation in{\alpha} at the 3 ppm precision level (1{\sigma} confidence). if the recentlyreported 10 ppm dipolar variation of {\alpha} across the sky were correct, theexpectation at this sky position is (3.2-5.4) +/-1.7 ppm depending on dipolemodel used . our constraint of delta{\alpha}/{\alpha}=+1.3+/-2.4stat +/-1.0sysppm is not inconsistent with this expectation.

1310.6280	fundamental constants and high resolution spectroscopy	absorption-line systems detected in high resolution quasar spectra can beused to compare the value of dimensionless fundamental constants such as thefine-structure constant, alpha, and the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu =m_p/m_e, as measured in remote regions of the universe to their value today onearth. in recent years, some evidence has emerged of small temporal and alsospatial variations in alpha on cosmological scales which may reach a fractionallevel of 10 ppm . we are conducting a large programme of observations with vltuves to explore these variations. we here provide a general overview of thelarge programme and report on the first results for these two constants,discussed in detail in molaro et al. and rahmani et al. a stringent bound fordelta(alpha)/alpha is obtained for the absorber at_abs = 1.6919 towards he2217-2818. the absorption profile is complex with several very narrow features,and is modeled with 32 velocity components. the relative variation in alpha inthis system is +1.3+-2.4_{stat}+-1.0_{sys} ppm if al ii lambda 1670aa and threefe ii transitions are used, and +1.1+-2.6_{stat} ppm in a lightly differentanalysis with only fe ii transitions used. the expectation at this sky positionof the recently-reported dipolar variation of alpha is (3.2--5.4)+-1.7 ppmdepending on dipole model. this constraint of delta(alpha)/alpha at face valueis not supporting this expectation but is not inconsistent with it at the 3sigma level. for the proton-to-electron mass ratio the analysis of the h_2absorption lines of the z_{abs}~2.4018 damped ly alpha system towards he 0027-1836 provides delta(mu)/mu = (-7.6 +- 8.1_{stat} +- 6.3_{sys}) ppm which isalso consistent with a null variation.

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

0705.1650	a new comprehensive set of elemental abundances in dlas iii. star  formation histories	we obtained comprehensive sets of elemental abundances for eleven dampedly-alpha systems (dlas) at z_dla=1.7-2.5. in paper i of this series, we showedfor three dla galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories andages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns withchemical evolution models. we determine in this paper the star formationproperties of six additional dla galaxies. the derived results confirm that nosingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patternsin dlas. we demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducingthe dla abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst andquiescent spiral galaxies. independent of the star formation history, the dlashave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models withhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. all the derived dla starformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 &lt;log sfr &lt; -1.1 m_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. the dla abundance patterns require alarge spread in ages ranging from 20 myr up to 3 gyr. the oldest dla in oursample is observed at z_dla=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 gyr; itnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f&gt;10. but, most of thedlas show ages much younger than that of the universe at the epoch ofobservation. young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift universe atz&gt;2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for mosthigh-redshift galaxies. the dla star formation properties are compared withthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys withthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.

astro-ph;0111527	the k20 survey. i. disentangling old and dusty star-forming galaxies in  the ero population	we present the results of vlt optical spectroscopy of a complete sample of 78eros with r-ks\geq5 over a field of 52 arcmin^2. about 70% of the 45 eros withks\leq19.2 have been spectroscopically identified with old passively evolvingand dusty star-forming galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5. the two classes are about equallypopulated and for each of them we present and discuss the average spectrum.  from the old ero average spectrum and for z=z_{\odot} we derive a minimum ageof \sim 3 gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift of z_f \gtsima 2.4. plemodels with such formation redshifts well reproduce the density of old eros(consistent with being passively evolving ellipticals), whereas the predictionsof the current hierarchical merging models are lower than the observeddensities by large factors (up to an order of magnitude). from the averagespectrum of the star-forming eros we estimate a substantial dust extinctionwith e(b-v) \gtsima 0.5. the star formation rates, corrected for the averagereddening, suggest a significant contribution from eros to the cosmicstar-formation density at z \sim 1.

astro-ph;0112290	exploring the intergalactic medium with vlt/uves	the remarkable efficiency of the uves spectrograph at the vlt has made itpossible to push high-resolution, high-s/n ground observations of the ly-aforest down to z~1.5, gaining new insight into the physical conditions of theintergalactic medium and its evolution over more than 90% of the cosmic time.the universal expansion, the uv ionizing background and the gravitationalcondensation of structures are the driving factors shaping the number densityand the column density distribution of the absorbers. a (limited) contributionof uv photons produced by galaxies is found to be important to reproduce theobserved evolutionary pattern at very high and low redshift. the lyman forestcontains most of the baryons, at least at z&gt;1.5, and acts as a reservoir forgalaxy formation. the typical doppler parameter at a fixed column density ismeasured to slightly increase with decreasing redshift, but the inferredtemperature at the mean density is increasing with redshift. the signatures ofheii reionization and feedback from the formation of galactic structures havepossibly been detected in the lyman forest.

astro-ph;0207023	new detections of mn, ti and mg in damped ly-alpha systems: toward  reconciling the dust/nucleosynthesis degeneracy	we have combined new high resolution uves-vlt observations of a sample offour damped ly-alpha systems (dlas) at redshifts between z_abs = 1.7-2.5 withthe existing hires-keck spectra to undertake a comprehensive study of theirphysical conditions and their abundances of up to 15 elements. in this paper,we present abundance measurements for mn, ti and mg which are among the firstpresented in the literature at these redshifts. we confirm the underabundanceof mn with respect to fe as observed in lower redshift dlas and a trend withdecreasing metallicity very similar to the one observed in galactic metal-poorstars. this agreement between the mn/fe ratios in dlas and in galactic starssuggests that the dlas and the milky way share some similarities in their starformation histories. however, these similarities must be cautiously interpretedand investigated in light of all of the elements observed in the dlas. we haveobtained a first measurement and a significant upper limit of the ti abundanceat z_abs ~ 2 from the tiii lines at lambda_rest &gt; 3000 a, and we discuss howthe relative abundance of this highly depleted element can be used to proveunambiguously any enhancement of the abundance of the alpha-elements relativeto fe-peak elements. we present the abundances of mg for two dlas in additionto the single mg measurement existing in the literature. contrary to the trendexpected from differential depletion, the [mg/si,s] ratios tend to beover-solar. the effect is at the level of the measurement errors, but worthinvestigating in a larger sample because it could be suggestive of a peculiarnucleosynthesis effect.

astro-ph;0702175	clues to the nature of high-redshift ovi absorption systems from their  (lack of) small-scale structure	we present results of the first survey of high-redshift (&lt;z&gt; ~ 2.3) oviabsorption systems along parallel lines of sight toward two lensed qsos. aftera careful and well-defined search, we find ten intervening ovi systems. withinthe errors, all ovi systems appear at the same redshift and have similar linestrengths in front of both qso images, whereas in most cases civ or siiv showmore differences across the lines of sight, either in radial velocity or linestrength. we conclude that (1) the coherence length of ovi must be much largerthan ~ 1 kpc, and (2) an important fraction of the civ absorbers may not residein the same volume as ovi. since doppler parameters are consistent withphotoionization, we propose a model in which civ occurs in two differentphotoionized phases, one large, with characteristic sizes of a few hundred kpcand bearing ovi, and another one a factor of ten smaller and containing ciii.this model is able to explain the various transverse differences observed incolumn density and kinematics. we apply the model successfully to 2 kinds ofabsorbers, with low and high metallicity. in the low-metallicity regime, [c/h]\~ -2, we find that [c/o] ~ -0.7 is required to explain the observations, whichhints at late (z &lt; 6) rather than early metal enrichment. in thehigh-metallicity regime, the observed dissociation between ovi and civ gasmight be produced by galactic outflows. altogether, the relative abundances,inhomogeneous civ and featureless ovi are consistent with gas that has beenprocessed recently before the absorption occurred (thus close to star-formingregions). finally, we discuss briefly three associated systems (z_abs ~ z_em)that also show ovi.

astro-ph;0703622	high-precision wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrographs with  laser frequency combs	we describe a possible new technique for precise wavelength calibration ofhigh-resolution astronomical spectrographs using femtosecond-pulsed mode-lockedlasers controlled by stable oscillators such as atomic clocks. such `frequencycombs' provide a series of narrow modes which are uniformly spaced according tothe laser's pulse repetition rate and whose absolute frequencies are known apriori with relative precision better than 10^{-12}. simulations of frequencycomb spectra show that the photon-limited wavelength calibration precisionachievable with existing echelle spectrographs should be ~1 cm/s whenintegrated over a 4000a range. moreover, comb spectra may be used to accuratelycharacterise distortions of the wavelength scale introduced by the spectrographand detector system. the simulations show that frequency combs with pulserepetition rates of 5-30ghz are required, given the typical resolving power ofexisting and possible future echelle spectrographs. achieving such highrepetition rates, together with the desire to produce all comb modes withuniform intensity over the entire optical range, represent the only significantchallenges in the design of a practical system. frequency comb systems mayremove wavelength calibration uncertainties from all practical spectroscopicexperiments, even those combining data from different telescopes over manydecades.

astro-ph;9602026	the proximity effect, the uv background and the statistics of the  lyman-alpha lines at high resolution	we present results from high resolution (r\simeq 28000) spectra of six high-redshift qsos taken at the eso ntt telescope that allow the detailed study ofthe ly-alpha population in the redshift interval z=2.8-4.1. the typical dopplerparameters found for the ly-alpha lines lie in the interval b=20\div30 km/s,corresponding to temperatures t&gt;24000k, with a fraction of the order 15% in therange 10&lt;b&lt;20km/s. these values are still consistent with models of lowdensity, highly ionized clouds. the observed redshift and column densitydistributions obtained from these spectra and from the observations of 4 additional qsos taken in the literature allow an accurate estimate of theproximity effect from a relatively large ly-alpha sample (more than 1100 lineswith logn_{hi}&gt;=13.3) in the redshift interval z=1.7-4.1. a maximum likelihoodanalysis has been applied to estimate simultaneously the best fit parameters ofthe ly-alpha$ statistics and of the uv background. after correcting for theblanketing of weak lines, we confirm that the column density distribution isbest represented by a double power-law with a break at logn_{hi}\simeq14, witha slope beta_s=1.8 for higher column densities and a flatter slope beta_f=1.4below the break. a value j_{ll}= 5 \pm1 \times10^{-22} erg/cm^2/s/hz/sr isderived for the uv background in the redshift interval z=1.7-4.1, consistentwith the predicted qso contribution. no evidence is found for redshiftevolution of the uvb in the same redshift interval. the comoving volume densitydistributions of protogalactic damped and lyman lymit systems and ly-alphaclouds with log n_{hi}&gt;= 14 and radii r\simeq 200 kpc are found to be similar,suggesting a possible common association with galaxies.

astro-ph;9606063	the shape of the ionizing uv background at $z\sim 3.7$ from the metal  absorption systems of q$0000-2619$	spectra of the \ze~$=4.12$ quasar q$0000-2619$ have been obtained in therange $\lambda\lambda = 4880-8115$ \aa~with a resolution of 13 \kms~andsignal--to--noise ratio of $s/n=15-60$ per resolution element. the mode of thedistribution of the doppler parameters for the \lya~lines is $\simeq 25$ \kms.the fraction of lines with $10&lt;b&lt;20$ \kms~is 17\%. the doppler values derivedfrom uncontaminated \lyb~lines are smaller than those obtained from thecorresponding ly$\alpha$ lines, indicating the contribution of non saturated,non resolved components in the \lya~profiles. the integrated uv backgroundestimated from the proximity effect is found to be $j \sim 7 \times 10^{-22}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$~hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. this value is consistent withprevious estimates obtained at a lower $z$, implying no appreciable redshiftevolution of the uvb up to $z=4$. 13 metal systems are identified, five ofwhich previously unknown. the analysis of the associated metal systems suggestsabundances generally below the solar value with an average [c/h] $\sim -0.5$.this value is about one order of magnitude higher than that found inintervening systems at about the same redshift. the analysis of the interveningmetal line systems has revealed in particular the presence of three opticallythin systems with $\log n_{hi}\sim 15$ showing associated civ and siivabsorptions. in order to make the observed column densities consistent with[si/c] ratios lower than 10 times the solar value, it is necessary to assume alarge jump in the spectrum of the ionizing uv background beyond the heii edge($j_{912}/j_{228}\gsim 1000$). this result, if confirmed in other spectra atthe same redshift is suggestive of a possible dominance of a stellar ionizingemissivity over the declining quasar one at $z &gt; 3$.

astro-ph;9710174	the uv background and the lyman alpha clouds at high redshift	the estimate of the ionizing uv background through the proximity effectanalysis is discussed. taking into account the correct bending of the columndensity distribution which appears in high resolution high s/n data, a value ofthe uv background ~5x10^{-22} cgs is obtained in the redshift interval z=1.7-4without indication of any appreciable redshift evolution. inferences on thespectral shape of the uv background between the hi and heii edges are providedby the study of metal line ratios like siiv/civ in optically thin systems. thepresence of a jump near the heii edge seems favoured at very high redshiftsz&gt;3. an increasing heii jump with increasing redshift can be responsible forthe decreasing in the minimum temperatures of the lyman alpha clouds withincreasing z. new studies of the cosmic evolution of star-forming galaxiesallow the estimate of a galaxy-dominated uv background intensity ~1.3 x10^{-21}f_{esc} cgs at z=0.5 where f_{esc}&lt;20% is the escape fraction of ionizing uvphotons from the galaxies. finally it is also shown that in a uv backgrounddominated by qsos and/or star-forming galaxies the cosmological baryon densityof the lyman alpha clouds decreases rapidly with cosmic time possibly due toincreasing bulk heating in the intergalactic medium with cosmic time.
