0904.0028	a laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south - submillimeter  properties of near-ir selected galaxies	using the 330hr eso-mpg 870-micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdf-s) obtained with the large apex bolometer camera (laboca) on theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex), we have carried out a stacking analysisat submillimeter (submm) wavelengths of a sample of 8266 near-infra-red(near-ir) selected (k_vega &lt;= 20) galaxies, including 893 bzk galaxies, 1253extremely red objects (eros) and 737 distant red galaxies (drgs), selected fromthe multi-wavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). we measure average870-micron fluxes of 0.20+-0.01mjy (20.0sigma), 0.45+-0.04mjy (11.3sigma),0.42+-0.03mjy (14.0sigma), and 0.41+-0.04mjy (10.3sigma) for the k_vega &lt;= 20,bzk, ero and drg samples, respectively. for the bzk, ero and drg subsamples,which overlap to some degree and are like to be at z ~ 1-2, this implies anaverage far-ir luminosity of ~2-6x10^{11} lsolar and star formation rate of~40-100msolar. splitting the bzk galaxies up into star-forming (sbzk) andpassive (pbzk) galaxies, the former is significantly detected (0.48+-0.04mjy,12.0sigma) while the latter is only marginally detected (0.27+-0.10mjy,2.7sigma), thus confirming that the sbzk/pbzk criteria do isolate obscured,star forming and truly passive galaxies. the k_vega &lt;= 20 galaxies are found tocontribute with 6.6+-0.3jy deg^{-2} (~15%) to the 870-micron extragalacticbackground light (ebl). sbzk and pbzk galaxies contribute 1.7+-0.2jy deg^{-2}(~4%) and 0.2+-0.1 jy deg^{-2} (&lt; 0.5%) to the ebl.

0908.3675	a search for neutral carbon towards two z=4.05 submillimetre galaxies,  gn20 and gn20.2	using the iram plateau-de-bure interferometer (pdbi) we have searched for theupper fine structure line of neutral carbon (ci(2-&gt;1), nu_rest = 809 ghz) and12co(j=7-&gt;6) (nu_rest=806ghz) towards the submillimetre galaxies (smgs) gn20(smm j123711.9+622212, z = 4.055) and gn20.2 (smm j123708.8+622202, z = 4.051).the far-infrared (fir) continuum is detected at 8sigma significance in gn20,with a flux density of s_1.8mm = 1.9+-0.2mjy, while no continuum is detected ingn20.2. both sources are statistically undetected in both ci and co(7-6) lines;we derive line luminosity limits for both ci and co of l'&lt;~2x10^10k km s^-1pc^2. assuming carbon excitation temperatures of t_ex = 30k (the galaxies'measured dust temperatures), we infer ci mass limits of m_ci &lt; 5.4x10^6 msun(gn20) and m_ci &lt; 6.8x10^6 msun (gn20.2). the derived ci abundance limits are&lt;1.8x10^-5 for gn20 and &lt;3.8x10^-5 for gn20.2 implying that the systems havemilky way level neutral carbon enrichment (x[ci]/x[h2]) or lower, similar tohigh-redshift carbon-detected systems (at 5x10^-5) but about 50 times less thanthe neutral carbon enrichment of local starburst galaxies. observations of gn20and gn20.2 in high-resolution merlin+vla radio maps of goods-n are used tofurther constrain the sizes and locations of active regions. we conclude thatthe physical gas properties of young rapidly evolving systems like gn20 andgn20.2 are likely significantly different than starburst/ulirg environments inthe local universe yet similar to z~2 smgs. unless gravitationally amplifiedexamples can be found, observations of galaxies like gn20 will require theorder of magnitude increase in sensitivity of the atacama large millimetrearray (alma) to constrain their ci and high-j co content, despite the fact thatthey are the brightest systems at z~4.

0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

0910.3642	the blast 250-micron selected galaxy population in goods-south	we identify and investigate the nature of the 20 brightest 250-micron sourcesdetected by the blast within the central 150 sq. arcmin of the goods-southfield. aided by the available deep vla radio imaging, reaching s_1.4 = 30micro-jy, we have identified radio counterparts for 17/20 of the 250-micronsources. the resulting enhanced positional accuracy of ~1 arcsec has thenallowed us to exploit the deep multi-frequency imaging of goods-south toestablish secure galaxy counterparts for the 17 radio-identified sources, andplausible galaxy candidates for the 3 radio-unidentified sources. confusion isa serious issue for this deep blast 250-micron survey, due to the large size ofthe beam. nevertheless, we argue that our chosen counterparts are significant,and often dominant contributors to the measured blast flux densities. for allof these 20 galaxies we have been able to determine spectroscopic (8) orphotometric (12) redshifts. the result is the first `complete' redshiftdistribution for a deep 250-micron selected galaxy sample. this reveals that250-micron surveys reaching detection limits of ~30 mjy contain not onlylow-redshift spirals/lirgs, but also the extreme z~2 dust-enshrouded starburstgalaxies previously discovered at sub-millimetre wavelengths. based on theirirac colours, we find that virtually all of the blast galaxy identificationsappear better described as analogues of the m82 starburst galaxy, or scstar-forming discs rather than highly obscured ulirgs. inspection of the laboca870-micron imaging of the goods-south field yields detections of 7/11 of thez&gt;1 blast sources, and reveals 250/870 flux-density ratios consistent with astandard 40k modified black-body fit with a dust emissivity index beta=1.5.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

1002.0071	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: two modes of  star formation in agn hosts?	we study the co-existence of star formation and agn activity in x-rayselected agn by analyzing stacked 870um submm emission from a deep and wide mapof the extended chandra deep field south, obtained with laboca at the apextelescope. the total x-ray sample of 895 sources with median redshift z~1 isdetected at a mean submm flux of 0.49+-0.04mjy, corresponding to a typical starformation rate around 30msun/yr for a t=35k, beta=1.5 greybody far-infraredsed. the good s/n permits stacking analyses for subgroups. we observe a trendof star formation rate increasing with redshift. an increase of star formationrate with agn luminosity is indicated at the highest l_2-10&gt;~1e44erg/sluminosities only. increasing trends with x-ray obscuration as expected in someagn evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the x-ray agnsample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects. thissuggests a transition between two modes in the coexistence of agn activity andstar formation. for the bulk of the sample, the x-ray luminosity andobscuration of the agn are not intimately linked to the global star formationrate of their hosts. the hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly,at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxieswithout an agn at similar redshifts. the change indicated towards more intensestar formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates betweenunobscured and obscured agn at highest luminosities suggests that luminous agnfollow an evolutionary path on which obscured agn activity and intense starformation are linked, possibly via merging. comparison to local hard x-rayselected agn supports this interpretation.

0707.4482	wide-field mid-infrared and millimetre imaging of the high-redshift  radio galaxy, 4c41.17	we present deep 350- and 1200-micron imaging of the region around 4c41.17 --one of the most distant (z = 3.792) and luminous known radio galaxies --obtained with the submillimeter high angular resolution camera (sharc-ii) andthe max planck millimeter bolometer array (mambo). the radio galaxy is robustlydetected at 350- and 1200-micron, as are two nearby 850-micron-selectedgalaxies; a third 850-micron source is detected at 350-micron and coincideswith a ~ 2-sigma feature in the 1200-micron map. further away from the radiogalaxy an additional nine sources are detected at 1200-micron, bringing thetotal number of detected (sub)millimeter selected galaxies (smgs) in this fieldto 14. using radio images from the very large array (vla) and spitzermid-infrared (mid-ir) data, we find statistically robust radio and/or 24-microncounterparts to eight of the 14 smgs in the field around 4c41.17. follow-upspectroscopy with keck/lris has yielded redshifts for three of the eightrobustly identified smgs, placing them in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.7,i.e. well below that of 4c41.17. we infer photometric redshifts for a furtherfour sources using their 1.6-micron (rest-frame) stellar feature as probed bythe irac bands; only one of them is likely to be at the same redshift as4c41.17. thus at least four, and as many as seven, of the smgs within the4c41.17 field are physically unrelated to the radio galaxy. with the redshiftinformation at hand we are able to constrain the observed over-densities ofsmgs within radial bins stretching to r=50 and 100" (~ 0.4 and ~ 0.8mpc at z ~3.8) from the radio galaxy to ~ 5x and ~ 2x that of the field, dropping off tothe background value at r=150".

1003.2166	an excess of star-forming galaxies in the fields of high-redshift qsos	we present submillimetre and mid-infrared imaging observations of five fieldscentred on quasi-stellar objects (qsos) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.8. all 5 qsos were detectedpreviously at submillimetre wavelengths. at 850 (450) um we detect 17 (11)submillimetre galaxies (smgs) in addition to the qsos. the total area mapped at850 um is ~28 arcmin^2 down to rms noise levels of 1-2 mjy/beam, depending onthe field. integral number counts are computed from the 850 um data using thesame analytical techniques adopted by `blank-field' submillimetre surveys. wefind that the `qso-field' counts show a clear excess over the blank-fieldcounts at deboosted flux densities of 2-4 mjy; at higher flux densities thecounts are consistent with the blank-field counts. robust mid-infraredcounterparts are identified for all four submillimetre detected qsos and ~60per cent of the smgs. the mid-infrared colours of the qsos are similar to thoseof the local ulirg/agn mrk 231 if placed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 whilst most of the smgs havecolours very similar to those of the local ulirg arp 220 at 1&lt;z&lt;3. mid-infrareddiagnostics therefore find no strong evidence that the smgs host buried agnalthough we cannot rule out such a possibility. taken together our resultssuggest that the qsos sit in regions of the early universe which are undergoingan enhanced level of major star-formation activity, and should evolve to becomesimilarly dense regions containing massive galaxies at the present epoch.finally, we find evidence that the level of star-formation activity inindividual galaxies appears to be lower around the qsos than it is around morepowerful radio-loud agn at higher redshifts.

1004.0819	far-infrared properties of spitzer-selected luminous starbursts	we present sharc-2 350 micron data on 20 luminous z ~ 2 starbursts withs(1.2mm) &gt; 2 mjy from the spitzer-selected samples of lonsdale et al. andfiolet et al. all the sources were detected, with s(350um) &gt; 25 mjy for 18 ofthem. with the data, we determine precise dust temperatures and luminositiesfor these galaxies using both single-temperature fits and models with power-lawmass--temperature distributions. we derive appropriate formulae to use whenoptical depths are non-negligible. our models provide an excellent fit to the6um--2mm measurements of local starbursts. we find characteristicsingle-component temperatures t1 ~ 35.5+-2.2 k and integrated infrared (ir)luminosities around 10^(12.9+-0.1) lsun for the swire-selected sources.molecular gas masses are estimated at 4 x 10^(10) msun, assumingkappa(850um)=0.15 m^2/kg and a submillimeter-selected galaxy (smg)-likegas-to-dust mass ratio. the best-fit models imply &gt;~2 kpc emission scales. wealso note a tight correlation between rest-frame 1.4 ghz radio and irluminosities confirming star formation as the predominant power source. thefar-ir properties of our sample are indistinguishable from the purelysubmillimeter-selected populations from current surveys. we therefore concludethat our original selection criteria, based on mid-ir colors and 24 um fluxdensities, provides an effective means for the study of smgs at z ~ 1.5--2.5.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1009.0749	tracing the molecular gas in distant submillimetre galaxies via co(1-0)  imaging with the evla	we report the results of a pilot study with the evla of 12co j=1-0 emissionfrom four smgs at z=2.2-2.5, each with an existing detection of co j=3-2. usingthe evla's most compact configuration we detect strong, broad j=1-0 lineemission from all of our targets. the median line width ratio,sigma(1-0)/sigma(3-2) = 1.15 +/- 0.06, suggests that the j=1-0 is morespatially extended than the j=3-2 emission, a situation confirmed by our mapswhich reveal velocity structure in several cases and typical sizes of ~16 kpcfwhm. the median tb ratio is r(3-2/1-0) = 0.55 +/- 0.05, noting that our valuemay be biased high because of the j=3-2-based sample selection. naively, thissuggests gas masses ~2x higher than estimates made using higher-j transitionsof co, with the discrepency due to the difference in assumed tb ratio. we alsoestimate masses using the 12co j=1-0 line and the observed global tb ratios,assuming standard underlying tb ratios as well as a limiting sfe, i.e. withoutcalling upon x(co). using this new method, we find a median molecular gas massof (2.5 +/- 0.8) x 10^10 msun, with a plausible range stretching 3x higher.even larger masses cannot be ruled out, but are not favoured by dynamicalconstraints: the median dynamical mass for our sample is (2.3 +/- 1.4) x 10^11msun. we examine the schmidt-kennicutt relation for all the distant galaxypopulations for which co j=1-0 or j=2-1 data are available, finding smallsystematic differences. these have previously been interpreted as evidence fordifferent modes of star formation, but we argue that these differences are tobe expected, given the still considerable uncertainties. finally, we discussthe morass of degeneracies surrounding molecular gas mass estimates, thepossibilities for breaking them, and the future prospects for imaging andstudying cold, quiescent molecular gas at high redshifts [abridged].

1012.3753	the submillimeter array 1.3 mm line survey of arp 220	we present the first aperture synthesis unbiased spectral line survey towardan extragalactic object. the survey covered the 40 ghz frequency range between202 and 242 ghz of the 1.3 mm atmospheric window. we find that 80% of theobserved band shows molecular emission, with 73 features identified from 15molecular species and 6 isotopologues. the 13c isotopic substitutions of hc3nand transitions from h2(18)o, 29sio, and ch2co are detected for the first timeoutside the galaxy. within the broad observed band, we estimate that 28% of thetotal measured flux is due to the molecular line contribution, with co onlycontributing 9% to the overall flux. we present maps of the co emission at aresolution of 2.9"x1.9" which, though not enough to resolve the two nuclei,recover all the single-dish flux. the 40 ghz spectral scan has been modelledassuming lte conditions and abundances are derived for all identified species.the chemical composition of arp 220 shows no clear evidence of an agn impact onthe molecular emission but seems indicative of a purely starburst-heated ism.the overabundance of h2s and the low isotopic ratios observed suggest achemically enriched environment by consecutive bursts of star formation, withan ongoing burst at an early evolutionary stage. the large abundance of water(~10^-5), derived from the isotopologue h2(18)o, as well as the vibrationallyexcited emission from hc3n and ch3cn are claimed to be evidence of massive starforming regions within arp 220. moreover, the observations put strongconstraints on the compactness of the starburst event in arp 220. we estimatethat such emission would require ~2-8x10^6 hot cores, similar to those found inthe sgr b2 region in the galactic center, concentrated within the central 700pc of arp 220.

1205.1511	a survey of molecular gas in luminous sub-millimetre galaxies	we present the results from a survey for 12co emission in 40 luminoussub-millimetre galaxies (smgs), with 850um fluxes of s850 = 4 - 20 mjy,conducted with the plateau de bure interferometer. we detect 12co emission in32 smgs at z~1.2 - 4.1, including 16 smgs not previously published. usingmultiple 12co line (j_up =2 - 7) observations, we derive a median spectral lineenergy distribution for luminous smgs and use this to estimate a mean gas massof (5.3 +/- 1.0) \times 10^10 msun. we report the discovery of a fundamentalrelationship between 12co fwhm and 12co line luminosity in high-redshiftstarbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominateddynamics within the regions probed by our observations. we use far-infraredluminosities to assess the star-formation efficiency in our smgs, finding asteepening of the l'co-lfir relation as a function of increasing 12co j_uptransition. we derive dynamical masses and molecular gas masses, and use theseto determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of smgs, finding thatthey do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorouslystar-forming galaxies at high redshifts. finally, we collate x-rayobservations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties ofsmgs with their agn activity and supermassive black hole masses (mbh), findingthat smgs lie significantly below the local m_bh-sigma relation. we concludethat smgs represent a class of massive, gas-rich ultraluminous galaxies withsomewhat heterogeneous properties, ranging from starbursting disc-like systemswith l~10^12 l_sun, to the most highly star-forming mergers in the universe.

1206.5821	rapid coeval black hole and host galaxy growth in mrc 1138-262: the  hungry spider	we present a detailed study of the infrared spectral energy distribution ofthe high-redshift radio galaxy mrc 1138-26 at z = 2.156, also known as thespiderweb galaxy. by combining photometry from spitzer, herschel and laboca wefit the rest-frame 5-300 um emission using a two component, starburst andactive galactic nucleus (agn), model. the total infrared (8 - 1000 um)luminosity of this galaxy is (1.97+/-0.28)x10^13 lsun with (1.17+/-0.27) and(0.79+/-0.09)x10^13 lsun due to the agn and starburst components respectively.the high derived agn accretion rate of \sim20% eddington, and the measured starformation rate (sfr) of 1390pm150 msun/yr, suggest that this massive system isin a special phase of rapid central black hole and host galaxy growth, likelycaused by a gas rich merger in a dense environment. the accretion rate issufficient to power both the jets and the previously observed large outflow.the high sfr and strong outflow suggest this galaxy could potentially exhaustits fuel for stellar growth in a few tens of myr, although the likely merger ofthe radio galaxy with nearby satellites suggest bursts of star formation mayrecur again on time scales of several hundreds of myr. the age of the radiolobes implies the jet started after the current burst of star formation, andtherefore we are possibly witnessing the transition from a merger-inducedstarburst phase to a radio-loud agn phase. we also note tentative evidence for[cii]158um emission. this paper marks the first results from the herschelgalaxy evolution project (project herge), a systematic study of theevolutionary state of 71 high redshift, 1 &lt; z &lt; 5.2, radio galaxies.

1303.2723	dusty starburst galaxies in the early universe as revealed by  gravitational lensing	in the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has beenrevolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty, starburst galaxies were1,000 times more abundant in the early universe than at present. it has,however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift 2 distribution ofthese objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z &gt; 4). here we report aredshift survey at a wavelength of three millimeters, targeting carbon monoxideline emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction ofextraordinarily bright millimetrewave-selected sources. high-resolution imagingdemonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed byforeground galaxies. we detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources andmultiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust,unambiguous redshifts. at least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z &gt; 4,indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts isgreater than previously thought. models of lens geometries in the sampleindicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies,powered by extreme bursts of star formation.

1303.2726	alma redshifts of millimeter-selected galaxies from the spt survey: the  redshift distribution of dusty star-forming galaxies	using the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma), we haveconducted a blind redshift survey in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission windowfor 26 strongly lensd dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected with thesouth pole telescope (spt). the sources were selected to have s_1.4mm&gt;20 mjyand a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio(s_843mhz&lt;6mjy) or far-infrared counterparts (s_100um&lt;1 jy, s_60um&lt;200mjy). werobustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshiftedemission lines of 12co, 13co, [ci], h2o, and h2o+. we find one or more spectralfeatures in 23 sources yielding a ~90% detection rate for this survey; in 12 ofthese sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only asingle line. for the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshiftdegeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or inferthe most likely line identification based on photometric data. this yieldssecure redshifts for ~70% of the sample. the three sources with no linesdetected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.0. theresulting mean redshift of our sample is &lt;z&gt;=3.5. this finding is in contrastto the redshift distribution of radio-identified dsfgs, which have asignificantly lower mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;=2.3 and for which only 10-15% of thepopulation is expected to be at z&gt;3. we discuss the effect of gravitationallensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshiftdistribution to that of models in the literature.

1501.02985	the herschel comprehensive (u)lirg emission survey (hercules): co  ladders, fine structure lines, and neutral gas cooling	(ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs) are objects characterized bytheir extreme infrared (8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosities ($l_{lirg}&gt;10^{11}$l$_\odot$ and $l_{ulirg}&gt;10^{12}$ l$_\odot$). the herschel comprehensive ulirgemission survey (hercules; pi van der werf) presents a representativeflux-limited sample of 29 (u)lirgs that spans the full luminosity range ofthese objects (10$^{11}\leq l_\odot \geq10^{13}$). with the \emph{herschelspace observatory}, we observe [cii] 157 $\mu$m, [oi] 63 $\mu$m, and [oi] 145$\mu$m line emission with pacs, co j=4-3 through j=13-12, [ci] 370 $\mu$m, and[ci] 609 $\mu$m with spire, and low-j co transitions with ground-basedtelescopes. the co ladders of the sample are separated into three classes basedon their excitation level. in 13 of the galaxies, the [oi] 63 $\mu$m emissionline is self absorbed. comparing the co excitation to the iras 60/100 $\mu$mratio and to far infrared luminosity, we find that the co excitation is morecorrelated to the far infrared colors. we present cooling budgets for thegalaxies and find fine-structure line flux deficits in the [cii], [siii], [oi],and [ci] lines in the objects with the highest far ir fluxes, but do notobserve this for co $4\leq j_{upp}\leq13$. in order to study the heating of themolecular gas, we present a combination of three diagnostic quantities to helpdetermine the dominant heating source. using the co excitation, the co j=1-0linewidth, and the agn contribution, we conclude that galaxies with large colinewidths always have high-excitation co ladders, and often low agncontributions, suggesting that mechanical heating is important.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

astro-ph;0108399	lens magnification by cl0024+1654 in the u and r band	[abridged] we estimate the total mass distribution of the galaxy clustercl0024+1654 from the measured source depletion due to lens magnification in ther band. within a radius of 0.54mpc/h, a total projected mass of(8.1+/-3.2)*10^14 m_sol/h (eds) is measured, which corresponds to a mass-to-light ratio of m/l(b)=470+/-180. we compute the luminosity function ofcl0024+1654 in order to estimate contamination of the background source countsfrom cluster galaxies. three different magnification-based reconstructionmethods are employed using both local and non-local techniques. we havemodified the standard single power-law slope number count theory to incorporatea break and applied this to our observations. fitting analytical magnificationprofiles of different cluster models to the observed number counts, we findthat the cluster is best described either by a nfw model with scale radiusr_s=334+/-191 kpc/h and normalisation kappa_s=0.23+/-0.08 or a power-lawprofile with slope xi=0.61+/-0.11, central surface mass densitykappa_0=1.52+/-0.20 and assuming a core radius of r_core=35 kpc/h. the nfwmodel predicts that the cumulative projected mass contained within a radius rscales as m(&lt;r)=2.9*10^14*(r/1')^[1.3-0.5lg (r/1')] m_sol/h. finally, we haveexploited the fact that flux magnification effectively enables us to probedeeper than the physical limiting magnitude of our observations in searchingfor a change of slope in the u band number counts. we rule out both a totalflattening of the counts with a break up to u_ab&lt;=26.6 and a change of slope,reported by some studies, from dlog n/dm=0.4-&gt;0.15 up to u_ab&lt;=26.4 with 95%confidence.

astro-ph;0503055	an interferometric co survey of luminous submm galaxies	in this paper we present results from an iram plateau de bure millimetre-waveinterferometer (pdbi) survey for co emission towards radio-detectedsubmillimetre galaxies (smgs) with known optical and near-infraredspectroscopic redshifts. five sources in the redshift range z~1-3.5 weredetected, nearly doubling the number of smgs detected in co. we summarise theproperties of all 12 co-detected smgs, as well as 6 sources not detected in coby our survey, and use this sample to explore the bulk physical properties ofthe smg population as a whole. the median co line luminosity of the smgs is&lt;l_co&gt; = (3.8 +- 2.0) x 10^10 k km/s pc^2. using a co-to-h_2 conversion factorappropriate for starburst galaxies, this corresponds to a molecular gas mass&lt;m(h_2)&gt; = (3.0 +- 1.6) x 10^10 msun within a ~2kpc radius, about four timesgreater than the most luminous local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)but comparable to that of the most extreme high-redshift radio galaxies andqsos. the median co fwhm linewidth is broad, &lt;fwhm&gt; = 780 +- 320 km/s, and thesmgs often have double peaked line profiles, indicative of either a merger or adisk. from their median gas reservoirs (~3 x 10^10 msun) and star-formationrates (&gt;700 msun/yr) we estimate a lower limit on the typical gas-depletiontime scale of &gt;40myr in smgs. this is marginally below the typical age expectedfor the starbursts in smgs, and suggests that negative feedback processes mayplay an important role in prolonging the gas consumption time scale. we find astatistically-significant correlation between the far-infrared and columinosities of the smgs which extends the observed correlation for localulirgs to higher luminosities and higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0509364	350 micron sharc-ii imaging of luminous high-z radio galaxies	using the filled bolometer array sharc-ii on the caltech submillimeterobservatory (cso), we have obtained deep (rms ~ 15mjy/beam), high-quality 350micron maps of five of the most luminous high-z radio galaxies known. in allcases the central radio galaxy is detected at the &gt;3sigma level, and in somecases the high resolution of sharc-ii (fwhm ~ 9") allows us to confirm thespatially extended nature of the dust emission. in pks1138-262 (z=2.156),8c1909+722 (z=3.538) and 4c41.17 (z=3.792), additional sources -- firstdiscovered by scuba at 850 micron and believed to be dusty, merging systemsassociated with the central radio galaxy -- are detected at 350 micron.furthermore, in pks1138 and 4c41.17 additional sharc-ii sources are seen whichwere not detected at 850 micron, although the reality of these sources willhave to be confirmed by independent submm observations. thus, our observationsseem to support the notion of extended star formation taking place in radiogalaxies at high redshifts, and that these systems sit at the centers ofoverdense regions harbouring a complexity of dusty and vigorously star formingsystems. at the redshift of the radio galaxies, the 350 micron observationssample very close to the rest-frame dust peak (typically at ~100 micron), andthey therefore contribute a particularly important point to the spectral energydistributions of these sources, which we use this in conjunction with existing(sub)millimeter data to derive fir luminosities, dust temperatures and spectralemissivities of the central radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0509898	a robust sample of submillimetre galaxies: constraints on the prevalence  of dusty, high-redshift starbursts	the modest significance of most sources detected in current submm surveys canpotentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sourcesin catalogues typically selected at &gt;3.0-3.5sigma. here, we develop and apply adual-survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole.cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of smgs is more robust than previous samples,with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint smgs (beneath and around theconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. the effective fluxlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-ghz image. the former issensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latterprobes the z&lt;3 regime. a high fraction of our robust smgs (~80%) have radiocounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggeststhat very distant smgs (z&gt;&gt;3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of thebright smg population. this implies that almost all of the bright smgpopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. we usethese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positionaluncertainty in smg catalogues. we then go on to outline the acquisition ofredshifts for radio-identified smgs, from sample selection in the submm, tocounterpart selection in the radio and optical/ir, to slit placement onspectrograph masks. we determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample ofsix secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/orless reliable redshifts. these figures are consistent with previous estimates,suggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright smgs populationhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.

astro-ph;0607089	observing cold gas in submillimeter galaxies: detection of co(1-0)  emission in smm j13120+4242 with the green bank telescope	we report the first detection of co(1-0) emission from asubmillimeter-selected galaxy, using the green bank telescope. we identify theline in the spectrum of smm j13120+4242 as a broad emission feature at z=3.408,with delta(v_fwhm)=1040 +/- 190 km/s. if the observed co(1-0) line profilearises from a single object and not several merging objects, then theco(4-3)/co(1-0) brightness temperature ratio of ~0.26 suggests n(h_2) &gt; 3-10 x10^2 cm^-3 and the presence of sub-thermally excited gas. the integrated lineflux implies a cold molecular gas mass m(h_2)=1.6 x 10^11 m_sun, comparable tothe dynamical mass estimate and 4 times larger than the h_2 mass predicted fromthe co(4-3) line assuming a brightness temperature ratio of 1.0. while ourobservations confirm that this submillimeter galaxy is massive and gas-rich,they also suggest that extrapolating gas masses from j_upper &gt;= 3 transitionsof co leads to considerable uncertainties. we also report an upper limit to themass of cold molecular gas in a second submillimeter galaxy, smm j09431+4700,of m(h_2)&lt; 4 x 10^10 m_sun.

astro-ph;0607365	a search for dense gas in luminous submillimeter galaxies with the 100-m  green bank telescope	we report deep k-band (18-27ghz) observations with the 100-m green banktelescope of hcn(1-0) line emission towards the two submillimeter-selectedgalaxies (smgs) smmj02399-0136 (z=2.81) and smmj16359+6612 (z=2.52). for bothsources we have obtained spectra with channel-to-channel rms noise of &lt;=0.5mjy,resulting in velocity-integrated line fluxes better than &lt; 0.1 jy km/s,although we do not detect either source. such sensitive observations -- aidedby gravitational lensing of the sources -- permit us to put upper limits ofl_hcn(1-0) &lt; 2x10^10 k km/s pc^2 on the intrinsic hcn(1-0) line luminosities ofthe two smgs. the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for all three smgs withsensitive hcn(1-0) observations to date are found to be consistent with thetight fir-hcn luminosity correlation observed in galactic molecular clouds,quiescent spirals and (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies in the local universe.thus, the observed hcn luminosities remain in accordance with what is expectedfrom the universal star formation efficiency per dense molecular gas massimplied by the aforementioned correlation, and more sensitive observations withtoday's large aperture radio telescopes hold the promise of detecting hcn(1-0)emission in similar objects in the distant universe.

astro-ph;0608683	co line emission from lyman break galaxies. cosmological simulations and  predictions for alma	[abridged] the detection of the rotational lines of co in proto-galaxies inthe early universe provides one of the most promising ways of probing thefundamental physical properties of a galaxy, such as its size, dynamical mass,gas density, and temperature. while such observations are currently limited tothe most luminous galaxies, the advent of alma will change the situationdramatically, resulting in the detection of numerous normal galaxies at highredshifts. maps and spectra of rotational co line emission were calculated froma cosmological n-body/hydrodynamical treesph simulation of a z ~ 3 "lyman breakgalaxy'' of uv luminosity about one order of magnitude below l*. to simulate atypical observation of our system with alma, we imposed characteristic noise,angular, and spectral resolution constraints. the co line properties predictedby our simulation are in good agreement with the two lyman break systemsdetected in co to date. we find that while supernovae explosions from theongoing star formation carve out large cavities in the molecular ism, they donot generate large enough gas outflows to make a substantial imprint on the coline profile. this implies that for most proto-galaxies - except possibly themost extreme cases - stellar feedback effects do not affect co as a dynamicalmass tracer. detecting co in sub-l* galaxies at z ~3 will push alma to thelimits of its cababilities, and whether a source is detected or not may dependcritically on its inclination angle. both these effects (sensitivity andinclination) will severely impair the ability of alma to infer the gaskinematics and dynamical masses using line observations.

astro-ph;0609039	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- ii. submillimetre  maps, catalogue and number counts	we present the maps, source catalogue and number counts of the largest, mostcomplete and unbiased extragalactic submillimetre survey ever undertaken: the850-micron scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades). using thesubmillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt), shades mapped two separate regions of sky: thesubaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf) and the lockman hole east (lh). these scubamaps cover 720 square arcmin with an rms noise level of about 2 mjy and haveuncovered &gt;100 submillimetre galaxies. in order to ensure the utmost robustnessof the resulting source catalogue, data reduction was independently carried outby four sub-groups drawn within the shades team, providing an unprecedenteddegree of reliability with respect to other scuba catalogues available from theliterature. individual source lists from the four groups were combined toproduce a robust 120-object shades catalogue; an invaluable resource forfollow-up campaigns aiming to study the properties of a complete and consistentsample of submillimetre galaxies. we present differential and integral sourcenumber counts of submillimetre galaxies and find that the differential countsare better fit with a broken power-law or a schechter function than with asingle power-law; the shades data alone significantly show that a break isrequired at several mjy, although the precise position of the break is not wellconstrained. we also find that an 850-micron survey complete down to 2 mjywould resolve 20-30 per cent of the far-ir background into point sources.[abridged]

astro-ph;0609826	dense molecular gas in extreme starburst galaxies - what will we learn  from herschel?	ultra luminous infra-red galaxies (ulirgs) -- gas-rich mergers harboring themost extreme star-forming conditions encountered in the local universe -- arethought to re-enact the galaxy formation processes we are only barely able toglimpse in the distant universe. combining new single-dish molecular lineobservations of 12co, 13co, hco+, hcn, and cs towards the two ulirgs arp220 andngc6240 with existing data in the literature, we have compiled the mostextensive molecular line data-sets to date of such galaxies. the data allow usto put strong constraints on the properties of the dense star forming gas inthese two systems, and compare the relative usefulness of cs, hcn and hco+ astracers of dense gas. in addition, we have build molecular line templates basedon our observations, and demonstrate that herschel/hi-fi will be able to detectthe high-j transitions of most of the above molecules in a large sample ofulirgs out to z&lt;=0.5, assuming arp220 and ngc6240 are representative of theulirg population at these redshifts.

astro-ph;0610378	molecular gas in extreme star-forming environments: the starbursts  arp220 and ngc6240 as case studies	we report single-dish multi-transition measurements of the 12^co, hcn, andhco^+ molecular line emission as well as hnc j=1-0 and hnco in the twoultraluminous infra-red galaxies arp220 and ngc6240. using this new molecularline inventory, in conjunction with existing data in the literature, wecompiled the most extensive molecular line data sets to date for such galaxies.the many rotational transitions, with their different excitation requirements,allow the study of the molecular gas over a wide range of different densitiesand temperatures with significant redundancy, and thus allow good constraintson the properties of the dense gas in these two systems. the mass (~(1-2) x10^10 msun) of dense gas (&gt;10^5-6 cm^-3) found accounts for the bulk of theirmolecular gas mass, and is consistent with most of their ir luminositiespowered by intense star bursts while self-regulated by o,b star clusterradiative pressure onto the star-forming dense molecular gas. the highlyexcited hcn transitions trace a gas phase ~(10-100)x denser than that of thesub-thermally excited hco^+ lines (for both galaxies). these two phases areconsistent with an underlying density-size power law found for galactic gmcs(but with a steeper exponent), with hcn lines tracing denser and more compactregions than hco^+. whether this is true in ir-luminous, star forming galaxiesin general remains to be seen, and underlines the need for observations ofmolecular transitions with high critical densities for a sample of bright(u)lirgs in the local universe -- a task for which the hi-fi instrument onboard herschel is ideally suited to do.

astro-ph;0702463	350 micron observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies at  intermediate redshifts	we present 350micron observations of 36 ultraluminous infrared galaxies(ulirgs) at intermediate redshifts (0.089 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.926) using thesubmillimeter high angular resolution camera ii (sharc-ii) on the caltechsubmillimeter observatory (cso). in total, 28 sources are detected at s/n &gt;= 3,providing the first flux measurements longward of 100micron for a statisticallysignificant sample of ulirgs in the redshift range of 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. combiningour 350micron flux measurements with the existing iras 60 and 100micron data,we fit a single-temperature model to the spectral energy distribution (sed),and thereby estimate dust temperatures and far-ir luminosities. assuming anemissivity index of beta = 1.5, we find a median dust temperature and far-irluminosity of td = 42.8+-7.1k and log(lfir/lsolar) = 12.2+-0.5, respectively.the far-ir/radio correlation observed in local star-forming galaxies is foundto hold for ulirgs in the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.5, suggesting that thedust in these sources is predominantly heated by starbursts. we compare thefar-ir luminosities and dust temperatures derived for dusty galaxy samples atlow and high redshifts with our sample of ulirgs at intermediate redshift. ageneral lfir-td relation is observed, albeit with significant scatter, due todiffering selection effects and variations in dust mass and grain properties.the relatively high dust temperatures observed for our sample compared to thatof high-z submillimeter-selected starbursts with similar far-ir luminositiessuggest that the dominant star formation in ulirgs at moderate redshifts takesplace on smaller spatial scales than at higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.
