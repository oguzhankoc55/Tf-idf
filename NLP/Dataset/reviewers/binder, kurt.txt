0910.3168	multiscale modeling of polymers at interfaces	a brief review of modeling and simulation methods for a study of polymers atinterfaces is provided. when studying truly multiscale problems as provided byrealistic polymer systems, coarse graining is practically unavoidable. in thisprocess, degrees of freedom on smaller scales are eliminated to the favor of amodel suitable for efficient study of the system behavior on larger length andtime scales. we emphasize the need to distinguish between dynamic and staticproperties regarding the model validation. a model which accurately reproducesstatic properties may fail completely, when it comes to the dynamic behavior ofthe system. furthermore, we comment on the use of monte carlo method in polymerscience as compared to molecular dynamics simulations. using the latterapproach, we also discuss results of recent computer simulations on theproperties of polymers close to solid substrates. this includes both genericfeatures (as also observed in the case of simpler molecular models) as well aspolymer specific properties. predictive power of computer simulations ishighlighted by providing experimental evidence for these observations. someimportant implications of these results for an understanding of mechanicalproperties of thin polymer films and coatings are also worked out.

0912.0897	out of equilibrium characteristics of a forced translocating chain  through a nanopore	polymer translocation through a nano-pore in a thin membrane is studied usinga coarse-grained bead-spring model and langevin dynamics simulation with aparticular emphasis to explore out of equilibrium characteristics of thetranslocating chain. we analyze the out of equilibrium chain conformations bothat the $cis$ and the $trans$ side separately either as a function of the timeduring the translocation process or as as function of the monomer index $m$inside the pore. a detailed picture of translocation emerges by monitoring thecenter of mass of the translocating chain, longitudinal and transversecomponents of the gyration radii and the end to end vector. we observe thatpolymer configurations at the $cis$ side are distinctly different from those atthe $trans$ side. during the translocation, and immediately afterwards, thechain is clearly out of equilibrium, as different parts of the chain arecharacterized by a series of effective flory exponents. we further notice thatimmediately after the translocation the last set of beads that have justtranslocated take a relatively compact structure compared to the first set ofbeads that translocated earlier, and the chain immediately after translocationis described by an effective flory exponent $0.45 \pm 0.01$. the analysis ofthese results is further strengthened by looking at the conformations of chainsegments of equal length as they cross from the $cis$ to the $trans$ side, wediscuss implications of these results to the theoretical estimates andnumerical simulation studies of the translocation exponent reported by variousgroups.

0704.1857	what is the order of 2d polymer escape transition?	an end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistonsundergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-likeconformation when the number of monomers in the chain, n, reaches a criticalvalue. in 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chainconfined inside a strip of finite length 2l transform the coil conformationinto a linear string of blobs. however, the blob picture raises questions onthe nature of this escape transition. to check the theoretical predictionsbased on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excludedvolume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length  2l and width h by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with thepruned-enriched-rosenbluth method (perm). we estimate the free energy, theend-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter,and its distribution. it is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large nand l but finite l/n, there is a small but finite jump in several averagecharacteristics, including the order parameter. we also present a theoreticaldescription based on the landau free energy approach, which is in goodagreement with the simulation results. both simulation results and theanalytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-orderphase transition.

1005.5099	two-state protein-like folding of a homopolymer chain	many small proteins fold via a first-order "all-or-none" transition directlyfrom an expanded coil to a compact native state. here we study an analogousdirect freezing transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite for asimple flexible homopolymer. wang-landau sampling is used to construct the 1ddensity of states for square-well chains of length 128. analysis within boththe micro-canonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain withsufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition ispreempted by a direct freezing or "folding" transition. a 2d free-energylandscape, built via subsequent multi-canonical sampling, reveals a dominantfolding pathway over a single free-energy barrier. this barrier separates ahigh entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallitestates and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-statefolding nucleus. despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, thethermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to thethermodynamics of two-state protein folding. the model chain satisfies thevan't hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding and an arrheniusanalysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a chevron plotcharacteristic of small proteins.

1006.5843	capillary condensation in cylindrical pores: monte carlo study of the  interplay of surface and finite size effects	when a fluid that undergoes a vapor to liquid transition in the bulk isconfined to a long cylindrical pore, the phase transition is shifted (mostlydue to surface effects at the walls of the pore) and rounded (due to finitesize effects). the nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends onthe length of the pore: for very long pores the system is axially homogeneousat low temperatures. at the chemical potential where the transition takes placefluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder asa whole. at somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality)the system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multi-domainstate, where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate.using monte carlo simulations for the ising/lattice gas model and theasakura-oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between thesetwo different scenarios is characterized. it is shown that the densitydistribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peakshape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibriumdomain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. the (rounded)transition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axialcorrelation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinderdiameter. it is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when thetransition from the simple domain state to the multi-domain state of thecylindrical pore occurs. we predict that the difference between the porecritical temperature and the hysteresis critical emperature should increaselogarithmically with the length of the pore.

1009.0321	does young's equation hold on the nanoscale? a monte carlo test for the  binary lennard-jones fluid	when a phase-separated binary ($a+b$) mixture is exposed to a wall, thatpreferentially attracts one of the components, interfaces between a-rich andb-rich domains in general meet the wall making a contact angle $\theta$.young's equation describes this angle in terms of a balance between the $a-b$interfacial tension $\gamma_{ab}$ and the surface tensions $\gamma_{wa}$,$\gamma_{wb}$ between, respectively, the $a$- and $b$-rich phases and the wall,$\gamma _{ab} \cos \theta =\gamma_{wa}-\gamma_{wb}$. by monte carlo simulationsof bridges, formed by one of the components in a binary lennard-jones liquid,connecting the two walls of a nanoscopic slit pore, $\theta$ is estimated fromthe inclination of the interfaces, as a function of the wall-fluid interactionstrength. the information on the surface tensions $\gamma_{wa}$, $\gamma_{wb}$are obtained independently from a new thermodynamic integration method, while$\gamma_{ab}$ is found from the finite-size scaling analysis of theconcentration distribution function. we show that young's equation describesthe contact angles of the actual nanoscale interfaces for this model ratheraccurately and location of the (first order) wetting transition is estimated.

1009.3451	conformational studies of bottle-brush polymers absorbed on a flat solid  surface	the adsorption of a bottle-brush polymer end-grafted with one chain end ofits backbone to a flat substrate surface is studied by monte carlo simulationof a coarse-grained model, that previously has been characterized in the bulk,assuming a dilute solution under good solvent conditions. applying the bondfluctuation model on the simple cubic lattice, we vary the backbone chainlength $n_b$ from $n_b=67$ to $n_b = 259$ effective monomeric units, the sidechain length $n$ from n=6 to n=48, and the grafting density $\sigma=1$, i.e.,parameters that correspond well to the experimentally accessible range. whenthe adsorption energy strength $\epsilon$ is varied, we find that theadsorption transition (which becomes well-defined in the limit $n_b \rightarrow\infty$, for arbitrary finite $n$) roughly occurs at the same value$\epsilon_c$ as for ordinary linear chains (n=0), at least within ourstatistical errors. mean square end-to-end distances and gyration radii of theside chains are obtained, as well as the monomer density profile in thedirection perpendicular to the adsorbing surface. we show that for longer sidechains the adsorption of bottle-brushes is a two step process, the decrease ofthe perpendicular linear dimension of side chains with adsorption energystrength can even be non-monotonic. also the behavior of the static structurefactor $s(q)$ is analyzed, evidence for a quasi-two-dimensional scaling ispresented, and consequences for the interpretation of experiments arediscussed.

1103.2241	monte carlo methods for estimating interfacial free energies and line  tensions	excess contributions to the free energy due to interfaces occur for manyproblems encountered in the statistical physics of condensed matter whencoexistence between different phases is possible (e.g. wetting phenomena,nucleation, crystal growth, etc.). this article reviews two methods to estimateboth interfacial free energies and line tensions by monte carlo simulations ofsimple models, (e.g. the ising model, a symmetrical binary lennard-jones fluidexhibiting a miscibility gap, and a simple lennard-jones fluid). one method isbased on thermodynamic integration. this method is useful to study flat andinclined interfaces for ising lattices, allowing also the estimation of linetensions of three-phase contact lines, when the interfaces meet walls (where"surface fields" may act). a generalization to off-lattice systems is describedas well.  the second method is based on the sampling of the order parameterdistribution of the system throughout the two-phase coexistence region of themodel. both the interface free energies of flat interfaces and of (spherical orcylindrical) droplets (or bubbles) can be estimated, including also systemswith walls, where sphere-cap shaped wall-attached droplets occur. thecurvature-dependence of the interfacial free energy is discussed, and estimatesfor the line tensions are compared to results from the thermodynamicintegration method. basic limitations of all these methods are criticallydiscussed, and an outlook on other approaches is given.

1103.4069	hard sphere fluids confined between soft repulsive walls: a comparative  study using monte carlo and density functional methods	hard-sphere fluids confined between parallel plates a distance $d$ apart arestudied for a wide range of packing fractions, including also the onset ofcrystallization, applying monte carlo simulation techniques and densityfunctional theory. the walls repel the hard spheres (of diameter $\sigma$) witha weeks-chandler-andersen (wca) potential $v_{wca}(z) = 4 \epsilon[(\sigma_w/z)^{12}-(\sigma_w/z)^6 + 1/4]$, with range $\sigma_w = \sigma/2$. wevary the strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range and the case of simple hardwalls is also treated for comparison. by the variation of $\epsilon$ one canchange both the surface excess packing fraction and the wall-fluid$(\gamma_{wf})$ and wall-crystal $(\gamma_{wc})$ surface free energies. severaldifferent methods to extract $\gamma_{wf}$ and $\gamma_{wc}$ from monte carlo(mc) simulations are implemented, and their accuracy and efficiency iscomparatively discussed. the density functional theory (dft) using fundamentalmeasure functionals is found to be quantitatively accurate over a wide range ofpacking fractions; small deviations between dft and mc near the fluid tocrystal transition need to be studied further. our results on density profilesnear soft walls could be useful to interpret corresponding experiments withsuitable colloidal dispersions.

1105.1949	mesophase formation in two-component cylindrical bottle-brush polymers	when two types of side chains (a,b) are densely grafted to a (stiff) backboneand the resulting bottle-brush polymer is in a solution under poor solventconditions, an incompatibility between a and b leads to microphase separationin the resulting cylindrical brush. the possible types of ordering arereminiscent of the ordering of block copolymers in cylindrical confinement.starting from this analogy, leibler's theory of microphase separation in blockcopolymer melts is generalized to derive a description of the system in theweak segregation limit. also molecular dynamics simulation results of acorresponding coarse-grained bead-spring model are presented. using side chainlengths up to n = 50 effective monomers, the ratio of the lennard-jones energyparameter between unlike monomers $(\epsilon_{ab})$ and monomers of the samekind $(\epsilon _{aa} = \epsilon_{bb})$ is varied. various correlationfunctions are analyzed to study the conditions when (local) janus cylinder-typeordering and when (local) microphase separation in the direction along thecylinder axis occurs. both the analytical theory and the simulations giveevidence for short range order due to a tendency towards microphase separationin the axial direction, with a wavelength proportional to the side chaingyration radius, irrespective of temperature and grafting density, for a widerange of these parameters.

1110.1410	stretching semiflexible polymer chains: evidence for the importance of  excluded volume effects from monte carlo simulation	semiflexible macromolecules in dilute solution under very good solventconditions are modeled by self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice($d=3$ dimensions) and square lattice ($d=2$ dimensions), varying chainstiffness by an energy penalty $\epsilon_b$ for chain bending. in the absenceof excluded volume interactions, the persistence length $\ell_p$ of thepolymers would then simply be $\ell_p=\ell_b(2d-2)^{-1}q_b^{-1}$ with $q_b=\exp(-\epsilon_b/k_bt)$, the bond length $\ell_b$ being the lattice spacing,and $k_bt$ is the thermal energy. using monte carlo simulations applying thepruned-enriched rosenbluth method (perm), both $q_b$ and the chain length $n$are varied over a wide range $(0.005 \leq q_b \leq 1, \; n \leq 50000$), andalso a stretching force $f$ is applied to one chain end (fixing the other endat the origin). in the absence of this force, in $d=2$ a single crossover fromrod-like behavior (for contour lengths less than $\ell_p$) to swollen coilsoccurs, invalidating the kratky-porod model, while in $d=3$ a double crossoveroccurs, from rods to gaussian coils (as implied by the kratky-porod model) andthen to coils that are swollen due to the excluded volume interaction. if thestretching force is applied, excluded volume interactions matter for the forceversus extension relation irrespective of chain stiffness in $d=2$, whiletheories based on the kratky-porod model are found to work in $d=3$ for stiffchains in an intermediate regime of chain extensions. while for $q_b \ll 1$ inthis model a persistence length can be estimated from the initial decay ofbond-orientational correlations, it is argued that this is not possible formore complex wormlike chains (e.g. bottle-brush polymers). consequences for theproper interpretation of experiments are briefly discussed.

1203.1794	transitions between imperfectly ordered crystalline structures: a phase  switch monte carlo study	a model for two-dimensional colloids confined laterally by "structuredboundaries" (i.e., ones that impose a periodicity along the slit) is studied bymonte carlo simulations. when the distance d between the confining walls isreduced at constant particle number from an initial value d_0, for which acrystalline structure commensurate with the imposed periodicity fits, tosmaller values, a succession of phase transitions to imperfectly orderedstructures occur. these structures have a reduced number of rows parallel tothe boundaries (from n to n-1 to n-2 etc.) and are accompanied by an almostperiodic strain pattern, due to "soliton staircases" along the boundaries.since standard simulation studies of such transitions are hampered by hugehysteresis effects, we apply the phase switch monte carlo method to estimatethe free energy difference between the structures as a function of the misfitbetween d and d_0, thereby locating where the transitions occurs inequilibrium. for comparison, we also obtain this free energy difference from athermodynamic integration method: the results agree, but the effort required toobtain the same accuracy as provided by phase switch monte carlo would be atleast three orders of magnitude larger. we also show for a situation whereseveral "candidate structures" exist for a phase, that phase switch monte carlocan clearly distinguish the metastable structures from the stable one. finally,applying the method in the conjugate statistical ensemble (where the normalpressure conjugate to d is taken as an independent control variable) we showthat the standard equivalence between the conjugate ensembles of statisticalmechanics is violated.

1203.3716	simulation of fluid-solid coexistence in finite volumes: a method to  study the properties of wall-attached crystalline nuclei	the asakura-oosawa model for colloid-polymer mixtures is studied by montecarlo simulations at densities inside the two-phase coexistence region of fluidand solid. choosing a geometry where the system is confined between two flatwalls, and a wall-colloid potential that leads to incomplete wetting of thecrystal at the wall, conditions can be created where a single nanoscopicwall-attached crystalline cluster coexists with fluid in the remainder of thesimulation box. following related ideas that have been useful to studyheterogeneous nucleation of liquid droplets at the vapor-liquid coexistence, weestimate the contact angles from observations of the crystalline clusters inthermal equilibrium. we find fair agreement with a prediction based on young'sequation, using estimates of interface and wall tension from the study of flatsurfaces. it is shown that the pressure versus density curve of the finitesystem exhibits a loop, but the pressure maximum signifies the "dropletevaporation-condensation" transition and thus has nothing in common with a vander waals-like loop. preparing systems where the packing fraction is deepinside the two-phase coexistence region, the system spontaneously forms a "slabstate", with two wall-attached crystalline domains separated by (flat)interfaces from liquid in full equilibrium with the crystal in between;analysis of such states allows a precise estimation of the bulk equilibriumproperties at phase coexistence.

1208.3617	scattering function of semiflexible polymer chains under good solvent  conditions	using the pruned-enriched rosenbluth monte carlo algorithm, the scatteringfunctions of semiflexible macromolecules in dilute solution under good solventconditions are estimated both in $d=2$ and $d=3$ dimensions, considering alsothe effect of stretching forces. using self-avoiding walks of up to $n = 25600$steps on the square and simple cubic lattices, variable chain stiffness ismodeled by introducing an energy penalty $\epsilon_b$ for chain bending;varying $q_b=\exp (- \epsilon_b/k_bt)$ from $q_b=1$ (completely flexiblechains) to $q_b = 0.005$, the persistence length can be varied over two ordersof magnitude. for unstretched semiflexible chains we test the applicability ofthe kratky-porod worm-like chain model to describe the scattering function, anddiscuss methods for extracting persistence length estimates from scattering.while in $d=2$ the direct crossover from rod-like chains to self-avoiding walksinvalidates the kratky-porod description, it holds in $d=3$ for stiff chains ifthe number of kuhn segments $n_k$ does not exceed a limiting value $n^*_k$(which depends on the persistence length). for stretched chains, the pincusblob size enters as a further characteristic length scale. the anisotropy ofthe scattering is well described by the modified debye function, if the actualobserved chain extension $&lt;x&gt;$ (end-to-end distance in the direction of theforce) as well as the corresponding longitudinal and transverse lineardimensions $&lt;x^2&gt; - &lt;x&gt;^2$, $&lt;r_{g,\bot}^2&gt;$ are used.

1305.0386	monte carlo tests of nucleation concepts in the lattice gas model	the conventional theory of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation in asupersaturated vapor is tested by monte carlo simulations of the lattice gas(ising) model with nearest-neighbor attractive interactions on the simple cubiclattice. the theory considers the nucleation process as a slow (quasi-static)cluster (droplet) growth over a free energy barrier $\delta f^*$, constructedin terms of a balance of surface and bulk term of a "critical droplet" ofradius $r^*$, implying that the rates of droplet growth and shrinkingessentially balance each other for droplet radius $r=r^*$. for heterogeneousnucleation at surfaces, the barrier is reduced by a factor depending on thecontact angle. using the definition of "physical" clusters based on thefortuin-kasteleyn mapping, the time-dependence of the cluster size distributionis studied for "quenching experiments" in the kinetic ising model, and thecluster size $\ell ^*$ where the cluster growth rate changes sign is estimated.these studies of nucleation kinetics are compared to studies where the relationbetween cluster size and supersaturation is estimated from equilibriumsimulations of phase coexistence between droplet and vapor in the canonicalensemble. the chemical potential is estimated from a lattice version of thewidom particle insertion method. for large droplets it is shown that the"physical clusters" have a volume consistent with the estimates from the leverrule. "geometrical clusters" (defined such that each site belonging to thecluster is occupied and has at least one occupied neighbor site) yield validresults only for temperatures less than 60% of the critical temperature, wherethe cluster shape is non-spherical. we show how the chemical potential can beused to numerically estimate $\delta f^*$ also for non-spherical clustershapes.

1406.0616	logarithmic finite-size effects on interfacial free energies:  phenomenological theory and monte carlo studies	the computation of interfacial free energies between coexisting phases(e.g.~saturated vapor and liquid) by computer simulation methods is still achallenging problem due to the difficulty of an atomistic identification of aninterface, and due to interfacial fluctuations on all length scales. theapproach to estimate the interfacial tension from the free energy excess of asystem with interfaces relative to corresponding single-phase systems does notsuffer from the first problem but still suffers from the latter. considering$d$-dimensional systems with interfacial area $l^{d-1}$ and linear dimension$l_z$ in the direction perpendicular to the interface, it is argued that theinterfacial fluctuations cause logarithmic finite-size effects of order $\ln(l) / l^{d-1}$ and order $\ln (l_z)/l ^{d-1}$, in addition to regularcorrections (with leading order $\text{const}/l^{d-1}$). a phenomenologicaltheory predicts that the prefactors of the logarithmic terms are universal (butdepend on the applied boundary conditions and the considered statisticalensemble). the physical origin of these corrections are the translationalentropy of the interface as a whole, "domain breathing" (coupling ofinterfacial fluctuations to the bulk order parameter fluctuations of thecoexisting domains), and capillary waves. using a new variant of the ensembleswitch method, interfacial tensions are found from monte carlo simulations of$d=2$ and $d=3$ ising models and a lennard jones fluid. the simulation resultsare fully consistent with the theoretical predictions.

0803.2845	dragging a polymer chain into a nanotube and subsequent release	we present a scaling theory and monte carlo (mc) simulation results for aflexible polymer chain slowly dragged by one end into a nanotube. we alsodescribe the situation when the completely confined chain is released andgradually leaves the tube. mc simulations were performed for a self-avoidinglattice model with a biased chain growth algorithm, the pruned-enrichedrosenbluth method. the nanotube is a long channel opened at one end and itsdiameter $d$ is much smaller than the size of the polymer coil in solution. weanalyze the following characteristics as functions of the chain end position$x$ inside the tube: the free energy of confinement, the average end-to-enddistance, the average number of imprisoned monomers, and the average stretchingof the confined part of the chain for various values of $d$ and for the numberof monomers in the chain, $n$. we show that when the chain end is dragged by acertain critical distance $x^*$ into the tube, the polymer undergoes afirst-order phase transition whereby the remaining free tail is abruptly suckedinto the tube. this is accompanied by jumps in the average size, the number ofimprisoned segments, and in the average stretching parameter. the criticaldistance scales as $x^*\sim nd^{1-1/\nu}$. the transition takes place whenapproximately 3/4 of the chain units are dragged into the tube. the theorypresented is based on constructing the landau free energy as a function of anorder parameter that provides a complete description of equilibrium andmetastable states. we argue that if the trapped chain is released with allmonomers allowed to fluctuate, the reverse process in which the chain leavesthe confinement occurs smoothly without any jumps. finally, we apply the theoryto estimate the lifetime of confined dna in metastable states in nanotubes.

0803.3507	spherically averaged versus angle-dependent interactions in quadrupolar  fluids	employing simplified models in computer simulation is on the one hand oftenenforced by computer time limitations but on the other hand it offers insightsinto the molecular properties determining a given physical phenomenon. weemploy this strategy to the determination of the phase behaviour of quadrupolarfluids, where we study the influence of omitting angular degrees of freedom ofmolecules via an effective spherically symmetric potential obtained from aperturbative expansion. comparing the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, vaporpressure at coexistence, interfacial tension between the coexisting phases,etc., as obtained from both the models with the full quadrupolar interactionsand the (approximate) isotropic interactions, we find discrepancies in thecritical region to be typically (such as in the case of carbon dioxide) of theorder of 4%. however, when the lennard-jones parameters are rescaled such thatcritical temperatures and critical densities of both models coincide with theexperimental results, almost perfect agreement between the above-mentionedproperties of both models is obtained. this result justifies the use ofisotropic quadrupolar potentials. we present also a detailed comparison of oursimulations with a combined integral equation/density functional approach andshow that the latter provides an accurate description except for the vicinityof the critical point.

1409.3623	transitions of tethered chain molecules under tension	an applied tension force changes the equilibrium conformations of a polymerchain tethered to a planar substrate and thus affects the adsorption transitionas well as the coil-globule and crystallization transitions. conversely,solvent quality and surface attraction are reflected in equilibriumforce-extension curves that can be measured in experiments. to investigatethese effects theoretically, we study tethered chains under tension withwang-landau simulations of a bond-fluctuation lattice model. applying our modelto pulling experiments on biological molecules we obtain a good description ofexperimental data in the intermediate force range, where universal featuresdominate and finite size effects are small. for tethered chains in poorsolvent, we observe the predicted two-phase coexistence at transitions from theglobule to stretched conformations and also discover direct transitions fromcrystalline to stretched conformations. a phase portrait for finite chainsconstructed by evaluating the density of states for a broad range of solventconditions and tensions shows how increasing tension leads to a disappearanceof the globular phase. for chains in good solvents tethered to hard andattractive surfaces we find the predicted scaling with the chain length in thelow-force regime and show that our results are well described by an analytical,independent-bond approximation for the bond-fluctuation model for the highesttensions. finally, for a hard or slightly attractive surface the stretching ofa tethered chain is a conformational change that does not correspond to a phasetransition. however, when the surface attraction is sufficient to adsorb achain it will undergo a desorption transition at a critical value of theapplied force. our results for force-induced desorption show the transition tobe discontinuous with partially desorbed conformations in the coexistenceregion.

0804.2654	comparative classical and ab initio molecular dynamics study of molten  and glassy germanium dioxide	a molecular dynamics (md) study of static and dynamic properties of moltenand glassy germanium dioxide is presented. the interactions between the atomsare modelled by the classical pair potential proposed by oeffner and elliott(oe) [oeffner r d and elliott s r 1998, phys. rev. b, 58, 14791]. we compareour results to experiments and previous simulations. in addition, an ab initiomethod, the so-called car-parrinello molecular dynamics (cpmd), is applied tocheck the accuracy of the structural properties, as obtained by the classicalmd simulations with the oe potential. as in a similar study for sio2, thestructure predicted by cpmd is only slightly softer than that resulting fromthe classical md. in contrast to earlier simulations, both the static structureand dynamic properties are in very good agreement with pertinent experimentaldata. md simulations with the oe potential are also used to study therelaxation dynamics. as previously found for sio2, for high temperatures thedynamics of molten geo2 is compatible with a description in terms of modecoupling theory.

0804.2657	confinement effects on phase behavior of soft matter systems	when systems that can undergo phase separation between two coexisting phasesin the bulk are confined in thin film geometry between parallel walls, thephase behavior can be profoundly modified. these phenomena shall be describedand exemplified by computer simulations of the asakura-oosawa model forcolloid-polymer mixtures, but applications to other soft matter systems (e.g.confined polymer blends) will also be mentioned. typically a wall will preferone of the phases, and hence the composition of the system in the directionperpendicular to the walls will not be homogeneous. if both walls are of thesame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the systemin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenonof "capillary condensation" of simple fluids in thin capillaries. in the caseof "competing walls", where both walls prefer different phases of the twophases coexisting in the bulk, a state with an interface parallel to the wallsgets stabilized. the transition from the disordered phase to this "soft modephase" is rounded by the finite thickness of the film and not a sharp phasetransition. however, a sharp transition can occur where this interface getslocalized at (one of) the walls. the relation of this interface localizationtransition to wetting phenomena is discussed. finally, an outlook to relatedphenomena is given, such as the effects of confinement in cylindrical pores onthe phase behavior, and more complicated ordering phenomena (lamellarmesophases of block copolymers or nematic phases of liquid crystals underconfinement).

0807.4597	from capillary condensation to interface localization transitions in  colloid polymer mixtures confined in thin film geometry	monte carlo simulations of the asakura-oosawa (ao) model for colloid-polymermixtures confined between two parallel repulsive structureless walls arepresented and analyzed in the light of current theories on capillarycondensation and interface localization transitions. choosing a polymer tocolloid size ratio of q=0.8 and studying ultrathin films in the range of d=3 tod=10 colloid diameters thickness, grand canonical monte carlo methods are used;phase transitions are analyzed via finite size scaling, as in previous work onbulk systems and under confinement between identical types of walls. unlike thelatter work, inequivalent walls are used here: while the left wall has ahard-core repulsion for both polymers and colloids, at the right wall anadditional square-well repulsion of variable strength acting only on thecolloids is present. we study how the phase separation into colloid-rich andcolloid-poor phases occurring already in the bulk is modified by such aconfinement. when the asymmetry of the wall-colloid interaction increases, thecharacter of the transition smoothly changes from capillary condensation-typeto interface localization-type. the critical behavior of these transitions isdiscussed, as well as the colloid and polymer density profiles across the filmin the various phases, and the correlation of interfacial fluctuations in thedirection parallel to the confining walls. the experimental observability ofthese phenomena also is briefly discussed.

0808.1485	structure of bottle-brush polymers in solution: a monte carlo test of  models for the scattering function	extensive monte carlo results are presented for a lattice model of abottle-brush polymer under good solvent or theta solvent conditions. varyingthe side chain length, backbone length, and the grafting density for a rigidstraight backbone, both radial density profiles of monomers and side chain endsare obtained, as well as structure factors describing the scattering from asingle side chain and from the total bottle-brush polymer. to describe thestructure in the interior of a very long bottle-brush, a periodic boundarycondition in the direction along the backbone is used, and to describe effectsdue to the finiteness of the backbone length, a second set of simulations withfree ends of the backbone is performed. in the latter case, the inhomogeneityof the structure in the direction along the backbone is carefully investigated.we use these results to test various phenomenological models that have beenproposed to interpret experimental scattering data for bottle-brushmacromolecules. these models aim to extract information on the radial densityprofile of a bottle-brush from the total scattering via suitable convolutionapproximations. possibilities to improve such models, guided by our simulationresults, are discussed.

0808.1488	escape transition of a polymer chain from a nanotube: how to avoid  spurious results by use of the force-biased pruned-enriched rosenbluth  algorithm	a polymer chain containing $n$ monomers confined in a finite cylindrical tubeof diameter $d$ grafted at a distance $l$ from the open end of the tube mayundergo a rather abrupt transition, where part of the chain escapes from thetube to form a "crown-like" coil outside of the tube. when this problem isstudied by monte carlo simulation of self-avoiding walks on the simple cubiclattice applying a cylindrical confinement and using the standardpruned-enriched rosenbluth method (perm), one obtains spurious results,however: with increasing chain length the transition gets weaker and weaker,due to insufficient sampling of the "escaped" states, as a detailed analysisshows. in order to solve this problem, a new variant of a biased sequentialsampling algorithm with re-sampling is proposed, force-biased perm: thedifficulty of sampling both phases in the region of the first order transitionwith the correct weights is treated by applying a force at the free end pullingit out of the tube. different strengths of this force need to be used andreweighting techniques are applied. using rather long chains (up to n=18000)and wide tubes (up to d=29 lattice spacings), the free energy of the chain, itsend-to-end distance, the number of "imprisoned" monomers can be estimated, aswell as the order parameter and its distribution. it is suggested that this newalgorithm should be useful for other problems involving state changes ofpolymers, where the different states belong to rather disjunct "valleys" in thephase space of the system.

cond-mat;0002125	static and dynamical properties of a supercooled liquid confined in a  pore	we present the results of a molecular dynamics computer simulation of abinary lennard-jones liquid confined in a narrow pore. the surface of the porehas an amorphous structure similar to that of the confined liquid. we find thatthe static properties of the liquid are not affected by the confinement, whilethe dynamics changes dramatically. by investigating the time and temperaturedependence of the intermediate scattering function we show that the dynamics ofthe particles close to the center of the tube is similar to the one in thebulk, whereas the characteristic relaxation time tau_q(t,rho) of theintermediate scattering function at wavevector q and distance rho from the axisof the pore increases continuously when approaching the wall, leading to anapparent divergence in the vicinity of the wall. this effect is seen forintermediate temperatures down to temperatures close to the glass transition.the rho-dependence of tau_q(t,rho) can be described by an empirical law of theform tau_q(t,\rho)=f_q(t) exp [delta_q/(rho_p-rho)], where delta_q and \rho_qare constants, and f_q(t) is the only parameter which shows a significanttemperature dependence.

cond-mat;0008006	frequency dependent specific heat of viscous silica	we apply the mori-zwanzig projection operator formalism to obtain anexpression for the frequency dependent specific heat c(z) of a liquid. by usingan exact transformation formula due to lebowitz et al., we derive a relationbetween c(z) and k(t), the autocorrelation function of temperature fluctuationsin the microcanonical ensemble. this connection thus allows to determine c(z)from computer simulations in equilibrium, i.e. without an externalperturbation. by considering the generalization of k(t) to finite wave-vectors,we derive an expression to determine the thermal conductivity \lambda from suchsimulations. we present the results of extensive computer simulations in whichwe use the derived relations to determine c(z) over eight decades in frequency,as well as \lambda. the system investigated is a simple but realistic model foramorphous silica. we find that at high frequencies the real part of c(z) hasthe value of an ideal gas. c'(\omega) increases quickly at those frequencieswhich correspond to the vibrational excitations of the system. at lowtemperatures c'(\omega) shows a second step. the frequency at which this stepis observed is comparable to the one at which the \alpha-relaxation peak isobserved in the intermediate scattering function. also the temperaturedependence of the location of this second step is the same as the one of the$\alpha-$peak, thus showing that these quantities are intimately connected toeach other. from c'(\omega) we estimate the temperature dependence of thevibrational and configurational part of the specific heat. we find that thestatic value of c(z) as well as \lambda are in good agreement with experimentaldata.

cond-mat;0011322	structure and dynamics of amorphous silica surfaces	we use molecular dynamics computer simulations to study the equilibriumproperties of the surface of amorphous silica. two types of geometries areinvestigated: i) clusters with different diameters (13.5\aa, 19\aa, and26.5\aa) and ii) a thin film with thickness 29\aa. we find that the shape ofthe clusters is independent of temperature and that it becomes more sphericalwith increasing size. the surface energy is in qualitative agreement with theexperimental value for the surface tension. the density distribution functionshows a small peak just below the surface, the origin of which is traced backto a local chemical ordering at the surface. close to the surface the partialradial distribution functions as well as the distributions of the bond-bondangles show features which are not observed in the interior of the systems. bycalculating the distribution of the length of the si-o rings we can show thatthese additional features are related to the presence of two-membered rings atthe surface. the surface density of these structures is around 0.6/nm^2 in goodagreement with experimental estimates. from the behavior of the mean-squareddisplacement at low temperatures we conclude that at the surface the cage ofthe particles is larger than the one in the bulk. close to the surface thediffusion constant is somewhat larger than the one in the bulk and withdecreasing temperature the relative difference grows. the total vibrationaldensity of states at the surface is similar to the one in the bulk. however, ifonly the one for the silicon atoms is considered, significant differences arefound.

cond-mat;0104382	growing length scales in a supercooled liquid close to an interface	we present the results of molecular dynamics computer simulations of a simpleglass former close to an interface between the liquid and the frozen amorphousphase of the same material. by investigating f_s(q,z,t), the incoherentintermediate scattering function for particles that have a distance z from thewall, we show that the relaxation dynamics of the particles close to the wallis much slower than the one for particles far away from the wall. for small zthe typical relaxation time for f_s(q,z,t) increases like exp(delta/(z-z_p)),where delta and z_p are constants. we use the location of the crossover fromthis law to the bulk behavior to define a first length scale tilde{z}. adifferent length scale is defined by considering the ansatz f_s(q,z,t) =f_s^{bulk}(q,t) +a(t) exp[-(z/xi(t))^{beta(t)}], where a(t), xi(t), and beta(t)are fit parameters. we show that this ansatz gives a very good description ofthe data for all times and all values of z. the length xi(t) increases forshort and intermediate times and decreases again on the time scale of thealpha-relaxation of the system. the maximum value of xi(t) can thus be definedas a new length scale xi_max. we find that tilde{z} as well as xi_max increasewith decreasing temperature. the temperature dependence of this increase iscompatible with a divergence of the length scale at the kauzmann temperature ofthe bulk system.

cond-mat;0109200	recent md results on supercooled thin polymer films	the dynamic and static properties of a supercooled (non-entangled) polymermelt are investigated via molecular dynamics (md) simulations. the system isconfined between two completely smooth and purely repulsive walls. thewall-to-wall separation (film thickness), $d$, is varied from about 3 to about14 times the bulk radius of gyration. despite the geometric confinement, thesupercooled films exhibit many qualitative features which were also observed inthe bulk and could be analyzed in terms of mode-coupling theory (mct). examplesare the two-step relaxation of the incoherent intermediate scattering function,the time-temperature superposition property of the late time $\alpha$-processand the space-time factorization of the scattering function on the intermediatetime scale of the mct $\beta$-process. an analysis of the temperaturedependence of the $\alpha$-relaxation time suggests that the criticaltemperature, $\tc$, of mct decreases with $d$. if the confinement is not toostrong ($d \ge 10 {monomer diameter}$) the static structure factor of the filmcoincides with that of the bulk when compared for the same distance,$t-\tc(d)$, to the critical temperature. this suggests that $t-\tc(d)$ is animportant temperature scale of our model both in the bulk and in the films.

cond-mat;0202337	simulation of models for the glass transition: is there progress?	the glass transition of supercooled fluids is a particular challenge forcomputer simulation, because the (longest) relaxation times increase by about15 decades upon approaching the transition temperature t_g. brute-forcemolecular dynamics simulations, as presented here for molten sio_2 andcoarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer chains, can yield very usefulinsight about the first few decades of this slowing down. hence this allows toaccess the temperature range around t_c of the so-called mode coupling theory,whereas the dynamics around the experimental glass transition is completely outof reach. while methods such as ``parallel tempering'' improve the situationsomewhat, a method that allows to span a significant part of the region t_g\leqt\leq t_c is still lacking. only for abstract models such as the infinite range10-state potts glass with a few hundred spins this region can be explored.however this model suffers from very strong finite size effects thus making itdifficult to extrapolate the results obtained for the finite system sizes tothe thermodynamic limit. for the case of polymer melts, two differentstrategies to use lattice models instead of continuum models are discussed: inthe first approach, a mapping of an atomistically realistic model ofpolyethylene to the bond fluctuation model with suitable effective potentialsand a temperature-dependent time rescaling factor is attempted. in the secondapproach, devoted to a test of the entropy theory, moves that are artificialbut which lead to a faster relaxation (``slithering snake'' algorithm) areused, to get at least static properties at somewhat lower temperatures thanpossible with a ``realistic'' dynamics. the merits and shortcomings of allthese approaches are discussed.

cond-mat;0211195	statics and dynamics of the ten-state nearest-neighbor potts glass on  the simple-cubic lattice	we present the results of monte carlo simulations of two different pottsglass models with short range random interactions. in the first model a \pmj-distribution of the bonds is chosen, in the second model a gaussiandistribution. in both cases the first two moments of the distribution arechosen to be j_0=-1, delta j=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the pottsspins can occur. we find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glasssusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, andthat the specific heat has only a smooth schottky-like peak. these results canbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters ofspins. hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at anynonzero temperature. consistent with these findings, only very minor sizeeffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the modelsremain very short. we also compute for both models the time auto-correlationfunction c(t) of the potts spins. while in the gaussian model c(t) shows asmooth uniform decay, the correlator for the \pm j model has several distinctsteps. these steps correspond to the breaking of bonds in small clusters offerromagnetically coupled spins (dimers, trimers, etc.). the relaxation timesfollow simple arrhenius laws, with activation energies that are readilyinterpreted within the cluster picture, giving evidence that the system doesnot have a dynamic transition at a finite temperature. hence we find that forthe present models all the transitions known for the mean-field version of themodel are completely wiped out. finally we also determine the timeauto-correlation functions of individual spins, and show that the system isdynamically very heterogeneous.

cond-mat;0305024	interplay between wetting and phase behavior in binary polymer films and  wedges: monte carlo simulations and mean field calculations	we study the interplay between wetting and miscibility of a symmetric polymermixture via mc simulations and scf calculations. the film surfaces interactwith the monomers via short ranged potentials and the wetting transition is offirst order. if both surfaces in a film attract the same component, capillarycondensation occurs and the critical point is close to the critical point ofthe bulk. if surfaces attract different components, an interface localizationoccurs which gives rise to phase diagrams with two critical points in thevicinity of the pre-wetting critical point. the crossover between these twotypes of phase diagrams as a function of the surface field asymmetry isstudied. we investigate the dependence of the phase diagram on the filmthickness d for antisymmetric surface fields. upon decreasing the filmthickness the two critical points approach the symmetry axis of the phasediagram, and below a certain thickness d_tri there remains only a singlecritical point at symmetric composition. this corresponds to a second orderinterface localisation transition even though the wetting transition is offirst order. at a specific film thickness, d_tri, tricritical behavior isfound. the behavior of antisymmetric films is compared with the phase behaviorin an antisymmetric double wedge. while the former is the analogon of thewetting transition of a planar surface, the latter is the analogon of thefilling behavior of a single wedge. we present evidence for a second orderinterface localization transition in an antisymmetric double wedge and relateits unconventional critical behavior to the predictions of parry et al. prl 835535 (1999) for wedge filling. the critical behavior differs from the isinguniversality class and is characterized by strong anisotropic fluctuations.

cond-mat;0309014	calculation of local pressure tensors in systems with many-body  interactions	local pressures are important in the calculation of interface tensions and inanalyzing micromechanical behavior. the calculation of local pressures incomputer simulations has been limited to systems with pairwise interactionsbetween the particles, which is not sufficient for chemically detailed systemswith many-body potentials such as angles and torsions. we introduce a method tocalculate local pressures in systems with n-body interactions (n=2,3,4, . . .)based on a micromechanical definition of the pressure tensor. the localpressure consists of a kinetic contribution from the linear momentum of theparticles and an internal contribution from dissected many-body interactions byinfinitesimal areas. to define dissection by a small area, respective n-bodyinteractions are divided into two geometric centers, effectively reducing themto two-body interactions. consistency with hydrodynamics-derived formulas forsystems with two-body interactions (j. h. irving and j. g. kirkwood, j. chem.phys. 18, 817 (1950)), for average cross-sectional pressures (b. d. todd, d. j.evans, and p. j. daivis, phys. rev. e 52, 1627 (1995)), and for volume averagedpressures (virial formula) is shown. as a simple numerical example, we discussliquid propane in a cubic box. local, crosssectional,and volume-averagedpressures as well as relative contributions from two-body and three-body forcesare analyzed with the proposed method, showing full numerical equivalence withthe existing approaches. the method allows computing local pressures in thepresence of many-body interactions in atomistic simulations of complexmaterials and biological systems.

cond-mat;0309025	the relaxation dynamics of a supercooled liquid confined by rough walls	we present the results of molecular dynamics computer simulations of a binarylennard-jones liquid confined between two parallel rough walls. these walls arerealized by frozen amorphous configurations of the same liquid and thereforethe structural properties of the confined fluid are identical to the ones ofthe bulk system. hence this setup allows us to study how the relaxationdynamics is affected by the pure effect of confinement, i.e. if structuralchanges are completely avoided. we find that the local relaxation dynamics is astrong function of z, the distance of the particles from the wall, and thatclose to the surface the typical relaxation times are orders of magnitudelarger than the ones in the bulk. because of the cooperative nature of theparticle dynamics, the slow dynamics also affects the dynamics of the particlesfor large values of z. using various empirical laws, we are able toparameterize accurately the z-dependence of the generalized incoherentintermediate scattering function f_s(q,z,t) and also the spatial dependence ofstructural relaxation times. these laws allow us to determine various dynamicallength scales and we find that their temperature dependence is compatible withan arrhenius law. furthermore, we find that at low temperatures time and spacedependent correlation function fulfill a generalized factorization propertysimilar to the one predicted by mode-coupling theory for bulk systems. for thinfilms and/or at sufficiently low temperatures, we find that the relaxationdynamics is influenced by the two walls in a strongly non-linear way in thatthe slowing down is much stronger than the one expected from the presence ofonly one confining wall. ....

cond-mat;0507523	kinetics of phase separation in thin films: simulations for the  diffusive case	we study the diffusion-driven kinetics of phase separation of a symmetricbinary mixture (ab), confined in a thin-film geometry between two parallelwalls. we consider cases where (a) both walls preferentially attract the samecomponent (a), and (b) one wall attracts a and the other wall attracts b (withthe same strength). we focus on the interplay of phase separation and wettingat the walls, which is referred to as {\it surface-directed spinodaldecomposition} (sdsd). the formation of sdsd waves at the two surfaces, withwave-vectors oriented perpendicular to them, often results in a metastablelayered state (also referred to as ``stratified morphology''). this state isreminiscent of the situation where the thin film is still in the one-phaseregion but the surfaces are completely wet, and hence coated with thick wettinglayers. this metastable state decays by spinodal fluctuations and crosses overto an asymptotic growth regime characterized by the lateral coarsening ofpancake-like domains. these pancakes may or may not be coated by precursors ofwetting layers. we use langevin simulations to study this crossover and thegrowth kinetics in the asymptotic coarsening regime.

0810.3790	statics and dynamics of colloid-polymer mixtures near their critical  point of phase separation: a computer simulation study of a continuous ao  model	we propose a new coarse-grained model for the description of liquid-vaporphase separation of colloid-polymer mixtures. the hard-sphere repulsion betweencolloids and between colloids and polymers, which is used in the well-knownasakura-oosawa (ao) model, is replaced by weeks-chandler-anderson potentials.similarly, a soft potential of height comparable to thermal energy is used forthe polymer-polymer interaction, rather than treating polymers as ideal gasparticles. it is shown by grand-canonical monte carlo simulations that thismodel leads to a coexistence curve that almost coincides with that of the aomodel and the ising critical behavior of static quantities is reproduced. thenthe main advantage of the model is exploited - its suitability for moleculardynamics simulations - to study the dynamics of mean square displacements ofthe particles, transport coefficients such as the self-diffusion andinterdiffusion coefficients, and dynamic structure factors. while theself-diffusion of polymers increases slightly when the critical point isapproached, the self-diffusion of colloids decreases and at criticality thecolloid self-diffusion coefficient is about a factor of 10 smaller than that ofthe polymers. critical slowing down of interdiffusion is observed, which isqualitatively similar to symmetric binary lennard-jones mixtures, for which nodynamic asymmetry of self-diffusion coefficients occurs.

cond-mat;0602266	spinodal decomposition in thin films: molecular dynamics simulations of  a binary lennard-jones fluid mixture	we use molecular dynamics (md) to simulate an unstable homogeneous mixture ofbinary fluids (ab), confined in a slit pore of width $d$. the pore walls areassumed to be flat and structureless, and attract one component of the mixture(a) with the same strength. the pair-wise interactions between the particles ismodeled by the lennard-jones potential, with symmetric parameters that lead toa miscibility gap in the bulk. in the thin-film geometry, an interestinginterplay occurs between surface enrichment and phase separation.  we study the evolution of a mixture with equal amounts of a and b, which isrendered unstable by a temperature quench. we find that a-rich surfaceenrichment layers form quickly during the early stages of the evolution,causing a depletion of a in the inner regions of the film. thesesurface-directed concentration profiles propagate from the walls towards thecenter of the film, resulting in a transient layered structure. this layeredstate breaks up into a columnar state, which is characterized by the lateralcoarsening of cylindrical domains. the qualitative features of this processresemble results from previous studies of diffusive ginzburg-landau-type models[s.~k. das, s. puri, j. horbach, and k. binder, phys. rev. e {\bf 72}, 061603(2005)], but quantitative aspects differ markedly. the relation to spinodaldecomposition in a strictly 2-$d$ geometry is also discussed.
