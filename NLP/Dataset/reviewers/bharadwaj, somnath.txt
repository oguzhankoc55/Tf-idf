0905.1756	a study of ism of dwarf galaxies using hi power spectrum analysis	we estimate the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations for a sample of 8galaxies (7 dwarf and one spiral). the power spectrum can be fitted to a powerlaw p_hi(u) = a u^\alpha for 6 of these galaxies, indicating turbulence isoperational. the estimated best fit value for the slope ranges from ~ -1.5 (andiv, ngc 628, ugc 4459 and gr 8) to ~ -2.6 (ddo 210 and ngc 3741). we interpretthis bi-modality as being due to having effectively 2d turbulence on lengthscales much larger than the scale height of the galaxy disk and 3d otherwise.this allows us to use the estimated slope to set bounds on the scale heights ofthe face-on galaxies in our sample. we also find that the power law sloperemains constant as we increase the channel thickness for all these galaxies,suggesting that the fluctuations in hi intensity are due to densityfluctuations and not velocity fluctuations, or that the slope of the velocitystructure function is ~ 0. finally, for the four galaxies with "2d turbulence"we find that the slope \alpha correlates with the star formation rate per unitarea, with larger star formation rates leading to steeper power laws. given oursmall sample size this result needs to be confirmed with a larger sample.

0906.0360	the optimal redshift for detecting ionized bubbles in hi 21-cm maps	the detection of individual ionized bubbles in hi 21-cm maps is one of themost promising, direct probes of the epoch of reionization(eor). atleast 1000hrs of observation would be required for such a detection with either thecurrently functioning gmrt or the upcoming mwa. considering the largeinvestment of telescope time it is essential to identify the``optimalredshift'' where the prospects of a detection are most favourable. we find thatthe optimal redshift is determined by a combination of instrument dependentfactors and the evolution of the neutral fraction x_hi. we find that theredshift range 8.1 +/- 1.1 and 9.8 +/- 1 are optimum for detecting ionizedbubbles with the gmrt and mwa respectively. the prospects of a detection, wefind, are more favourable in a scenario with late reionization with x_hi\approx 0.5 at z \approx 7.5 as compared to an early reionization model wherex_hi \approx 0.5 at z \approx 10. in the late reionization scenario, for bothinstruments a 3 \sigma detection is possible for bubbles of comoving radiusr_b&gt;= 30 mpc with 1000 hrs of observation. future observations will either leadto the detection of ionized bubbles, or in the event of non-detection, lead toconstraints on the product x_hi r_b^\gamma for the observational volume, where\gamma=1.5 and 2 for gmrt and mwa respectively.

0906.3431	the scale of homogeneity of the galaxy distribution in sdss dr6	the assumption that the universe, on sufficiently large scales, ishomogeneous and isotropic is crucial to our current understanding of cosmology.in this paper we test if the observed galaxy distribution is actuallyhomogeneous on large scales. we have carried out a multifractal analysis of thegalaxy distribution in a volume limited subsample from the sdss dr6. thisconsiders the scaling properties of different moments of galaxy number countsin spheres of varying radius $r$ centered on galaxies. this analysis gives thespectrum of generalized dimension $d_q(r)$, where $q &gt;0$ quantifies the scalingproperties in overdense regions and $q&lt;0$ in underdense regions. we expect$d_q(r)=3$ for a homogeneous, random point distribution.  in our analysis we have determined $d_q(r)$ in the range $-4 \le q \le 4$ and$7 \le r \le 98 h^{-1} {\rm mpc}$. in addition to the sdss data we haveanalysed several random samples which are homogeneous by construction.simulated galaxy samples generated from dark matter n-body simulations and themillennium run were also analysed. the sdss data is considered to behomogeneous if the measured $d_q$ is consistent with that of the randomsamples. we find that the galaxy distribution becomes homogeneous at alength-scale between 60 and $70 h^{-1} {\rm mpc}$. the galaxy distribution, wefind, is homogeneous at length-scales greater than $70 h^{-1} {\rm mpc}$. thisis consistent with earlier works which find the transition to homogeneity ataround $70 h^{-1} {\rm mpc}$.

1002.4192	hi 21 cm opacity fluctuations power spectra towards cassiopeia a	the angular power spectrum of hi 21 cm opacity fluctuations is a usefulstatistic for quantifying the observed opacity fluctuations as well as forcomparing these with theoretical models. we present here the hi 21 cm opacityfluctuation power spectrum towards the supernova remnant cas a frominterferometric data with spacial resolution of 5" and spectral resolution of0.4 km/s. the power spectrum has been estimated using a simple but robustvisibility based technique. we find that the power spectrum is well fit by apower law p_tau(u) = u^{alpha} with a power law index of alpha ~ -2.86 +/- 0.10(3 sigma error) over the scales of 0.07 - 2.3 pc for the gas in the perseusspiral arm and 0.002 - 0.07 pc (480 - 15730 au) for that in the local arm. thisestimated power law index is consistent with earlier observational resultsbased on both hi emission over larger scales and absorption studies over asimilar range of scales. we do not detect any statistically significant changein the power law index with the velocity width of the frequency channels. thisconstrains the power law index of the velocity structure function to be beta =0.2 +/- 0.6 (3 sigma error).

1004.1528	turbulence in the harassed galaxy ngc 4254	galaxy harassment is an important mechanism for the morphological evolutionof galaxies in clusters. the spiral galaxy ngc 4254 in the virgo cluster isbelieved to be a harassed galaxy. we have analyzed the power spectrum of hiemission fluctuations from ngc 4254 to investigate whether it carries anyimprint of galaxy harassment. the power spectrum, as determined using the 16central channels which contain most of the hi emission, is found to be wellfitted by a power law $p(u)=au^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\ =-\ 1.7\pm 0.2$ atlength-scales $1.7 \, {\rm k pc}$ to $ 8.4 \, {\rm kpc}$. this is similar toother normal spiral galaxies which have a slope of $\sim -1.5$ and isinterpreted as arising from two dimensional turbulence at length-scales largerthan the galaxy's scale-height. ngc 4254 is hence yet another example of aspiral galaxy that exhibits scale-invariant density fluctuations out tolength-scales comparable to the diameter of the hi disk. while a large varietyof possible energy sources like proto-stellar winds, supernovae, shocks, etc.have been proposed to produce turbulence, it is still to be seen whether theseare effective on length-scales comparable to that of the entire hi disk. onseparately analyzing the hi power spectrum in different parts of ngc 4254, wefind that the outer parts have a different slope ($ \alpha = -2.0\pm0.3$)compared to the central part of the galaxy ($\alpha = -1.5\pm0.2$). such achange in slope is not seen in other, undisturbed galaxies. we suggest that, inaddition to changing the overall morphology, galaxy harassment also effects thefine scale structure of the ism, causing the power spectrum to have a steeperslope in the outer parts.

1006.0430	the impact of anisotropy from finite light travel time on detecting  ionized bubbles in redshifted 21-cm maps	the detection of ionized bubbles around quasars in redshifted 21-cm maps ispossibly one of the most direct future probes of reionization. we consider twomodels for the growth of spherical ionized bubbles to study the apparent shapesof the bubbles in redshifted 21-cm maps, taking into account the finite lighttravel time (fltt) across the bubble. we find that the fltt, whose effect isparticularly pronounced for large bubbles, causes the bubble's image tocontinue to grow well after it's actual growth is over. there are two distinctfltt distortions in the bubble's image: (i) its apparent center is shiftedalong the line of sight (los) towards the observer from the quasar; (ii) it'sshape is anisotropic along the los. the bubble initially appears elongatedalong the los. this is reversed in the later stages of growth where the bubbleappears compressed. the fltt distortions are expected to have an impact onmatched filter bubble detection where it is most convenient to use a sphericaltemplate for the filter. we find that the best matched spherical filter gives areasonably good estimate of the size and the shift in the center of theanisotropic image. the mismatch between the spherical filter and theanisotropic image causes a 10 - 20% degradation in the snr relative to that ofa spherical bubble. we conclude that a spherical filter is adequate for bubbledetection. the fltt distortions do not effect the lower limits for bubbledetection with 1000 hr of gmrt observations. the smallest spherical filter forwhich a detection is possible has comoving radii 24 mpc and 33 mpc for a3-sigma and 5-sigma detection respectively, assuming a neutral fraction 0.6 atz \sim 8.

1010.4489	gmrt observation towards detecting the post-reionization 21-cm signal	we have analyzed 610 mhz gmrt observations towards detecting the redshifted21-cm signal from z=1.32. the multi-frequency angular power spectrum c_l(deltanu) is used to characterize the statistical properties of the backgroundradiation across angular scales ~20" to 10', and a frequency bandwidth of 7.5mhz with resolution 125 khz. the measured c_l(delta nu) which ranges from 7mk^2 to 18 mk^2 is dominated by foregrounds, the expected hi signalc_l^hi(delta nu) ~10^{-6}- 10^{-7} mk^2 is several orders of magnitude smaller.the foregrounds, believed to originate from continuum sources, is expected tovary smoothly with delta nu whereas the hi signal decorrelates within ~0.5 mhzand this holds the promise of separating the two. for each l, we use theinterval 0.5 &lt; delta nu &lt; 7.5 mhz to fit a fourth order polynomial which issubtracted from the measured c_l(delta nu) to remove any smoothly varyingcomponent across the entire bandwidth delta nu &lt; 7.5 mhz. the residualc_l(delta nu), we find, has an oscillatory pattern with amplitude and periodrespectively ~0.1 mk^2 and delta nu = 3 mhz at the smallest l value of 1476,and the amplitude and period decreasing with increasing l. applying a suitablychosen high pass filter, we are able to remove the residual oscillatory patternfor l=1476 where the residual c_l(delta nu) is now consistent with zero at the3-sigma noise level. we conclude that we have successfully removed theforegrounds at l=1476 and the residuals are consistent with noise. we use thisto place an upper limit on the hi signal whose amplitude is determined by x_hib where x_hi and b are the hi neutral fraction and the hi bias respectively. avalue of x_hi b greater than 7.95 would have been detected in our observation,and is therefore ruled out at the 3-sigma level.

1108.3707	improved foreground removal in gmrt 610 mhz observations towards  redshifted 21-cm tomography	foreground removal is a challenge for 21-cm tomography of the high redshiftuniverse. we use archival gmrt data (obtained for completely differentastronomical goals) to estimate the foregrounds at a redshift ~ 1. thestatistic we use is the cross power spectrum between two frequencies separatedby \delta{\nu} at the angular multipole l, or equivalently the multi-frequencyangular power spectrum c_l(\delta{\nu}). an earlier measurement ofc_l(\delta{\nu}) using this data had revealed the presence of oscillatorypatterns along \delta{\nu}, which turned out to be a severe impediment forforeground removal (ghosh et al. 2011). using the same data, in this paper weshow that it is possible to considerably reduce these oscillations bysuppressing the sidelobe response of the primary antenna elements. thesuppression works best at the angular multipoles l for which there is a densesampling of the u-v plane. for three angular multipoles l = 1405, 1602 and1876, this sidelobe suppression along with a low order polynomial fittingcompletely results in residuals of (\leq 0.02 mk^2), consistent with the noiseat the 3{\sigma} level. since the polynomial fitting is done after estimationof the power spectrum it can be ensured that the estimation of the hi signal isnot biased. the corresponding 99% upper limit on the hi signal is xhi b \leq2.9, where xhi is the mean neutral fraction and b is the bias.

1111.6354	constraining quasar and igm properties through bubble detection in  redshifted 21-cm maps	the infrared detection of a z&gt;7 quasar has opened up a new window to directlyprobe the igm during the epoch of reionization. in this paper we theoreticallyconsider the possibility of detecting the ionized bubble around a z=8 quasarusing targeted redshifted 21-cm observations with the gmrt. the apparent shapeand size of the ionized bubble, as seen by a distant observer, depends on theparameters \dot{n}_{phs}/c, x_hi/c and \tau_q where \dot{n}_{phs}, \tau_q, x_hiand c are respectively the photon emission rate, age of the quasar, the neutralfraction and clumping factor of the igm.here we have analytically estimated theshape and size of a quasar's ionized bubble assuming an uniform igm andignoring other ionizing sources besides the quasar, and used this as a templatefor matched filter bubble search with the gmrt visibility data. we have assumedthat \dot{n}_{phs} is known from the infrared spectrum and c from theoreticalconsiderations, which gives us two free parameters x_hi and \tau_q for bubble.considering 1,000 hr of observation, we find that there is a reasonably largeregion of parameter space where a 3\sigma detection is possible. we also findthat it will be possible to place lower limits on x_hi and \tau_q with thisobservation. deeper follow up observations can place upper limits on \tau_q andx_hi. value of c affect the estimation of x_hi but the estimation of \tau_qremains unaffected.we have used a semi-numerical technique to simulate theapparent shape and size of quasar ionized bubbles considering the presence ofother ionizing sources and inhomogeneities in the igm. the presence of othersources increase the size of the quasar bubble, leading to underestimation ofx_hi. clustering of other ionizing sources around the quasar can produce severedistortions in bubble's shape. however, this does not severely affect parameterestimation in the bubbles that are large.

1112.0745	the imprint of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the  cross-correlation of the redshifted hi 21-cm signal and the ly-alpha forest	the cross-correlation of the ly-alpha forest and redshifted 21-cm emissionhas recently been proposed as an observational tool for mapping out thelarge-scale structures in the post-reionization era z &lt; 6. this has asignificant advantage as the problems of continuum subtraction and foregroundremoval are expected to be considerably less severe in comparison to therespective auto-correlation signals. further, the effect of discrete quasarsampling is less severe for the cross-correlation in comparison to the ly-alphaforest auto-correlation signal. in this paper we explore the possibility ofusing the cross-correlation signal to detect the baryon acoustic oscillation(bao). to this end, we have developed a theoretical formalism to calculate theexpected cross-correlation signal and its variance. we have used this topredict the expected signal, and estimate the range of observational parameterswhere a detection is possible.  for the ly-$\alpha$ forest, we have considered boss and bigboss which areexpected have a quasar density of 16 deg^{-2} and 64 deg^{-2} respectively. aradio interferometric array that covers the redshift range z=2 to 3 usingantennas of size 2 m * 2 m, is well suited for the 21-cm observations. it isrequired to observe 25 independent fields of view, which corresponds to theentire angular extent of boss. we find that it is necessary to achieve a noiselevel of 1.1 * 10^{-5} k^2 and 6.25 * 10^{-6} mk^2 per field of view in the21-cm observations to detect the angular and radial bao respectively with boss.the corresponding figures are 3.3 * 10^{-5} mk^2 and 1.7 * 10^{-5} mk^2 forbigboss. four to five independent radio interferometric arrays, each containing400 antennas uniformly sampling all the baselines within 50 m will be able tocarry out these observations in the span of a few years.

1208.5386	probing interstellar turbulence in spiral galaxies using hi power  spectrum analysis	we estimate the \hi intensity fluctuation power spectrum for a sample of 18spiral galaxies chosen from things. our analysis spans a large range oflength-scales from $\sim 300 {\rm pc}$ to $\sim 16 {\rm kpc}$ across the entiregalaxy sample. we find that the power spectrum of each galaxy can be wellfitted by a power law $p_{\rm hi}(u) = a u^{\alpha}$, with an index $\alpha$that varies from galaxy to galaxy. for some of the galaxies the scale-invariantpower-law power spectrum extends to length-scales that are comparable to thesize of the galaxy's disk. the distribution of $\alpha$ is strongly peaked with50% of the values in the range $\alpha=-1.9$ to 1.5, and a mean and standarddeviation of -1.3 and 0.5 respectively. we find no significant correlationbetween $\alpha$ and the star formation rate, dynamical mass, \hi mass orvelocity dispersion of the galaxies.  several earlier studies that have measured the power spectrum within ourgalaxy on length-scales that are considerably smaller than $500 {\rm pc}$ havefound a power-law power spectrum with $\alpha$ in the range $\approx -2.8$ to-2.5. we propose a picture where we interpret the values in the range $\approx-2.8$ to -2.5 as arising from three dimensional (3d) turbulence in theinterstellar medium (ism) on length-scales smaller than the galaxy'sscale-height, and we interpret the values in the range $\approx -1.9$ to -1.5measured in this paper as arising from two-dimensional ism turbulence in theplane of the galaxy's disk. it however still remains a difficulty to explainthe small galaxy to galaxy variations in the values of $\alpha$ measured here.

1209.4762	the effect of peculiar velocities on the epoch of reionization (eor)  21-cm signal	we have used semi-numerical simulations of reionization to study thebehaviour of the power spectrum of the eor 21-cm signal in redshift space. wehave considered two models of reionization, one which has homogeneousrecombination (hr) and the other incorporating inhomogeneous recombination(ir). we have estimated the observable quantities --- quadrupole and monopolemoments of hi power spectrum at redshift space from our simulated data. we findthat the magnitude and nature of the ratio between the quadrupole and monopolemoments of the power spectrum ($p^s_2 /p^s_0$) can be a possible probe for theepoch of reionization. we observe that this ratio becomes negative at largescales for $x_{hi} \leq 0.7$ irrespective of the reionization model, which is adirect signature of an inside-out reionization at large scales. it is possibleto qualitatively interpret the results of the simulations in terms of thefluctuations in the matter distribution and the fluctuations in the neutralfraction which have power spectra and cross-correlation $p_{\delta \delta}(k)$,$p_{xx}(k)$ and $p_{\delta x}(k)$ respectively. we find that at large scalesthe fluctuations in matter density and neutral fraction is exactlyanti-correlated through all stages of reionization. this provides a simplepicture where we are able to qualitatively interpret the behaviour of theredshift space power spectra at large scales with varying $x_{hi}$ entirely interms of a just two quantities, namely $x_{hi}$ and the ratio $p_{xx}/p_{\delta\delta}$. the nature of $p_{\delta x}$ becomes different for hr and irscenarios at intermediate and small scales. we further find that it is possibleto distinguish between an inside-out and an outside-in reionization scenariofrom the nature of the ratio $p^s_2 /p^s_0$ at intermediate length scales.

1409.4420	the effect of non-gaussianity on error predictions for the epoch of  reionization (eor) 21-cm power spectrum	the epoch of reionization (eor) 21-cm signal is expected to becomeincreasingly non-gaussian as reionization proceeds. we have used semi-numericalsimulations to study how this affects the error predictions for the eor 21-cmpower spectrum. we expect $snr=\sqrt{n_k}$ for a gaussian random field where$n_k$ is the number of fourier modes in each $k$ bin. we find thatnon-gaussianity is important at high $snr$ where it imposes an upper limit$[snr]_l$. for a fixed volume $v$, it is not possible to achieve $snr &gt;[snr]_l$ even if $n_k$ is increased. the value of $[snr]_l$ falls asreionization proceeds, dropping from $\sim 500$ at $\bar{x}_{hi} = 0.8-0.9$ to$\sim 10$ at $\bar{x}_{hi} = 0.15 $ for a $[150.08\, {\rm mpc}]^3$ simulation.we show that it is possible to interpret $[snr]_l$ in terms of the trispectrum,and we expect $[snr]_l \propto \sqrt{v}$ if the volume is increased. for $snr\ll [snr]_l$ we find $snr = \sqrt{n_k}/a $ with $a \sim 0.95 - 1.75$, roughlyconsistent with the gaussian prediction. we present a fitting formula for the$snr$ as a function of $n_k$, with two parameters $a$ and $[snr]_l$ that haveto be determined using simulations. our results are relevant for predicting thesensitivity of different instruments to measure the eor 21-cm power spectrum,which till date have been largely based on the gaussian assumption.

0805.1734	simulating the impact of hi fluctuations on matched filter search for  ionized bubbles in redshifted 21 cm maps	extending the formalism of datta, bharadwaj &amp; choudhury (2007) for detectingionized bubbles in redshifted 21 cm maps using a matched-filtering technique,we use different simulations to analyze the impact of hi fluctuations outsidethe bubble on the detectability of the bubble. in the first three kinds ofsimulations there is a spherical bubble of comoving radius r_b, the one that weare trying to detect, located at the center, and the neutral hydrogen (hi)outside the bubble traces the underlying dark matter distribution. we considerthree different possible scenarios of reionization, i.e., (i) there is a singlebubble (sb) in the field of view (fov) and the hydrogen neutral fraction isconstant outside this bubble (ii) patchy reionization with many small ionizedbubbles in the fov (pr1) and (iii) many spherical ionized bubbles of the sameradius $r_b$ (pr2). the fourth kind of simulation uses more realistic mapsbased on semi-numeric modelling (sm) of ionized regions. we find that for boththe sb and pr1 scenarios the fluctuating igm restricts bubble detection to sizer_b&lt;= 6 mpc and r_b&lt;= 12 mpc for the gmrt and the mwa respectively, howeverlarge be the integration time. these results are well explained by analyticalpredictions. large uncertainty due to the hi fluctuations restricts bubbledetection in the pr2 scenario for neutral fraction x_hi&lt;0.6. the matched-filtertechnique works well even when the targeted ionized bubble is non-spherical dueto surrounding bubbles and inhomogeneous recombination (sm). we find thatdetermining the size and positions of the bubbles is not limited by the hifluctuations in the sb and pr1 scenario but limited by the instrument's angularresolution instead, and this can be done more precisely for larger bubble(abridged).

1508.00896	statistics of the epoch of reionization 21-cm signal - i. power spectrum  error-covariance	the non-gaussian nature of the epoch of reionization (eor) 21-cm signal has asignificant impact on the error variance of its power spectrum $p({\bf\textit{k}})$. we have used a large ensemble of semi-numerical simulations andan analytical model to estimate the effect of this non-gaussianity on theentire error-covariance matrix ${\mathcal{c}}_{ij}$. our analytical model showsthat ${\mathcal{c}}_{ij}$ has contributions from two sources. one is the usualvariance for a gaussian random field which scales inversely of the number ofmodes that goes into the estimation of $p({\bf \textit{k}})$. the other is thetrispectrum of the signal. using the simulated 21-cm signal ensemble, anensemble of the randomized signal and ensembles of gaussian random ensembles wehave quantified the effect of the trispectrum on the error variance${\mathcal{c}}_{ij}$. we find that its relative contribution is comparable toor larger than that of the gaussian term for the $k$ range $0.3 \leq k \leq 1.0\,{\rm mpc}^{-1}$, and can be even $\sim 200$ times larger at $k \sim 5\, {\rmmpc}^{-1}$. we also establish that the off-diagonal terms of${\mathcal{c}}_{ij}$ have statistically significant non-zero values which arisepurely from the trispectrum. this further signifies that the error in different$k$ modes are not independent. we find a strong correlation between the errorsat large $k$ values ($\ge 0.5 \,{\rm mpc}^{-1}$), and a weak correlationbetween the smallest and largest $k$ values. there is also a smallanti-correlation between the errors in the smallest and intermediate $k$values. these results are relevant for the $k$ range that will be probed by thecurrent and upcoming eor 21-cm experiments.

astro-ph;0101228	using gravitational lensing to study hi clouds at high redshift	we investigate the possibility of detecting hi emission from gravitationallylensed hi clouds (akin to damped lyman-$\alpha$ clouds) at high redshift bycarrying out deep radio observations in the fields of known cluster lenses.such observations will be possible with present radio telescopes only if thelens substantially magnifies the flux of the hi emission. while at present thisholds the only possibility of detecting the hi emission from such clouds, ithas the disadvantage of being restricted to clouds that lie very close to thecaustics of the lens. we find that observations at a detection threshold of 50micro jy at 320 mhz (possible with the gmrt) have a greater than 20%probability of detecting an hi cloud in the field of a cluster, provided theclouds have hi masses in the range 5 x 10^8 m_{\odot} &lt; m_{hi} &lt; 2.5 x 10^{10}m_{\odot}. the probability of detecting a cloud increases if they have largerhi masses, except in the cases where the number of hi clouds in the clusterfield becomes very small. the probability of a detection at 610 mhz and 233 mhzis comparable to that at 320 mhz, though a definitive statement is difficultowing to uncertainties in the hi content at the redshifts corresponding tothese frequencies. observations at a detection threshold of 2 micro jy(possible in the future with the ska) are expected to detect a few hi clouds inthe field of every cluster provided the clouds have hi masses in the range 2 x10^7 m_{\odot} &lt; m_{hi} &lt; 10^9 m_{\odot}. even if such observations do notresult in the detection of hi clouds, they will be able to put usefulconstraints on the hi content of the clouds.

astro-ph;0403670	modeling non-linear effects in the redshift space two-point correlation  function and its implications for the pairwise velocity dispersion	the anisotropies in the galaxy two-point correlation function measured fromredshift surveys exhibits deviations from the predictions of the linear theoryof redshift space distortion on scales as large 20 mpc/h where we expect lineartheory to hold in real space. any attempt at analyzing the anisotropies in theredshift correlation function and determining the linear distortion parameter\beta requires these deviations to be correctly modeled and taken into account.these deviations are usually attributed to galaxy random motions and these areincorporated in the analysis through a phenomenological model where the linearredshift correlation is convolved with the random pairwise velocitydistribution function along the line of sight. we show that a substantial partof the deviations arise from non-linear effects in the mapping from real toredshift space caused by the coherent flows. models which incorporate thiseffect provide a better fit to n-body results as compared to thephenomenological model which has only the effect of random motions. we findthat the pairwise velocity dispersion predicted by all the models that we haveconsidered are in excess of the values determined directly from the n-bodysimulations. this indicates a shortcoming in our understanding of thestatistical properties of peculiar velocities and their relation to redshiftdistortion.

astro-ph;0406676	on using visibility correlations to probe the hi distribution from the  dark ages to the present epoch i: formalism and the expected signal	redshifted 21 cm radiation originating from the cosmological distribution ofneutral hydrogen (hi) appears as a background radiation in low frequency radioobservations. the angular and frequency domain fluctuations in this radiationcarry information about cosmological structure formation. we propose thatcorrelations between visibilities measured at different baselines andfrequencies in radio-interferometric observations be used to quantify thestatistical properties of these fluctuations. this has an inherent advantageover other statistical estimators in that it deals directly with thevisibilities which are the primary quantities measured in radio-interferometricobservations. also, the visibility correlation has a very simple relation withpower spectrum. we present estimates of the expected signal for nearly theentire post-recombination era, from the dark ages to the present epoch. theepoch of reionization, where the hi has a patchy distribution, has a distinctsignature where the signal is determined by the size of the discrete ionizedregions. the signal at other epochs, where the hi follows the dark matter, isdetermined largely by the power spectrum of dark matter fluctuations. thesignal is strongest for baselines where the antenna separations are within afew hundred times the wavelength of observation, and an optimal strategy wouldpreferentially sample these baselines. in the frequency domain, for mostbaselines the visibilities at two different frequencies are uncorrelated beyond\delta \nu ~ 1 mhz, a signature which in principle would allow the hi signal tobe easily distinguished from the continuum sources of contamination.

astro-ph;0410581	probing non-gaussian features in the hi distribution at the epoch of  reionization	the hi distribution at the epoch of reionization (eor) is largely determinedby the sizes and distribution of the ionized regions. in the scenario where theionized regions have comoving sizes of the order of a few mpc, the large scalestatistical properties of the hi distribution are dominated by the poissonnoise of the discrete ionized regions, and it is highly non-gaussian. weinvestigate the possibility of probing reionization by studying thesenon-gaussian features using future radio interferometric observations ofredshifted 21 cm hi radiation. we develop a formalism relating correlationsbetween the visibilities measured at three different baselines and frequenciesto the bispectrum of hi fluctuations. for visibilities at the same frequency,this signal is found to be of the same order as the two visibility correlationwhich probes the hi power spectrum. for visibilities at different frequencies,we find that the correlations decay within a frequency difference of ~1 mhz.this implies that it is, in principle, straightforward to extract this hisignal from various contaminants which are believed to have a continuum spectraand are expected to be correlated even at large frequency separations.

astro-ph;0503237	what will anisotropies in the clustering pattern in redshifted 21 cm  maps tell us?	the clustering pattern in high redshift hi maps is expected to be anisotropicdue to two distinct reasons, the  alcock-paczynski effect and the peculiar velocities, both of which aresensitive to the cosmological parameters. the signal is also expected to besensitive to the details of the hi distribution at the epoch when the radiationoriginated. we use simple models for the hi distribution at the epoch ofreionizaation and the post-reionization era to investigate exactly what we hopeto learn from future observations of the anisotropy pattern in hi maps. we findthat such observations will probably tell us more about the hi distributionthan about the background cosmological model. assuming that reionization can bedescribed by spherical, ionized bubbles all of the same size with their centerspossibly being biased with respect to the dark matter, we find that theanisotropy pattern at small angles is expected to have a bump at thecharacteristic angular size of the individual bubbles whereas the large scaleanisotropy pattern will reflect the size and the bias of the bubbles. theanisotropy also depends on the background cosmological parameters, but thedependence is much weaker. under the assumption that the hi in thepost-reionization era traces the dark matter with a possible bias, we find thatchanging the bias and changing the background cosmology has similar effects onthe anisotropy pattern. combining observations of the anisotropy withindependent estimates of the bias, possibly from the bi-spectrum, may allowthese observations to constrain cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0605546	the multi-frequency angular power spectrum of the epoch of reionization  21 cm signal	observations of redshifted 21cm radiation from hi at high redshifts is animportant future probe of reionization. we consider the multi-frequency angularpower spectrum (maps) to quantify the statistics of the hi signal as a jointfunction of the angular multipole l and frequency separation \delta\nu. thesignal at two different frequencies is expected to get decorrelated as\delta\nu is increased, and quantifying this decorrelation is particularlyimportant in deciding the frequency resolution for future hi observations. thisis also expected to play a very crucial role in extracting the signal fromforegrounds as the signal is expected to decorrelate much faster than theforegrounds (which are largely continuum sources) with increasing \delta\nu. inthis paper we develop formulae relating the maps to different components of thethree dimensional hi power spectrum taking into account hi peculiar velocities.we show that the flat-sky approximation provides a very good representationover the angular scales of interest, and a final expression which is verysimple to calculate and interpret. we present results considering two modelsfor the hi distribution, namely, (i) dm: where the hi traces the dark matterand (ii) pr: where the effects of patchy reionization are incorporated throughtwo parameters. we find that while the dm signal is largely featureless, the prsignal peaks at the angular scales of the individual bubbles, and the signal isconsiderably enhanced for large bubble size. for most cases of interest at l\sim 100 the signal is uncorrelated beyond \delta\nu \sim 1 mhz or even less,whereas it occurs around \sim 0.1 mhz at l \sim 10^3. the \delta\nu dependencealso carries an imprint of the bubble size and the bias, and is expected to bean important probe of the reionization scenario (abridged).

astro-ph;9609171	self-similarity and the pair velocity dispersion	we have considered linear two point correlations of the form $1/{x^{\gamma}}$which are known to have a self-similar behaviour in a $\omega=1$ universe. weinvestigate under what conditions the non-linear corrections, calculated usingthe zel'dovich approximation, have the same self-similar behaviour. we findthat the scaling properties of the non-linear corrections are decided by thespatial behaviour of the linear pair velocity dispersion and it is only for thecases where this quantity keeps on increasing as a power law (i.e. for $\gamma&lt; 2$) do the non-linear corrections have the same self-similar behaviour as thelinear correlations. for $(\gamma &gt; 2)$ we find that the pair velocitydispersion reaches a constant value and the self-similarity is broken by thenon-linear corrections. we find that the scaling properties calculated usingthe zel'dovich approximation are very similar to those obtained at the lowestorder of non-linearity in gravitational dynamics and we propose that thescaling properties of the non-linear corrections in perturbative gravitationaldynamics also are decided by the spatial behaviour of the linear pair velocitydispersion.

astro-ph;9707143	decaying neutrinos and large scale structure formation	we study the growth of density perturbations in a universe with unstable darkmatter particles. the mass (m_\nu) range 30 ev &lt; m_\nu &lt; 10 kev with lifetimes($t_d$) in the range 10^7 sec &lt; t_d &lt; 10^16 sec are considered. we calculatethe cobe normalized matter power spectrum for these models. we find that it ispossible to construct models consistent with observations for masses $m_\nu &gt;50 ev by adjusting t_d so as to keep the quantity (m_\nu(kev))^2 t_d(yr)constant at a value around 100. for m_\nu &lt; 1 kev the power spectrum has extrapower at small scales which could result in an early epoch of galaxy formation.we do not find any value of t_d which gives a viable model in the mass rangem_\nu &lt; 50 ev. we also consider the implications of radiatively decayingneutrinos---models in which a small fraction b &lt;&lt; 1 of neutrinos decay intophotons-which could possibly ionize the intergalactic medium (igm) at highredshift. we show that the parameter space of decaying particles whichsatisfies the igm observations does not give viable models of structureformation.

astro-ph;9708015	skewness in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy from inflationary  gravity wave background	in the context of inflationary scenarios, the observed large angle anisotropyof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature is believed to probe theprimordial metric perturbations from inflation. although the perturbations frominflation are expected to be gaussian random fields, there remains thepossibility that nonlinear processes at later epochs induce ``secondary''non-gaussian features in the corresponding cmb anisotropy maps. thenon-gaussianity induced by nonlinear gravitational instability of scalar(density) perturbations has been investigated in existing literature. in thispaper, we highlight another source of non-gaussianity arising out of higherorder scattering of cmb photons off the metric perturbations. we provide asimple and elegant formalism for deriving the cmb temperature fluctuationsarising due to the sachs-wolfe effect beyond the linear order. in particular,we derive the expression for the second order cmb temperature fluctuations. themultiple scattering effect pointed out in this paper leads to the possibilitythat tensor metric perturbation, i.e., gravity waves (gw) which do not exhibitgravitational instability can still contribute to the skewness in the cmbanisotropy maps. we find that in a flat $\omega =1$ universe, the skewness incmb contributed by gravity waves via multiple scattering effect is comparableto that from the gravitational instability of scalar perturbations for equalcontribution of the gravity waves and scalar perturbations to the total rms cmbanisotropy. the secondary skewness is found to be smaller than the cosmicvariance leading to the conclusion that inflationary scenarios do predict thatthe observed cmb anisotropy should be statistically consistent with a gaussianrandom distribution.

astro-ph;9904406	evidence for filamentarity in the las campanas redshift survey	we apply shapefinders, statistical measures of `shape' constructed from twodimensional partial minkowski functionals, to study the degree of filamentarityin the las campanas redshift survey (lcrs). in two dimensions, three minkowskifunctionals characterise the morphology of an object, they are: its perimeter(l), area (s), and genus. out of l and s a single dimensionless shapefinderstatistic, f can be constructed (0 &lt;=f &lt;=1). f acquires extreme values on acircle (f = 0) and a filament (f = 1). using f, we quantify the extent offilamentarity in the lcrs by comparing our results with a poisson distributionwith similar geometrical properties and having the same selection function asthe survey. our results unambiguously demonstrate that the lcrs displays a highdegree of filamentarity both in the northern and southern galactic sections aresult that is in general agreement with the visual appearance of thecatalogue. it is well known that gravitational clustering from gaussian initialconditions gives rise to the development of non-gaussianity reflected in theformation of a network-like filamentary structure on supercluster scales.consequently the fact that the smoothed lcrs catalogue shows propertiesconsistent with those of a gaussian random field (colley 1997) whereas theunsmoothed catalogue demonstrates the presence of filamentarity lends strongsupport to the conjecture that the large scale clustering of galaxies is drivenby gravitational instability.

0810.3649	the cmbr isw and hi 21-cm cross-correlation angular power spectrum	the late-time growth of large scale structures (lss) is imprinted in the cmbranisotropy through the integrated sachs wolfe (isw) effect. this is perceivedto be a very important observational probe of dark energy. future observationsof redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral hydrogen (hi)distribution hold the potential of probing the lss over a large redshift range.we have investigated the possibility of detecting the isw throughcross-correlations between the cmbr anisotropies and redshifted 21-cmobservations. assuming that the hi traces the dark matter, we find that theisw-hi cross-correlation angular power spectrum at an angular multipole l isproportional to the dark matter power spectrum evaluated at the comoving wavenumber l/r, where r is the comoving distance to the redshift from which the hisignal originated. the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal depends onparameters related to the hi distribution and the growth of cosmologicalperturbations. however the cross-correlation is extremely weak as compared tothe cmbr anisotropies and the predicted hi signal. as a consequence thecross-correlation signal is smaller than the cosmic variance, and astatistically significant detection is not very likely.

0812.1800	the local dimension: a method to quantify the cosmic web	it is now well accepted that the galaxies are distributed in filaments,sheets and clusters all of which form an interconnected network known as thecosmic web. it is a big challenge to quantify the shapes of the interconnectedstructural elements that form this network. tools like the minkowskifunctionals which use global properties, though well suited for an isolatedobject like a single sheet or filament, are not suited for an interconnectednetwork of such objects. we consider the local dimension $d$, defined through$n(r)=a r^d$, where $n(r)$ is the galaxy number count within a sphere ofcomoving radius $r$ centered on a particular galaxy, as a tool to locallyquantify the shape in the neigbourhood of different galaxies along the cosmicweb. we expect $d \sim 1,2$ and 3 for a galaxy located in a filament, sheet andcluster respectively. using lcdm n-body simulations we find that it is possibleto determine $d$ through a power law fit to $n(r)$ across the length-scales 2to $10 {\rm mpc}$ for $\sim 33 %$ of the galaxies. we have visually identifiedthe filaments and sheets corresponding to many of the galaxies with $d \sim 1$and 2 respectively. in several other situations the structure responsible forthe $d$ value could not be visually identified, either due to its being tenuousor due to other dominating structures in the vicinity. we also show that theglobal distribution of the $d$ values can be used to visualize and interprethow the different structural elements are woven into the cosmic web.
