0902.3460	the detection of inside-out disk growth in m33	we present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis ofthe m33 disk from images taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard thehubble space telescope. the photometry provides a detailed census of the redclump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermostfield. through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find thatthe percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9%in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. the disk shows aclear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc10 gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 gyr ago, in agreementwith analytical predictions for disk growth. beyond the disk truncation radius,however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradientreverses, in agreement with recent simulations. the late and slow growth of thestellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of m33.

0706.2325	the monitor project: jw 380 -- a 0.26, 0.15 msol pre main sequence  eclipsing binary in the orion nebula cluster	we report the discovery of a low-mass (0.26 +/- 0.02, 0.15 +/- 0.01 msol)pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary with a 5.3 day orbital period. jw 380 wasdetected as part of a high-cadence time-resolved photometric survey (themonitor project) using the 2.5m isaac newton telescope and wide field camerafor a survey of a single field in the orion nebula cluster (onc) region in vand i bands. the star is assigned a 99 per cent membership probability fromproper motion measurements, and radial velocity observations indicate asystemic velocity within 1 sigma of that of the onc. modelling of the combinedlight and radial velocity curves of the system gave stellar radii of 1.19 +0.04-0.18 rsol and 0.90 +0.17 -0.03 rsol for the primary and secondary, with asignificant third light contribution which is also visible as a third peak inthe cross-correlation functions used to derive radial velocities. the massesand radii appear to be consistent with stellar models for 2-3 myr age fromseveral authors, within the present observational errors. these observationsprobe an important region of mass-radius parameter space, where there arecurrently only a handful of known pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary systemswith precise measurements available in the literature.

0905.3737	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a systematic survey toestablish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for avolume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (d&lt;4 mpc). the survey volumeencompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &amp;large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. the galaxies include anearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 inluminosity and star formation rate. the survey data consists of images takenwith acs on hst, supplemented with archival data and new wfpc2 imaging takenafter the failure of acs. survey images include wide field tilings covering thefull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowdedregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. the new wide field imagingin angst reaches median 50% completenesses of m_f475w=28.0 mag, m_f606w=27.3mag, and m_f814w=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb). the deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve thestructure in the red clump. the resulting photometric catalogs are publiclyaccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of &gt;14 millionstars. in this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysisof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the acs andwfpc2 imaging. we also present uniformly derived relative distances measuredfrom the apparent magnitude of the trgb.

0909.1632	sulfur abundances in the orion association b stars	sulfur abundances are derived for a sample of ten b main-sequence starmembers of the orion association. the analysis is based on lte plane-parallelmodel atmospheres and non-lte line formation theory by means of aself-consistent spectrum synthesis analysis of lines from two ionization statesof sulfur, sii and siii. the observations are high-resolution spectra obtainedwith the arces spectrograph at the apache point observatory. the abundancedistribution obtained for the orion targets is homogeneous within the expectederrors in the analysis: a(s)=7.15+/-0.05. this average abundance result is inagreement with the recommended solar value (both from modelling of thephotospheres in 1-d and 3-d, and meteorites) and indicates that little, if any,chemical evolution of sulfur has taken place in the last ~4.5 billion years.the sulfur abundances of the young stars in orion are found to agree well withresults for the orion nebulae, and place strong constraints on the amount ofsulfur depletion onto grains as being very modest or nonexistent. the sulfurabundances for orion are consistent with other measurements at a similargalactocentric radius: combined with previous results for other ob-type starsproduce a relatively shallow sulfur abundance gradient with a slope of-0.037+/-0.012 dex/kpc.

0910.5597	type ii-p supernovae from the sdss-ii supernova survey and the  standardized candle method	we apply the standardized candle method (scm) for type ii plateau supernovae(sne ii-p), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a sn to its luminosityduring the plateau, to 15 sne ii-p discovered over the three season run of thesloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey. the redshifts of these sne -0.027 &lt; z &lt; 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;in particular, our sne ii-p sample contains nearly as many sne in the hubbleflow (z &gt; 0.01) as all of the current literature on the scm combined. we findthat the sdss sne have a very small intrinsic i-band dispersion (0.22 mag),which can be attributed to selection effects. when the scm is applied to thecombined sdss-plus-literature set of sne ii-p, the dispersion increases to 0.29mag, larger than the scatter for either set of sne separately. we show that thestandardization cannot be further improved by eliminating sne with positiveplateau decline rates, as proposed in poznanski et al. (2009). we thoroughlyexamine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the scm to beuseful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the fe iivelocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompassthe intrinsic variations of type ii-p sne will be needed.

1002.1743	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury v. radial star formation history  of ngc 300	we present new hubble space telescope (hst) observations of ngc 300 taken aspart of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). individual stars areresolved in these images down to an absolute magnitude of m_f814w = 1.0 (belowthe red clump). we determine the star formation history of the galaxy in 6radial bins by comparing our observed color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) withsynthetic cmds based on theoretical isochrones. we find that the stellar diskout to 5.4 kpc is primarily old, in contrast with the outwardly similar galaxym33. we determine the scale length as a function of age and find evidence forinside-out growth of the stellar disk: the scale length has increased from 1.1+/- 0.1 kpc 10 gyr ago to 1.3 +/- 0.1 kpc at present, indicating a buildup inthe fraction of young stars at larger radii. as the scale length of m33 hasrecently been shown to have increased much more dramatically with time, ourresults demonstrate that two galaxies with similar sizes and morphologies canhave very different histories. with an n-body simulation of a galaxy designedto be similar to ngc 300, we determine that the effects of radial migrationshould be minimal. we trace the metallicity gradient as a function of time andfind a present day metallicity gradient consistent with that seen in previousstudies. consistent results are obtained from archival images covering the sameradial extent but differing in placement and filter combination.

1005.2434	analyzing the low state of ef eridani with hubble space telescope  ultraviolet spectra	time-resolved spectra throughout the orbit of ef eri during its low accretionstate were obtained with the solar blind channel on the advanced camera forsurveys onboard the hubble space telescope. the overall spectral distributionexhibits peaks at 1500 and 1700a, while the uv light curves display aquasi-sinusoidal modulation over the binary orbit. models of white dwarfs witha hot spot and cyclotron emission were attempted to fit the spectral variationsthroughout the orbit. a non-magnetic white dwarf with a temperature of ~10,000kand a hot spot with central temperature of 15,000k generally matches the broadabsorptions at 1400 and 1600a with those expected for the quasimolecular hfeatures h2 and h+2 . however, the flux in the core of the lyalpha absorptiondoes not go to zero, implying an additional component, and the flux variationsthroughout the orbit are not well matched at long wavelengths. alternatively, a9500k white dwarf with a 100 mg cyclotron component can fit the lowest (phase0.0) fluxes, but the highest fluxes (phase 0.5) require an additional source ofmagnetic field or temperature. the 100 mg field required for the uv fit is muchhigher than that which fits the optical/ir wavelengths, which would supportprevious suggestions of a complex field structure in polars.

1008.1589	the nature of starbursts: i. the star formation histories of eighteen  nearby starburst dwarf galaxies	we use archival hst observations of resolved stellar populations to derivethe star formation histories (sfhs) of 18 nearby starburst dwarf galaxies. inthis first paper we present the observations, color-magnitude diagrams, and thesfhs of the 18 starburst galaxies, based on a homogeneous approach to the datareduction, differential extinction, and treatment of photometric completeness.we adopt a star formation rate (sfr) threshold normalized to the average sfr ofthe individual system as a metric for classifying starbursts in sfhs derivedfrom resolved stellar populations. this choice facilitates finding not onlycurrently bursting galaxies but also "fossil" bursts increasing the sample sizeof starburst galaxies in the nearby (d&lt;8 mpc) universe. thirteen of theeighteen galaxies are experiencing ongoing bursts and five galaxies show fossilbursts. from our reconstructed sfhs, it is evident that the elevated sfrs of aburst are sustained for hundreds of myr with variations on small timescales. along &gt;100 myr temporal baseline is thus fundamental to any starburst definitionor identification method. the longer lived bursts rule out rapid"self-quenching" of starbursts on global scales. the bursting galaxies' gasconsumption timescales are shorter than the hubble time for all but one galaxyconfirming the short-lived nature of starbursts based on fuel limitations.additionally, we find the strength of the h{\alpha} emission usually correlateswith the cmd based sfr during the last 4-10 myr. however, in four cases, theh{\alpha} emission is significantly less than what is expected for models ofstarbursts; the discrepancy is due to the sfr changing on timescales of a fewmyr. the inherently short timescale of the h{\alpha} emission limitsidentifying galaxies as starbursts based on the current characteristics whichmay or may not be representative of the recent sfh of a galaxy.

1009.2940	the nature of starbursts : ii. the duration of starbursts in dwarf  galaxies	the starburst phenomenon can shape the evolution of the host galaxy and thesurrounding intergalactic medium. the extent of the evolutionary impact ispartly determined by the duration of the starburst, which has a directcorrelation with both the amount of stellar feedback and the development ofgalactic winds, particularly for smaller mass dwarf systems. we measure theduration of starbursts in twenty nearby, ongoing, and "fossil" starbursts indwarf galaxies based on the recent star formation histories derived fromresolved stellar population data obtained with the hubble space telescope.contrary to the shorter times of 3-10 myr often cited, the starburst durationswe measure range from 450 - 650 myr in fifteen of the dwarf galaxies and up to1.3 gyr in four galaxies; these longer durations are comparable to or longerthan the dynamical timescales for each system. the same feedback from massivestars that may quench the flickering sf does not disrupt the overall burstevent in our sample of galaxies. while five galaxies present fossil bursts,fifteen galaxies show ongoing bursts and thus the final durations may be longerthan we report here for these systems. one galaxy shows a burst that has beenongoing for only 20 myr; we are likely seeing the beginning of a burst event inthis system. using the duration of the starbursts, we calculate that the burstsdeposited 10^(53.9)-10^(57.2) ergs of energy into the interstellar mediumthrough stellar winds and supernovae and produced 3%-26% of the host galaxy'smass.

1012.0577	the galactic m dwarf flare rate	m dwarfs are known to flare on timescales from minutes to hours, with fluxincreases of several magnitudes in the blue/near-uv. these frequent, powerfulevents, which are caused by magnetic reconnection, will have a strongobservational signature in large, time-domain surveys. the radiation andparticle fluxes from flares may also exert a significant influence on theatmospheres of orbiting planets, and affect their habitability. we present astatistical model of flaring m dwarfs in the galaxy that allows us to predictthe observed flare rate along a given line of sight for a particular surveydepth and cadence. the parameters that enter the model are the galacticstructure, the distribution of magnetically active and inactive m dwarfs, andthe flare frequency distribution (ffd) of both populations. the ffd is afunction of spectral type, activity, and galactic height. although inactive mdwarfs make up the majority of stars in a magnitude-limited survey, the ffd ofinactive stars is very poorly constrained. we have organized a flare monitoringcampaign comprising hundreds of hours of new observations from both the groundand space to better constrain flare rates. incorporating the new observationsinto our model provides more accurate predictions of stellar variability causedby flares on m dwarfs. we pay particular attention to the likelihood of flaresappearing as optical transients (i.e., host star not seen in quiescent data).

0709.2147	argon abundances in the solar neighborhood: non-lte analysis of orion  association b-type stars	argon abundances have been derived for a sample of b main-sequence stars inthe orion association. the abundance calculations are based on nlte metalline-blanketed model atmospheres calculated with the nlte code tlusty and anupdated and complete argon model atom. we derive an average argon abundance forthis young population of a(ar) = 6.66 +- 0.06. while our result is in excellentagreement with a recent analysis of the orion nebula, it is significantlyhigher than the currently recommended solar value which is based on abundancemeasurements in the solar corona. moreover, the derived argon abundances in theorion b stars agree very well with a measurement from a solar impulsive flareduring which unmodified solar photospheric material was brought to flareconditions. we therefore argue that the argon abundances obtained independentlyfor both the orion b stars and the orion nebula are representative of the diskabundance value in the solar neighborhood. the lower coronal abundance mayreflect a depletion related to the fip effect. we propose a new reference valuefor the abundance of argon in the solar neighborhood, a(ar) = 6.63 +- 0.10,corresponding to ar/o = 0.009.

1205.2732	observational constraints on the molecular gas content in nearby  starburst dwarf galaxies	using star formation histories derived from optically resolved stellarpopulations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with thehubble space telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of starsnewly formed in the bursts. by assuming a star formation efficiency (sfe), wethen calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of thestarbursts. assuming a sfe of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forminggalaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very highhi surface densities (~10^2-10^3 msun pc^-2), which are much higher than havebeen observed in dwarf galaxies. this implies either higher values of sfe inthese dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of h_2 indwarfs (or both). raising the assumed sfes to 10% or greater (in line withobservations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies),still results in hi surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies.thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of thegas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onsetof the bursts. our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range10^19-10^21 cm^-2 for the sample. in those galaxies where co observations havebeen made, these densities correspond to values of the co-h_2 conversion factor(x_co) in the range &gt;3-80x10^20 cm^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1, or up to 40x greater thangalactic x_co values.

1206.6056	the very short period m dwarf binary sdss j001641-000925	we present follow-up observations and analysis of the recently discoveredshort period low-mass eclipsing binary, sdss j001641-000925. with an orbitalperiod of 0.19856 days, this system has one of the shortest known periods foran m dwarf binary system. medium-resolution spectroscopy and multi-bandphotometry for the system are presented. markov chain monte carlo modeling ofthe light curves and radial velocities yields estimated masses for the stars ofm1 = 0.54 +/- 0.07 msun and m2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 msun, and radii of r1 = 0.68 +/-0.03 rsun and r2 = 0.58 +/- 0.03 rsun respectively. this solution places bothcomponents above the critical roche overfill limit, providing strong evidencethat sdss j001641-000925 is the first verified m-dwarf contact binary system.within the follow-up spectroscopy we find signatures of non-solid body rotationvelocities, which we interpret as evidence for mass transfer or loss within thesystem. in addition, our photometry samples the system over 9 years, and wefind strong evidence for period decay at the rate of dp/dt ~8 s/yr. both ofthese signatures raise the intriguing possibility that the system is inover-contact, and actively losing angular momentum, likely through mass loss.this places sdss j001641-000925 as not just the first m-dwarf over-contactbinary, but one of the few systems of any spectral type known to be activelyundergoing coalescence. further study sdss j001641-000925 is on-going to verifythe nature of the system, which may prove to be a unique astrophysicallaboratory.

1209.0759	the milky way's circular velocity curve between 4 and 14 kpc from apogee  data	we measure the milky way's rotation curve over the galactocentric range 4 kpc&lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc from the first year of data from the apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). we model the line-of-sight velocitiesof 3,365 stars in fourteen fields with b = 0 deg between 30 deg &lt; l &lt; 210 degout to distances of 10 kpc using an axisymmetric kinematical model thatincludes a correction for the asymmetric drift of the warm tracer population(\sigma_r ~ 35 km/s). we determine the local value of the circular velocity tobe v_c(r_0) = 218 +/- 6 km/s and find that the rotation curve is approximatelyflat with a local derivative between -3.0 km/s/kpc and 0.4 km/s/kpc. we alsomeasure the sun's position and velocity in the galactocentric rest frame,finding the distance to the galactic center to be 8 kpc &lt; r_0 &lt; 9 kpc, radialvelocity v_{r,sun} = -10 +/- 1 km/s, and rotational velocity v_{\phi,sun} =242^{+10}_{-3} km/s, in good agreement with local measurements of the sun'sradial velocity and with the observed proper motion of sgr a*. we investigatevarious systematic uncertainties and find that these are limited to offsets atthe percent level, ~2 km/s in v_c. marginalizing over all the systematics thatwe consider, we find that v_c(r_0) &lt; 235 km/s at &gt;99% confidence. we find anoffset between the sun's rotational velocity and the local circular velocity of26 +/- 3 km/s, which is larger than the locally-measured solar motion of 12km/s. this larger offset reconciles our value for v_c with recent claims thatv_c &gt;~ 240 km/s. combining our results with other data, we find that the milkyway's dark-halo mass within the virial radius is ~8x10^{11} m_sun.

1301.1367	very metal-poor stars in the outer galactic bulge found by the apogee  survey	despite its importance for understanding the nature of early stellargenerations and for constraining galactic bulge formation models, at presentlittle is known about the metal-poor stellar content of the central milky way.this is a consequence of the great distances involved and intervening dustobscuration, which challenge optical studies. however, the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee), a wide-area, multifiber,high-resolution spectroscopic survey within sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii), is exploring the chemistry of all galactic stellar populations atinfrared wavelengths, with particular emphasis on the disk and the bulge. anautomated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields inthe bulge obtained during apogee commissioning yielded five stars with lowmetallicity([fe/h]$\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor[fe/h]$\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.  luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outerbulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside. a manual reanalysisof the spectra verifies the low metallicities, and finds these stars to beenhanced in the $\alpha$-elements o, mg, and si without significant$\alpha$-pattern differences with other local halo or metal-weak thick-diskstars of similar metallicity, or even with other more metal-rich bulge stars.while neither the kinematics nor chemistry of these stars can yet definitivelydetermine which, if any, are truly bulge members, rather than denizens of otherpopulations co-located with the bulge, the newly-identified stars reveal thatthe chemistry of metal-poor stars in the central galaxy resembles that ofmetal-weak thick-disk stars at similar metallicity.

1301.7422	comparing the ancient star formation histories of the magellanic clouds	we present preliminary results from a new hst archival program aimed attightly constraining the ancient (&gt;4 gyr ago) star formation histories (sfhs)of the field populations of the smc and lmc. we demonstrate the quality of thearchival data by constructing hst/wfpc2-based color-magnitude diagrams (cmds;m_{f555w} ~ +8) for 7 spatially diverse fields in the smc and 8 fields in thelmc. the hst-based cmds are &gt;2 magnitudes deeper than any from ground basedobservations, and are particularly superior in high surface brightness regions,e.g., the lmc bar, which contain a significant fraction of star formation andare crowding limited from ground based observations. to minimize systematicuncertainties, we derive the sfh of each field using an identical maximumlikelihood cmd fitting technique. we then compute an approximate mass weightedaverage sfh for each galaxy. we find that both galaxies lack a dominant burstof early star formation, which suggests either a suppression or anunder-fueling of early star formation. from 10-12 gyr ago, the lmc experienceda period of enhanced stellar mass growth relative to the smc. similar to someprevious studies, we find two notable peaks in the sfh of the smc at ~4.5 and 9gyr ago, which could be due to repeated close passages with the lmc, implyingan interaction history that has persisted for at least 9 gyr. we find littleevidence for strong periodic behavior in the lifetime sfhs of both mcs,suggesting that repeated encounters with the milky way are unlikely. beginning~3.5 gyr ago, both galaxies show increases in their sfhs, in agreement withprevious studies, and thereafter, track each other remarkably well.

1304.2815	very low mass stellar and substellar companions to solar-like stars from  marvels v: a low eccentricity brown dwarf from the driest part of the desert,  marvels-6b	we describe the discovery of a likely brown dwarf (bd) companion with aminimum mass of 31.7 +/- 2.0 m_jup to gsc 03546-01452 from the marvels radialvelocity survey, which we designate as marvels-6b. for reasonable priors, ouranalysis gives a probability of 72% that marvels-6b has a mass below thehydrogen-burning limit of 0.072 m_sun, and thus it is a high-confidence bdcompanion. it has a moderately long orbital period of 47.8929 +0.0063/-0.0062days with a low eccentricty of 0.1442 +0.0078/-0.0073, and a semi-amplitude of1644 +12/-13 m/s. moderate resolution spectroscopy of the host star hasdetermined the following parameters: t_eff = 5598 +/- 63, log g = 4.44 +/-0.17, and [fe/h] = +0.40 +/- 0.09. based upon these measurements, gsc03546-01452 has a probable mass and radius of m_star = 1.11 +/- 0.11 m_sun andr_star = 1.06 +/- 0.23 r_sun with an age consistent with less than ~6 gyr at adistance of 219 +/- 21 pc from the sun. although marvels-6b is not observed totransit, we cannot definitively rule out a transiting configuration based onour observations. there is a visual companion detected with lucky imaging at7.7 arcsec from the host star, but our analysis shows that it is not bound tothis system. the minimum mass of marvels-6b exists at the minimum of the massfunctions for both stars and planets, making this a rare object even comparedto other bds.

1309.5535	discovery of a dynamical cold point in the heart of the sagittarius dsph  galaxy with observations from the apogee project	the dynamics of the core of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxy are explored using high-resolution (r~22,500), h-band, near-infraredspectra of over 1,000 giant stars in the central 3 deg^2 of the system, ofwhich 328 are identified as sgr members. these data, among some of the earliestobservations from the sdss-iii/apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment (apogee) and the largest published sample of high resolution sgrdsph spectra to date, reveal a distinct gradient in the velocity dispersion ofsgr from 11-14 km/s for radii &gt;0.8 degrees from center to a dynamical coldpoint of 8 km/s in the sgr center --- a trend differing from that found inprevious kinematical analyses of sgr over larger scales that suggest a more orless flat dispersion profile at these radii. well-fitting mass models witheither cored and cusped dark matter distributions can be found to match thekinematical results, although the cored profile succeeds with significantlymore isotropic stellar orbits than required for a cusped profile. it isunlikely that the cold point reflects an unusual mass distribution. thedispersion gradient may arise from variations in the mixture of populationswith distinct kinematics within the dsph; this explanation is suggested (e.g.,by detection of a metallicity gradient across similar radii), but notconfirmed, by the present data. despite these remaining uncertainties abouttheir interpretation, these early test data (including some from instrumentcommissioning) demonstrate apogee's usefulness for precision dynamical studies,even for fields observed at extreme airmasses.

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1503.05195	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies iii.  characterizing quenching in low-mass galaxies	we explore the quenching of low-mass galaxies (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^8 msun) as afunction of lookback time using the star formation histories (sfhs) of 38 localgroup dwarf galaxies. the sfhs were derived from analyzing color-magnitudediagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival hubble spacetelescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. we find: (1) lower massgalaxies quench earlier than higher mass galaxies; (2) inside of virial radiusthere is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massivehost and its quenching epoch; (3) there are hints of systematic differences inquenching times of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites, although the samplesample size and uncertainties in the sfhs of m31 dwarfs prohibit definitiveconclusions. combined with literature results, we qualitatively consider theredshift evolution (z=0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ~7 dex instellar mass (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^11.5 msun). the quenched fraction of allgalaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest andhighest mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at allredshifts. in contrast, galaxies between mstar ~ 10^8-10^10 msun have thelowest quenched fractions. we suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies arethe least efficient at quenching. finally, we compare our quenching times withpredictions for infall times of low-mass galaxies associated with the mw. wefind that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., cvn ii, leo iv) may havebeen quenched before infall while higher mass satellites (e.g., leo i, fornax)typically quench ~1-4 gyr after infall.

1511.04088	determining ages of apogee giants with known distances	we present a sample of local red giant stars observed using the new mexicostate university 1 m telescope with the apogee spectrograph, for which weestimate stellar ages and the age distribution from the high-resolutionspectroscopic stellar parameters and accurate distance measurements fromhipparcos. the high-resolution (r ~ 23,000), near infrared (h-band, 1.5-1.7micron) apogee spectra provide measurements of the stellar atmosphericparameters (temperature, surface gravity, [m/h], and [alpha/m]). due to thesmaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectraand accurate hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate thestellar masses to within 40%. for red giants, the relatively rapid evolution ofstars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on themass. we examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relationdirectly and a bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming aconstant star formation history (sfh). to improve the prior on the sfh, we usea hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model sfhfrom the age probability distribution functions of the data. the results of analpha dependent gaussian sfh model shows a clear relation between age and[alpha/m] at all ages. using this sfh model as the prior for an empiricalbayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution functionand determine ages for individual stars. the age-metallicity relation is flat,with a slight decrease in [m/h] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread inmetallicity. for stars with ages &lt; 1 gyr we find a smaller spread, consistentwith radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on theolder stars.

astro-ph;0311020	the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies: a problem for cold dark matter?	we address the issue of accuracy in recovering density profiles fromobservations of rotation curves of galaxies. we ``observe'' and analyze ourmodels in much the same way as observers do the real galaxies. we find that thetilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotationalvelocity. in some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flatcore, while in reality it does not. we identify three effects, which explainthe systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) bar. thepresence of even a small non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotationvelocity. in the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circularvelocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and randomvelocities. signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surfacebrightness profiles of the model galaxies. the variation of inclination angleand isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of barpresence than the surface brightness profiles. the systematic biases in thecentral ~ 1 kpc of galaxies are not large. each effect separately givestypically a few kms error, but the effects add up. in some cases the error incircular velocity was a factor of two, but typically we get about 20 percent.the result is the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattensin the central parts. our observations of real galaxies show that for a largefraction of galaxies the velocity of gas rotation (as measured by emissionlines) is very close to the rotation of stellar component (as measured byabsorption lines). this implies that the systematic effects discussed in thispaper are also applicable both for the stars and emission-line gas.

astro-ph;0401437	structure of disk dominated galaxies: ii. color gradients and stellar  population models	(abridged) we investigate optical and near-ir color gradients in a sample of172 low-inclination galaxies spanning hubble types s0--irr. the colors arecompared to stellar population synthesis models from which luminosity-weightedaverage ages and metallicities are determined. we explore the effects ofdifferent underlying star formation histories and additional bursts of starformation. our results are robust in a relative sense under the assumption thatour galaxies shared a similar underlying star formation history and that nobursts involving more than ~10% of the galaxy mass have occurred in the past1-2 gyr. we find strong correlations in age and metallicity with hubble-type,rotational velocity, total magnitude, and central surface brightness in thesense that earlier-type, faster rotating, more luminous, and higher surfacebrightness galaxies are older and more metal-rich, suggesting an early and morerapid star formation history for these galaxies. the increasing trends withrotational velocity and total magnitude level off for v_rot &gt; 120 km/s and m_k&lt; -23 mag respectively. this effect is stronger for metallicity (than age)which could reflect a threshold potential above which all metals are retainedand thus metallicity saturates at the yield. trends in gradients with galaxyparameters are compared with model predictions: these trends do not agree withpredictions of semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation, possiblydue to the effect of bar-induced radial flows. the observed trends are inagreement with chemo-spectrophotometric models of spiral galaxy evolution basedon cdm-motivated scaling laws but none of the hierarchical mergingcharacteristics, implying a strong dependence of the star formation history ofspiral galaxies on the galaxy potential and halo spin parameter.

astro-ph;9405003	damped lyman alpha systems vs. cold + hot dark matter	although the cold + hot dark matter (chdm) cosmology provides perhaps thebest fit of any model to all the available data at the current epoch, chdmproduces structure at relatively low redshifts and thus could be ruled out ifthere were evidence for formation of massive objects at high redshifts. dampedly$\alpha$ systems are abundant in quasar absorption spectra and thus providepossibly the most significant evidence for early structure formation, and thusperhaps the most stringent constraint on chdm. using the numbers of halos inn-body simulations to normalize press-schechter estimates of the numberdensities of protogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that chdm with$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the dampedly$\alpha$ data at $\le 2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with thelimited $z&gt;3$ damped ly$\alpha$ data. the situation is uncertain because thereis very little data for $z&gt;3$, and also it is unclear whether all dampedly$\alpha$ systems are associated with collapsed protogalaxies. the predictionsof chdm are quite sensitive to the hot (neutrino) fraction, and we find that$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.675/0.25/0.075$ is compatible even with the$z&gt;3$ data. this corresponds to lowering the neutrino mass from 6.8 to 5.7 ev,for $h_0=50\kmsmpc$. in chdm, the higher redshift damped ly$\alpha$ systems arepredicted to have lower masses, which can be checked by measuring the velocitywidths of the associated metal line systems.

astro-ph;9702099	linearizing the observed power spectrum	reconstruction of the linear power spectrum from observational data providesa way to compare cosmological models to a large amount of data, as peacock &amp;dodds (1994, 1996) have shown. by applying the appropriate corrections to theobservational power spectrum it is possible to recover the underlying linearpower spectrum for any cosmological model. using extensive n-body simulationswe demonstrate that the method is applicable to a wide range of cosmologicalmodels. however, we find that the recovery of the linear power spectrum fromobservations following pd94 is misleading because the corrections are model-dependent. when we apply the proper corrections for a given model to theobservational power spectrum, we find that no model in our test group recoversthe linear power spectrum well for the bias suggested by pd94 between abell,radio, optical, and iras catalogs 4.5:1.9:1.3:1, with b_iras=1. when we allowb_iras to vary we find that: (i)chdm models give very good fits to observationsif optically-selected galaxies are slightly biased b_opt=1.1 (ii) most lcdmmodels give worse but acceptable fits if blue galaxies are considerablyantibiased: 0.6&lt;b_opt&lt;0.9 and fail if optical galaxies are biased. (iii)thereis a universal shape of the recovered linear power spectrum of all lcdm modelsover their entire range of explored wavenumbers,0.01&lt;k&lt;0.6h\mpc. recoveredspectra of cdm and chdm models are nearly the same as that of lcdm in theregion 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.2h/mpc but diverge from this spectrum at higher k.

astro-ph;9712142	cdm-variant cosmological models - i: simulations and preliminary  comparisons	we present two matched sets of five simulations each, covering five presentlyfavored simple modifications to the standard cold dark matter (cdm) scenario.one simulation suite, with a linear box size of 75 mpc/h, is designed for highresolution and good statistics on the group/poor cluster scale, and the other,with a box size of 300 mpc/h, is designed for good rich cluster statistics. allruns had 57 million cold particles, and models with massive neutrinos had anadditional 113 million hot particles. we consider separately models withmassive neutrinos, tilt, curvature, and a nonzero cosmological constant inaddition to the standard cdm model. we find that our tiltedomega+omega_lambda=1 (tlcdm) model produces too much small-scale power by afactor of ~3, and our open lambda=0 (ocdm) model also exceeds observedsmall-scale power by a factor of 2. in addition, we take advantage of the largedynamic range in detectable halo masses our simulations allow to check theshape of the press-schechter approximation. we find good fits at cluster massesfor delta_c=1.27--1.35 for a gaussian filter and delta_c=1.57--1.73 for atophat filter. however, press-schechter overpredicts the number density ofhalos compared to the simulations in the high resolution suite by a weaklycosmology-dependent factor of 1.5--2 at galaxy and group masses, which cannotbe fixed by adjusting delta_c within reasonable bounds. an appendix generalizesthe spherical collapse model to any isotropic cosmology.

astro-ph;9712217	particle-mesh code for cosmological simulations	particle-mesh (pm) codes are still very useful tools for testing predictionsof cosmological models in cases when extra high resolution is not veryimportant. we release for public use a cosmological pm n-body code. we providea complete package of routines needed to set initial conditions, to run thecode, and to analyze the results. the package allows you to simulate modelswith numerous combinations of parameters: open/flat/closed background, with orwithout the cosmological constant, different values of the hubble constant,with or without hot neutrinos, tilted or non-tilted initial spectra, differentamount of baryons. routines are included to measure the power spectrum and thedensity distribution function in your simulations, and a bound-density-maximacode for halo finding. we also provide results of test runs. a simulation with256^3 mesh and 128^3 particles can be done in a couple of days on a typicalworkstation (70mb of ram are needed). to run simulations with 800^3 mesh and256^3 particles one needs a computer with 1gb memory and 1gb disk space. thecode has been successfully tested on an hp workstation and on a sun workstationrunning solaris. most of the files (not tests) can be obtained fromftp://astro.nmsu.edu/pub/aklypin/pmcode the package can be downloaded fromhttp://astro.nmsu.edu/~aklypin/pm/pmcode/index.html we provide this tool as aservice to the astronomical community, but we cannot guarantee results orpublications.

0810.0266	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ii. young stars and their relation  to halpha and uv emission timescales in the m81 outer disk	we have obtained resolved stellar photometry from hubble space telescope(hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of a field in the outerdisk of m81 as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). motivatedby the recent discovery of extended uv (xuv) disks around many nearby spiralgalaxies, we use the observed stellar population to derive the recent starformation histories of five ~0.5 kpc-sized regions within this field. theseregions were selected on the basis of their uv luminosity from galex andinclude two hii regions, two regions which are uv-bright but halpha-faint, andone "control" region faint in both uv and halpha. we estimate our effective sfrdetection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 msun/yr, which is lower than that of galex forregions of this size. as expected, the hii regions contain massive mainsequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 msun, based on our best extinctionestimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in theuv-bright/halpha-faint regions. the observations are consistent with stellarages &lt;10 myr in the hii regions, and &gt;16 myr in the uv-bright/halpha-faintregions. all regions but the control have formed ~10^4 msun of stars over thepast ~65 myr. thus, our results, for at least one small area in the outer diskof m81, are consistent with an age difference being sufficient to explain theobserved discrepancy between star-forming regions detected in halpha and thosedetected exclusively in uv. however, our data cannot conclusively rule outother explanations, such as a strongly truncated initial mass function (imf).

0810.2557	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury i. the star formation history of  the m81 outer disk	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a large hubble spacetelescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) treasury program to obtainresolved stellar photometry for a volume-limited sample of galaxies out to 4mpc. as part of this program, we have obtained deep acs imaging of a field inthe outer disk of the large spiral galaxy m81. the field contains the outskirtsof a spiral arm as well as an area containing no current star formation. ourimaging results in a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) reaching to f814w = 28.8 andf606w = 29.5, one magnitude fainter than the red clump. through detailedmodeling of the full cmd, we quantify the age and metallicity distribution ofthe stellar populations contained in the field. the mean metallicity in thefield is -1&lt;[m/h]&lt;0 and only a small fraction of stars have ages &lt;~1 gyr. theresults show that most of the stars in this outer disk field were formed by z~1and that the arm structure at this radius has a lifetime of &gt;~100 myr. wediscuss the measured evolution of the m81 disk in the context of surveys ofhigh-redshift disk galaxies and deep stellar photometry of other nearbygalaxies. all of these indicate that massive spiral disks are mostly formed byz~1 and that they have experienced rapid metal enrichment.
