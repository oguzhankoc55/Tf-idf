0901.4018	an evolved donor star in the long-period cataclysmic variable hs  0218+3229	context. we present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of hs0218+3229, a new long-period cataclysmic variable discovered within the hamburgquasar survey. it is one of the few systems that allow a dynamical measurementof the masses of the stellar components. aims. we combine the analysis oftime-resolved optical spectroscopy and r-band photometry with the aim ofmeasuring the mass of the white dwarf and the donor star and the orbitalinclination. methods. cross-correlation of the spectra with k-type dwarftemplates is used to derive the radial velocity curve of the donor star. anoptimal subtraction of the broadened templates is performed to measure therotational broadening and constrain the spectral type of the donor. finally, anellipsoidal model is fitted to the r-band light curve to obtain constraintsupon the orbital inclination of the binary system. results. the orbital periodof hs 0218+3229 is found to be 0.297229661 +- 0.000000001 d (7.13351186 +-0.00000002 h), and the amplitude of the donor's radial velocity curve is k2 =162.4 +- 1.4 km/s. modelling the ellipsoidal light curves gives an orbitalinclination in the range i = 59 +- 3 deg. a rotational broadening between 82.4+- 1.2 km/s and 89.4 +- 1.3 km/s is found when assuming zero and continuum limbdarkening, respectively. the secondary star has most likely a spectral type k5and contributes ~ 80-85% to the r-band light. our analysis yields a mass ratioof 0.52 &lt; q &lt; 0.65, a white dwarf mass of 0.44 &lt; m1(msol) &lt; 0.65, and a donorstar mass of 0.23 &lt; m2(msol) &lt; 0.44. conclusions. we find that the donor starin hs 0218+3229 is significantly undermassive for its spectral type. it istherefore very likely that it has undergone nuclear evolution prior to theonset of mass transfer.

0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0902.3248	ntt, spitzer and chandra spectroscopy of sdssj095209.56+214313.3: the  most luminous coronal-line supernova ever observed, or a stellar tidal  disruption event ?	the galaxy sdssj0952+2143 showed remarkable emission-line properties firstreported in 2008 (paper i), which are the consequence of a powerful high-energyflare. here we report follow-up observations of sdssj0952+2143, and discussoutburst scenarios in terms of stellar tidal disruption by a smbh, peculiarvariability of an agn, and a supernova explosion. the optical spectrum ofsdssj0952+2143 exhibits several peculiarities: an exceptional ratio of [fevii]transitions over [oiii], a dramatic decrease by a factor of 10 of thehighest-ionization lines, a very unusual and variable balmer line profileincluding a triple-peaked narrow component with two unresolved horns, and alarge balmer decrement. the mir emission measured with the spitzer irs in thenarrow 10-20mu band is extraordinarily luminous (3.5 x 10^{43} erg\s). the irsspectrum shows a bump around ~11mu and an increase towards longer wavelengths,reminiscent of silicate emission. the strong mir excess over the nir impliesthe dominance of relatively cold dust. the x-ray luminosity of 10^{41} erg\smeasured with chandra is below that typically observed in agn. similarities ofsdssj0952+2143 with some extreme supernovae suggest the explosion of asupernova of type iin. however, an extreme accretion event in a low-luminosityagn or inactive galaxy, especially stellar tidal disruption, remainpossibilities, which could potentially produce a very similar emission-lineresponse. if indeed a supernova, sdssj0952+2143 is one of the most distantx-ray and mir detected sne known so far, the most mir luminous, and one of themost x-ray luminous. it is also by far the most luminous (&gt;10^{40} erg\s) inhigh-ionization coronal lines, exceeding previous sne by at least a factor of100 [abridged].

0905.0472	the evolution of swift/bat blazars and the origin of the mev background	we use 3 years of data from the swift/bat survey to select a complete sampleof x-ray blazars above 15 kev. this sample comprises 26 flat-spectrum radioquasars (fsrqs) and 12 bl lac objects detected over a redshift range of0.03&lt;z&lt;4.0. we use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15--55kev band, the evolution of blazars. we find that, contrary to the seyfert-likeagns detected by bat, the population of blazars shows strong positiveevolution. this evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous opticalqsos and luminous x-ray selected agns. we also find evidence for anepoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quietagns. we interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion andjet activity. in our sample, the fsrqs evolve strongly, while our best-fitshows that bl lacs might not evolve at all. the blazar population accounts for10-20 % (depending on the evolution of the bl lacs) of the cosmic x-raybackground (cxb) in the 15--55 kev band. we find that fsrqs can explain theentire cxb emission for energies above 500 kev solving the mystery of thegeneration of the mev background. the evolution of luminous fsrqs shows a peakin redshift ($z_c$=4.3$\pm0.5$) which is larger than the one observed in qsosand x-ray selected agns. we argue that fsrqs can be used as tracers of massiveelliptical galaxies in the early universe.

0905.0690	the collimation and energetics of the brightest swift gamma-ray bursts	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are widely believed to behighly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). as a result ofthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a grb is usually severalorders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. measuring thisopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in theafterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in theswift era. here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of theisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, e(gamma, iso)) grbs in the swift erato search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energyrelease. we present multi-wavelength (radio through x-ray) observations of grbs050820a, 060418, and 080319b, and construct afterglow models to extract theopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.together with results from previous analyses of grbs 050904 and 070125, we findevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supportingthe canonical picture of grbs as collimated explosions. the most naturalexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most swift grbs istherefore selection effects. however, the opening angles for the events in oursample are larger than would be expected if all grbs had a canonical energyrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. the total energy release we measure for those"hyper-energetic" (e(total) &gt;~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enoughto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

0907.2462	a new analysis of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 051103, a  possible extragalactic sgr giant flare	grb 051103 is considered to be a candidate soft gamma repeater (sgr)extragalactic giant magnetar flare by virtue of its proximity on the sky tom81/m82, as well as its time history, localization, and energy spectrum. wehave derived a refined interplanetary network localization for this burst whichreduces the size of the error box by over a factor of two. we examine its timehistory for evidence of a periodic component, which would be one signature ofan sgr giant flare, and conclude that this component is neither detected nordetectable under reasonable assumptions. we analyze the time-resolved energyspectra of this event with improved time- and energy resolution, and concludethat although the spectrum is very hard, its temporal evolution at late timescannot be determined, which further complicates the giant flare association. wealso present new optical observations reaching limiting magnitudes of r &gt; 24.5,about 4 magnitudes deeper than previously reported. in tandem withserendipitous observations of m81 taken immediately before and one month afterthe burst, these place strong constraints on any rapidly variable sources inthe region of the refined error ellipse proximate to m81. we do not find anyconvincing afterglow candidates from either background galaxies or sources inm81, although within the refined error region we do locate two uv bright starforming regions which may host sgrs. a supernova remnant (snr) within the errorellipse could provide further support for an sgr giant flare association, butwe were unable to identify any snr within the error ellipse. these data stilldo not allow strong constraints on the nature of the grb 051103 progenitor, andsuggest that candidate extragalactic sgr giant flares will be difficult,although not impossible, to confirm.

0909.3847	the effect of dust geometry on the lyman-alpha output of galaxies	we present the optical spectroscopic follow-up of 31 z=0.3 lyman-alpha (lya)emitters, previously identified by deharveng et al. (2008). we find that 17% ofthe lya emitters have line ratios that require the hard ionizing continuumproduced by an agn. the uniform dust screen geometry traditionally used instudies similar to ours is not able to simultaneously reproduce the observedhigh lya/halpha and halpha/hbeta line ratios. we consider differentpossibilities for the geometry of the dust around the emitting sources. we findthat also a uniform mixture of sources and dust does not reproduce the observedline ratios. instead, these are well reproduced by a clumpy dust screen. thismore realistic treatment of the geometry results in extinction corrected(lya/halpha)_c values consistent with case b recombination theory, whereas auniform dust screen model would imply values (lya/halpha)_c higher than 8.7.our analysis shows that there is no need to invoke "ad-hoc" multi phase mediain which the lya photons only scatter between the dusty clouds and eventuallyescape.

0912.1247	recent discoveries of supersoft x-ray sources in m 31	classical novae (cne) have recently been reported to represent the majorclass of supersoft x-ray sources (ssss) in the central area of our neighbouringgalaxy m 31. this paper presents a review of results from recent x-rayobservations of m 31 with xmm-newton and chandra. we carried out a dedicatedoptical and x-ray monitoring program of cne and ssss in the central area of m31. we discovered the first ssss in m 31 globular clusters (gcs) and theirconnection to the very first discovered cn in a m 31 gc. this result may havean impact on the cn rate in gcs. furthermore, in our optical and x-raymonitoring data we discovered the cn m31n 2007-11a, which shows a very shortsss phase of 29 - 52 days. short sss states (durations &lt; 100 days) of cneindicate massive white dwarfs (wds) that are candidate progenitors ofsupernovae type ia. in the case of m31n 2007-11a, the optical and x-ray lightcurves suggest a binary containing a wd with m_wd &gt; 1.0 m_sun. finally, wepresent the discovery of the sss counterpart of the cn m31n 2006-04a. the x-raylight curve of m31n 2006-04a shows short-time variability, which might indicatean orbital period of about 2 hours.

1003.0658	spectroscopic evidence for a 5.4-minute orbital period in hm cancri	hm cancri is a candidate ultracompact binary white dwarf with an apparentorbital period of only 5.4 minutes, as suggested by x-ray and opticallight-curve modulations on that period, and by the absence of longer-periodvariability. in this letter we present keck-i spectroscopy which shows clearmodulation of the helium emission lines in both radial velocity and amplitudeon the 5.4-minute period and no other. the data strongly suggest that thebinary is emitting he i 4471 from the irradiated face of the cooler, lessmassive star, and he ii 4686 from a ring around the more massive star. fromtheir relative radial velocities, we measure a mass ratio q=0.50+/-0.13. weconclude that the observed 5.4-minute period almost certainly represents theorbital period of an interacting binary white dwarf. we thus confirm that hmcnc is the shortest-period binary star known: a unique test for stellarevolution theory, and one of the strongest known sources of gravitational wavesfor the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa).

1003.1720	discovery of a new photometric sub-class of faint and fast classical  novae	we present photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of a sample ofextragalactic novae discovered by the palomar 60-inch telescope during a searchfor "fast transients in nearest galaxies" (p60-fasting). designed as a fastcadence (1-day) and deep (g &lt; 21 mag) survey, p60-fasting was particularlysensitive to short-lived and faint optical transients. the p60-fasting novasample includes 10 novae in m31, 6 in m81, 3 in m82, 1 in ngc2403 and 1 inngc891. this significantly expands the known sample of extragalactic novaebeyond the local group, including the first discoveries in a starburstenvironment. surprisingly, our photometry shows that this sample is quiteinconsistent with the canonical maximum magnitude rate of decline (mmrd)relation for classical novae. furthermore, the spectra of the p60-fastingsample are indistinguishable from classical novae. we suggest that we haveuncovered a sub-class of faint and fast classical novae in a new phase space inluminosity-timescale of optical transients. thus, novae span two orders ofmagnitude in both luminosity and time. perhaps, the mmrd, which ischaracterized only by the white dwarf mass, was an over-simplification. novaphysics appears to be characterized by quite a rich four-dimensional parameterspace in white dwarf mass, temperature, composition and accretion rate.

1003.2217	nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2007if: first total mass  measurement of a super-chandrasekhar-mass progenitor	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2007if, anoverluminous (m_v = -20.4), red (b-v = 0.16 at b-band maximum), slow-rising(t_rise = 24 days) type ia supernova in a very faint (m_g = -14.10) hostgalaxy. a spectrum at 5 days past b-band maximum light is a direct match to thesuper-chandrasekhar-mass candidate sn ia 2003fg, showing si ii and c ii at~9000 km/s. a high signal-to-noise co-addition of the sn spectral time seriesreveals no na i d absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the hostgalaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the lirarelation for normal sne ia. the ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strongmaximum in i-band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing innear-maximum-light spectra. sn2007 if also displays a plateau in the si iivelocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for anoverdense shell in the sn ejecta. we calculate the bolometric light curve ofthe sn and use it and the \ion{si}{2} velocity evolution to constrain the massof the shell and the underlying sn ejecta, and demonstrate that sn2007 if isstrongly inconsistent with a chandrasekhar-mass scenario. within the context ofa "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, andassuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4+/- 0.2 solar masses, with 1.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of nickel-56 and with0.3-0.5 solar masses in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. ourmodeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a moreefficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the lowvelocities typical of super-chandrasekhar-mass sneia.

1010.2034	the missing gas problem in grb host galaxies: evidence for a highly  ionised component	there is considerable discrepancy between the amount of x-ray absorption andthat inferred from optical (rest frame uv) as measured along gamma-ray burst(grb) sight lines, with the former being typically an order of magnitude higherthan what would be expected from the measurement of neutral element species viaoptical absorption line spectroscopy. we explore this "missing gas problem" byusing x-ray and optical measurements in a sample of 29 z=0.7-6.3 grbs from bothspectroscopic data and the afterglow broadband spectral energy distributions.the low ionisation species detected in the uv are associated with the neutralinterstellar medium in the grb host galaxy, while soft x-ray absorption, whichis weakly dependent on the ionisation state of the gas, provides a probe of thetotal column of gas along the sight line. after careful consideration of anysystematic effects, we find that the neutral gas consists of less than ~10% ofthe total gas, and this limit decreases with the more ionised that the x-rayabsorbing gas is, which in our spectral fits is assumed to be neutral. only avery small fraction of this ionised gas, however, is detected in uv absorptionlines with ionisation potentials up to ~200ev (i.e. siiv, civ, nv, ovi), whichleaves us to postulate that the x-ray excess is due to ultra-highly-ionised,dense gas in the grb vicinity.

1011.0113	grb 050502b optical afterglow: a jet break at high redshift	aims: grb 050502b is well known for the very bright flare displayed in itsx-ray light curve. despite extensive studies, however, the optical light curvehas never been discussed and its redshift is unconstrained. possiblecorrelations between optical and x-ray data are analysed. methods: photometricdata from tng in the r and i bands were used to compare the optical afterglowwith the x-ray light curve. the hyperz package and a late time vlt hostobservation were used to derive redshift estimates. results: the i-bandafterglow decay followed a power-law of index {\alpha} = 2.1 $\pm$ 0.6, after alate break at ~ $1.3 \times 10^5$ s. the r - i color is remarkably red and thebroadband spectral index {\beta}_ox = $0.9 \pm 0.1$ is consistent with thex-ray spectral slope {\beta}_x. although a photometric redshift of z &gt; 4 is themost conservative result to consider, a photometric redshift of z = 5.2 $\pm$0.3 is suggested with no extinction in the host, based on which an isotropicenergy e_{\gamma},iso = $(3.8 \pm 0.7) \times 10^52$ erg and a jet openingangle {\theta} ~ $3.7^{\circ}$ are subsequently derived.  conclusions: the combined x-ray and optical data suggest an achromatic break,which we interpret as a jet break. the post jet break slope obeys roughly theclosure relation for the jet slow cooling model. because of the afterglow'svery red color, in order for the redshift to be low (z &lt; 1), extinction, ifpresent in the host, must be significantly high. since the optical-to-x-rayindex is consistent with the x-ray spectrum, and there is no xrt evidence forexcess n_h, grb 050502b was likely at high redshift.

1011.0618	the nature of "dark" gamma-ray bursts	context: thirteen years after the discovery of the first afterglows, thenature of dark gamma-ray bursts (grb) still eludes explanation: while eachng-duration grb typically has an x-ray afterglow, optical/nir emission is onlyseen for 40-60% of them. aim: here we use the afterglow detection statistics ofthe systematic follow-up observations performed with grond since mid-2007 inorder to derive the fraction of "dark bursts" according to different methods,and to distinguish between various scenarios for "dark bursts". method:observations were performed with the 7-channel "gamma-ray optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpi/eso telescope. we used theafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between grb and thefirst grond exposure. results: for long-duration swift bursts with a detectedx-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/nirafterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240\,min afterthe burst. complementing our grond data with swift/xrt spectra we constructbroad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. edetect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. the faintoptical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination oftwo contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderateredshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift $&gt;$5.

1011.1205	photometric redshifts for grb afterglows from grond and swift/uvot	we present a framework to obtain photometric redshifts (photo-zs) forgamma-ray burst afterglows. using multi-band photometry from grond andswift/uvot, photo-zs are derived for five grbs for which spectroscopicredshifts are not available. we use uv/optical/nir data and syntheticphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometricredshifts of grbs and their accuracy. taking into account the afterglowsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometryto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. themeasurement of photo-zs for grb afterglows provides a quick, robust andreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly inthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/nir range cannot beobtained. given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, therelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and betterthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. we detail the approach on 5 sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts observed with uvot on-board swift and/or grond. thedistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for grb 080825b, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for grb080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for grb 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ forgrb 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for grb 090530. combining the responsefrom uvot with ground-based observatories and in particular grond operating inthe optical/nir wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorablecases, provided that these grbs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficientlybright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.

1012.0328	the two-component jet of grb 080413b	the quick and precise localization of grbs by the swift telescope allows theearly evolution of the afterglow light curve to be captured by ground-basedtelescopes. with grond measurements we can investigate theoptical/near-infrared light curve of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst 080413bin the context of late rebrightening. multi-wavelength follow-up observationswere performed on the afterglow of grb 080413b. x-ray emission was detected bythe x-ray telescope onboard the swift satellite and obtained from the publicarchive. optical and near-infrared photometry was performed with theseven-channel imager grond mounted at the mpg/eso 2.2 m telescope andadditionally with the rem telescope, both in la silla, chile. the light curvemodel was constructed using the obtained broad-band data. the broad-band lightcurve of the afterglow of grb 080413b is well fitted with an on-axistwo-component jet model. the narrow ultra-relativistic jet is responsible forthe initial decay, while the rise of the moderately relativistic wider jet nearits deceleration time is the cause of the rebrightening of the light curve. thelater evolution of the optical/nir light curve is then dominated by the widecomponent, the signature of which is almost negligible in the x-raywavelengths. these components have opening angles of theta(narrow) ~1.7 degreesand theta(wide) ~9 degrees, and lorentz factors of gamma(narrow) &gt;188 andgamma(wide) ~18.5. we calculated the beaming-corrected energy release to be 7.9x 10^48 erg.

1101.1099	fermi/gbm observations of the ultra-long grb 091024: a burst with an  optical flash	in this paper we examine gamma-ray and optical data of grb 091024, agamma-ray burst (grb) with an extremely long duration of t90~1020 s, asobserved with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm). we present spectralanalysis of all three distinct emission episodes using data from fermi/gbm.because of the long nature of this event, many ground-based optical telescopesslewed to its location within a few minutes and thus were able to observe thegrb during its active period. we compare the optical and gamma-ray lightcurves. furthermore, we estimate a lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor fromthe variability and spectrum of the gbm light curve and compare it with thatobtained from the peak time of the forward shock of the optical afterglow. fromthe spectral analysis we note that, despite its unusually long duration, thisburst is similar to other long grbs, i.e. there is spectral evolution (both thepeak energy and the spectral index vary with time) and spectral lags aremeasured. we find that the optical light curve is highly anti-correlated to theprompt gamma-ray emission, with the optical emission reaching the maximumduring an epoch of quiescence in the prompt emission. we interpret thisbehavior as the reverse shock (optical flash), expected in theinternal-external shock model of grb emission but observed only in a handful ofgrbs so far. the lower limit on the initial lorentz factor deduced from thevariability time scale ($\gamma_{min}=195_{-110}^+{90}$)is consistent withinthe error to the one obtained using the peak time of the forward shock($\gamma_0=120$) and is also consistent with lorentz factors of other longgrbs.

1105.0917	on the nature of the extremely fast optical rebrightening of the  afterglow of grb 081029	context. after the launch of the swift satellite, the gamma-ray burst (grb)optical light-curve smoothness paradigm has been questioned thanks to thefaster and better sampled optical follow-up, which has unveiled a very complexbehaviour. this complexity is triggering the interest of the whole grbcommunity. the grond multi-channel imager is used to study optical andnear-infrared (nir) afterglows of grbs with unprecedented optical andnear-infrared temporal and spectral resolution. the grb 081029 has a veryprominent optical rebrightening event and is an outstanding example of theapplication of the multi-channel imager to grb afterglows. aims. here weexploit the rich grond multi-colour follow-up of grb 081029 combined with xrtobservations to study the nature of late-time rebrightenings that appear in theoptical-nir light-curves of some grb afterglows. methods. we analyse theoptical and nir observations obtained with the seven-channel gamma-ray burstoptical and near-infrared detector (grond) at the 2.2 m mpi/eso telescope andthe x-ray data obtained with the xrt telescope on board the swift observatory.the multi-wavelength temporal and spectral evolution is discussed in theframework of different physical models. results. the extremely steep opticaland nir rebrightening observed in grb 081029 cannot be explained in theframework of the standard forward shock afterglow model. the absence of acontemporaneous x-ray rebrightening and the evidence of a strong spectralevolution in the optical-nir bands during the rise suggest two separatecomponents that dominate in the early and late-time lightcurves, respectively.the steepness of the optical rise cannot be explained even in the framework ofthe alternative scenarios proposed in the literature unless a late-timeactivity of the central engine is assumed.

1105.1312	grb 090426: discovery of a jet break in a short burst afterglow	context: the link between the duration of grbs and the nature of theirprogenitors remains disputed. short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, andexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. aims: it is of critical importance toestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different grbpopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. the swift grb090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. its duration(t_90=1.28 s) places grb 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while thehigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectralcharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration grbs. methods: onthe basis of data obtained with the tautenburg 2m telescope (germany) and the7-channel imager grond (la silla, chile), we compiled the most finely sampledlight curve available for a short burst optical/nir afterglow. the light curvewas then analysed in a standard fashion. grond and xrt data were used todetermine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow acrossmore than three orders of magnitude. results: our data show that a light curvebreak exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. this light curvedecay is achromatic in the optical/nir bands, and interpreted as a post-jetbreak phase. the x-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.conclusions: the half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as theluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that grb 090426is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger oftwo compact objects.

0709.4333	bat x-ray survey - iii: x-ray spectra and statistical properties	in this concluding part of the series of three papers dedicated to theswift/bat hard x-ray survey (bxs), we focus on the x-ray spectral analysis andstatistical properties of the source sample. using a dedicated method toextract time-averaged spectra of bat sources we show that galactic sourceshave, generally, softer spectra than extragalactic objects and that seyfert 2galaxies are harder than seyfert 1s. the averaged spectrum of all seyfertgalaxies is consistent with a power-law with photon index of 2.00 (+/-0.07).the cumulative flux-number relation for the extragalactic sources in the 14-170kev band is best described by a power-law with a slope alpha=1.55 (+/-0.20) anda normalization of 9.6$\pm1.9 \times 10^{-3}$ agn deg$^{-2}$ (or 396(+/-80) agnall-sky) above a flux level of 2$\times 10^{-11}$erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (~0.85mcrab). the integration of the cumulative flux per unit area indicates that batresolves 1-2% of the x-ray background emission in the 14-170 kev band. asub-sample of 24 extragalactic sources above the 4.5 sigma detection limit isused to study the statistical properties of agn. this sample comprises localseyfert galaxies (z=0.026, median value) and ~10% blazars. we find that 55% ofthe seyfert galaxies are absorbed by column densities of log(n_h)&gt;22, but thatnone is a bona fide compton-thick. this study shows the capabilities of bat toprobe the hard x-ray sky to the mcrab level.

1107.2399	quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares: new clues from the fermi  gamma-ray burst monitor	in the last four decades it has been observed that solar flares showquasi-periodic pulsations (qpps) from the lowest, i.e. radio, to the highest,i.e. gamma-ray, part of the electromagnetic spectrum. to this day, it is stillunclear which mechanism creates such qpps. in this paper, we analyze fourbright solar flares which show compelling signatures of quasi-periodic behaviorand were observed with the gamma-ray burst monitor (\gbm) onboard the fermisatellite. because gbm covers over 3 decades in energy (8 kev to 40 mev) it canbe a key instrument to understand the physical processes which drive solarflares. we tested for periodicity in the time series of the solar flaresobserved by gbm by applying a classical periodogram analysis. however, contraryto previous authors, we did not detrend the raw light curve before creating thepower spectral density spectrum (psd). to assess the significance of thefrequencies we made use of a method which is commonly applied for x-raybinaries and seyfert galaxies. this technique takes into account the underlyingcontinuum of the psd which for all of these sources has a p(f) ~ f^{-\alpha}dependence and is typically labeled red-noise. we checked the reliability ofthis technique by applying it to a solar flare which was observed by the reuvenramaty high-energy solar spectroscopic imager (rhessi) which contains, besidesany potential periodicity from the sun, a 4 s rotational period due to therotation of the spacecraft around its axis. while we do not find an intrinsicsolar quasi-periodic pulsation we do reproduce the instrumental periodicity.moreover, with the method adopted here, we do not detect significant qpps inthe four bright solar flares observed by gbm. we stress that for the purpose ofsuch kind of analyses it is of uttermost importance to appropriately accountfor the red-noise component in the psd of these astrophysical sources.

1108.0674	the seds and host galaxies of the dustiest grb afterglows	(abridged) until recently the information inferred from gamma-ray burstfollow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows,biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amountsof dust. here, we present grb afterglow and host observations for a sample ofbursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visualextinction along the sight-line. this facilitates an investigation of theproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of thesepoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts fromoptically-selected samples. the hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse intheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than thehosts of optically-bright events. we hence probe a different galaxy population,suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,chemically-evolved and metal-rich members. this also indicates that the dustalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probablylocated in the diffuse ism or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate grbenvironment. some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of smallstellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxiespossess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. the presentedobservations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondinglychemically-evolved grb hosts. this suggests that grbs trace the globalstar-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected hostsamples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass hostgalaxies was at least partially a selection effect.

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1110.4642	super-solar metal abundances in two galaxies at z ~ 3.57 revealed by the  grb 090323 afterglow spectrum	we report on the surprisingly high metallicity measured in two absorptionsystems at high redshift, detected in the very large telescope spectrum of theafterglow of the gamma-ray burst grb 090323. the two systems, at redshiftz=3.5673 and z=3.5774 (separation delta v ~ 660 km/s), are dominated by theneutral gas in the interstellar medium of the parent galaxies. from the singlyionized zinc and sulfur, we estimate oversolar metallicities of [zn/h]=+0.29+/-0.10 and [s/h] = +0.67+/- 0.34, in the blue and red absorber,respectively. these are the highest metallicities ever measured in galaxies atz&gt;3. we propose that the two systems trace two galaxies in the process ofmerging, whose star formation and metallicity are heightened by theinteraction. this enhanced star formation might also have triggered the birthof the grb progenitor. as typically seen in star-forming galaxies, thefine-structure absorption siii* is detected, both in g0 and g1. from therest-frame uv emission in the grb location, we derive a relatively high, notcorrected for dust extinction, star-formation rate sfr ~ 6 msun/yr. theseproperties suggest a possible connection between some high-redshift grb hostgalaxies and high-z massive sub-millimeter galaxies, which are characterized bydisturbed morphologies and high metallicities. our result provides additionalevidence that the dispersion in the chemical enrichment of the universe at highredshift is substantial, with the existence of very metal rich galaxies lessthan two billion years after the big bang.

1201.3885	the late-time afterglow of the extremely energetic short burst grb  090510 revisited	the discovery of the short grb 090510 has raised considerable attentionmainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it is among the mostenergetic events detected so far within the entire grb population. theafterglow was observed with swift/uvot and swift/xrt and evidence of a jetbreak around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature,implying that after this break the optical and x-ray light curve should fadewith the same decay slope. as noted by several authors, the post-break decayslope seen in the uvot data is much shallower than the steep decay in the x-rayband, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. we reduced andanalyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imagergrond. based on the densely sampled data set obtained with grond, we find thatthe optical afterglow of grb 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phasestarting around 22 ks after the burst. during this time the grond optical lightcurve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the x-ray data.in combination with the uvot data this implies that a second break must haveoccurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however,has no obvious counterpart in the x-ray band, contradicting the interpretationthat this could be another jet break. the grond data provide the missing pieceof evidence that the optical afterglow of grb 090510 did follow a post-jetbreak evolution at late times.

1202.1225	the long gamma-ray burst rate and the correlation with host galaxy  properties	to answer questions on the start and duration of the epoch of reionisation,periods of galaxy mergers and properties of other cosmological encounters, thecosmic star formation history (csfh), is of fundamental importance. using theassociation of long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) with the death of massive starsand their ultra-luminous nature, the csfh can be probed to higher redshiftsthan current conventional methods. unfortunately, no consensus has been reachedon the manner in which the lgrb rate (lgrbr) traces the csfh, leaving many ofthe questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. observations by thegrb nir detector (grond) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,acquired highly complete lgrb samples. driven by these completeness levels andnew evidence of lgrbs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxiesthan previously thought, the possible biases of the lgrbr-csfh connection areinvestigated over a large range of galaxy properties. the csfh is modelledusing empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formationrates. biasing the csfh by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and otherunknown redshift dependencies, a lgrbr is generated and compared to the highlycomplete grond sample. it is found that there is no strong preference for ametallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknownredshift effects, in contrast to previous work which suggest values ofz/z_sun~0.1-0.3. from the best-fit models, we predict that ~1.2% of the lgrbburst sample exists above z=6. the linear relationship between the lgrbr andthe csfh suggested by our results implies that redshift biases present inprevious lgrb samples significantly affect the inferred dependencies of lgrbson their host galaxy properties. such biases can lead to, e.g., aninterpretation of metallicity limitations and evolving lgrb luminosityfunctions.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1202.4967	discovery of the neutron star spin and a possible orbital period from  the be/x-ray binary igr j05414-6858 in the lmc	the number of known be/x-ray binaries in the large magellanic cloud is smallcompared to the observed population of the galaxy or the small magellaniccloud. the discovery of a system in outburst provides the rare opportunity tomeasure its x-ray properties in detail. igr j05414-6858 was discovered in 2010by integral and found in another outburst with the swift satellite in 2011. inorder to characterise the system, we analysed the data from a follow-upxmm-newton target of opportunity observation of the 2011 outburst andinvestigate the stellar counterpart with photometry and spectroscopy. wemodelled the x-ray spectra from the epic instruments on xmm-newton and comparedthem with swift archival data. in the x-ray and optical light curves, wesearched for periodicities and variability. the optical counterpart wasclassified using spectroscopy obtained with eso's faint object spectrograph atntt. the x-ray spectra as seen in 2011 are relatively hard with a photon indexof ~0.3-0.4 and show only low absorption. they deviate significantly fromearlier spectra of a probable type ii outburst in 2010. the neutron star spinperiod of p_s = 4.4208 s was discovered with epic-pn. the i-band light curverevealed a transition from a low to a high state around mjd 54500. the opticalcounterpart is classified to b0-1iiie and shows halpha emission and a variablenir excess, vanishing during the 2010 outburst. in the optical high state, wefound a periodicity at 19.9 days, probably caused by binarity and indicatingthe orbital period.

1205.2216	search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts during  ligo science run 6 and virgo science runs 2 and 3	we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with154 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-rayexperiments in 2009-2010, during the sixth ligo science run and the second andthird virgo science runs. we perform two distinct searches: a modeled searchfor coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole;and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. we find noevidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual grb inthis sample or with the population as a whole. for all grbs we place lowerbounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of agravitational-wave emission energy of 10^-2 m c^2 at 150 hz, with a medianlimit of 17 mpc. for short hard grbs we place exclusion distances on binaryneutron star and neutron star-black hole progenitors, using astrophysicallymotivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 mpc and 28mpc respectively. these distance limits, while significantly larger than for asearch that is not aided by grb satellite observations, are not large enough toexpect a coincidence with a grb. however, projecting these exclusions to thesensitivities of advanced ligo and virgo, which should begin operation in 2015,we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with grbs willbecome quite possible.

1208.3467	sdss j102623.61+254259.5: the second most distant blazar at z=5.3	the radio-loud quasar sdss j102623.61+254259.5, at a redshift z=5.3, is oneof the most distant radio-loud objects. since its radio flux exceeds 100 mjy ata few ghz, it is also one of the most powerful radio-loud sources. we proposethat this source is a blazar, i.e. we are seeing its jet at a small viewingangle. this claim is based on the spectral energy distribution of this source,and especially on its strong and hard x-ray spectrum, as seen by swift, verytypical of powerful blazars. observations by the gamma-ray burstoptical/near-infrared detector (grond) and by thewide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) allow to establish the thermal nature of the emission in thenear ir-optical band. assuming that this is produced by a standard accretiondisk, we derive that it emits a luminosity of l_d \simeq 9 \times 10^46 ergs^{-1} and that the black hole has a mass between 2 and 5 billion solar masses.this poses interesting constraints on the mass function of heavy (&gt; 10^9 m_sun)black holes at high redshifts.

1209.0479	pks 2123-463: a confirmed gamma-ray blazar at high redshift	the flat spectrum radio quasar (fsrq) pks 2123-463 was associated in thefirst fermi-lat source catalog with the gamma-ray source 1fgl j2126.1-4603, butwhen considering the full first two years of fermi observations, no gamma-raysource at a position consistent with this fsrq was detected, and thus pks2123-463 was not reported in the second fermi-lat source catalog. on 2011december 14 a gamma-ray source positionally consistent with pks 2123-463 wasdetected in flaring activity by fermi-lat. this activity triggeredradio-to-x-ray observations by the swift, grond, atca, ceduna, and kat-7observatories. results of the localization of the gamma-ray source over 41months of fermi-lat operation are reported here in conjunction with the resultsof the analysis of radio, optical, uv and x-ray data collected soon after thegamma-ray flare.  the strict spatial association with the lower energy counterpart togetherwith a simultaneous increase of the activity in optical, uv, x-ray andgamma-ray bands led to a firm identification of the gamma-ray source with pks2123-463. a new photometric redshift has been estimated as z = 1.46+/-0.05using grond and swift/uvot observations, in rough agreement with the disputedspectroscopic redshift of z = 1.67. we fit the broadband spectral energydistribution with a synchrotron/external compton model. we find that a thermaldisk component is necessary to explain the optical/uv emission detected byswift/uvot. this disk has a luminosity of about 1.8x10^46 erg/s, and a fit tothe disk emission assuming a schwarzschild (i.e., nonrotating) black hole givesa mass of about 2x10^9 solar masses. this is the first black hole mass estimatefor this source.

1209.2514	high redshift fermi blazars observed by grond and swift	we observed 5 gamma-ray loud blazars at redshift greater than 2 with thex-ray telescope (xrt) and the ultraviolet and optical telescope (uvot) onboardthe swift satellite, and the gamma-ray burst optical near-infrared detector(grond) instrument. these observations were quasi simultaneous, usually withina few hours. for 4 of these blazars the near-ir to uv data show the presence ofan accretion disc, and we could reliably estimate its accretion rate and blackhole mass. one of them, pks 1348+007, was found in an extraordinarily highir-optical state, almost two orders of magnitude brighter than at the epoch ofthe sloan digital sky survey observations. for all the 5 quasars the physicalparameters of the jet emitting zone, derived by applying a one-zone emissionmodel, are similar to that found for the bulk of other gamma-ray loud quasars.with our observations we have x-ray data for the full sample of blazars at z&gt;2present in the fermi 2-yrs (2lac) catalog. this allows to have a rathercomplete view of the spectral energy distribution of all high-redshift fermiblazars, and to draw some conclusions about their properties, and especiallyabout the relation between the accretion rate and the jet power.

1301.3522	the interplanetary network supplement to the fermi gbm catalog of cosmic  gamma-ray bursts	we present interplanetary network (ipn) data for the gamma-ray bursts in thefirst fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) catalog. of the 491 bursts in thatcatalog, covering 2008 july 12 to 2010 july 11, 427 were observed by at leastone other instrument in the 9-spacecraft ipn. of the 427, the localizations of149 could be improved by arrival time analysis (or triangulation). for anygiven burst observed by the gbm and one other distant spacecraft, triangulationgives an annulus of possible arrival directions whose half-width varies betweenabout 0.4' and 32 degrees, depending on the intensity, time history, andarrival direction of the burst, as well as the distance between the spacecraft.we find that the ipn localizations intersect the 1 sigma gbm error circles inonly 52% of the cases, if no systematic uncertainty is assumed for the latter.if a 6 degree systematic uncertainty is assumed and added in quadrature, thetwo localization samples agree about 87% of the time, as would be expected. ifwe then multiply the resulting error radii by a factor of 3, the two samplesagree in slightly over 98% of the cases, providing a good estimate of the gbm 3sigma error radius. the ipn 3 sigma error boxes have areas between about 1square arcminute and 110 square degrees, and are, on the average, a factor of180 smaller than the corresponding gbm localizations. we identify two bursts inthe ipn/gbm sample that did not appear in the gbm catalog. in one case, the gbmtriggered on a terrestrial gamma flash, and in the other, its origin was givenas uncertain. we also discuss the sensitivity and calibration of the ipn.

1303.6951	blazar candidates beyond redshift 4 observed with grond	the search for extremely massive high redshift blazars is essential to putstrong constraints on the supermassive black holes formation theories. up tonow, the few blazars known to have a redshift larger than 4 have beendiscovered serendipitously. we try a more systematic approach. assumingradio-loudness as a proxy for the jet orientation, we select a sample ofextremely radio-loud quasars. we measure their black hole masses with a methodbased on fitting the thermal emission from the accretion disc. we achieve aprecision of a factor of two for our measures, thanks to the observationsperformed with the gamma-ray burst optical near-infrared detector (grond). theinfrared to optical grond data allow us to observe directly the peak of thedisc emission, thus constraining the overall disc luminosity. we obtain a smallrange of masses, that peaks at 10^{9.3}msun. if some of our candidates will beconfirmed as blazars, these results would introduce interesting constraints onthe mass function of extremely massive black holes at very high redshift.moreover, all our blazar candidates have high accretion rates. this result,along with the high masses, opens an interesting view on the need of a fastgrowth of the heaviest black holes at very high redshift.

1304.4628	time-resolved analysis of fermi grbs with fast and slow-cooled  synchrotron photon models	time-resolved spectroscopy is performed on eight bright, long gamma-raybursts (grbs) dominated by single emission pulses that were observed with the{\it fermi gamma-ray space telescope}. fitting the prompt radiation of grbs byempirical spectral forms such as the band function leads to ambiguousconclusions about the physical model for the prompt radiation. moreover, theband function is often inadequate to fit the data. the grb spectrum istherefore modeled with two emission components consisting of optically thinnonthermal synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons and, whensignificant, thermal emission from a jet photosphere, which is represented by ablackbody spectrum. to produce an acceptable fit, the addition of a blackbodycomponent is required in 5 out of the 8 cases. we also find that the low-energyspectral index \alpha is consistent with a synchrotron component with \alpha =-0.81\pm 0.1. this value lies between the limiting values of \alpha = -2/3 and\alpha = -3/2 for electrons in the slow and fast-cooling regimes, respectively,suggesting ongoing acceleration at the emission site. the blackbody componentcan be more significant when using a physical synchrotron model instead of theband function, illustrating that the band function does not serve as a goodproxy for a nonthermal synchrotron emission component. the temperature andcharacteristic emission-region size of the blackbody component are found to,respectively, decrease and increase as power laws with time during the promptphase. in addition, we find that the blackbody and nonthermal components haveseparate temporal behaviors.

1310.0006	the cosmic evolution of fermi bl lacertae objects	fermi has provided the largest sample of gamma-ray selected blazars to date.in this work we use a uniformly selected set of 211 bl lacertae (bl lac)objects detected by it fermi during its first year of operation. we haveobtained redshift constraints for 206 out of the 211 bl lacs in our samplemaking it the largest and most complete sample of bl lacs available in theliterature. we use this sample to determine the luminosity function of bl lacsand its evolution with cosmic time. we find that for most bl lac classes, theevolution is positive with a space density peaking at modest redshift (z~1.2).the low-luminosity, high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lacs are an exception,showing strong negative evolution, with number density increasing forz$\lesssim$0.5. since this rise corresponds to a drop-off in the density offlat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), a possible interpretation is that thesehsps represent an accretion-starved end-state of an earlier merger-drivengas-rich phase. we additionally find that the known bl lac correlation betweenluminosity and photon spectral index persists after correction for thesubstantial observational selection effects with implications for the so called`blazar sequence'. finally, estimating the beaming corrections to theluminosity function, we find that bl lacs have an average lorentz factor of$\gamma=6.1^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$, and that most are seen within 10$^{\circ}$ of thejet axis.

(2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1311.5734	the ultraluminous grb 110918a	grb 110918a is the brightest long grb detected by konus-wind during its 19years of continuous observations and the most luminous grb ever observed sincethe beginning of the cosmological era in 1997. we report on the final ipnlocalization of this event and its detailed multiwavelength study with a numberof space-based instruments. the prompt emission is characterized by a typicalduration, a moderare $e_{peak}$ of the time-integrated spectrum, and stronghard-to-soft evolution. the high observed energy fluence yields, at z=0.984, ahuge isotropic-equivalent energy release $e_{iso}=(2.1\pm0.1)\times10^{54}$erg. the record-breaking energy flux observed at the peak of the short, bright,hard initial pulse results in an unprecedented isotropic-equivalent luminosity$l_{iso}=(4.7\pm0.2)\times10^{54}$erg s$^{-1}$. a tail of the soft gamma-rayemission was detected with temporal and spectral behavior typical of thatpredicted by the synchrotron forward-shock model. swift/xrt and swift/uvotobserved the bright afterglow from 1.2 to 48 days after the burst and revealedno evidence of a jet break. the post-break scenario for the afterglow ispreferred from our analysis, with a hard underlying electron spectrum andism-like circumburst environment implied. we conclude that, among multiplereasons investigated, the tight collimation of the jet must have been a keyingredient to produce this unusually bright burst. the inferred jet openingangle of 1.7-3.4 deg results in reasonable values of the collimation-correctedradiated energy and the peak luminosity, which, however, are still at the topof their distributions for such tightly collimated events. we estimate adetection horizon for a similar ultraluminous grb of $z\sim7.5$ for konus-wind,and $z\sim12$ for swift/bat, which stresses the importance of grbs as probes ofthe early universe.

1312.1335	afterglow rebrightenings as a signature of a long-lasting central engine  activity? the emblematic case of grb 100814a	in the past few years the number of well-sampled optical to nir light curvesof long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has greatly increased particularly due tosimultaneous multi-band imagers such as grond. combining these densely sampledground-based data sets with the swift uvot and xrt space observations unveils amuch more complex afterglow evolution than what was predicted by the mostcommonly invoked theoretical models. grb 100814a represents a remarkableexample of these interesting well-sampled events, showing a prominent late-timerebrightening in the optical to nir bands and a complex spectral evolution.this represents a unique laboratory to test the different afterglow emissionmodels. here we study the nature of the complex afterglow emission of grb100814a in the framework of different theoretical models. moreover, we comparethe late-time chromatic rebrightening with those observed in other well-sampledlong grbs. we analysed the optical and nir observations obtained with theseven-channel gamma-ray burst optical and near-infrared detector at the 2.2 mmpg/eso telescope together with the x-ray and uv data detected by theinstruments onboard the swift observatory. the broad-band afterglow evolution,achieved by constructing multi-instrument light curves and spectral energydistributions, will be discussed in the framework of different theoreticalmodels. we find that the standard models that describe the broad-band afterglowemission within the external shock scenario fail to describe the complexevolution of grb 100814a, and therefore more complex scenarios must be invoked.[abridged]

1312.4547	prompt emission of grb 121217a from gamma-rays to the nir	the mechanism that causes the prompt-emission episode of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) is still widely debated despite there being thousands of promptdetections. the favoured internal shock model relates this emission tosynchrotron radiation. however, it does not always explain the spectral indicesof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.multi-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate thepossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. we present grb121217a, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (nir) emissionduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the gamma-ray burst opticalnear-infrared detector (grond) in combination with the swift and fermisatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 kev to 100 kev. we determine aphotometric redshift of z=3.1+/-0.1 with a line-of-sight extinction of a_v~0mag, utilising the optical/nir sed. from the afterglow, we determine a bulklorentz factor of gamma~250 and an emission radius of r&lt;10^18 cm. theprompt-emission broadband spectral energy distribution is well fit with abroken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break ate=6.6+/-0.9 kev, which can be interpreted as the maximum injection frequency.self-absorption by the electron population below energies of e_a&lt;6 kev suggesta magnetic field strength of b~10^5 g. however, all the best fit modelsunderpredict the flux observed in the nir wavelengths, which also onlyrebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, instark contrast to the x-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. we present grb121217a one of the few grbs for which there are multi-wavelength observationsof the prompt-emission period and show that it can be understood with asynchrotron radiation model.

1312.5099	simultaneous optical/gamma-ray observations of grb 121217's prompt  emission	since the advent of the swift satellite it has been possible to obtainprecise localisations of grb positions of sub-arcsec accuracy within seconds,facilitating ground-based robotic telescopes to automatically slew to thetarget within seconds. this has yielded a plethora of observational data forthe afterglow phase of the grb, but the quantity of data (&lt;2 kev) covering theinitial prompt emission still remains small. only in a handful of cases has itbeen possible obtain simultaneous coverage of the prompt emission in amulti-wavelength regime (gamma-ray to optical), as a result of: observing thefield by chance prior to the grb (e.g. 080319b/naked-eye burst), long-promptemission (e.g., 080928, 110205a) or triggered on a pre-cursor (e.g., 041219a,050820a, 061121). this small selection of bursts have shown both correlated anduncorrelated gamma-ray and optical light curve behaviour, and themulti-wavelength emission mechanism remains far from resolved (i.e. singlepopulation synchrotron self-component, electron distributions, additionalneutron components or residual collisions). such multi-wavelength observationsduring the grb prompt phase are pivotal in providing further insight on thepoorly understood prompt emission mechanism. we add to this small sample theswift burst 121217a that had two distinct periods of prompt emission separatedby ~700 s, observed by swift/bat, swift/xrt and fermi/gbm. as a result of thetime delay of the second emission, it enabled optical imaging (from 3 to 7bands) to be taken with the grond instrument to a resolution as fine as 10s.this multi-wavelength data will hopefully allow us to shed more light on thecurrent picture of prompt emission physics.

1402.6336	a missing-link in the supernova-grb connection: the case of sn 2012ap	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are characterized by ultra-relativistic outflows,while supernovae are generally characterized by non-relativistic ejecta. grbafterglows decelerate rapidly usually within days, because their low-massejecta rapidly sweep up a comparatively larger mass of circumstellar material.however supernovae, with heavy ejecta, can be in nearly free expansion forcenturies. supernovae were thought to have non-relativistic outflows except forfew relativistic ones accompanied by grbs. this clear division was blurred bysn 2009bb, the first supernova with a relativistic outflow without an observedgrb. yet the ejecta from sn 2009bb was baryon loaded, and in nearly-freeexpansion for a year, unlike grbs. we report the first supernova discoveredwithout a grb, but with rapidly decelerating mildly relativistic ejecta, sn2012ap. we discovered a bright and rapidly evolving radio counterpart driven bythe circumstellar interaction of the relativistic ejecta. however, we did notfind any coincident grb with an isotropic fluence of more than a sixth of thefluence from grb 980425. this shows for the first time that central engines intype ic supernovae, even without an observed grb, can produce both relativisticand rapidly decelerating outflows like grbs.

1503.04870	a tidal disruption flare in a massive galaxy? implications for the  fuelling mechanisms of nuclear black holes	we argue that the `changing look' agn recently reported by lamassa et al.could be a luminous flare produced by the tidal disruption of a super-solarmass star passing just a few gravitational radii outside the event horizon of a$\sim 10^8 m_{\odot}$ nuclear black hole. this flare occurred in a massive,star forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks torepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. by takingdifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year sdss stripe-82light-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum overthe course of the outburst. the tidal disruption event (tde) interpretation isconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, whichdisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (witha clear superimposed re-brightening flare). our analysis places constraints onthe physical properties of the tde, such as the putative disrupted star's massand orbital parameters, as well as the size and temperature of the emittingmaterial. the properties of the broad and narrow emission lines observed in twoepochs of sdss spectra provide further constraints on the circum-nuclearstructure, and could be indicative that the system hosted a moderate-luminosityagn as recently as a few $10^4$ years ago, and is likely undergoing residualaccretion as late as ten years after peak, as seen from the broad h$\alpha$emission line. we discuss the complex interplay between tidal disruption eventsand gas accretion episodes in galactic nuclei, highlighting the implicationsfor future tde searches and for estimates of their intrinsic rates.

1505.04415	super-solar metallicity at the position of the ultra-long grb130925a	over the last decade there has been immense progress in the follow-up ofshort and long grbs, resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate ofx-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of grb redshifts, and of theidentification of the underlying host galaxies. nevertheless, our theoreticalunderstanding on the progenitors and central engines powering these vastexplosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of `ultra-long' grbshas fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of grb formation. inthis paper we present high signal-to-noise x-shooter observations of the hostgalaxy of grb130925a, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-longgrb, with prompt gamma-ray emission detected for ~20ks. the grb line of sightwas close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations coverboth this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy, in addition to a brightstar-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. from our broadwavelength coverage we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinctionmeasurements at both the galaxy nucleus, and an outer star-forming region, andmeasure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy withinthe 10-20% most metal-rich grb host galaxies. such a high metal enrichment hasimplications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long grbs,although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to ruleout a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. the spatiallyresolved spectroscopic data presented in this paper offer important insightinto variations in the metal and dust abundance within grb host galaxies. theyalso illustrate the need for ifu observations on a larger sample of grb hostgalaxies at varies metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on therelation between the grb circumburst and the galaxy-whole properties.

astro-ph;0604343	the nature of the dls fast transients	the discovery and study of highly transient sources, especially those whichrise to high brightness and then fade to obscurity, has been a major part ofmodern astrophysics. well known examples include supernovae and novae. abyproduct of the deep lens survey was the discovery of three transients whichvaried on a timescale of less than an hour. all three had faint and redcounterparts, the brightest of which was identified with an m star. however,the remaining two showed hints of an extragalactic origin, one had a spatiallyextended counterpart and the other appeared in projection on the outskirts of abright elliptical galaxy. if these two sources were really of an extragalacticorigin then the two events represent a new class of exotic explosivetransients. we undertook spectroscopic observations with the keck telescope andfind the two counterparts are also late type galactic dwarfs. our mainconclusion is that flares from m dwarfs constitute a dense foreground fog anddominate over any plausible class of extragalactic fast transients by at leasttwo orders of magnitude. overcoming this fog will likely require dedicatedsurveys with careful optimization of target field location, filter(s) andcadence, pre-search imaging to filter out late type dwarfs and a well plannedrapid followup plan.

0809.1388	m31n 2007-11d: a slowly-rising, luminous nova in m31	we report a series of extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations ofthe luminous m31 nova m31n 2007-11d. our photometric observations coupled withprevious measurements show that the nova took at least four days to reach peakbrightness at r~14.9 on 20 nov 2007 ut. after reaching maximum, the time forthe nova to decline 2 and 3 magnitudes from maximum light (t_2 and t_3) was~9.5 and ~13 days, respectively, establishing that m31n 2007-11d was amoderately fast declining nova. during the nova's evolution a total of threespectra were obtained. the first spectrum was obtained one day after maximumlight (5 days post-discovery), followed by two additional spectra taken on thedecline at two and three weeks post-maximum. the initial spectrum revealsnarrow balmer and fe ii emission with p cygni profiles superimposed on a bluecontinuum. these data along with the spectra obtained on the subsequent declineclearly establish that m31n 2007-11d belongs to the fe ii spectroscopic class.the properties of m31n 2007-11d are discussed within the context of otherluminous novae in m31, the galaxy, and the lmc. overall, m31n 2007-11d appearsto be remarkably similar to nova lmc 1991, which was another bright,slowly-rising, fe ii nova. a comparison of the available data for luminousextragalactic novae suggest that the &gt;~4 day rise to maximum light seen in m31n2007-11d may not be unusual, and that the rise times of luminous galacticnovae, usually assumed to be &lt;~2 days, may have been underestimated.

astro-ph;0607511	a spectacular radio flare from xrf 050416a at 40 days and implications  for the nature of x-ray flashes	we present detailed optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of thex-ray flash 050416a obtained with palomar and siding springs observatories aswell as hst and the vla, placing this event among the best-studied x-rayflashes to date. in addition, we present an optical spectrum from keck lrisfrom which we measure the redshift of the burst, z=0.6528. at this redshift theisotropic-equivalent prompt energy release was about 10^51 erg, and using astandard afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energyis a factor of 10 larger, e_k,iso ~ 10^52 erg. the lack of an observed jetbreak to t ~ 20 days indicates that the opening angle is larger than 7 deg andthe total beaming-corrected relativistic energy is larger than 10^50 erg. wefurther show that the burst produced a strong radio flare at t ~ 40 daysaccompanied by an observed flattening in the x-ray band which we attribute toan abrupt circumburst density jump or an episode of energy injection (eitherfrom a refreshed shock or off-axis ejecta). late-time observations with hstshow evidence for an associated supernova with peak optical luminosity roughlycomparable to that of sn 1998bw. next, we show that the host galaxy of xrf050416a is actively forming stars at a rate of at least 2 m_solar per year witha luminosity of l_b ~ 0.5l* and metallicity of z ~ 0.2-0.8 z_solar. finally, wediscuss the nature of xrf 050416a in the context of short-hard gamma-ray burstsand under the framework of off-axis and dirty fireball models for x-rayflashes.

astro-ph;0611128	a new population of high redshift short-duration gamma-ray bursts	the redshift distribution of the short-duration grbs is a crucial, butcurrently fragmentary, clue to the nature of their progenitors. here we presentoptical observations of nine short grbs obtained with gemini, magellan, and thehubble space telescope. we detect the afterglows and host galaxies of two shortbursts, and host galaxies for two additional bursts with known opticalafterglow positions, and five with x-ray positions (&lt;6'' radius). in eight ofthe nine cases we find that the most probable host galaxies are faint,r~23-26.5 mag, and are therefore starkly different from the first few short grbhosts with r~17-22 mag and z&lt;0.5. indeed, we measure spectroscopic redshifts ofz~0.4-1.1 for the four brightest hosts. a comparison to large field galaxysamples, as well as the hosts of long grbs and previous short grbs, indicatesthat the fainter hosts likely reside at z&gt;1. our most conservative limit isthat at least half of the five hosts without a known redshift reside at z&gt;0.7(97% confidence level), suggesting that about 1/3-2/3 of all short grbsoriginate at higher redshifts than previously determined. this has twoimportant implications: (i) we constrain the acceptable age distributions to awide lognormal (sigma&gt;1) with tau~4-8 gyr, or to a power law, p(tau)~tau^n,with -1&lt;n&lt;0; and (ii) the inferred isotropic energies,e_{gamma,iso}~10^50-10^52 erg, are significantly larger than ~10^48-10^49 ergfor the low redshift short grbs, indicating a large spread in energy release orjet opening angles. finally, we re-iterate the importance of short grbs aspotential gravitational wave sources and find a conservative advanced ligodetection rate of ~2-6 yr^-1.

astro-ph;0611933	the incidence of dwarf novae in large area transient searches	understanding and quantifying the contribution of known classes of transientand variable sources is an important lesson to be learned from the manifold ofpre-cursors programs of the near-future large synoptic sky survey programs likeskymapper, pan-starrs and lsst. with this goal in mind, we undertookphotometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of three recently reportedunidentified transients. for two sources, wfi j132813.7-214237 and wfij161953.3+031909, we show that unfortunate coincidences lead to their previousdesignation as transients. while the former is now interpreted as the spatialcoincidence of a solar system object with faint background star, the latter ismerely a cataclysmic variable unfortunately caught in and out of eclipse. thethird candidate, rotse3 j160213.1-021311.7 is identified as an su uma-typedwarf novae with quiescent brightness of r~22.7 and an outburst amplitude ofabout 5 mag. the fourth event, sdss-sn15207, similarly shows evidence for adwarf nova origin. our main conclusion is that cataclysmic variables in theirvarious avata rs will contribute moderately to the population of transientobjects.

astro-ph;0612408	sn 2006gy: an extremely luminous supernova in the galaxy ngc 1260	with an extinction-corrected v-band peak absolute magnitude of about -22,supernova (sn) 2006gy is probably the brightest sn ever observed. we report onmulti-wavelength observations of this sn and its environment. our spectroscopyshows an h alpha emission line as well as absorption features which may beidentified as siii lines at low expansion velocity. the high peak luminosity,the slow rise to maximum, and the narrow h alpha line are similar to thoseobserved in hybrid type-ia/iin (also called iia) sne. the host galaxy, ngc1260, is dominated by an old stellar population with solar metallicity.however, our high resolution adaptive optics images reveal a dust lane in thisgalaxy, and there appears to be an hii region in the vicinity of the sn. theextra-ordinarily large peak luminosity, ~3x10^44 erg/s, demands a densecircum-stellar medium, regardless of the mass of the progenitor star. theinferred mass loss rate of the progenitor is ~0.1 solar mass per year over aperiod of ~10 yr prior to explosion. such an high mass-loss rate may be theresult of a binary star common envelope ejection. the total radiated energy inthe first two months is about 1.1x10^51 erg, which is only a factor of two lessthan that available from a super-chandrasekhar ia explosion. therefore, giventhe presence of a star forming region in the vicinity of the sn and the highenergy requirements, a plausible scenario is that sn 2006gy is related to thedeath of a massive star (e.g., pair production sn).

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

astro-ph;0703192	grb 060505: a possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming  region at redshift of 0.09	on 2006 may 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, gamma-rayburst (grb) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. here, wereport the discovery of the grb optical afterglow and observations of itsenvironment using gemini-south, hubble space telescope (hst), chandra, swiftand the very large array. the optical afterglow of this grb is spatiallyassociated with a prominent star forming region in the sc-type galaxy 2dfgrss173z112. its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitordelay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 myr. our hst deepimaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolutemagnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at abouttwo weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive nickel 56to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). although itwas suggested that grb 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration grbswith no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that thephysical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-durationgrbs.

0811.3974	sdss j080449.49+161624.8: a peculiar am cvn star from a colour-selected  sample of candidates	we describe a spectroscopic survey designed to uncover an estimated ~40 amcvn stars hiding in the photometric database of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we have constructed a relatively small sample of about 1500 candidatesbased on a colour selection, which should contain the majority of all am cvnbinaries while remaining small enough that spectroscopic identification of thefull sample is feasible.  we present the first new am cvn star discovered using this strategy, sdssj080449.49+161624.8, the ultracompact binary nature of which is demonstratedusing high-time-resolution spectroscopy obtained at the magellan telescopes atlas campanas observatory, chile. a kinematic 's-wave' feature is observed on aperiod 44.5+/-0.1min, which we propose is the orbital period, although thepresent data cannot yet exclude its nearest daily aliases.  the new am cvn star shows a peculiar spectrum of broad, single-peaked heliumemission lines with unusually strong series of ionised helium, reminiscent ofthe (intermediate) polars among the hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables. wespeculate that sdss j0804+1616 may be the first magnetic am cvn star. theaccreted material appears to be enriched in nitrogen, to n/o&gt;~10 and n/c&gt;10 bynumber, indicating cno-cycle hydrogen burning, but no helium burning, in theprior evolution of the donor star.
