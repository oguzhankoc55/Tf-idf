0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

0710.0761	geometrical tests of cosmological models. iii. the cosmology-evolution  diagram at z=1	the rotational velocity of distant galaxies, when interpreted as a size(luminosity) indicator, may be used as a tool to select high redshift standardrods (candles) and probe world models and galaxy evolution via the classicalangular diameter-redshift or hubble diagram tests. we implement the proposedtesting strategy using a sample of 30 rotators spanning the redshift range0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with high resolution spectra and images obtained by the vimos/vlt deepredshift survey (vvds) and the great observatories origins deep survey (goods).we show that by applying at the same time the angular diameter-redshift andhubble diagrams to the same sample of objects (i.e. velocity selected galacticdiscs) one can derive a characteristic chart, the cosmology-evolution diagram,mapping the relation between global cosmological parameters and localstructural parameters of discs such as size and luminosity. this chart allowsto put constraints on cosmological parameters when general prior informationabout discs evolution is available. in particular, by assuming that equallyrotating large discs cannot be less luminous at z=1 than at present (m(z=1) &lt;m(0)), we find that a flat matter dominated cosmology (omega_m=1) is excludedat a confidence level of 2sigma and an open cosmology with low mass density(omega_m = 0.3) and no dark energy contribution is excluded at a confidencelevel greater than 1 sigma. inversely, by assuming prior knowledge about thecosmological model, the cosmology-evolution diagram can be used to gain usefulinsights about the redshift evolution of the structural parameters of baryonicdiscs hosted in dark matter halos of nearly equal masses.

0710.5682	the atesp 5 ghz radio survey. ii. physical properties of the faint radio  population	one of the most debated issues about sub-mjy radio sources, which areresponsible for the steepening of the 1.4 ghz source counts, is the origin oftheir radio emission. particularly interesting is the possibility of combiningradio spectral index information with other observational properties to assesswhether the sources are triggered by star formation or nuclear activity. theaim of this work is to study the optical and near infrared properties of acomplete sample of 131 radio sources with s&gt;0.4 mjy, observed at both 1.4 and 5ghz as part of the atesp radio survey. we use deep multi-colour (ubvrijk)images, mostly taken in the framework of the eso deep public survey, tooptically identify and derive photometric redshifts for the atesp radiosources. deep optical coverage and extensive colour information are availablefor 3/4 of the region covered by the radio sample. typical depths of the imagesare u~25, b~26, v~25.4, r~25.5, i~24.3, 19.5&lt;k_s&lt;20.2, j&lt;22.2. optical/nearinfrared counterparts are found for ~78% (66/85) of the radio sources in theregion covered by the deep multi-colour imaging, and for 56 of these reliableestimates of the redshift and type are derived. we find that many of thesources with flat radio spectra are characterised by high radio-to-opticalratios (r&gt;1000), typical of classical powerful radio galaxies and quasars.flat-spectrum sources with low r values are preferentially identified withearly type galaxies, where the radio emission is most probably triggered bylow-luminosity active galactic nuclei. considering both early type galaxies andquasars as sources with an active nucleus, such sources largely dominate oursample (78%). flat-spectrum sources associated with early type galaxies arequite compact (d&lt;10-30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radio emission.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

0705.2438	the swire-vvds-cfhtls surveys: stellar mass assembly over the last 10  gyears. evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1	(abridged abstract) we present an analysis of the stellar mass growth overthe last 10 gyrs using a large 3.6$\mu$ selected sample. we split our sampleinto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. our measurements of the k-lfsand ld evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is alreadyassembled at $z\sim 1.2$. based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellarmass-to-light ratio (in k-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive thestellar mass density for the entire sample. we find that the global evolutionof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation ratederived from uv dust corrected measurements. over the last 8gyrs, we observethat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximatelyconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over thesame timescale. as a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in thequiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in activegalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. from $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, weobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by afactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch whenan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity andstart to build up the red sequence.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

astro-ph;0102016	the atesp radio survey iv. optical identifications and spectroscopy in  the eis-a region	(abridged) this paper is the fourth of a series reporting the results of theatesp 1.4 ghz radio survey. the survey covers a region of ~26 sq. degrees atdecl. -40 degr. and has produced a catalogue of 2967 radio sources down to ~0.5mjy (6sigma). in this paper we present the optical identifications over a 3 sq.degr. region of the public eso imaging survey. in this region deep photometryand 95% complete object catalogues in the i band are available down to i~22.5.these data allowed us to identify 57% of the atesp sources present in theregion (219/386). for a magnitude limited sample of 70 identified sources withi&lt;19.0 we have obtained spectroscopy at the eso 3.6 m telescope. this dataallowed us to get redshifts and spectral classification for all sources (exceptone). from the analysis of the spectroscopic sample we find that thecomposition of the faint radio population abruptly changes going from mjy tosub-mjy fluxes: the early type galaxies largely dominate the mjy population(60%), while star forming processes become important in the sub-mjy regime.starburst and post-starburst galaxies go from 13% at s&gt;1 mjy to 39% at s&lt;1 mjy.nevertheless, at sub-mjy fluxes, early type galaxies still constitute asignificant fraction (25%) of the whole population. we also show that, due tothe distribution of radio to optical ratios, sub-mjy samples with fainterspectroscopic follow-ups should be increasingly sensitive to the population ofearly type galaxies, while a larger fraction of star-forming galaxies would beexpected in microjy samples. we compare our results with others obtained fromstudies of sub-mjy samples and we show how the existing discrepancies can beexplained in terms of selection effects.

astro-ph;0402202	bias in the estimation of global luminosity functions	we discuss a bias present in the calculation of the global luminosityfunction  (lf) which occurs when analysing faint galaxy samples. this effect existsbecause of the different spectral energy distributions of galaxies, which arein turn quantified by the k-corrections. we demonstrate that this bias occursbecause not all galaxy types are visible in the same absolute magnitude rangeat a given redshift and it mainly arises at high redshift since it is relatedto large k-corrections. we use realistic simulations with observed lfs toinvestigate the amplitude of the bias. we also compare our results to theglobal lfs derived from hubble deep field-north and -south (hdf) surveys. weconclude that, as expected, there is no bias in the global lf measured in theabsolute magnitude range where all galaxy types are observable. beyond thisrange the faint-end slope of the global lf can be over/under-estimateddepending on the adopted lf estimator. the effect is larger when the referencefilter in which the global lf is measured, is far from the rest-frame filter inwhich galaxies are selected. the fact that lf estimators are differentlyaffected by this bias implies that the bias is minimal when the different lfestimators give measurements consistent with one another at the faint-end. forinstance, we show that the estimators are discrepant in the same way both inthe simulated and hdf lfs. this suggests that the hdf lfs are affected by thepresently studied bias. the best solution to avoid this bias is to derive theglobal lf in the reference filter closest to the rest-frame selection filter.

astro-ph;0606060	the vimos vlt deep survey: the faint type-1 agn sample	we present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (agn) sample extracted from thevimos vlt deep survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 squaredegree. this sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphologicalor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line agn (blagn) spectra withredshift up to 5. our data are divided into a wide (iab &lt; 22.5) and a deep (iab&lt; 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. because of its depthand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the populationof faint type-1 agn. our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 blagn per squaredegree with iab &lt; 24) is significantly higher than that of any other opticallyselected sample of blagn with spectroscopic confirmation. by applying amorphological and color analysis to our agn sample we find that: (1)~23% of theagn brighter than iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentageincreases to ~42% for those with z &lt; 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of ourblagn are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versusg'-r' color-color diagram. this leads us to the conclusion that classicaloptical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes(iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can missmiss up to ~35% of the agn population. finally, we present a composite spectrumof our sample of objects. while the continuum shape is very similar to that ofthe sdss composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda &gt;3000 a. we interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission ofthe host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled byour survey.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0701273	studying the evolution of large-scale structure with the vimos-vlt deep  survey	the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) currently offers a unique combination ofdepth, angular size and number of measured galaxies among surveys of thedistant universe: ~ 11,000 spectra over 0.5 deg2 to i_{ab}=24 (vvds-deep),35,000 spectra over ~ 7 deg2 to i_{ab}=22.5 (vvds-wide). the current ``firstepoch'' data from vvds-deep already allow investigations of galaxy clusteringand its dependence on galaxy properties to be extended to redshifts ~1.2-1.5,in addition to measuring accurately evolution in the properties of galaxies upto z~4. this paper concentrates on the main results obtained so far on galaxyclustering. overall, l* galaxies at z~ 1.5 show a correlation length r_0=3.6\pm0.7. as a consequence, the linear galaxy bias at fixed luminosity rises overthe same range from the value b~1 measured locally, to b=1.5 +/- 0.1. theinterplay of galaxy and structure evolution in producing this observation isdiscussed in some detail. galaxy clustering is found to depend on galaxyluminosity also at z~ 1, but luminous galaxies at this redshift show asignificantly steeper small-scale correlation function than their z=0counterparts. finally, red galaxies remain more clustered than blue galaxiesout to similar redshifts, with a nearly constant relative bias among the twoclasses, b_{rel}~1.4, despite the rather dramatic evolution of thecolor-density relation over the same redshift range.

astro-ph;9803022	the eso slice project [esp] galaxy redshift survey: v. evidence for a  d=3 sample dimensionality	the issue of the approximate isotropy and homogeneity of the observableuniverse is one of the major topics in modern cosmology: the common use of thefriedmann-robertson-walker [fwr] metric relies on these assumptions. therefore,results conflicting with the ``canonical'' picture would be of the utmostimportance. in a number of recent papers it has been suggested that strongevidence of a fractal distribution with dimension d~2 exists in severalsamples, including abell clusters [aco] and galaxies from the eso slice projectredshift survey [esp].here we report the results of an independent analysis ofthe radial density run,n(&lt;r)~r^d, of the esp and aco data.  for the esp data the situation is such that the explored volume, albeitreasonably deep, is still influenced by the presence of large structures.moreover, the depth of the esp survey (z&lt;0.2) is such to cause noticeableeffects according to different choices of k-corrections, and this adds someadditional uncertainty in the results. however, we find that for a variety ofvolume limited samples the dimensionality of the esp sample is d~3, and thevalue $d = 2$ is always excluded at the level of at least five (bootstrap)standard deviations. the only way in which we reproduce d~2 is by bothunphysically ignoring the galaxy k-correction and using euclidean rather thanfrw cosmological distances.  in the cluster case the problems related to the choice of metrics andk-correction are much lessened, and we find that aco clusters have d_{aco} =3.07 +- 0.18 and d_{aco} = 2.93 +- 0.15 for richness class r \geq 1 and r \geq0, respectively. therefore d=2 is excluded with high significance also for thecluster data.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.
