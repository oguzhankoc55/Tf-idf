hep-ph;9702361	a study of the day - night effect for the super - kamiokande detector:  i. time averaged solar neutrino survival probability	this is the first of two articles aimed at providing comprehensivepredictions for the day-night (d-n) effect for the super-kamiokande detector inthe case of the msw $\nu_e \to \numt$ transition solution of the solar neutrinoproblem. the one-year averaged probability of survival of the solar $\nue$crossing the earth mantle, the core, the inner 2/3 of the core, and the (core +mantle) is calculated with high precision (better than 1%) using the ellipticalorbit approximation (eoa) to describe the earth motion around the sun. resultsfor the survival probability in the indicated cases are obtained for a largeset of values of the msw transition parameters $\delta m^2$ and$sin^22\theta_{v}$ from the ``conservative'' regions of the msw solution,derived by taking into account possible relatively large uncertainties in thevalues of the $^{8}$b and $^{7}$be neutrino fluxes. our results show that theone-year averaged d-n asymmetry in the $\nu_e$ survival probability forneutrinos crossing the earth core can be, in the case of $sin^22 \theta_{v}\leq 0.13$, larger than the asymmetry in the probability for (only mantlecrossing + core crossing) neutrinos by a factor of up to six. the enhancementis larger in the case of neutrinos crossing the inner 2/3 of the core. thisindicates that the super-kamiokande experiment might be able to test the$sin^22\theta_{v} \leq 0.01$ region of the msw solution of the solar neutrinoproblem by performing selective d-n asymmetry measurements.

1312.1966	generalised geometrical cp violation in a $t^{\prime}$ lepton flavour  model	we analyse the interplay of generalised cp transformations and thenon-abelian discrete group $t^{\prime}$ and use the semi-direct product $g_f=t^{\prime}\rtimes h_{\text{cp}}$, as family symmetry acting in the leptonsector. the family symmetry is shown to be spontaneously broken in ageometrical manner. in the resulting flavour model, naturally small majorananeutrino masses for the light active neutrinos are obtained through the type isee-saw mechanism. the known masses of the charged leptons, lepton mixingangles and the two neutrino mass squared differences are reproduced by themodel with a good accuracy. the model allows for two neutrino mass spectra withnormal ordering (no) and one with inverted ordering (io). for each of the threespectra the absolute scale of neutrino masses is predicted with relativelysmall uncertainty. the value of the dirac cp violation (cpv) phase $\delta$ inthe lepton mixing matrix is predicted to be $\delta \cong \pi/2~{\rm or}~3\pi/2$. thus, the cp violating effects in neutrino oscillations are predictedto be maximal (given the values of the neutrino mixing angles) andexperimentally observable. we present also predictions for the sum of theneutrino masses, for the majorana cpv phases and for the effective majoranamass in neutrinoless double beta decay. the predictions of the model can betested in a variety of ongoing and future planned neutrino experiments.

1405.6006	predicting the values of the leptonic cp violation phases	using the fact that the neutrino mixing matrix $u = u^\dagger_{e}u_{\nu}$,where $u_{e}$ and $u_{\nu}$ result from the diagonalisation of the chargedlepton and neutrino mass matrices, we consider a number of forms of $u_{\nu}$associated with a variety of flavour symmetries: i) bimaximal (bm) and ii)tri-bimaximal (tbm) forms, the forms corresponding iii) to the conservation ofthe lepton charge $l' = l_e - l_\mu - l_{\tau}$ (lc), iv) to golden ratio typea (gra) mixing, v) golden ratio type b (grb) mixing, and iii) to hexagonal (hg)mixing. employing the minimal form of $u_e$ that can provide the requisitecorrections to $u_{\nu}$ so that reactor, atmospheric and solar neutrino mixingangles $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$ and $\theta_{12}$ have values compatiblewith the current data, including a possible sizable deviation of $\theta_{23}$from $\pi/4$, we discuss the possibility to obtain predictions for the cpviolation phases in the neutrino mixing matrix. following the approachdeveloped in [1] we derive predictions for the dirac phase $\delta$ and therephasing invariant $j_{\rm cp}$ in the cases of gra, grb and hg forms of$u_{\nu}$ (results for the tbm and bm (lc) forms were obtained in [1]). we showalso that under rather general conditions within the scheme considered thevalues of the majorana phases in the pmns matrix can be predicted for each ofthe forms of $u_{\nu}$ discussed. we give examples of these predictions and oftheir implications for neutrinoless double beta decay. in the gra, grb and hgcases, as in the tbm one, relatively large cp violation effects in neutrinooscillations are predicted ($|j_{cp}| \sim (0.031 - 0.034)$). distinguishingbetween the tbm, bm (lc), gra, grb and hg forms of $u_{\nu}$ requires ameasurement of $\cos\delta$ or a relatively high precision measurement of$j_{\rm cp}$.

0803.4120	the interplay between the "low" and "high" energy cp-violation in  leptogenesis	we analyse within the "flavoured" leptogenesis scenario of baryon asymmetrygeneration, the interplay of the "low energy" cp-violation, originating fromthe pmns neutrino mixing matrix $u$, and the "high energy" cp-violation whichcan be present in the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings, $\lambda$, and canmanifest itself only in "high" energy scale processes. the type i see-saw modelwith three heavy right-handed majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrumis considered. the "orthogonal" parametrisation of the matrix of neutrinoyukawa couplings, which involves a complex orthogonal matrix $r$, is employed.in this approach the matrix $r$ is the source of "high energy" cp-violation.results for normal hierarchical (nh) and inverted hierarchical (ih) lightneutrino mass spectrum are derived in the case of decoupling of the heaviest rhmajorana neutrino. it is shown that taking into account the contribution to$y_b$ due to the cp-violating phases in the neutrino mixing matrix $u$ canchange drastically the predictions for $y_b$, obtained assuming only "highenergy" cp-violation from the $r$-matrix is operative in leptogenesis. in thecase of ih spectrum, in particular, there exist significant regions in thecorresponding parameter space where the purely "high energy" contribution in$y_b$ plays a subdominant role in the production of baryon asymmetry compatiblewith the observations.

0804.4857	neutrino oscillation parameters after high statistics kamland results	we do a re-analysis to asses the impact of the results of the borexinoexperiment and the recent 2.8 kty kamland data on the solar neutrinooscillation parameters. the current borexino results are found to have noimpact on the allowed solar neutrino parameter space. the new kamland datacauses a significant reduction of the allowed range of $\delta m^2_{21}$,determining it with an unprecedented precision of 8.3% at 3$\sigma$. theprecision of $\delta m^2_{21}$ is controlled practically by the kamland dataalone. inclusion of new kamland results also improves the upper bound on$\sin^2\theta_{12}$, but the precision of this parameter continues to becontrolled by the solar data. the third mixing angle is constrained to be$\sin^2\theta_{13} &lt; 0.063$ at $3\sigma$ from a combined fit to the solar,kamland, atmospheric and chooz results. we also address the issue of how muchfurther reduction of allowed range of $\delta m^2_{21}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$is possible with increased statistics from kamland. we find that there is asharp reduction of the $3\sigma$ ``spread'' with enhanced statistics till about10 kty after which the spread tends to flatten out reaching to less than 4%with 15 kty data. for $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ however, the spread is more than 25%even after 20 kty exposure and assuming $\theta_{12} &lt; \pi/4$, as dictated bythe solar data. we show that with a kamland like reactor ``spmin'' experimentat a distance of $\sim$ 60 km, the spread of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ could bereduced to about 5% at $3\sigma$ level while $\delta m_{21}^2$ could bedetermined to within 4%, with just 3 kty exposure.

1504.00658	predictions for the leptonic dirac cp violation phase: a systematic  phenomenological analysis	we derive predictions for the dirac phase $\delta$ present in the $3\times 3$unitary neutrino mixing matrix $u = u_e^{\dagger} \, u_{\nu}$, where $u_e$ and$u_{\nu}$ are $3\times 3$ unitary matrices which arise from thediagonalisation, respectively, of the charged lepton and the neutrino massmatrices. we consider forms of $u_e$ and $u_{\nu}$ allowing us to express$\delta$ as a function of three neutrino mixing angles, present in $u$, and theangles contained in $u_{\nu}$. we consider several forms of $u_{\nu}$determined by, or associated with, symmetries, tri-bimaximal, bimaximal, etc.,for which the angles in $u_{\nu}$ are fixed. for each of these forms and formsof $u_e$ allowing one to reproduce the measured values of the neutrino mixingangles, we construct the likelihood function for $\cos \delta$, using i) thelatest results of the global fit analysis of neutrino oscillation data, and ii)the prospective sensitivities on the neutrino mixing angles. our results, inparticular, confirm the conclusion, reached in earlier similar studies, thatthe measurement of the dirac phase in the neutrino mixing matrix, together withan improvement of the precision on the mixing angles, can provide uniqueinformation as regards the possible existence of symmetry in the lepton sector.

0808.3534	a case of subdominant/suppressed "high energy" contribution to the  baryon asymmetry of the universe in flavoured leptogenesis	the cp-violation necessary for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of theuniverse $y_b$ in the "flavoured" leptogenesis scenario can arise from the "lowenergy" pmns neutrino mixing matrix $u$ and/or from the "high energy" part ofneutrino yukawa couplings, which can mediate cp-violating phenomena only atsome high energy scale. the possible interplay between these two types ofcp-violation is analysed. the type i see-saw model with three heavyright-handed majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum is considered. weshow that in the case of inverted hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum,there exist regions in the corresponding leptogenesis parameter space where therelevant "high energy" phases have large cp-violating values, but the purely"high energy" contribution in $y_b$ plays a subdominant role in the productionof baryon asymmetry compatible with the observations. in some of these regionsthe purely "high energy" contribution in $y_b$ is so strongly suppressed thatone can have successful leptogenesis only if the requisite cp-violation isprovided by the majorana phase(s) in the neutrino mixing matrix.

hep-ph;0103334	hierarchies of quark masses and the mixing matrix in the standard theory	we study the general dependence of mixing angles on heavy fermion masses whenmass hierarchies exist among the fermions. for two generations and smallcabibbo angle, this angle is directly shown to scale like $\mu_1/m_s \pm\mu_2/m_c$, where $|\mu_1| \ll m_s, |\mu_2| \ll m_c$ are independent massscales. for $n=3$ generations, we extend to the yukawa matrices of $u$- and$d$-type quarks the property that the $2\times 2$ upper-left sub-matrix of thecabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa matrix $k$ is a good approximation to the cabibbomatrix $c$. then, without any additional ansatz concerning the existence ofmass hierarchies or the smallness of the mixing angles, the moduli of itsentries $k_{13},k_{23},k_{31},k_{32}$ are shown to scale like$[\beta_{13},\beta_{23},\beta_{31},\beta_{32}] \sqrt{{m_c}/{m_t}} \pm[\delta_{13},\delta_{23},\delta_{31},\delta_{32}] \sqrt{{m_s}/{m_b}}$, wherethe $\beta$'s and the $\delta$'s are coefficients smaller than 10. this method,when used for two generations, gives a dependence on $m_s$ and $m_c$ ``weaker''than the one obtained first, but which matches a well known behaviour for thecabibbo angle: $\theta_c \approx \sqrt{\epsilon_d (m_d/m_s)} -\sqrt{\epsilon_u(m_u/m_c)}$, with $\epsilon_d,\epsilon_u \leq 1$. theasymptotic behaviour in the case of three generations can also be strengthenedinto a $1/m_{b,t}$ behaviour by incorporating our knowledge about thehierarchies of quark masses and the smallness of the mixing angles.
