1001.0026	detection of solar-like oscillations from kepler photometry of the open  cluster ngc 6819	asteroseismology of stars in clusters has been a long-sought goal because theassumption of a common age, distance and initial chemical composition allowsstrong tests of the theory of stellar evolution. we report results from thefirst 34 days of science data from the kepler mission for the open cluster ngc6819 -- one of four clusters in the field of view. we obtain the first cleardetections of solar-like oscillations in the cluster red giants and are able tomeasure the large frequency separation and the frequency of maximum oscillationpower. we find that the asteroseismic parameters allow us to testcluster-membership of the stars, and even with the limited seismic data inhand, we can already identify four possible non-members despite their having abetter than 80% membership probability from radial velocity measurements. weare also able to determine the oscillation amplitudes for stars that span abouttwo orders of magnitude in luminosity and find good agreement with theprediction that oscillation amplitudes scale as the luminosity to the power of0.7. these early results demonstrate the unique potential of asteroseismologyof the stellar clusters observed by kepler.

1001.0216	instrument performance in kepler's first months	the kepler mission relies on precise differential photometry to detect the 80parts per million (ppm) signal from an earth-sun equivalent transit. suchprecision requires superb instrument stability on time scales up to ~2 days andsystematic error removal to better than 20 ppm. to this end, the spacecraft andphotometer underwent 67 days of commissioning, which included several data setstaken to characterize the photometer performance. because kepler has noshutter, we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection, fromwhich we measured the bias levels, dark current, and read noise. these basicdetector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests,indicating that the photometer is working as expected. several image artifactshave proven more complex than when observed during ground testing, as a resultof their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability inflight, which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on thetimescales of transits. because of kepler's unprecedented sensitivity andstability, we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affectphotometric precision. we are using the first 43 days of science data tocharacterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods thatwill be implemented in the calibration pipeline. based on early testing, weexpect to attain kepler's planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of thefield of view.

1001.0256	initial characteristics of kepler long cadence data for detecting  transiting planets	the kepler mission seeks to detect earth-size planets transiting solar-likestars in its ~115 deg^2 field of view over the course of its 3.5 year primarymission by monitoring the brightness of each of ~156,000 long cadence stellartargets with a time resolution of 29.4 minutes. we discuss the photometricprecision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for dataobtained in the 33.5-day long quarter 1 (q1) observations that ended 2009 june15. the lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at varioustimescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating thatkepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. the kepler light curvesexhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permittheir use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding andcharacterizing planets. we discuss the temporal characteristics of both the rawflux time series and the systematic error-corrected flux time series producedby the kepler science pipeline, and give examples illustrating kepler's largedynamic range and the variety of light curves obtained from the q1observations.

1001.0258	overview of the kepler science processing pipeline	the kepler mission science operations center (soc) performs several criticalfunctions including managing the ~156,000 target stars, associated targettables, science data compression tables and parameters, as well as processingthe raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month. the rawdata are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias, smear inducedby a shutterless readout, and other detector and electronic effects. abackground sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 ccdreadout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimalaperture for each star. ancillary engineering data and diagnostic informationextracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in theflux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching forsignatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter.stars with signatures exceeding 7.1 sigma are subjected to a suite ofstatistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion toreject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. physicalparameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature,and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residuallight curve. the pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures andproviding robust eliminations of false positives.

1001.0331	the kepler pixel response function	kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of earth-size exoplanetsorbiting solar-like stars. such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm.the high photometric precision demanded by kepler requires detailed knowledgeof how the kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation.this information is provided by the kepler pixel response function (prf),defined as the composite of kepler's optical point spread function, integratedspacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematiceffects. to provide sub-pixel resolution, the prf is represented as apiecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. this continuousrepresentation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel giventhe star's pixel position. the advantages and difficulties of this polynomialrepresentation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variationin the prf and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomialpatches. on-orbit super-resolution measurements of the prf across the keplerfield of view are described. two uses of the prf are presented: the selectionof pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratiofor that star, and prf-fitted centroids which provide robust and accuratestellar positions on the ccd, primarily used for attitude and plate scaletracking. good knowledge of the prf has been a critical component for thesuccessful collection of high-precision photometry by kepler.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1102.0541	characteristics of planetary candidates observed by kepler, ii: analysis  of the first four months of data	on 1 february 2011 the kepler mission released data for 156,453 starsobserved from the beginning of the science observations on 2 may through 16september 2009. there are 1235 planetary candidates with transit likesignatures detected in this period. these are associated with 997 host stars.distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separatedinto five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately earth-size (radius &lt; 1.25earth radii), 288 super-earth size (1.25 earth radii &lt; radius &lt; 2 earth radii),662 neptune-size (2 earth radii &lt; radius &lt; 6 earth radii), 165 jupiter-size (6earth radii &lt; radius &lt; 15 earth radii), and 19 up to twice the size of jupiter(15 earth radii &lt; radius &lt; 22 earth radii). in the temperature rangeappropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes rangingfrom earth-size to larger than that of jupiter. five are less than twice thesize of the earth. over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller thanneptune. the observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidatesincreases to a peak at two to three times earth-size and then declinesinversely proportional to area of the candidate. our current best estimates ofthe intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting forgeometric and sensitivity biases, are 6% for earth-size candidates, 7% forsuper-earth size candidates, 17% for neptune-size candidates, and 4% forjupiter-size candidates. multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17%of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the candidatesare part of multi-candidate systems.

1102.0543	architecture and dynamics of kepler's candidate multiple transiting  planet systems	about one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in thefirst four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. thereare 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8with four, and one each with five and six. we characterize the dynamicalproperties of these candidate multi-planet systems. the distribution ofobserved period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs areneither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. nonetheless, there aresmall but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both inresonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularlynear the 2:1 resonance. we find that virtually all candidate systems arestable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radiusrelationship. several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority ofthese multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. using the observedmultiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systemsthat matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number ofsingly-transiting systems. we provide constraints on the true multiplicity andmutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing apopulation of systems with multiple super-earth-size and neptune-size planetswith low to moderate mutual inclinations.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1103.5805	gravity modes as a way to distinguish between hydrogen- and  helium-burning red giant stars	red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen intheir cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. once a red giantis sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion.outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties inthe amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount ofinternal mixing from rotation and other processes. progress is hampered by ourinability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core andthose still only burning hydrogen in a shell. asteroseismology offers a wayforward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of starsusing their natural oscillation frequencies. here we report observations ofgravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction betweenevolutionary stages to be made. we use high-precision photometry obtained withthe kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in severalhundred red giants. we find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences withapproximately regular period spacings. these stars fall into two clear groups,allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars(period spacing mostly about 50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium(period spacing about 100 to 300 seconds).

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1107.5207	kepler mission stellar and instrument noise properties	kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally newdiscoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. the datareturned from kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed,precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extentof high duty cycle observations. as the first mission to provide extensive timeseries measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a levelhitherto possible only for the sun, the results from kepler will vastlyincrease our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. herewe report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of mostinterest for detection of exoplanets via transits. by design the data frommoderately bright kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levelsof noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamentallimitations such as poisson statistics and any instrument noise. the noiselevels attained by kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50% the target levels forsolar-type, quiet stars. we provide a decomposition of observed noise for anensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (poisson andreadout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to thestars. the largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise followsfrom intrinsic stellar noise. we show that using stellar parameters fromgalactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation,activity and hence noise levels reproduces the primary intrinsic stellar noisefeatures.

1107.5750	the hot-jupiter kepler-17b: discovery, obliquity from stroboscopic  starspots, and atmospheric characterization	this paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting hotgiant exoplanet kepler-17b. the planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, andradial velocity measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het) show adoppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. from a transit-based estimate of the hoststar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effectivetemperature t_eff=5630+/-100 k from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellarhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 m_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 r_jup.we estimate the planet mass and radius to be mp=2.450+/-0.114 m_jup andrp=1.312+/-0.018 r_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. the host star isactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. thecontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio producesstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. the temporal pattern of thesespot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star'sobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. we detected planetary occultations ofkepler-17b with both the kepler and spitzer space telescopes. we use theseobservations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistentwith a circular orbit (e&lt;0.0011). the brightness temperatures of the planet theinfrared bandpasses are t_3.6um=1880+/-100 k and t4.5um=1770+/-150 k. wemeasure the optical geometric albedo a_g in the kepler bandpass and find a_g =0.10+/-0.02. the observations are best described by atmospheric models forwhich most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

1109.1561	the kepler-19 system: a transiting 2.2 r_earth planet and a second  planet detected via transit timing variations	we present the discovery of the kepler-19 planetary system, which we firstidentified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the kepler photometry.from high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effectivetemperature teff=5541 \pm 60 k, a metallicity [fe/h]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and asurface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. we combine the estimate of teff and[fe/h] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometriclight curve to deduce a stellar mass of m_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 m_sun and astellar radius of r_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 r_sun. we rule out the possibilitythat the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by firstidentifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape ofthe light curve. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more than threeorders of magnitude more likely than a blend. the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure atransit depth with spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent withthe depth measured in the kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. we determinea physical radius of the planet kepler-19b of r_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 r_earth.from radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on theplanet mass of 20.3 m_earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 gcm^-3. we report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from apredicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additionalperturbing body in the system. we cannot uniquely determine the orbitalparameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match theamplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the hoststar's radial velocity limits. however, the perturber in these mechanisms hasperiod &lt;160 days and mass &lt;6 m_jup, confirming its planetary nature askepler-19c.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1110.3510	detection of koi-13.01 using the photometric orbit	we use the koi-13 transiting star-planet system as a test case for therecently developed beer algorithm (faigler &amp; mazeh 2011), aimed at identifyingnon-transiting low-mass companions by detecting the photometric variabilityinduced by the companion along its orbit. such photometric variability isgenerated by three mechanisms, including the beaming effect, tidal ellipsoidaldistortion, and reflection/heating. we use data from three kepler quarters,from the first year of the mission, while ignoring measurements within thetransit and occultation, and show that the planet's ephemeris is clearlydetected. we fit for the amplitude of each of the three effects and use thebeaming effect amplitude to estimate the planet's minimum mass, which resultsin m_p sin i = 9.2 +/- 1.1 m_j (assuming the host star parameters derived byszabo et al. 2011). our results show that non-transiting star-planet systemssimilar to koi-13.01 can be detected in kepler data, including a measurement ofthe orbital ephemeris and the planet's minimum mass. moreover, we derive arealistic estimate of the amplitudes uncertainties, and use it to show thatdata obtained during the entire lifetime of the kepler mission, of 3.5 years,will allow detecting non-transiting close-in low-mass companions orbitingbright stars, down to the few jupiter mass level. data from the kepler extendedmission, if funded by nasa, will further improve the detection capabilities.

1112.1640	kepler-22b: a 2.4 earth-radius planet in the habitable zone of a  sun-like star	a search of the time-series photometry from nasa's kepler spacecraft revealsa transiting planet candidate orbiting the 11th magnitude g5 dwarf kic 10593626with a period of 290 days. the characteristics of the host star are wellconstrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismicanalysis of the kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of0.970 +/- 0.060 msun and 0.979 +/- 0.020 rsun. the depth of 492 +/- 10ppm forthe three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 +/- 0.13 rearth for theplanet. the system passes a battery of tests for false positives, includingreconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. afull blender analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretationby showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarelymimic the observed shape of the transits. the final validation of the planet isprovided by 16 radial velocities obtained with hires on keck 1 over a one yearspan. although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and massdetermination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\sigma} upper limitof 124 mearth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning thedesignation kepler-22b. the radiative equilibrium temperature is 262k for aplanet in kepler-22b's orbit. although there is no evidence that kepler-22b isa rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius toorbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the sun.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.1048	detection of potential transit signals in the first three quarters of  kepler mission data	we present the results of a search for potential transit signals in the firstthree quarters of photometry data acquired by the kepler mission. the targetsof the search include 151,722 stars which were observed over the full intervaland an additional 19,132 stars which were observed for only 1 or 2 quarters.from this set of targets we find a total of 5,392 detections which meet thekepler detection criteria: those criteria are periodicity of the signal, anacceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and a composition test which rejects spuriousdetections which contain non-physical combinations of events. the detectedsignals are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio andby events with relatively short periods. the distribution of estimated transitdepths appears to peak in the range between 40 and 100 parts per million, witha few detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. the detected signalsare compared to a set of known transit events in the kepler field of view whichwere derived by a different method using a longer data interval; the comparisonshows that the current search correctly identified 88.1% of the known events. atabulation of the detected transit signals, examples which illustrate theanalysis and detection process, a discussion of future plans and open,potentially fruitful, areas of further research are included.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1203.1382	kepler presearch data conditioning i - architecture and algorithms for  error correction in kepler light curves	kepler provides light curves of 156,000 stars with unprecedented precision.however, the raw data as they come from the spacecraft contain significantsystematic and stochastic errors. these errors, which include discontinuities,systematic trends, and outliers, obscure the astrophysical signals in the lightcurves. to correct these errors is the task of the presearch data conditioning(pdc) module of the kepler data analysis pipeline. the original version of pdcin kepler did not meet the extremely high performance requirements for thedetection of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellaractivity and rotation. one particular deficiency was that astrophysicalfeatures were often removed as a side-effect to removal of errors. in thispaper we introduce the completely new and significantly improved version of pdcwhich was implemented in kepler soc 8.0. this new pdc version, which utilizes abayesian approach for removal of systematics, reliably corrects errors in thelight curves while at the same time preserving planet transits and otherastrophysically interesting signals. we describe the architecture and thealgorithms of this new pdc module, show typical errors encountered in keplerdata, and illustrate the corrections using real light curve examples.

1203.1383	kepler presearch data conditioning ii - a bayesian approach to  systematic error correction	with the unprecedented photometric precision of the kepler spacecraft,significant systematic and stochastic errors on transit signal levels areobservable in the kepler photometric data. these errors, which includediscontinuities, outliers, systematic trends and other instrumental signatures,obscure astrophysical signals. the presearch data conditioning (pdc) module ofthe kepler data analysis pipeline tries to remove these errors while preservingplanet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. the completelynew noise and stellar variability regime observed in kepler data poses asignificant problem to standard cotrending methods such as sysrem and tfa.variable stars are often of particular astrophysical interest so thepreservation of their signals is of significant importance to the astrophysicalcommunity. we present a bayesian maximum a posteriori (map) approach where asubset of highly correlated and quiet stars is used to generate a cotrendingbasis vector set which is in turn used to establish a range of "reasonable"robust fit parameters. these robust fit parameters are then used to generate abayesian prior and a bayesian posterior probability distribution function (pdf)which when maximized finds the best fit that simultaneously removes systematiceffects while reducing the signal distortion and noise injection which commonlyafflicts simple least-squares (ls) fitting. a numerical and empirical approachis taken where the bayesian prior pdfs are generated from fits to the lightcurve distributions themselves.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

1208.3499	transit timing observations from kepler: vii. confirmation of 27 planets  in 13 multiplanet systems via transit timing variations and orbital stability	we confirm 27 planets in 13 planetary systems by showing the existence ofstatistically significant anti-correlated transit timing variations (ttvs),which demonstrates that the planet candidates are in the same system, andlong-term dynamical stability, which places limits on the masses of thecandidates---showing that they are planetary. %this overall method of planetconfirmation was first applied to \kepler systems 23 through 32. all of thesenewly confirmed planetary systems have orbital periods that place them nearfirst-order mean motion resonances (mmrs), including 6 systems near the 2:1mmr, 5 near 3:2, and one each near 4:3, 5:4, and 6:5. in addition, severalunconfirmed planet candidates exist in some systems (that cannot be confirmedwith this method at this time). a few of these candidates would also be nearfirst order mmrs with either the confirmed planets or with other candidates.one system of particular interest, kepler-56 (koi-1241), is a pair of planetsorbiting a 12th magnitude, giant star with radius over three times that of thesun and effective temperature of 4900 k---among the largest stars known to hosta transiting exoplanetary system.

1208.3712	the neptune-sized circumbinary planet kepler-38b	we discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planetkepler-38b. the stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, andconsists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (m_a = 0.949 +/- 0.059solar masses and r_a = 1.757 +/- 0.034 solar radii) paired with a low-mass star(m_b = 0.249 +/- 0.010 solar masses and r_b = 0.2724 +/- 0.0053 solar radii) ina mildly eccentric (e=0.103) orbit. a total of eight transits due to acircumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the keplerlight curve (using kepler quarters 1 through 11), from which a planetary periodof 105.595 +/- 0.053 days can be established. a photometric dynamical model fitto the radial velocity curve and kepler light curve yields a planetary radiusof 4.35 +/- 0.11 earth radii, or 1.12 +/- 0.03 neptune radii. since the planetis not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary fromkeplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of122 earth masses (7.11 neptune masses or 0.384 jupiter masses) at 95%confidence. this upper limit should decrease as more kepler data becomeavailable.

1210.4592	photometrically derived masses and radii of the planet and star in the  tres-2 system	we measure the mass and radius of the star and planet in the tres-2 systemusing 2.7 years of observations by the kepler spacecraft. the light curve showsevidence for ellipsoidal variations and doppler beaming on a period consistentwith the orbital period of the planet with amplitudes of 2.79+0.44-0.62 and3.44+0.32-0.37 parts per million (ppm) respectively, and a difference betweenthe day and night side planetary flux of 3.41+0.55-0.82 ppm. we present anasteroseismic analysis of solar-like oscillations on tres-2a which we use tocalculate the stellar mass of 0.94+/-0.05 msun and radius of 0.95+/-0.02 rsun.using these stellar parameters, a transit model fit and the phase curvevariations, we determine the planetary radius of 1.162+0.020-0.024 rjup andderive a mass for tres-2b from the photometry of 1.44+/-0.21 mjup. the ratio ofthe ellipsoidal variation to the doppler beaming amplitudes agrees to betterthan 2{\sigma} with theoretical predications, while our measured planet massand radius agree within 2-{\sigma} of previously published values based onspectroscopic radial velocity measurements. we measure a geometric albedo of0.0136+0.0022-0.0033 and an occultation (secondary eclipse) depth of6.5+1.7-1.8 ppm which we combined with the day/night planetary flux ratio tomodel the atmosphere of tres-2b. we find an atmosphere model that contains atemperature inversion is strongly preferred. we hypothesize that the keplerbandpass probes a significantly greater atmospheric depth on the night siderelative to the day side.

1212.2915	detection of potential transit signals in the first twelve quarters of  kepler mission data	we present the results of a search for potential transit signals in the firstthree years of photometry data acquired by the kepler mission. the targets ofthe search include 112,321 targets which were observed over the full intervaland an additional 79,992 targets which were observed for a subset of the fullinterval. from this set of targets we find a total of 11,087 targets whichcontain at least one signal which meets the kepler detection criteria: thosecriteria are periodicity of the signal, an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio,and three tests which reject false positives. each target containing at leastone detected signal is then searched repeatedly for additional signals, whichrepresent multi-planet systems of transiting planets. when targets withmultiple detections are considered, a total of 18,406 potential transitingplanet signals are found in the kepler mission dataset. the detected signalsare dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios and byevents with relatively short periods. the distribution of estimated transitdepths appears to peak in the range between 20 and 30 parts per million, with afew detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. the detections exhibitsignal-to-noise ratios from 7.1 sigma, which is the lower cut-off fordetections, to over 10,000 sigma, and periods ranging from 0.5 days, which isthe shortest period searched, to 525 days, which is the upper limit ofachievable periods given the length of the data set and the requirement thatall detections include at least 3 transits. the detected signals are comparedto a set of known transit events in the kepler field of view, many of whichwere identified by alternative methods; the comparison shows that the currentsearch recovery rate for targets with known transit events is 98.3%.

1301.0842	the false positive rate of kepler and the occurrence of planets	the kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolarplanets. this goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives suchas eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound tothem, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. we performnumerical simulations to predict the occurrence of astrophysical falsepositives detectable by the mission, and quantify the fraction of them thatwould pass the kepler candidate vetting procedure. by comparing theirdistribution with that of the kepler objects of interest detected during thefirst six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positiverate of kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planetsize, and orbital period. we find that the global false positive rate of kepleris 9.4 %, peaking for giant planets (6-22 earth radii) at 17.7 %, reaching alow of 6.7 % for small neptunes (2-4 earth radii), and increasing again forearth-size planets (0.8-1.25 earth radii) to 12.3 %.  most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rateof occurrence of planets down to earth size with no prior assumptions on theirfrequency, by subtracting from the population of actual kepler candidates oursimulated population of astrophysical false positives. we find that 16.5 +/-3.6 % of main-sequence fgk stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25earth radii with orbital periods up to 85 days. there is no significantdependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 earth radii withspectral type. in the process, we derive also a prescription for the signalrecovery rate of kepler that enables a good match to both the koi size andorbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.

1303.0227	all six planets known to orbit kepler-11 have low densities	the kepler-11 planetary system contains six transiting planets ranging insize from 1.8 to 4.2 times the radius of earth. five of these planets orbit ina tightly-packed configuration with periods between 10 and 47 days. we performa dynamical analysis of the system based upon transit timing variationsobserved in more than three years of \ik photometric data. stellar parametersare derived using a combination of spectral classification and constraints onthe star's density derived from transit profiles together with planetaryeccentricity vectors provided by our dynamical study. combining masses of theplanets relative to the star from our dynamical study and radii of the planetsrelative to the star from transit depths together with deduced stellarproperties yields measurements of the radii of all six planets, masses of thefive inner planets, and an upper bound to the mass of the outermost planet,whose orbital period is 118 days. we find mass-radius combinations for all sixplanets that imply that substantial fractions of their volumes are occupied byconstituents that are less dense than rock. the kepler-11 system contains thelowest mass exoplanets for which both mass and radius have been measured.

1303.0255	measuring transit signal recovery in the kepler pipeline i: individual  events	the kepler mission was designed to measure the frequency of earth-sizeplanets in the habitable zone of sun-like stars. a crucial component forrecovering the underlying planet population from a sample of detected planetsis understanding the completeness of that sample - what fraction of the planetsthat could have been discovered in a given data set were actually detected.here we outline the information required to determine the sample completeness,and describe an experiment to address a specific aspect of that question, whichis the issue of transit signal recovery. we investigate the extent to which thekepler pipeline preserves individual transit signals by injecting simulatedtransits into the pixel-level data, processing the modified pixels through thepipeline, and comparing the measured transit signal-to-noise ratio (snr) tothat expected without perturbation by the pipeline. we inject simulated transitsignals across the full focal plane for a set of observations of length 89days. on average, we find that the snr of the injected signal is recovered atms = 0.9973(+/-0.0012)xbs-0.0151(+/-0.0049), where ms is the measured snr andbs is the baseline, or expected, snr. the 1{\sigma} width of the distributionaround this correlation is +/-2.64%. we discuss the pipeline processes thatcause the measured snr to deviate significantly from the baseline snr; theseare primarily the handling of data adjacent to spacecraft re-pointings and theremoval of harmonics prior to the measurement of the snr. finally we outlinethe further work required to characterise the completeness of the keplerpipeline.

1307.5842	the same frequency of planets inside and outside open clusters of stars	most stars and their planets form in open clusters. over 95 per cent of suchclusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubicparsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apartwithin a few hundred million years. older open clusters have survived by virtueof being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) whenthey formed. such clusters represent a stellar environment very different fromthe birthplace of the sun and other planet-hosting field stars. so far morethan 800 planets have been found around sun-like stars in the field. the fieldplanets are usually the size of neptune or smaller. in contrast, only fourplanets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with massessimilar to or greater than that of jupiter. here we report observations of thetransits of two sun-like stars by planets smaller than neptune in thebillion-year-old open cluster ngc6811. this demonstrates that small planets canform and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequencyand properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planetsaround field stars in the galaxy.

1401.1240	contamination in the kepler field. identification of 685 kois as false  positives via ephemeris matching based on q1-q12 data	the kepler mission has to date found almost 6,000 planetary transit-likesignals, utilizing three years of data for over 170,000 stars at extremely highphotometric precision. due to its design, contamination from eclipsingbinaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significantnumber of these signals being false positives. this directly affects thedetermination of the occurrence rate of earth-like planets in our galaxy, aswell as other planet population statistics. in order to detect as many of thesefalse positives as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transitingplanet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. we find that 685 keplerobjects of interest - 12% of all those analyzed - are false positives as aresult of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. of these, 118 havenot previously been identified by other methods. we estimate that ~35% of koisare false positives due to contamination, when performing a first-ordercorrection for observational bias. comparing single-planet candidate kois tomulti-planet candidate kois, we find an observed false positive fraction due tocontamination of 16% and 2.4% respectively, bolstering the existing evidencethat multi-planet kois are significantly less likely to be false positives. wealso analyze the parameter distributions of the ephemeris matches and derive asimple model for the most common type of contamination in the kepler field. wefind that the ephemeris matching technique is able to identify lowsignal-to-noise false positives that are difficult to identify with othervetting techniques. we expect false positive kois to become more frequent whenanalyzing more quarters of kepler data, and note that many of them will not beable to be identified based on kepler data alone.

1507.05097	measuring transit signal recovery in the kepler pipeline ii: detection  efficiency as calculated in one year of data	the kepler planet sample can only be used to reconstruct the underlyingplanet occurrence rate if the detection efficiency of the kepler pipeline isknown, here we present the results of a second experiment aimed atcharacterising this detection efficiency. we inject simulated transiting planetsignals into the pixel data of ~10,000 targets, spanning one year ofobservations, and process the pixels as normal. we compare the set ofdetections made by the pipeline with the expectation from the set of simulatedplanets, and construct a sensitivity curve of signal recovery as a function ofthe signal-to-noise of the simulated transit signal train. the sensitivitycurve does not meet the hypothetical maximum detection efficiency, however itis not as pessimistic as some of the published estimates of the detectionefficiency. for the fgk stars in our sample, the sensitivity curve is well fitby a gamma function with the coefficients a = 4.35 and b = 1.05. we also findthat the pipeline algorithms recover the depths and periods of the injectedsignals with very high fidelity, especially for periods longer than 10 days. weperform a simplified occurrence rate calculation using the measured detectionefficiency compared to previous assumptions of the detection efficiency foundin the literature to demonstrate the systematic error introduced into theresulting occurrence rates. the discrepancies in the calculated occurrencerates may go some way towards reconciling some of the inconsistencies found inthe literature.

1507.06723	discovery and validation of kepler-452b: a 1.6-re super earth exoplanet  in the habitable zone of a g2 star	we report on the discovery and validation of kepler-452b, a transiting planetidentified by a search through the 4 years of data collected by nasa's keplermission. this possibly rocky 1.63$^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ r$_\oplus$ planet orbitsits g2 host star every 384.843$^{+0.007}_{0.012}$ days, the longest orbitalperiod for a small (r$_p$ &lt; 2 r$_\oplus$) transiting exoplanet to date. thelikelihood that this planet has a rocky composition lies between 49% and 62%.the star has an effective temperature of 5757$\pm$85 k and a log g of4.32$\pm$0.09. at a mean orbital separation of 1.046$^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ au,this small planet is well within the optimistic habitable zone of its star(recent venus/early mars), experiencing only 10% more flux than earth receivesfrom the sun today, and slightly outside the conservative habitable zone(runaway greenhouse/maximum greenhouse). the star is slightly larger and olderthan the sun, with a present radius of 1.11$^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$ r$_\odot$ and anestimated age of 6 gyr. thus, kepler-452b has likely always been in thehabitable zone and should remain there for another 3 gyr.

1508.05054	kepler mission stellar and instrument noise properties revisited	an earlier study of the kepler mission noise properties on time scales ofprimary relevance to detection of exoplanet transits found that higher thanexpected noise followed to a large extent from the stars, rather thaninstrument or data analysis performance. the earlier study over the first sixquarters of kepler data is extended to the full four years ultimatelycomprising the mission. efforts to improve the pipeline data analysis have beensuccessful in reducing noise levels modestly as evidenced by smaller valuesderived from the current data products. the new analyses of noise properties ontransit time scales show significant changes in the component attributed toinstrument and data analysis, with essentially no change in the inferredstellar noise. we also extend the analyses to time scales of several days,instead of several hours to better sample stellar noise that follows frommagnetic activity. on the longer time scale there is a shift in stellar noisefor solar-type stars to smaller values in comparison to solar values.

1511.01068	characterization of kepler-91b and the investigation of a potential  trojan companion using exonest	presented here is an independent re-analysis of the kepler light curve ofkepler-91 (kic 8219268). using the exonest software package, which providesboth bayesian parameter estimation and bayesian model testing, we were able tore-confirm the planetary nature of kepler-91b. in addition to the primary andsecondary eclipses of kepler-91b, a third dimming event appears to occurapproximately $60^o$ away (in phase) from the secondary eclipse, leading to thehypothesis that a trojan planet may be located at the l4 or l5 lagrange points.here, we present a comprehensive investigation of four possibilities to explainthe observed dimming event using all available photometric data from the keplerspace telescope, recently obtained radial velocity measurements, and n-bodysimulations. we find that the photometric model describing kepler-91b and atrojan planet is highly favored over the model involving kepler-91b alone.however, it predicts an unphysically high temperature for the trojan companion,leading to the conclusion that the extra dimming event is likely afalse-postive.

astro-ph;0001177	observational limits on terrestrial-sized inner planets around the cm  draconis system using the photometric transit method with a matched-filter  algorithm	a lightcurve of the eclipsing binary cm draconis has been analyzed for thepresence of transits of planets of size &gt;= 2.5 earth-radii (re), with periodsof 60 days or less, and in co-planar orbits around the binary system. about 400million model lightcurves, representing transits from planets with periodsranging from 7 to 60 days, have been matched/correlated against these data.this process we call the "transit detection algorithm" or tda. the resulting`transit-statistics' for each planet candidate allow the quantification ofdetection probabilities, and of false alarm rates.  our current lightcurve of cm dra has a coverage of 1014 hours with 26,043individual points, at a photometric precision between 0.2% and 0.7%. planetssignificantly larger then 3re would constitute a `supra-noise' detection, andfor periods of 60 days or less, they would have been detected with aprobability of 90%. `subnoise' detections of smaller planets are moreconstrained. for example, 2.5 re planets with 10-day periods or less would havebeen detected with an 80% probability. the necessity for predicted observationsis illustrated with the nine top planet candidates that emerged from our tdaanalysis. they are the planet candidates with the highest transit-statisticsfrom the 1994-1998 observing seasons and, for them, transits for the 1999observing season were predicted. of the seven candidates that were thenobservationally tested in 1999, all were ruled out except one, which needsfurther observational confirmation. we conclude that the photometric transitmethod is a viable way to search for relatively small, inner extrasolar planetswith moderate-sized telescopes using ccd photometry with a matching-filteranalysis.

astro-ph;0305473	detecting reflected light from close-in extrasolar giant planets with  the kepler photometer	nasa's kepler mission promises to detect transiting earth-sized planets inthe habitable zones of solar-like stars. in addition, it will be poised todetect the reflected light component from close-in extrasolar giant planets(cegps) similar to 51 peg b. here we use the diarad/soho time series along withmodels for the reflected light signatures of cegps to evaluate kepler's abilityto detect such planets. we examine the detectability as a function of stellarbrightness, stellar rotation period, planetary orbital inclination angle, andplanetary orbital period, and then estimate the total number of cegps thatkepler will detect over its four year mission. the analysis shows thatintrinsic stellar variability of solar-like stars is a major obstacle todetecting the reflected light from cegps. monte carlo trials are used toestimate the detection threshold required to limit the total number of expectedfalse alarms to no more than one for a survey of 100,000 stellar light curves.kepler will likely detect 100-760 51 peg b-like planets by reflected light withorbital periods up to 7 days.
