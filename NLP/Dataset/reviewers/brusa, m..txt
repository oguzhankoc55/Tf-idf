0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0902.2930	the vla survey of the chandra deep field south iii: x-ray spectral  properties of radio sources	we discuss the x-ray properties of the radio sources detected in a deep 1.4and 5 ghz vla radio survey of the extended chandra deep field south (e-cdfs).among the 266 radio sources detected, we find 89 sources (1/3 of the total)with x-ray counterparts in the catalog of the 1ms exposure of the central 0.08deg^2 (giacconi et al. 2002; alexander et al. 2003) or in the catalog of the250 ks exposure of the 0.3 deg^2 e-cdfs field (lehmer et al. 2005). for 76(85%) of these sources we have spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, andtherefore we are able to derive their intrinsic properties from x-ray spectralanalysis, namely intrinsic absorption and total x-ray luminosities. we findthat the population of submillijansky radio sources with x-ray counterparts iscomposed of a mix of roughly 1/3 star forming galaxies and 2/3 agn. thedistribution of intrinsic absorption among x-ray detected radio sources isdifferent from that of the x-ray selected sample. namely, the fraction of lowabsorption sources is at least two times larger than that of x-ray selectedsources in the cdfs. this is mostly due to the larger fraction of star forminggalaxies present among the x-ray detected radio sources. if we investigate thedistribution of intrinsic absorption among sources with l_x&gt;10^42 erg s^-1 inthe hard 2-10 kev band (therefore in the agn luminosity regime), we findagreement between the x-ray population with and without radio emission. ingeneral, radio detected x-ray agn are not more heavily obscured than the nonradio detected agn. this argues against the use of radio surveys as anefficient way to search for the missing population of strongly absorbed agn.

0902.4236	the hellas2xmm survey. xii. the infrared/sub-millimeter view of an x-ray  selected type 2 quasar at z=2	we present multi-wavelength observations (from optical to sub-millimeter,including spitzer and scuba) of h2xmmj 003357.2-120038 (also gd158_19), anx-ray selected, luminous narrow-line (type 2) quasar at z=1.957 selected fromthe hellas2xmm survey. its broad-band properties can be reasonably well modeledassuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical andnear-ir emission, an agn component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting activenucleus), dominant in the mid-ir, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along theline of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) oftau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140degrees, and a far-ir starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation)to reproduce the wide bump observed longward of 70 micron. the derivedstar-formation rate is about 1500 solar masses per year. the overall modelingindicates that gd158_19 is a high-redshift x-ray luminous, obscured quasar withcoeval powerful agn activity and intense star formation. it is probably caughtbefore the process of expelling the obscuring gas has started, thus quenchingthe star formation.

0905.2193	on the nature of red galaxies: the chandra perspective	we present the x-ray properties of the extremely red objects (ero) populationobserved by chandra with three partially overlapping pointings (up to ~90 ks)over an area of ~500 arcmin^2, down to a 0.5-8 kev flux limit of ~10-15 ergcm-2 s-1. we selected eros using a multi-band photometric catalog down to aks-band magnitude of ~19.3 (vega system); 14 eros were detected in x-rays,corresponding to ~9% of the overall x-ray source population (149 x-ray sources)and to ~5% of the ero population (288). the x-ray emission of all x-raydetected eros is consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus (agn)(&gt;=3.5x10^{42} erg s-1 at photometric redshifts z &gt; 1), in agreement withprevious x-ray observations, with an indication of increasing absorptionbetween the three x-ray brightest eros and the 11 x-ray faintest eros.we takeadvantage of the good spatial resolution and limited background provided bychandra to place constraints on the population of the x-ray undetected eros bya stacking analysis. their stacked emission, whose statistical significance is5.7sigma in the observed 0.5-8 kev band, provides an upper limit to the averageintrinsic absorption at z=1 of 2.5x10^{22} cm^{-2} and corresponds to arest-frame 0.5-8 kev luminosity of 8.9x10^{41} erg s^{-1} . we estimate thatany accretion-related x-ray emission to the stacked signal is likely "diluted"by emission due to hot gas in normal galaxies and star-formation activity indust-enshrouded galaxies at high redshift.

0910.1007	black hole growth and starburst activity at z = 0.6-4 in the chandra  deep field south. host galaxies properties of obscured agn	the co-evolution of host galaxies and the active black holes which reside intheir centre is one of the most important topics in modern observationalcosmology. here we present a study of the properties of obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn) detected in the cdfs 1ms observation and their hostgalaxies. we limited the analysis to the music area, for which deep k-bandobservations obtained with isaac@vlt are available, ensuring accurateidentifications of the counterparts of the x-ray sources as well as reliabledetermination of photometric redshifts and galaxy parameters, such as stellarmasses and star formation rates. in particular, we: 1) refined thex-ray/infrared/optical association of 179 sources in the music area detected inthe chandra observation; 2) studied the host galaxies observed and rest framecolors and properties. we found that x-ray selected (l_x&gt;10^{42} erg s^{-1})agn show spitzer colors consistent with both agn and starburst dominatedinfrared continuum; the latter would not have been selected as agn frominfrared diagnostics. the host galaxies of x-ray selected obscured agn are allmassive (m_*&gt;10^{10} m_sun) and, in 50% of the cases, are also actively formingstars (1/ssfr&lt;t_{hubble}) in dusty environments. the median l/ledd value of theactive nucleus is between 2% and 10% depending on the assumed m_{bh}/m_{*}ratio. finally, we found that the x-ray selected agn fraction increases withthe stellar mass up to a value of ~30% at z&gt;1 and m_*&gt;3x10^{11} m_sun, afraction significantly higher than in the local universe for agn of similarluminosities.

0910.2617	the chandra survey of the cosmos field ii: source detection and  photometry	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra program,that covers the central contiguous ~0.92 deg^2 of the cosmos field. c-cosmos isthe result of a complex tiling, with every position being observed in up to sixoverlapping pointings (four overlapping pointings in most of the central ~0.45deg^2 area with the best exposure, and two overlapping pointings in most of thesurrounding area, covering an additional ~0.47 deg^2). therefore, the fullexploitation of the c-cosmos data requires a dedicated and accurate analysisfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the psfchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1arcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)obtaining the best source localization and count rate. we present here ourtreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,photometry, and survey sensitivity. our final procedure consists of a two stepprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) amaximum likelihood point spread function fitting algorithm to evaluate thesource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is afluctuation of the background. we discuss the main characteristics of thisprocedure, that was the result of detailed comparisons between differentdetection algorithms and photometry tools, calibrated with extensive anddedicated simulations.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0707.2465	the xmm-newton view of iras 09104+4109: evidence for a changing-look  type 2 quasar?	we analyzed the spectroscopic data from the pn and the mos cameras in the0.4-10 kev band. we also used an archival bepposax 1-50 kev observation of iras09104+4109 to investigate possible variations of the quasar emission. the x-rayemission in the epic band is dominated by the intra-cluster medium thermalemission. we found that the quasar contributes ~35% of the total flux in the2-10 kev band. both a transmission- (through a compton-thin absorber with acompton optical depth of \tau_c~0.3, i.e. nh~5 x 10^{23} cm^-2) and areflection-dominated (\tau_c&gt;1) model provide an excellent fit to the quasarcontinuum emission. however, the value measured for the ew of fe kalphaemission line is only marginally consistent with the presence of acompton-thick absorber in a reflection-dominated scenario, which had beensuggested by a previous, marginal (i.e. 2.5\sigma) detection with the hardx-ray (15-50 kev), non-imaging bepposax/pds instrument. moreover, the value ofluminosity in the 2-10 kev band measured by the transmission-dominated model isfully consistent with that expected on the basis of the bolometric luminosityof iras 09104+4109. from the analysis of the xmm-newton data we thereforesuggest the possibility that the absorber along the line of sight to thenucleus of iras 09104+4109 is compton-thin. alternatively, the absorber columndensity could have changed from compton-thick to -thin in the five yearselapsed between the observations. if this is the case, then iras 09104+4109 isthe first 'changing-look' quasar ever detected.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

1001.1354	the vla-cosmos perspective on the ir-radio relation. i. new constraints  on selection biases and the non-evolution of the ir/radio properties of star  forming and agn galaxies at intermediate and high redshift	vla 1.4 ghz (rms noise ~0.012 mjy) and mips 24 and 70 micron (rms noise ~0.02and ~1.7 mjy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree cosmosfield are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study theevolution of the ir-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. with~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the currentsample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.both monochromatic ir/radio flux ratios (q24 &amp; q70), as well as the ratio ofthe total ir and the 1.4 ghz luminosity (qtir) are used as indicators for their/radio properties of star forming galaxies and agn.  using a sample jointly selected at ir and radio wavelengths in order toreduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that their-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. moreover, based ondata from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holdsat 2.5&lt;z&lt;5. at redshift z&lt;1.4 we observe that radio-quiet agn populate thelocus of the ir-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. inour analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure astatistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. wedetermine the observed shift in average ir/radio properties of ir- and radio-selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepantmeasurements presented in the literature. finally, we also investigatevariations of the ir/radio ratio with ir and radio luminosity and find that ithardly varies with ir luminosity but is a decreasing function of radioluminosity.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1003.5563	the hellas2xmm survey. xiii. multi-component analysis of the spectral  energy distribution of obscured agn	we combine near-to-mid-ir spitzer data with shorter wavelength observations(optical to x-rays) to get insights on the properties of a sample of luminous,obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). we aim at modeling their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds) in order to estimate the main parametersrelated to the dusty torus. the sample comprises 16 obscured high-redshift(0.9&lt;z&lt;2.1) xray luminous quasars (l_2-10 ~ 10^44 erg s-1) selected from thehellas2xmm survey. the seds are described by a multi-component model includinga stellar component, an agn component and a starburst. the majority (~80%) ofthe sources show moderate optical depth (tau_9.7um&lt;3) and the derived columndensities n_h are consistent with the xray inferred values (10^22 &lt;n_h&lt; 3x10^23cm-2) for most of the objects, confirming that the sources are moderatelyobscured compton-thin agn. accretion luminosities in the range 5x10^44 &lt; lbol &lt;4x10^46 erg s-1 are inferred. we compare model luminosities with those obtainedby integrating the observed sed, finding that the latter are lower by a factorof ~2 in the median. the discrepancy can be as high as an order of magnitudefor models with high optical depth (tau_9.7um=10). the ratio between theluminosities obtained by the fitting procedure and from the observed sedsuggest that, at least for type~2 agn, observed bolometric luminosities arelikely to underestimate intrinsic ones and the effect is more severe for highlyobscured sources. bolometric corrections from the hard x-ray band are computedand have a median value of k_2-10kev ~ 20. the obscured agn in our sample arecharacterized by relatively low eddington ratios (median lambda_edd~0.08). onaverage, they are consistent with the eddington ratio increasing at increasingbolometric correction (e.g. vasudevan &amp; fabiam 2009).

1005.0289	properties of the integrated spectrum of serendipitous 2xmm catalogue  sources	our analysis is aimed at characterizing the properties of the integratedspectrum of active galactic nuclei (agns) such as the ubiquity of the fek{\alpha} emission in agns and the dependence of the spectral parameters on thex-ray luminosity and redshift. we selected 2646 point sources from the 2xmmcatalogue at high galactic latitude (|bii| &gt; 25 degrees) and with the sum ofepic-pn and epic-mos 0.2-12 kev counts greater than 1000. redshifts wereobtained for 916 sources from the ned. the final sample consists of 507 agn.individual source spectra have been summed in the observed frame to compute theintegrated spectra in different redshift and luminosity bins over the range0&lt;z&lt;5. detailed analysis of these spectra has been performed. we find that thenarrow fe k{\alpha} line at 6.4 kev is significantly detected up to z=1. theline equivalent width decreases with increasing x-ray luminosity in the 2-10kev band (''it effect''). the anti-correlation is characterized by the relationlog(ewfe) = (1.66 +/- 0.09) + (-0.43 +/- 0.07) log(lx,44), where ewfe is therest frame equivalent width of the neutral iron k{\alpha} line in ev and lx,44is the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity in units of 10^{44} erg s^{-1}. the equivalentwidth is nearly independent of redshift up to z ~ 0.8 with an average value of101+/-40 (rms dispersion) ev in the luminosity range 43.5&lt;= loglx &lt;= 44.5. ouranalysis also confirmed the hardening of the spectral indices at lowluminosities implying a dependence of obscuration on luminosity. we confirmthat the neutral narrow fe k{\alpha} line is an almost ubiquitous feature ofagns. we find compelling evidence for the ''it effect'' over a redshiftinterval larger than probed in any previous study. we detect no evolution ofthe average rest frame equivalent width of the fe k{\alpha} line with redshift.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1009.1923	the extended chandra deep field-south survey: optical spectroscopy of  faint x-ray sources with the vlt and keck	we present the results of a program to acquire high-quality optical spectraof x-ray sources detected in the e-cdf-s and its central area. newspectroscopic redshifts are measured for 283 counterparts to chandra sourceswith deep exposures (t~2-9 hr per pointing) using multi-slit facilities on boththe vlt and keck thus bringing the total number of spectroscopically-identifiedx-ray sources to over 500 in this survey field. we provide a comprehensivecatalog of x-ray sources detected in the e-cdf-s including the optical andnear-infrared counterparts, and redshifts (both spectroscopic and photometric)that incorporate published spectroscopic catalogs thus resulting in a finalsample with a high fraction (80%) of x-ray sources having secureidentifications. we demonstrate the remarkable coverage of the lx-z plane nowaccessible from our data while emphasizing the detection of agns thatcontribute to the faint end of the luminosity function at 1.5&lt;z&lt;3. our redshiftcatalog includes 17 type 2 qsos that significantly increases such samples (2x).with our deepest vimos observation, we identify "elusive" optically-faintgalaxies (r~25) at z~2-3 based upon the detection of interstellar absorptionlines; we highlight one such case, an absorption-line galaxy at z=3.208 havingno obvious signs of an agn in its optical spectrum. in addition, we determinedistances to eight galaxy groups with extended x-ray emission. finally, wemeasure the physical extent of known large-scale structures (z~0.7) evident inthe cdf-s. while a thick sheet (radial size of 67.7 mpc) at z~0.67 extends overthe full field, the z~0.73 structure is thin (18.8 mpc) and filamentary astraced by both agns and galaxy groups. in the appendix, we providespectroscopic redshifts for 49 counterparts to fainter x-ray sources detectedonly in the 1 and 2 ms catalogs, and 48 vla radio sources not detected inx-rays.

0704.2293	x-ray source counts in the cosmos field	we present the analysis of the source counts in the xmm-cosmos survey usingdata of the first year of xmm-newton observations. the survey covers ~2 deg^2within the region of sky bounded by 9^h57.5^m&lt;r.a.&lt;10^h03.5^m;1^d27.5^m&lt;dec&lt;2^d57.5^m with a total net integration time of 504 ks. using amaximum likelihood algorithm we detected a total of 1390 sources at least inone band. using monte carlo simulations to estimate the sky coverage weproduced the logn-logs relations. these relations have been then derived in the0.5--2 kev, 2--10 kev and 5--10 kev energy bands, down to flux limits of7.2x10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1, 4.0x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 and 9.7x10^-15 erg cm^-2s^-1, respectively. these relations have been compared to previous x-ray surveyand to the most recent x-ray background model finding an excellent agreement.the slightly different normalizations observed in the source counts of cosmosand previous surveys can be largely explained as a combination of low countingstatistics and cosmic variance introduced by the large scale structure.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1104.1094	the effect of environment on star forming galaxies at redshift 1 - first  insight from pacs	we use deep 70, 100 and 160 um observations taken with pacs, thephotodetector array camera and spectrometer on board of herschel, as part ofthe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed time, to study the relationbetween star formation rate and environment at redshift ~ 1 in the goods-s andgoods-n fields. we use the sdss spectroscopic catalog to build the local analogand study the evolution of the star formation activity dependence on theenvironment. at z ~ 1 we observe a reversal of the relation between starformation rate and local density, confirming the results based on spitzer 24 umdata. however, due to the high accuracy provided by pacs in measuring the starformation rate also for agn hosts, we identify in this class of objects thecause for the reversal of the density-sfr relation. indeed, agn hosts favorhigh stellar masses, dense regions and high star formation rates. without theagn contribution the relation flattens consistently with respect to the localanalog in the same range of star formation rates. as in the local universe, thespecific star formation rate anti-correlates with the density. this is due tomass segregation both at high and low redshift. the contribution of agn hostsdoes not affect this anti-correlation, since agn hosts exhibit the samespecific star formation rate as star forming galaxies at the same mass. thesame global trends and agn contribution is observed once the relations arestudied per morphological type. we study the specific star formation rate vsstellar mass relation in three density regimes. our data provides an indicationthat at m/m_{\odot} &gt; 10^{11} the mean specific star formation rate tends to behigher at higher density, while the opposite trend is observed in the localsdss star forming sample.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

0710.1811	the hellas2xmm survey: xi. unveiling the nature of x-ray bright  optically normal galaxies	x-ray bright optically normal galaxies (xbongs) constitute a small but notnegligible fraction of hard x-ray selected sources in recent chandra andxmm-newton surveys. even though several possibilities were proposed to explainwhy a relatively luminous hard x-ray source does not leave any significantsignature of its presence in terms of optical emission lines, the nature ofxbongs is still subject of debate. we aim to a better understanding of theirnature by means of a multiwavelength and morphological analysis of a smallsample of these sources. good-quality photometric near-infrared data(isaac/vlt) of four low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) xbongs, selected from thehellas2xmm survey, have been used to search for the presence of the putativenucleus, applying the surface-brightness decomposition technique through theleast-squares fitting program galfit. the surface brightness decompositionallows us to reveal a nuclear point-like source, likely to be responsible ofthe x-ray emission, in two out of the four sources. the results indicate thatmoderate amounts of gas and dust, covering a large solid angle (possibly 4pi)at the nuclear source, combined with the low nuclear activity, may explain thelack of optical emission lines. the third xbong is associated with an x-rayextended source and no nuclear excess is detected in the near infrared at thelimits of our observations. the last source is associated to a close (d&lt; 1arcsec) double system and the fitting procedure cannot achieve a firmconclusion.

1110.3591	rest-frame stacking of 2xmm catalog sources : properties of the fe  kalpha line	the aim of this work is to characterize the average fe k emission propertiesof active galactic nuclei (agns) in the source rest-frame. we selected a sampleof 248 agns from the 2xmm catalog, covering a wide redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 5 andwith the epic-pn net 2-10 kev rest-frame counts &gt;=200 and power law photonindices in the range 1.5-2.2. we employed two fully independent rest-framestacking procedures to compute the mean fe k profile. the counting statisticsfor the integrated spectrum is comparable to the one available for the beststudied local seyferts. to identify the artifacts possibly introduced by thestacking procedure, we have carried out simulations. we report that the averagefe k line profile in our sample is best represented by a combination of anarrow and a broad line. the equivalent widths of the narrow and broad(parametrized with a diskline) components are ~30 ev and ~100 ev, respectively.we also discuss the results of more complex fits and the implications of theadopted continuum modeling on the broad line parameters and its detectionsignificance.

1111.2447	fe k emission from active galaxies in the cosmos field	we present a rest-frame spectral stacking analysis of ~1000 x-ray sourcesdetected in the xmm-cosmos field in order to investigate the iron k lineproperties of active galaxies beyond redshift z~1. in type i agn that have atypical x-ray luminosity of lx~1.5e44 erg/s and z~1.6, the cold fe k at 6.4 kevis weak (ew~0.05kev), in agreement with the known trend. in contrast,high-ionization lines of fe xxv and fe xxvi are pronounced. thesehigh-ionization fe k lines appear to have a connection with high accretionrates. while no broad fe emission is detected in the total spectrum, it mightbe present, albeit at low significance, when the x-ray luminosity is restrictedto the range below 3e44 erg/s, or when an intermediate range of eddington ratioaround 0.1 is selected. in type ii agn, both cold and high-ionzation linesbecome weak with increasing x-ray luminosity. however, strong high-ionizationfe k (ew~0.3 kev) is detected in the spectrum of objects at z&gt;2, while no 6.4kev line is found. it is then found that the primary source of thehigh-ionization fe k emission is those objects detected with spitzer-mips at 24micron. given their median redshift of z=2.5, their bolometric luminosity islikely to reach 10^13 lsun and the mips-detected emission most likelyoriginates from hot dust heated by embedded agn, probably accreting at higheddington ratio. these properties match those of rapidly growing black holes inultra-luminous infrared galaxies at the interesting epoch (z=2-3) of galaxyformation.

1201.3899	identifying luminous agn in deep surveys: revised irac selection  criteria	spitzer irac selection is a powerful tool for identifying luminous agn. fordeep irac data, however, the agn selection wedges currently in use are heavilycontaminated by star-forming galaxies, especially at high redshift. using thelarge samples of luminous agn and high-redshift star-forming galaxies incosmos, we redefine the agn selection criteria for use in deep irac surveys.the new irac criteria are designed to be both highly complete and reliable, andincorporate the best aspects of the current agn selection wedges and ofinfrared power-law selection while excluding high redshift star-forminggalaxies selected via the bzk, drg, lbg, and smg criteria. at qso-luminositiesof log l(2-10 kev) (ergs/s) &gt; 44, the new irac criteria recover 75% of the hardx-ray and irac-detected xmm-cosmos sample, yet only 38% of the irac agncandidates have x-ray counterparts, a fraction that rises to 52% in regionswith chandra exposures of 50-160 ks. x-ray stacking of the individually x-raynon-detected agn candidates leads to a hard x-ray signal indicative of heavilyobscured to mildly compton-thick obscuration (log n_h (cm^-2) = 23.5 +/- 0.4).while irac selection recovers a substantial fraction of luminous unobscured andobscured agn, it is incomplete to low-luminosity and host-dominated agn.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.1977	the 4 ms chandra deep field-south number counts apportioned by source  class: pervasive active galactic nuclei and the ascent of normal galaxies	we present 0.5-2 kev, 2-8 kev, 4-8 kev, and 0.5-8 kev cumulative anddifferential number counts (logn-logs) measurements for the recently completed~4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) survey, the deepest x-ray survey todate. we implement a new bayesian approach, which allows reliable calculationof number counts down to flux limits that are factors of ~1.9-4.3 times fainterthan the previously deepest number-counts investigations. in the soft band, themost sensitive bandpass in our analysis, the ~4 ms cdf-s reaches a maximumsource density of ~27,800 deg-2. by virtue of the exquisite x-ray andmultiwavelength data available in the cdf-s, we are able to measure the numbercounts from a variety of source populations (active galactic nuclei [agns],normal galaxies, and galactic stars) and subpopulations (as a function ofredshift, agn absorption, luminosity, and galaxy morphology), and test modelsthat describe their evolution. we find that agns still dominate the x-raynumber counts down to the faintest flux levels for all bands and reach alimiting soft-band source density of ~14,900 deg-2, the highest reliable agnsource density measured at any wavelength. we find that the normal-galaxycounts rise rapidly near the flux limits, and at the limiting soft-band flux,reach source densities of ~12,700 deg-2 and make up 46+/-5% of the total numbercounts. the rapid rise of the galaxy counts toward faint fluxes, andsignificant normal-galaxy contributions to the overall number counts, indicatethat normal galaxies will overtake agns just below the ~4 ms soft-band fluxlimit and will provide a numerically significant new x-ray source population infuture surveys that reach below the ~4 ms sensitivity limit. we show that afuture ~10 ms cdf-s would allow for a significant increase in x-ray detectedsources, with many of the new sources being cosmologically distant (z &gt; 0.6)normal galaxies.

(2010).two scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of cid-42: a gwrecoiling smbh and a double type 1/ type 2 agn system, where one of the two isrecoiling because of slingshot effect. in both scenario, one of the opticalnuclei hosts an unobscured agn, while the other one, either an obscured agn ora star forming compact region. the x-ray chandra data allow to unambiguouslyresolve the x-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sourcesin cid-42. we find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for thewhole x-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the fluxof the second optical nucleus is measured. the upper limit on the x-rayluminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energydistribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second sourcerather than an obscured smbh, thus favoring the gw recoil scenario. however thepresence of a very obscured smbh cannot be fully ruled-out. a new x-rayfeature, in a sw direction with respect to the main source, is discovered anddiscussed.

1206.2642	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei in the xmm-cosmos survey	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of both x-ray selectedbroad-line (type-1) and narrow-line (type-2) agn from the xmm-newton survey inthe cosmos field are presented. the sample is composed by 929 agn (382 type-1agn and 547 type-2 agn) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, x-rayluminosities and absorbing column densities. about 65% of the sources arespectroscopically identified as either type-1 or type-2 agn (83% and 52%respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the restof the sample. the study of such a large sample of x-ray selected agn with ahigh quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with theinclusion of herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron) to the optical-uvallows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections and eddington ratios. the kbol-lbol relations derived in thepresent work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable agn sample,and rely on observed redshifts, x-ray luminosities and column densitydistributions. we find that kbol is significantly lower at high lbol withrespect to previous estimates by marconi et al. (2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1209.1478	spectral energy distributions of type 1 agn in the cosmos survey i - the  xmm-cosmos sample	the "cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) enables the study of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of active galactic nuclei (agn) because of the deepcoverage and rich sampling of frequencies from x-ray to radio. here we presenta sed catalog of 413 x-ray (\xmm) selected type 1 (emission line fwhm$&gt;2000$ kms$^{-1}$) agn with magellan, sdss or vlt spectrum. the seds are corrected forthe galactic extinction, for broad emission line contributions, constrainedvariability, and for host galaxy contribution. we present the mean sed and thedispersion seds after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 ghz to 40kev, and show examples of the variety of seds encountered. in the near-infraredto optical (rest frame $\sim 8\mu m$-- 4000\aa), the photometry is complete forthe whole sample and the mean sed is derived from detections only. reddeningand host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of theobserved sed variety. the seds are all available on-line.

1209.1640	accreting smbhs in the cosmos field and the connection to their host  galaxies	using the wide multi-band photometry available in the cosmos field we explorethe host galaxy properties of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (agn)obtained by combining x-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. based on acareful study of their spectral energy distribution (sed), which has beenparametrized using a 2-component (agn+galaxy) model fit, we deriveddust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formationrates (sfrs). we find that agn hosts span a large range of stellar masses andsfrs. no color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the agn hosts, which arefound to be mainly massive, red galaxies. once accounting for the color-massdegeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginalenhancement of agn incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific starformation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of ourability to properly account for agn light contamination and dust extinction.interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black holegrowing at any given "specific accretion rate" (i.e. the ratio of x-rayluminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxymass, while it decreases as a power-law with lx/m. by analyzing thenormalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence ofagn increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance withthe overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxypopulation. although agn activity and star formation in galaxies do appear tohave a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within thecosmos sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signalingpowerful agn influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.

1305.1881	agn in dusty hosts: implications for galaxy evolution	we present strong empirical evidence for a physical connection between theoccurrence of a starburst (sb) and a luminous agn phase. drawing infrared (ir),x-ray, and optically selected samples from cosmos, we find that the locus oftype-2 agn hosts in the optical colour-magnitude (u-v/v) and colour-colour(u-v/v-j) space significantly overlaps with that of ir-luminous (l_ir &gt; 10^10l_sun) galaxies. based on our observations, we propose that, whensimultaneously building their black hole and stellar masses, type-2 agn hostsare located in the same part of colour-colour space as dusty star-forminggalaxies. in fact, our results show that ir-luminous galaxies at z&lt;1.5 are onaverage 3 times more likely to host a type-2 agn (l_x &gt; 10^42 erg/s) than wouldbe expected serendipitously, if agn and star-formation events were unrelated.in addition, the optical and infrared properties of the agn/sb hybrid systemstentatively suggest that the agn phase might be coeval with a particularlyactive phase in a galaxy's star-formation history. interestingly, we also finda significant fraction of type-2 agn hosts offset from the dusty galaxysequence in colour-colour space, possibly representing a transitional orpost-starburst phase in galaxy evolution. our findings are consistent with ascenario whereby agn play a role in the termination of star-formation inmassive galaxies.

1305.3917	a statistical relation between the x-ray spectral index and eddington  ratio of active galactic nuclei in deep surveys	we present an investigation into how well the properties of the accretionflow onto a supermassive black hole may be coupled to those of the overlyinghot corona. to do so, we specifically measure the characteristic spectralindex, gamma, of a power-law energy distribution, over an energy range of 2 to10 kev, for x-ray selected, broad-lined radio-quiet agn up to z~2 in cosmos ande-cdf-s. we test the previously reported dependence between gamma and blackhole mass, fwhm and eddington ratio using a sample of agn covering a broadrange in these parameters based on both the mg ii and h-alpha emission lineswith the later afforded by recent near infrared spectroscopic observationsusing subaru/fmos. we calculate the eddington ratios, lambda_edd, for sourceswhere a bolometric luminosity (l_bol) has been presented in the literature,based on sed fitting, or, for sources where these data do not exist, wecalculate l_bol using a bolometric correction to the lx, derived from arelationship between the bolometric correction, and lx/l3000. from a sample of69 x-ray bright sources (&gt;250 counts), where gamma can be measured withgreatest precision, with an estimate of l_bol, we find a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and lambda_edd, which is highlysignificant with a chance probability of 6.59x10^-8. a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and the fwhm of the optical lines isconfirmed, but at lower significance than with lambda_edd indicating thatlambda_edd is the key parameter driving conditions in the corona. linearregression analysis reveals that gamma=(0.32+/-0.05)log10lambda_edd+(2.27+/-0.06) andgamma=(-0.69+/-0.11)log10(fwhm/km/s)+(4.44+/-0.42). our results ongamma-lambda_edd are in very good agreement with previous results.

0801.1184	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2. ii. superdense  passive galaxies: how did they form and evolve ?	we combine ultradeep optical spectroscopy from the gmass project ("galaxymass assembly ultradeep spectroscopic survey") with goods multi-band photometryand hst imaging to study a sample of passive galaxiesat 1.39&lt;z&lt;1.99 selected at4.5 microns. a stacked spectrum with an equivalent integration time of ~500hours was obtained is publicly released. the spectral and photometric sedproperties indicate very weak or absent star formation, moderately old stellarages of ~1 gyr (for solar metallicity) and stellar masses in the range of10^{10-11} solar masses, thus implying that the major star formation andassembly processes for these galaxies occurred at z&gt;2. these galaxies havemorphologies that are predominantly compact and spheroidal.however, their sizes(r_e &lt;~ 1 kpc) are much smaller than those of spheroids in the present--dayuniverse. their stellar mass surface densities are consequently higher by ~1dex if compared to spheroids at z~0 with the same mass. their rest-frame b-bandsurface brightness scales with the effective radius, but the offset withrespect to the surface brightness of the local kormendy relation is too largeto be explained by simple passive evolution. at z~1, a larger fraction ofpassive galaxies follows the z~0 size -- mass relation. superdense relics withr_e~1 kpc are extremely rare at z~0 with respect to z&gt;1, and absent if r_e&lt;1kpc. because of the similar sizes and mass densities, we suggest that thesuperdense passive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 are the remnants of the powerfulstarbursts occurring in submillimeter--selected galaxies at z&gt;2. the resultsare compared with theoretical models and the main implications discussed in theframework of massive galaxy formation and evolution.

1310.1399	the xmm-newton spectrum of a candidate recoiling supermassive black  hole: an elusive inverted p-cygni profile	we present a detailed spectral analysis of new xmm-newton data of the sourcecxoc j100043.1+020637, also known as cid-42, detected in the cosmos survey at z= 0.359. previous works suggested that cid-42 is a candidate recoilingsupermassive black holes showing also an inverted p-cygni profile in the x- rayspectra at ~6 kev (rest) with an iron emission line plus a redshiftedabsorption line (detected at 3sigma in previous xmm-newton and chandraobservations). detailed analysis of the absorption line suggested the presenceof ionized material inflowing into the black hole at high velocity. in the newlong xmm-newton observation, while the overall spectral shape remains constant,the continuum 2-10 kev flux decreased of ~20% with respect to previousobservation and the absorption line is undetected. the upper limit on theintensity of the absorption line is ew&lt;162 kev. extensive monte carlosimulations show that the non detection of the line is solely due to variationin the properties of the inflowing material, in agreement with the transientnature of these features, and that the intensity of the line is lower than thepreviously measured with a probability of 98.8%. in the scenario of cid-42 asrecoiling smbh, the absorption line can be interpreted as due to inflow of gaswith variable density and located in the proximity of the smbh and recoilingwith it. new monitoring observations will be requested to further characterizethis line.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

1311.1305	the incidence of obscuration in active galactic nuclei	we study the incidence of nuclear obscuration on a complete sample of 1310agn selected on the basis of their rest-frame 2-10 kev x-ray flux from thexmm-cosmos survey, in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5. we classify the agn asobscured or un-obscured on the basis of either the optical spectral propertiesand the overall sed or the shape of the x-ray spectrum. the two classificationsagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be furthersubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities x-ray un-obscured agndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/uv continuum emission in theiroptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at highluminosities broad line agn may have absorbed x-ray spectra, which hints at anincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. weconfirm that the fraction of obscured agn is a decreasing function of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significantevolution only for the most luminous agn, which appear to be more commonlyobscured at higher redshift. we find no significant difference between the meanstellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured agn hosts.we conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscurationin agn is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclearluminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere ofinfluence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the widerscale galactic conditions.

1311.4401	agn feedback at z~2 and the mutual evolution of active and inactive  galaxies	the relationships between galaxies of intermediate stellar mass and moderateluminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) at 1&lt;z&lt;3 are investigated with thegalaxy mass assembly ultra-deep spectroscopic survey (gmass) samplecomplemented with public data in the goods-south field. using x-ray data,hidden agns are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with noapparent signs of non-stellar activity. in the color-mass plane, two paralleltrends emerge during the ~2 gyr between the average redshifts z~2.2 and z~1.3:while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated by ellipticals, themajority of agns with l(2-10 kev)&gt;10^42.3 erg s^-1 disappear from the bluecloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systemswith disk and irregular morphologies. these results are even clearer when therest-frame colors are corrected for dust reddening. at z~2.2, the ultravioletspectra of active galaxies (including two type 1 agns) show possible gasoutflows with velocities up to about -500 km s^-1 that are not observed neitherin inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. such outflowsindicate the presence of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities ofactive galaxies. these results suggest that feedback from moderately luminousagns (logl_x&lt;44.5 erg s^-1) played a key role at z&gt;~2 by contributing tooutflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to arapid decrease in the star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses10&lt;logm&lt;11 m_sun.

1312.1248	alma reveals a warm and compact starburst around a heavily obscured  supermassive black hole at z=4.75	we report alma cycle 0 observations at 1.3mm of less j033229.4-275619(xid403), an ultraluminous infrared galaxy at $z=4.75$ in the chandra deepfield south hosting a compton-thick qso. the source is not resolved in our dataat a resolution of $\sim$0.75 arcsec, placing an upper-limit of 2.5 kpc to thehalf-light radius of the continuum emission from heated-dust. afterdeconvolving for the beam size, however, we found a $\sim3\sigma$ indication ofan intrinsic source size of $0.27\pm0.08$ arcsec (gaussian fwhm), which wouldcorrespond to $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc. we build the far-ir sed of xid403 bycombining datapoints from both alma and herschel and fit it with a modifiedblackbody spectrum. for the first time, we measure the dust temperature$t_d=58.5\pm5.3$ k in this system, which is comparable to what has beenobserved in other high-z submillimeter galaxies. the measured star formationrate is sfr=$1020\pm150$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with previousestimates at lower s/n. based on the measured sfr and source size, we constrainthe sfr surface density to be $\sigma_{sfr}&gt;26\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$($\sim200\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for $r_{half}\sim0.9$ kpc). thecompactness of this starburst is comparable to what has been observed in otherlocal and high-z starburst galaxies. if the gas mass measured from previous[cii] and co(2-1) observations at low resolution is confined within the samedust region, assuming $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc, this would produce a columndensity of $n_h\sim0.3-1.1\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ towards the central smbh,similar to the column density of $\approx1.4\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ measuredfrom the x-rays. then, in principle, if both gas and dust were confined onsub-kpc scales, this would be sufficient to produce the observed x-ray columndensity without any need of a pc-scale absorber [abridged].

1312.2264	agn x-ray variability in the xmm-cosmos survey	we took advantage of the observations carried out by xmm in the cosmos fieldduring 3.5 years, to study the long term variability of a large sample of agn(638 sources), in a wide range of redshift (0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5) and x-ray luminosity($10^{41}&lt;$l(2-10)$&lt;10^{45.5}$). both a simple statistical method to asses thesignificance of variability, and the normalized excess variance($\sigma^{2}_{rms}$) parameter, where used to obtain a quantitative measurementof the variability. variability is found to be prevalent in most agn, wheneverwe have good statistic to measure it, and no significant differences betweentype-1 and type-2 agn were found. a flat (slope -0.23+/-0.03) anti-correlationbetween $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity is found, when significantlyvariable sources are considered all together. when divided in three redshiftbins, the anti-correlation becomes stronger and evolving with z, with higherredshift agn being more variable. we prove however that this effect is due tothe pre-selection of variable sources: considering all the sources withavailable $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ measurement, the evolution in redshift disappears.for the first time we were also able to study the long term x-ray variabilityas a function of $m_{\rm bh}$ and eddington ratio, for a large sample of agnspanning a wide range of redshift. an anti-correlation between$\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and $m_{\rm bh}$ is found, with the same slope of theanti-correlation between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity, suggestingthat the latter can be a byproduct of the former one. no clear correlation isfound between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the eddington ratio in our sample.finally, no correlation is found between the x-ray $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and theoptical variability.

0802.2941	optical selection of faint agn in the cosmos field	we outline a strategy to select faint (i&lt;24.5) type 1 agn candidates down tothe seyfert/qso boundary for spectroscopic targeting in the cosmos field,picking candidates by their nonstellar colors in broadband ground-basedphotometry and morphological properties extracted from hst-acs. agn opticalcolor selection has not been applied to such faint magnitudes in such a largecontinuous part of the sky. hot stars are known to be the dominant contaminantfor bright agn candidate selection at z&lt;2, but we anticipate the highest colorcontamination at all redshifts to be from faint starburst and compact galaxies.morphological selection via the gini coefficient separates most potential agnfrom these faint blue galaxies. recent models of the quasar luminosity functionare used to estimate quasar surface densities, and studies of stellarpopulations in the cosmos field infer stellar contamination. we use 292spectroscopically confirmed type 1 agn and quasar templates to predict agncolors with redshift, and contrast those predictions with the colors of knowncontaminating populations. the motivation of this study and subsequentspectroscopic follow-up is to populate and refine the faint end of the qlfwhere the population of type 1 agn is presently not well known. the anticipatedagn observations will add to the ~300 already known agn in the cosmos field,making cosmos a densely packed field of quasars to be used to understandsupermassive black holes and probe the structure of the intergalactic medium inthe intervening volume.

1403.0853	gas reservoir of a hyper-luminous qso at z=2.6	understanding the relationship between the formation and evolution ofgalaxies and their central super massive black holes (smbh) is one of the maintopics in extragalactic astrophysics. links and feedback may reciprocallyaffect both black hole and galaxy growth. observations of the co line atredshifts of 2-4 are crucial to investigate the gas mass, star formationactivity and accretion onto smbhs, as well as the effect of agn feedback.potential correlations between agn and host galaxy properties can behighlighted by observing extreme objects. despite their luminosity,hyper-luminous qsos at z=2-4 are still little studied at mm wavelengths. wetargeted co(3-2) in ulas j1539+0557, an hyper-luminos qso (lbol&gt; 10^48 erg/s)at z=2.658, selected through its unusual red colors in the ukidss large areasurvey (ulas). we find a molecular gas mass of 4.1+-0.8 10^10 msun, and a gasfraction of 0.4-0.1, depending mostly on the assumed source inclination. wealso find a robust lower limit to the star-formation rate (sfr=250-1600msun/yr) and star-formation efficiency (sfe=25-350 lsun/(k km s-1 pc2) bycomparing the observed optical-near-infrared spectral energy distribution withagn and galaxy templates. the black hole gas consumption timescale,m(h_2)/dm(accretion)/dt, is ~160 myr, similar or higher than the gasconsumption timescale. the gas content and the star formation efficiency aresimilar to those of other high-luminosity, highly obscured qsos, and at thelower end of the star-formation efficiency of unobscured qsos, in line withpredictions from agn-galaxy co-evolutionary scenarios. further measurements ofthe (sub)-mm continuum in this and similar sources are mandatory to obtain arobust observational picture of the agn evolutionary sequence.

0803.0997	a new method to separate star forming from agn galaxies at intermediate  redshift: the submillijansky radio population in the vla-cosmos survey	we explore the properties of the submillijansky radio population at 20 cm byapplying a newly developed optical color-based method to separate star forming(sf) from agn galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1.3). although opticalrest-frame colors are used, our separation method is shown to be efficient, andnot biased against dusty starburst galaxies. this classification method hasbeen calibrated and tested on a local radio selected optical sample. givenaccurate multi-band photometry and redshifts, it carries the potential to begenerally applicable to any galaxy sample where sf and agn galaxies are the twodominant populations.  in order to quantify the properties of the submillijansky radio population,we have analyzed ~2,400 radio sources, detected at 20 cm in the vla-cosmossurvey. 90% of these have submillijansky flux densities. we classify theobjects into 1) star candidates, 2) quasi stellar objects, 3) agn, 4) sf, and5) high redshift (z&gt;1.3) galaxies. we find, for the composition of thesubmillijansky radio population, that sf galaxies are not the dominantpopulation at submillijansky flux levels, as previously often assumed, but thatthey make up an approximately constant fraction of 30-40% in the flux densityrange of ~50 microjy to 0.7 mjy. in summary, based on the entire vla-cosmosradio population at 20 cm, we find that the radio population at these fluxdensities is a mixture of roughly 30-40% of sf and 50-60% of agn galaxies, witha minor contribution (~10%) of qsos.

1406.3961	the primordial environment of super massive black holes: large scale  galaxy overdensities around $z\sim6$ qsos with lbt	we investigated the presence of galaxy overdensities around four $z\sim6$qsos, namely sdss j1030+0524 (z = 6.28), sdss j1148+5251 (z = 6.41), sdssj1048+4637 (z = 6.20) and sdss j1411+1217 (z = 5.95), through deep $r$-, $i$-and $z$- band imaging obtained with the wide-field ($\sim23'\times25'$) largebinocular camera (lbc) at the large binocular telescope (lbt). we adoptedcolor-color selections within the $i-z$ vs $r-z$ plane to identify samples of$i$-band dropouts at the qso redshift and measure their relative abundance andspatial distribution in the four lbc fields, each covering $\sim8\times8$physical mpc at $z\sim6$. the same selection criteria were then applied to$z$-band selected sources in the $\sim$1 deg$^2$ subaru-xmm newton deep surveyto derive the expected number of dropouts over a blank lbc-sized field($\sim$0.14 deg$^2$). the four observed qso fields host a number of candidateslarger than what is expected in a blank field. by defining as $i$-band dropoutsobjects with $z_{ab}&lt;25$, $i-z&gt;1.4$ and undetected in the $r$-band, we found16, 10, 9, 12 dropouts in sdss j1030+0524, sdss j1148+5251, sdss j1048+4637,and sdss j1411+1217, respectively, whereas only 4.3 such objects are expectedover a 0.14 deg$^2$ blank field. this corresponds to overdensity significancesof 3.3, 1.9, 1.7, 2.5$\sigma$, respectively. by considering the total number ofdropouts in the four lbc fields and comparing it with what is expected in fourblank fields of 0.14 deg$^2$ each, we find that high-z qsos reside in overdenseenvironments at the $3.7\sigma$ level. this is the first direct and unambiguousmeasurement of the large scale structures around $z\sim6$ qsos.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1410.5468	galaxy-wide outflows in z$\sim$1.5 luminous obscured qsos revealed  through nir slit-resolved spectroscopy	aims. the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes (smbhs)requires that some sort of feedback mechanism is operating during the activegalactic nuclei (agn) phases. agn driven winds are the most likely candidatesfor such feedback mechanism, but direct observational evidence of theirexistence and of their effects on the host galaxies are still scarce and theirphysical origin is still hotly debated.  methods. x-shooter observations of a sample of x-ray selected, obscuredquasars at z$\sim$1.5, selected on the basis of their observed red colors andx-ray-to-optical flux ratio, have shown the presence of outflowing ionized gasidentified by broad [oiii] emission lines in 6 out of 8 objects, confirming theefficiency of the selection criteria. here we present slit-resolvedspectroscopy for the two brightest sources, xid2028 and xid5321, to study thecomplex emission and absorption line kinematics.  results. we detect outflow extended out to $\sim$ 10 kpc from the centralblack hole (bh), both as blueshifted and redshifted emission. interestingly, wealso detect kpc scale outflows in the [oii] emission lines and in the neutralgas component, traced by the sodium d and magnesium absorption lines,confirming that a substantial amount of the outflowing mass is in the form ofneutral gas.  conclusions. the measured gas velocities and the outflow kinetic powers,inferred under reasonable assumptions on the geometry and physical propertiesof these two systems, favor an agn origin for the observed winds.

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1501.04634	relationship between star formation rate and black hole accretion at  z=2: the different contributions in quiescent, normal and starburst galaxies	we investigate the co-evolution of black-hole-accretion-rate (bhar) andstar-formation-rate (sfr) in $1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ galaxies displaying a greaterdiversity of star-forming properties compared to previous studies. we combinex-ray stacking and far-ir photometry of stellar mass-limited samples of normalstar-forming, starburst and quiescent/quenched galaxies in the cosmos field. wecorroborate the existence of a strong correlation between bhar (i.e. the x-rayluminosity, l_x), and stellar mass (m*) for normal star-forming galaxies,although find a steeper relation than previously reported. we find thatstarbursts show a factor of 3 enhancement in bhar compared to normal sfgalaxies (against a factor of 6 excess in sfr), while quiescents show a deficitof a factor 5.5 at a given mass. one possible interpretation of this is thatthe starburst phase does not coincide with cosmologically relevant bh growth,or that starburst-inducing mergers are more efficient at boosting sfr thanbhar. contrary to studies based on smaller samples, we find the bhar/sfr ratioof main sequence (ms) galaxies is not mass invariant, but scales weakly asm*^(0.43\pm0.09}, implying faster bh growth in more massive galaxies at$z\sim2$. furthermore, bhar/sfr during the starburst is a factor of 2 lowerthan in ms galaxies, at odds with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulationsof merger galaxies that foresee a sudden enhancement of l_x/sfr during themerger. finally, we estimate that the bulk of the accretion density of theuniverse at $z\sim2$ is associated with normal star-forming systems, with only6(+/-1)% and 11(+/-1)% associated with starburst and quiescent galaxies,respectively.

1503.01783	evidence for feedback in action from the molecular gas content in the  z~1.6 outflowing qso xid2028	gas outflows are believed to play a pivotal role in shaping galaxies, as theyregulate both star formation and black hole growth. despite their ubiquitouspresence, the origin and the acceleration mechanism of such powerful andextended winds is not yet understood. direct observations of the cold gascomponent in objects with detected outflows at other wavelengths are needed toassess the impact of the outflow on the host galaxy interstellar medium (ism).we observed with the plateau de bure interferometer an obscured quasar atz~1.5, xid2028, for which the presence of an ionised outflow has beenunambiguously signalled by nir spectroscopy. the detection of co(3-2) emissionin this source allows us to infer the molecular gas content and compare it tothe ism mass derived from the dust emission. we then analyze the results in thecontext of recent insights on scaling relations, which describe the gas contentof the overall population of star-forming galaxies at a similar redshifts. thestar formation efficiency (~100) and gas mass (m_gas=2.1-9.5x10^{10} m_sun)inferred from the co(3-2) line depend on the underlying assumptions on theexcitation of the transition and the co-to-h2 conversion factor. however, thecombination of this information and the ism mass estimated from the dust masssuggests that the ism/gas content of xid2028 is significantly lower thanexpected for its observed m$_\star$, ssfr and redshift, based on the mostup-to-date calibrations (with gas fraction &lt;20% and depletion time scale &lt;340myr). overall, the constraints we obtain from the far infrared and millimeterdata suggest that we are observing qso feedback able to remove the gas from thehost

1505.01153	the most obscured agn in the cosmos field	highly obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) are common in nearby galaxies,but are difficult to observe beyond the local universe, where they are expectedto significantly contribute to the black hole accretion rate density.furthermore, compton-thick (ct) absorbers (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) suppress even thehard x-ray (2-10 kev) agn nuclear emission, and therefore the column densitydistribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. we present theidentification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (nh&gt;~10^25cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (l(2-10kev)&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn at z=0.353 inthe cosmos field. several independent indicators, such as the shape of thex-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution andx-ray/[nev] and x-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that thenuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. the hostgalaxy properties show that this highly obscured agn is hosted in a massivestar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlatewith the presence of ct absorbers. finally, asymmetric and blueshiftedcomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate thepresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense agn activity(l(bol)/l(edd) = 0.3-0.5). such highly obscured, highly accreting agn areintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be muchmore common at the peak of the star formation and bh accretion history, atz~2-3. we demonstrate that a fully multi-wavelength approach can recover asizable sample of such peculiar sources in large and deep surveys such ascosmos.

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

1508.04464	the magnum survey: positive feedback in the nuclear region of ngc 5643  suggested by muse	we study the ionization and kinematics of the ionized gas in the nuclearregion of the barred seyfert 2 galaxy ngc~5643 using muse integral fieldobservations in the framework of the magnum (measuring active galactic nucleiunder muse microscope) survey. the data were used to identify regions withdifferent ionization conditions and to map the gas density and the dustextinction. we find evidence for a double sided ionization cone, possiblycollimated by a dusty structure surrounding the nucleus. at the center of theionization cone, outflowing ionized gas is revealed as a blueshifted,asymmetric wing of the [oiii] emission line, up to projected velocityv(10)~-450 km/s. the outflow is also seen as a diffuse, low luminosity radioand x-ray jet, with similar extension. the outflowing material points in thedirection of two clumps characterized by prominent line emission with spectratypical of hii regions, located at the edge of the dust lane of the bar. wepropose that the star formation in the clumps is due to `positive feedback'induced by gas compression by the nuclear outflow, providing the firstcandidate for outflow induced star formation in a seyfert-like radio quiet agn.this suggests that positive feedback may be a relevant mechanism in shaping theblack hole-host galaxy coevolution.

1508.07884	sinfoni spectra of heavily obscured agns in cosmos: evidence of outflows  in a mir/o target at z$\sim2.5$	we present new data for four candidate obscured compton-thick (ct) quasars atz $\sim$1-2.5 observed with sinfoni vlt spectrograph in ao mode. these sourceswere selected from a 24$\mu$m spitzer mips survey of the cosmos field, on thebasis of red mid-infrared-to-optical and optical-to-near-infrared colours, withthe intention of identifying active galactic nuclei (agns) in dust enshroudedenvironments, where most of the black hole mass is assembled in dust enshroudedenvironments. near infrared spectra were analyzed in order to check foremission line features and to search for broad components in the[oiii]-h$\beta$ and h$\alpha$-[nii] regions. x-ray spectral analysis, radio andmir diagnostics, and sed fitting have also been employed to study the nature ofthe sources. we successfully identified three objects for which we had only aphotometric redshift estimate. based on their emission line diagnostics and onancillary multi-wavelength constraints, we find that all four targets harborobscured agns. broad profiles that could be attributed to the effects ofoutflows are revealed in only one target, miro20581. in particular, we clearlyresolved a fast ($\sim$1600 km/s) and extended ($\sim$5 kpc) outflow in the[oiii]5007 emission line. this feature, the commonly used indicator for ionisedoutflowing gas, was sampled and detected only for this target; hence, we cannot exclude the presence of outflows in the other sources. overall, theconstraints we obtain from our targets and from other comparative samples fromthe literature suggest that these optically faint luminous infrared galaxies,hosting obscured agns, may represent a brief evolutionary phase between thepost-merger starburst and the unobscured qso phases.

1509.05413	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s. ix. an x-ray outflow in a luminous  obscured quasar at z~1.6	in active galactic nuclei (agn)-galaxy co-evolution models, agn winds andoutflows are often invoked to explain why super-massive black holes andgalaxies stop growing efficiently at a certain phase of their lives. they arecommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. evidence ofultra-fast (v&gt;0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of agn has beencollected in the past decade by sensitive x-ray observations for sizablesamples of agn, mostly at low redshift. here we present ultra-deep xmm-newtonand chandra spectral data of an obscured (nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsicallyluminous (l2-10kev~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named pid352) at z~1.6 (derivedfrom the x-ray spectral analysis) in the chandra deep field-south. the sourceis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observedenergies of e~2-3 kev. while the emission line is interpreted as being due toneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorptionfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (fexxv, fexxvi) with anoutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionizationmodels. the mass outflow rate - ~2 msun/yr - is similar to the source accretionrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. pid352 represents oneof the few cases where indications of x-ray outflowing gas have been observedat high redshift thus far. this wind is powerful enough to provide feedback onthe host galaxy.

0705.2864	unveiling obscured accretion in the chandra deep field south	a large population of heavily obscured, compton thick agns is predicted bymodels of galaxy formation, models of cosmic x-ray background and by the``relic'' super-massive black-hole mass function measured from local bulges.however, so far only a handful of compton thick agns have been possiblydetected using even the deepest chandra and xmm surveys. compton-thick agns canbe recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the agn uv emission in the infraredby selecting sources with agn luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faintnear-infrared and optical emission. to this purpose, we make use of deep hst,vlt, spitzer and chandra data on the chandra deep field south to constrain thenumber of compton thick agn in this field. we show that sources with high24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct sourcepopulation, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by agn emission.analysis of the x-ray properties of these extreme sources shows that most ofthem (80$\pm15%$) are indeed likely to be highly obscured, compton thick agns.the number of infrared selected, compton thick agns with 5.8$\mu$m luminosityhigher than $10^{44.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ turns out to be similar to that of x-rayselected, unobscured and moderately obscured agns with 2-10 kev luminosityhigher than $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the redshift bin 1.2-2.6. this ``factorof 2'' source population is exactly what it is needed to solve thediscrepancies between model predictions and x-ray agn selection.

astro-ph;0503102	passively evolving early-type galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 in the hubble ultra  deep field	we report on a complete sample of 7 luminous early-type galaxies in thehubble ultra deep field (udf) with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.39 and2.47 and to k&lt;23 ab. using the bzk selection criterion we have pre-selected aset of objects over the udf which fulfill the photometric conditions for beingpassively evolving galaxies at z&gt;1.4. low-resolution spectra of these objectshave been extracted from the hst+acs grism data taken over the udf by thegrapes project. redshift for the 7 galaxies have been identified based on theuv feature at rest frame 2640&lt;lambda&lt;2850 aa. this feature is mainly due to acombination of feii, mgi and mgii absorptions which are characteristic ofstellar populations dominated by stars older than about 0.5 gyr. the redshiftidentification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is furthersupported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energydistribution (sed), with the ultradeep hst+acs/nicmos imaging revealing compactmorphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. from the sed we derivestellar masses of 10^{11}msun or larger and ages of about 1 gyr. their spacedensity at &lt; z &gt;=1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2--3 smaller than thatof their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massiveand old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. much smallereffective radii are derived for some of the objects compared to local massiveellipticals, which may be due to morphological k corrections, evolution, or thepresence of a central point-like source. nuclear activity is indeed present ina subset of the galaxies, as revealed by them being hard x-ray sources, hintingto agn activity having played a role in discontinuing star formation.

0809.0309	agn host galaxy morphologies in cosmos	we use hst/acs images and a photometric catalog of the cosmos field toanalyze morphologies of the host galaxies of approximately 400 agn candidatesat redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. we compare the agn hosts with a sample ofnon-active galaxies drawn from the cosmos field to match the magnitude andredshift distribution of the agn hosts. we perform 2-d surface brightnessmodeling with galfit to yield host galaxy and nuclear point source magnitudes.x-ray selected agn host galaxy morphologies span a substantial range that peaksbetween those of early-type, bulge-dominated and late-type, disk-dominatedsystems. we also measure the asymmetry and concentration of the host galaxies.unaccounted for, the nuclear point source can significantly bias results ofthese measured structural parameters, so we subtract the best-fit point sourcecomponent to obtain images of the underlying host galaxies. our concentrationmeasurements reinforce the findings of our 2-d morphology fits, placing x-rayagn hosts between early- and late-type inactive galaxies. agn host asymmetrydistributions are consistent with those of control galaxies. combined with alack of excess companion galaxies around agn, the asymmetry distributionsindicate that strong interactions are no more prevalent among agn than normalgalaxies. in light of recent work, these results suggest that the host galaxiesof agn at these x-ray luminosities may be in a transition from disk-dominatedto bulge-dominated, but that this transition is not typically triggered bymajor mergers.

astro-ph;0509081	the hellas2xmm survey. vii. the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn up  to z=4: more absorbed agn at low luminosities and high redshifts	we have determined the cosmological evolution of the density of agn and oftheir nh distribution as a function of the un-absorbed 2-10 kev luminosity upto redshift 4. we used the hellas2xmm sample combined with other publishedcatalogs, yielding a total of 508 agn. our best fit is obtained with aluminosity-dependent density evolution (ldde) model where low luminosity(lx~10^43 erg s^-1) agn peak at z~0.7, while high luminosity agn (lx&gt;10^45 ergs^-1) peak at z~2.0. a pure luminosity evolution model (ple) can instead berejected. there is evidence that the fraction of absorbed (nh&gt;10^22 cm^-2) agndecreases with the intrinsic x-ray luminosity, and increases with the redshift.our best fit solution provides a good fit to the observed counts, the cosmicx-ray background, and to the observed fraction of absorbed agn as a function ofthe flux in the 10^-15&lt;s(2-10)&lt;10^-10 erg s^-1 cm^-2 range. we find that theabsorbed, high luminosity (lx&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn have a density of 267 deg^-2at fluxes s(2-10)&gt;10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2. using these results, we estimate adensity of supermassive black holes in the local universe of 3.2 (h^2_70) x10^5 m_sol mpc^-3, which is consistent with the recent measurements of theblack hole mass function in the local galaxies.

astro-ph;0509244	the hellas2xmm survey. ix. spectroscopic identification of super-eros  hosting agns	we present vlt near-ir spectroscopic observations of three x-ray sourcescharacterized by extremely high x-ray-to-optical ratios (x/o&gt;40), extremely redcolors (6.3&lt;r-k&lt;7.4, i.e. eros) and bright infrared magnitudes (17.6&lt;k&lt;18.3).these objects are very faint in the optical, making their spectroscopicidentification extremely challenging. instead, our near-ir spectroscopicobservations have been successful in identifying the redshift of two of them(z=2.08 and z=1.35), and tentatively even of the third one (z=2.13). whencombined with the x-ray properties, our results clearly indicate that all theseobjects host obscured qsos (4e44 &lt; l(2-10kev) &lt; 1.5e45 erg/s, 2e22 &lt; n_h &lt; 4e23cm-2) at high redshift. the only object with unresolved morphology in the kband shows broad halpha emission, but not broad hbeta, implying a type 1.9 agnclassification. the other two objects are resolved and dominated by the hostgalaxy light in the k band, and appear relatively quiescent: one of them has aliner-like emission line spectrum and the other presents only a single, weakemission line which we tentatively identify with halpha. the galaxyluminosities for the latter two objects are an order of magnitude brighter thantypical local l* galaxies and the derived stellar masses are well in excess of10^11 msun. for these objects we estimate black hole masses higher than 10^9msun and we infer that they are radiating at eddington ratios l/l_edd &lt; 0.1. wediscuss the implications of these findings for the coevolution of galaxies andblack hole growth. our results provide further support that x-ray sources withhigh x/o ratios and very red colors tend to host obscured qso in very massivegalaxies at high redshift.

astro-ph;0512466	mambo 1.2 millimeter observations of bzk-selected star-forming galaxies  at z~2	we present mambo 1.2 mm observations of five bzk-pre-selected vigorousstarburst galaxies at z~2. two of these were detected at more than 99.5%confidence levels, with 1.2 mm fluxes around 1.5 mjy. these millimeter fluxesimply vigorous activity with star-formation rates (sfrs) approx. 500-1500msun/yr, confirmed also by detections at 24 microns with the mips camera onboard of the spitzer satellite. the two detected galaxies are the ones in thesample with the highest sfrs estimated from the rest-frame uv, and theirfar-ir- and uv-derived sfrs agree reasonably well. this is different from localulirgs and high-z submm/mm selected galaxies for which the uv is reported tounderestimate sfrs by factors of 10-100, but similar to the average bzk-ulirggalaxy at z~2. the two galaxies detected at 1.2 mm are brighter in k than thetypical nir-counterparts of mambo and scuba sources, implying also asignificantly different k-band to submm/mm flux ratio. this suggests a scenarioin which z~2 galaxies, after their rapid (sub)mm brightest phase opaque tooptical/uv light, evolve into a longer lasting phase of k-band bright andmassive objects. targeting the most uv active bzks could yield substantialdetection rates at submm/mm wavelengths.

astro-ph;0610921	a wide angle tail radio galaxy in the cosmos field: evidence for cluster  formation	we have identified a complex galaxy cluster system in the cosmos field via awide angle tail (wat) radio galaxy consistent with the idea that wat galaxiescan be used as tracers of clusters. the wat galaxy, cwat-01, is coincident withan elliptical galaxy resolved in the hst-acs image. using the cosmosmultiwavelength data set, we derive the radio properties of cwat-01 and use theoptical and x-ray data to investigate its host environment. the cluster hostingcwat-01 is part of a larger assembly consisting of a minimum of four x-rayluminous clusters within ~2 mpc distance. we apply hydrodynamical models thatcombine ram pressure and buoyancy forces on cwat-01. these models explain theshape of the radio jets only if the galaxy's velocity relative to theintra-cluster medium (icm) is in the range of about 300-550 km/s which ishigher than expected for brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in relaxed systems.this indicates that the cwat-01 host cluster is not relaxed, but is possiblydynamically young. we argue that such a velocity could have been inducedthrough subcluster merger within the cwat-01 parent cluster and/orcluster-cluster interactions. our results strongly indicate that we arewitnessing the formation of a large cluster from an assembly of multipleclusters, consistent with the hierarchical scenario of structure formation. weestimate the total mass of the final cluster to be approximately 20% of themass of the coma cluster.

astro-ph;0612311	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: i. survey  description	we present the first set of xmm-newton epic observations in the 2 squaredegree cosmos field. the strength of the cosmos project is the unprecedentedcombination of a large solid angle and sensitivity over the wholemultiwavelength spectrum. the xmm-newton observations are very efficient inlocalizing and identifying active galactic nuclei (agn) and clusters as well asgroups of galaxies. one of the primary goals of the xmm-newton cosmos survey isto study the co-evolution of active galactic nuclei as a function of theirenvironment in the cosmic web. here we present the log of observations, imagesand a summary of first research highlights for the first pass of 25 xmm-newtonpointings across the field. in the existing dataset we have detected 1416 newx-ray sources in the 0.5-2, 2-4.5 and 4.5-10 kev bands to an equivalent 0.5-2kev flux limit of 7x10-16 erg cm-2 s-1. the number of sources is expected togrow to almost 2000 in the final coverage of the survey. from an x-ray colorcolor analysis we identify a population of heavily obscured, partially leaky orreflecting absorbers, most of which are likely to be nearby, compton-thick agn.

astro-ph;0612360	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: vi. statistical  properties of clusters of galaxies	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the first 36xmm-newton pointings on the cosmos field. we reach a depth for a total clusterflux in the 0.5-2 kev band of 3x10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1, having one of the widestxmm-newton contiguous raster surveys, covering an area of 2.1 square degrees.cluster candidates are identified through a wavelet detection of extended x-rayemission. verification of the cluster candidates is done based on a galaxyconcentration analysis in redshift slices of thickness of 0.1-0.2 in redshift,using the multi-band photometric catalog of the cosmos field and restrictingthe search to z&lt;1.3 and i_ab &lt; 25. we identify 72 clusters and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray cluster scaling relations. a statisticaldescription of the survey in terms of the cumulative log(n&gt;s)-lg(s)distribution compares well with previous results, although yielding a somewhathigher number of clusters at similar fluxes. the x-ray luminosity function ofcosmos clusters matches well the results of nearby surveys, providing acomparably tight constraint on the faint end slope of alpha=1.93+/-0.04. forthe probed luminosity range of 8x10+42 - 2x10+44 ergs s-1, our survey is inagreement with and adds significantly to the existing data on the clusterluminosity function at high redshifts and implies no substantial evolution atthese luminosities to z=1.3.

astro-ph;0701482	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): a large-scale structure at z=0.73  and the relation of galaxy morphologies to local environment	we have identified a large-scale structure at z~0.73 in the cosmos field,coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, anacs weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended x-ray sourcesin a mosaic of xmm observations. the main peak seen in these maps correspondsto a rich cluster with tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 kev and lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}erg/s ([0.1-2.4] kev band). we estimate an x-ray mass within $r500$corresponding to m500~1.6 x 10^{14} msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolatedby fitting a nfw profile) m(nfw)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 msun. we use an automatedmorphological classification of all galaxies brighter than i_ab=24 over thestructure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function oflocal projected density sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived fromground-based deep multi-band photometry. we recover a robust morphology-densityrelation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, asmaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. interestingly, thisdifference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe inintermediate environments. we also find, however, local "inversions'' of theobserved global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. inparticular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of diskgalaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the x-raytemperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. weinterpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation inexisting galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
