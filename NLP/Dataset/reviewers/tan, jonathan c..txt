0907.0260	a test of star formation laws in disk galaxies	we use observations of the radial profiles of the mass surface density oftotal, sigma_g, and molecular, sigma_h2, gas, rotation velocity and starformation rate surface density, sigma_sfr, of the molecular dominated regionsof 12 disk galaxies from leroy et al. to test several star formation laws: a"kennicutt-schmidt power law", sigma_sfr=a_g sigma_{g,2}^{1.5}$; a "constantmolecular law", sigma_sfr = a_h2 sigma_{h2,2}; the "turbulence-regulated laws"of krumholz &amp; mckee (km) and krumholz, mckee &amp; tumlinson (kmt), a "gas-omegalaw", sigma_sfr = b_omega sigma_g omega; and a shear-driven "gmc collisionslaw", sigma_sfr = b_cc sigma_g omega (1 - 0.7beta), where beta is d ln v_circ /d ln r. we find the constant molecular law, kmt turbulence law and gmccollision law are the most accurate, with an rms error of a factor of 1.5 ifthe normalization constants are allowed to vary between galaxies. of thesethree laws, the gmc collision law does not require a change in physics toaccount for the full range of star formation activity seen from normal galaxiesto circumnuclear starbursts. a single global gmc collision law withb_cc=8.0x10^{-3}, i.e. a gas consumption time of 20 orbital times for beta=0,yields an rms error of a factor of 1.8.

1006.0241	the near-infrared reflected spectrum of source i in orion-kl	source i in the orion-kl nebula is believed to be the nearest example of amassive star still in the main accretion phase. it is thus one of the bestcases for studying the properties of massive protostars to constrain high-massstar formation theories. near-infrared radiation from source i escapes throughthe cavity opened by the omc1 outflow and is scattered by dust towards our lineof sight. the reflected spectrum offers a unique possibility of observing theemission from the innermost regions of the system and probing the nature ofsource i and its immediate surroundings. we obtained moderately highspectral-resolution (r~9000) observations of the near-infrared diffuse emissionin several locations around source i/orion-kl. we observed a widespread richabsorption line spectrum that we compare with cool stellar photospheres andprotostellar accretion disk models. the spectrum is broadly similar to stronglyveiled, cool, low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range teff~3500-4500 k,luminosity class i-iii. an exact match explaining all features has not beenfound, and a plausible explanation is that a range of different temperaturescontribute to the observed absorption spectrum. the 1d velocity dispersionsimplied by the absorption spectra, sigma~30 km/s, can be explained by theemission from a disk around a massive, mstar~10 msun, protostar that isaccreting at a high rate, mdot~3x10^{-3} msun/yr. our observations suggest thatthe near-infrared reflection spectrum observed in the orion-kl region isproduced close to source i and scattered to our line of sight in the omc1outflow cavity. the spectrum allows us to exclude source i being a very large,massive protostar rotating at breakup speed. we suggest that the absorptionspectrum is produced in a disk surrounding a ~10 msun protostar, accreting fromits disk at a high rate of a few 10^{-3} msun/yr.

1103.3068	radiation transfer of models of massive star formation. i. dependence on  basic core properties	radiative transfer calculations of massive star formation are presented.these are based on the turbulent core model of mckee &amp; tan andself-consistently included a hydrostatic core, an inside-out expansion wave, azone of free-falling rotating collapse, wide-angle dust-free outflow cavities,an active accretion disk, and a massive protostar. for the first time for suchmodels, an optically thick inner gas disk extends inside the dust destructionfront. this is important to conserve the accretion energy naturally and for itsshielding effect on the outer region of the disk and envelope. the simulationof radiation transfer is performed with the monte carlo code of whitney,yielding spectral energy distributions (seds) for the model series, from thesimplest spherical model to the fiducial one, with the above components eachadded step-by-step. images are also presented in different wavebands of varioustelescope cameras, including spitzer irac and mips, sofia forcast and herschelpacs and spire. the existence of the optically thick inner disk produces higheroptical wavelength fluxes but reduces near- and mid-ir emission. the presenceof outflow cavities, the inclination angle to the line of sight, and thethickness of the disk all affect the seds and images significantly. for thehigh mass surface density cores considered here, the mid-ir emission can bedominated by the outflow cavity walls, as has been suggested by de buizer. theeffect of varying the pressure of the environment bounding the surface of themassive core is also studied. with lower surface pressures, the core is larger,has lower extinction and accretion rates, and the observed mid-ir flux from thedisk can then be relatively high even though the accretion luminosity is lower.in this case the silicate absorption feature becomes prominent, in contrast tohigher density cores forming under higher pressures.

1106.2499	mapping large-scale co depletion in a filamentary infrared dark cloud	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold, high mass surface density and highdensity structures, likely to be representative of the initial conditions formassive star and star cluster formation. co emission from irdcs has thepotential to be useful for tracing their dynamics, but may be affected bydepleted gas phase abundances due to freeze-out onto dust grains. here weanalyze c18o j=1-0 and j=2-1 emission line data, taken with the iram 30mtelescope, of the highly filamentary irdc g035.39.-0033. we derive theexcitation temperature as a function of position and velocity, with typicalvalues of ~7k, and thus derive total mass surface densities, sigma_c18o,assuming standard gas phase abundances and accounting for optical depth in theline, which can reach values of ~1. the mass surface densities reach values of~0.07 g/cm^2. we compare these results to the mass surface densities derivedfrom mid-infrared (mir) extinction mapping, sigma_smf, by butler &amp; tan, whichare expected to be insensitive to the dust temperatures in the cloud. with asignificance of &gt;10sigma, we find sigma_c18o/sigma_smf decreases by about afactor of 5 as sigma increases from ~0.02 to ~0.2 g/cm^2, which we interpret asevidence for co depletion. several hundred solar masses are being affected,making this one of the most massive clouds in which co depletion has beenobserved directly. we present a map of the depletion factor in the filament anddiscuss implications for the formation of the irdc.

1203.0325	gravitational slingshot of young massive stars in orion	the orion nebula cluster (onc) is the nearest region of massive starformation and thus a crucial testing ground for theoretical models. ofparticular interest amongst the onc's ~1000 members are: \theta^1 ori c, themost massive binary in the cluster with stars of masses 38 and 9 msun (kraus etal. 2009); the becklin-neugebauer (bn) object, a 30 km/s runaway star of ~8msun (tan 2004); and the kleinmann-low (kl) nebula protostar, ahighly-obscured, ~15 msun object still accreting gas while also driving apowerful, apparently "explosive" outflow (allen &amp; burton 1993). the unusualbehavior of bn and kl is much debated: how did bn acquire its high velocity?how is this related to massive star formation in the kl nebula? here we reportthe results of a systematic survey using ~ 10^7 numerical experiments ofgravitational interactions of the \theta^1c and bn stars. we show thatdynamical ejection of bn from this triple system at its observed velocityleaves behind a binary with total energy and eccentricity matching thoseobserved for \theta^1c. five other observed properties of \theta^c are alsoconsistent with it having ejected bn and altogether we estimate there is only a&lt;~ 10^{-5} probability that \theta^1c has these properties by chance. weconclude that bn was dynamically ejected from the \theta^1c system about 4,500years ago. bn has then plowed through the kl massive-star-forming core withinthe last 1,000 years causing its recently-enhanced accretion and outflowactivity.

0711.1377	the formation of the first stars ii. radiative feedback processes and  implications for the initial mass function	we consider the radiative feedback processes that operate during theformation of the first stars, including the photodissociation of h_2, ly-alpharadiation pressure, formation and expansion of an hii region, and diskphotoevaporation. these processes may inhibit continued accretion once thestellar mass has reached a critical value, and we evaluate this mass separatelyfor each process. photodissociation of h_2 in the local dark matter minihalooccurs relatively early in the growth of the protostar, but we argue this doesnot affect subsequent accretion since by this time the depth of the potentialis large enough for accretion to be mediated by atomic cooling. however,neighboring starless minihalos can be affected. ionization creates an hiiregion in the infalling envelope above and below the accretion disk. ly-alpharadiation pressure acting at the boundary of the hii region is effective atreversing infall from narrow polar directions when the star reaches ~20-30msun,but cannot prevent infall from other directions. expansion of the hii regionbeyond the gravitational escape radius for ionized gas occurs at masses~50-100msun, depending on the accretion rate and angular momentum of theinflow. however, again, accretion from the equatorial regions can continuesince the neutral accretion disk has a finite thickness and shields asubstantial fraction of the accretion envelope from direct ionizing flux. athigher stellar masses, ~140msun in the fiducial case, the combination ofdeclining accretion rates and increasing photoevaporation-driven mass loss fromthe disk act to effectively halt the increase in the protostellar mass. weidentify this process as the mechanism that terminates the growth of populationiii stars...

0711.4116	star formation at zero and very low metallicities	we describe how star formation is expected to proceed in the early metal-freeuniverse, focusing on the very first generations of stars. we then discuss howthe star formation process may change as the effects of metallicity, externalradiative feedback, and magnetic and turbulent support of the gas become moreimportant. the very first stars (pop iii.1) have relatively simple initialconditions set by cosmology and the cooling properties of primordial gas. wedescribe the evolution of these stars as they grow in mass by accretion fromtheir surrounding gas cores and how the accretion process is affected andeventually terminated by radiative feedback processes, especially hii regionexpansion and disk photoevaporation. the ability of the protostar and its diskto generate dynamically important magnetic fields is reviewed and their effectsdiscussed. pop iii.1 star formation is likely to produce massive (~100-200msun)stars that then influence their surroundings via ionization, stellar winds, andsupernovae. these processes heat, ionize and metal-enrich the gas, thusaltering the initial conditions for the next generation of star formation.stars formed from gas that has been altered significantly by radiative and/ormechanical feedback, but not by metal enrichment (pop iii.2) are expected tohave significantly smaller masses than pop iii.1 stars because of moreefficient cooling from enhanced hd production. stars formed from gas that ismetal-enriched to levels that affect the dynamics of the collapse (the firstpop ii stars) are also expected to have relatively low masses. we brieflycompare the above star formation scenarios to what is known about present-daystar formation.

1210.6835	complex, quiescent kinematics in a highly filamentary infrared dark  cloud	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) host the initial conditions under which massivestars and stellar clusters form. we have obtained high sensitivity and highspectral resolution observations with the iram 30m antenna, which allowed us toperform detailed analysis of the kinematics within one irdc, g035.39-00.33. wefocus on the 1-0 and 3-2 transitions of n2h+, c18o (1-0), and make comparisonwith sio (2-1) observations and extinction mapping. three interacting filamentsof gas are found. we report large-scale velocity coherence throughout thecloud, evidenced through small velocity gradients and relatively narrow linewidths. this suggests that the merging of these filaments is somewhat "gentle",possibly regulated by magnetic fields. this merging of filaments may beresponsible for the weak parsec-scale sio emission detected by jimenez-serra etal. 2010, via grain mantle vaporization. a systematic velocity shift betweenthe n2h+ (1-0) and c18o (1-0) gas throughout the cloud of 0.18 +/- 0.04kms^{-1} is also found, consistent with a scenario of collisions betweenfilaments which is still ongoing. the n2h+ (1-0) is extended throughout theirdc and it does not only trace dense cores, as found in nearby low-massstar-forming regions. the average h2 number density across the irdc is ~ 5 x10^4 cm^{-3}, at least one order of magnitude larger than in nearby molecularclouds where low-mass stars are forming. a temperature gradient perpendicularto the filament is found. from our study, we conclude that g035.39-00.33(clearly seen in the extinction map and in n2h+) has been formed via thecollision between two relatively quiescent filaments with average densities of~ 5 x 10^3 cm^{-3}, moving with relative velocities of ~ 5 kms^{-1}. theaccumulation of material at the merging points started &gt; 1 myr ago and it isstill ongoing.

(2011) presented the source catalog of ~300 clumps basedon hco+(1-0) emission, used to estimate masses m. here we use archivalmid-infrared to mm continuum data to construct spectral energy distributions.fitting two-temperature grey-body models, we derive bolometric luminosities, l.we find the clumps have 10lsun&lt;l&lt;1e6.5lsun and 0.1&lt;l/m&lt;1e3, consistent withtheoretical expectations of a clump population that spans a range ofinstantaneous star formation efficiencies from 0 to ~50%. we thus expect l/m tobe a useful, strongly-varying indicator of clump evolution during the starcluster formation process. we find correlations of the ratio of warm to coldcomponent fluxes and of cold component temperature with l/m. we also find anear linear relation between l/m and spitzer-irac specific intensity (surfacebrightness), which may thus also be useful as a star formation efficiencyindicator. the lower bound of the clump $l/m$ distribution suggests the starformation efficiency per free-fall time is epsilon&lt;0.2. we do not find strongcorrelations of l/m with mass surface density, velocity dispersion or virialparameter. we find a linear relation between l and l_{hco+(1-0}}, although withlarge scatter for any given individual clump. fitting together withextragalactic systems, the linear relation still holds, extending over 10orders of magnitude in luminosity. the complete nature of the champ survey overa several kiloparsec-scale region allows us to derive a measurement at anintermediate scale bridging those of individual clumps and whole galaxies.

1303.4343	the dynamics of massive starless cores with alma	how do stars that are more massive than the sun form, and thus how is thestellar initial mass function (imf) established? such intermediate- andhigh-mass stars may be born from relatively massive pre-stellar gas cores,which are more massive than the thermal jeans mass. the turbulent coreaccretion model invokes such cores as being in approximate virial equilibriumand in approximate pressure equilibrium with their surrounding clump medium.their internal pressure is provided by a combination of turbulence and magneticfields. alternatively, the competitive accretion model requires stronglysub-virial initial conditions that then lead to extensive fragmentation to thethermal jeans scale, with intermediate- and high-mass stars later forming bycompetitive bondi-hoyle accretion. to test these models, we have identifiedfour prime examples of massive (~100msun) clumps from mid-infrared extinctionmapping of infrared dark clouds (irdcs). fontani et al. found high deuterationfractions of n2h+ in these objects, which are consistent with them beingstarless. here we present alma observations of these four clumps that probe then2d+(3-2) line at 2.3" resolution. we find six n2d+ cores and determine theirdynamical state. their observed velocity dispersions and sizes are broadlyconsistent with the predictions of the turbulent core model ofself-gravitating, magnetized (with alfven mach number m_a~1) and virializedcores that are bounded by the high pressures of their surrounding clumps.however, in the most massive cores, with masses up to ~60msun, our resultssuggest that moderately enhanced magnetic fields (so that m_a~0.3) may beneeded for the structures to be in virial and pressure equilibrium.magnetically regulated core formation may thus be important in controlling theformation of massive cores, inhibiting their fragmentation, and thus helping toestablish the stellar imf.

0801.4950	turmoil in orion: the nearest massive protostar	i discuss different theories of massive star formation: formation frommassive cores, competitive bondi-hoyle accretion, and protostellar collisions.i summarize basic features of the turbulent core model (tcm). i then introducethe orion kleinmann-low (kl) region, embedded in the orion nebula cluster (onc)and one of the nearest regions of massive star formation. the kl regioncontains three principal radio sources, known as "i", "n" and "bn". bn is knownto be a runaway star, almost certainly set in motion by dynamical ejectionwithin the onc from a multiple system of massive stars, that would leave behinda recoiling, hard, massive, probably eccentric binary. i review the debateabout whether this binary is theta^1c, the most massive star in the onc, orsource "i", and argue that it is most likely to be theta^1c, since this is nowknown be a recoiling, hard, massive, eccentric binary, with properties thatsatisfy the energy and momentum constraints implied by bn's motion. source "n"is a relatively low-mass protostar with extended radio emission suggestive of abipolar outflow. source "i", located near the center of the main gasconcentration in the region, the orion hot core, is the likely location of amassive protostar that is powering the kl region, and i discuss how its basicproperties are consistent with predictions from the tcm. in this scenario, theradio emission from source "i" is the base of a bipolar outflow that is ionizedby the massive protostar and should be elongated along the axis of the outflow.

1312.0971	the deuterium fractionation timescale in dense cloud cores: a parameter  space exploration	the deuterium fraction [n$_2$d$^+$]/[n$_2$h$^+$], may provide informationabout the ages of dense, cold gas structures, important to compare withdynamical models of cloud core formation and evolution. here we introduce acomplete chemical network with species containing up to three atoms, with theexception of the oxygen chemistry, where reactions involving h$_3$o$^+$ and itsdeuterated forms have been added, significantly improving the consistency withcomprehensive chemical networks. deuterium chemistry and spin states of h$_2$and h$_3^+$ isotopologues are included in this primarily gas-phase chemicalmodel. we investigate dependence of deuterium chemistry on model parameters:density ($n_{\rm h}$), temperature, cosmic ray ionization rate, and gas-phasedepletion factor of heavy elements ($f_{\rm d}$). we also explore the effectsof time-dependent freeze-out of gas-phase species and dynamical evolution ofdensity at various rates relative to free-fall collapse. for a broad range ofmodel parameters, the timescales to reach large values of $d_{\rm frac}^{\rmn_2h^+} \gtrsim 0.1$, observed in some low- and high-mass starless cores, arerelatively long compared to the local free-fall timescale. these conclusionsare unaffected by introducing time-dependent freeze-out and considering modelswith evolving density, unless the initial $f_{\rm d} \gtrsim$ 10. for fiducialmodel parameters, achieving $d_{\rm frac}^{\rm n_2h^+} \gtrsim 0.1$ requirescollapse to be proceeding at rates at least several times slower than that offree-fall collapse, perhaps indicating a dynamically important role formagnetic fields in the support of starless cores and thus the regulation ofstar formation.

1312.1063	far-infrared extinction mapping of infrared dark clouds	progress in understanding star formation requires detailed observationalconstraints on the initial conditions, i.e. dense clumps and cores in giantmolecular clouds that are on the verge of gravitational instability. suchstructures have been studied by their extinction of near-infrared (nir) and,more recently, mid-infrared (mir) background light. it has been somewhat moreof a surprise to find that there are regions that appear as dark shadows atfar-infrared (fir) wavelengths as long as $\sim$100$\mu m$. here we developanalysis methods of fir images from spitzer-mips and herschel-pacs that allowquantitative measurements of cloud mass surface density, $\sigma$. the methodbuilds upon that developed for mir extinction mapping (mirex) (butler and tan2012), in particular involving a search for independent saturated, i.e. veryopaque, regions that allow measurement of the foreground intensity. we focus onthree massive starless core/clumps in irdc g028.37+00.07, deriving mass surfacedensity maps from 3.5 to 70$\mu m$. a by-product of this analysis ismeasurement of the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse foregroundemission. the lower opacity at 70$\mu m$ allows us to probe to higher $\sigma$values, up to $\sim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}^{-2}}$ in the densest parts of thecore/clumps. comparison of the $\sigma$ maps at different wavelengthsconstrains the shape of the mir-fir dust opacity law in irdcs. we find it ismost consistent with the thick ice mantle models of ossenkopf and henning(1994). there is tentative evidence for grain ice mantle growth as one goesfrom lower to higher $\sigma$ regions.

1312.3370	radiation transfer of models of massive star formation. iii. the  evolutionary sequence	we present radiation transfer (rt) simulations of evolutionary sequences ofmassive protostars forming from massive dense cores in environments of highsurface densities. the protostellar evolution is calculated with a detailedmulti-zone model, with the accretion rate regulated by feedback from anevolving disk-wind outflow cavity. disk and envelope evolutions are calculatedself-consistently. in this framework, an evolutionary track is determined bythree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass m_c, the meansurface density of the ambient star-forming clump sigma_cl, and therotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.evolutionary sequences with various m_c, sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. wefind that in a fiducial model with m_c=60msun, sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 andbeta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency &gt;~0.43. for each evolutionarytrack, rt simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperatureprofiles, seds, and images produced. at a given stage the envelope temperatureis highly dependent on sigma_cl, but only weakly dependent on m_c. the sed andmir images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity, which graduallywides as the protostar grows. the fluxes at &lt;~100 microns increasedramatically, and the far-ir peaks move to shorter wavelengths. we find that,despite scatter caused by different m_c, sigma_cl, beta, and inclinations,sources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions on color-colordiagrams, especially when using colors at &gt;~ 70 microns, where the scatter dueto the inclination is minimized, implying that such diagrams can be usefuldiagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars. we discuss howintensity profiles along or perpendicular to the outflow axis are affected byenvironmental conditions and source evolution.

1401.6855	the darkest shadows: deep mid-infrared extinction mapping of a massive  protocluster	we use deep $8\:\mu m$ spitzer-irac imaging of a massive infrared dark cloud(irdc) g028.37+00.07 to construct a mid-infrared (mir) extinction map thatprobes mass surface densities up to $\sigma\:\sim 1\:\rm{g~cm^{-2}}$($a_v\sim200\:$mag), amongst the highest values yet probed by extinctionmapping. merging with a nir extinction map of the region, creates a highdynamic range map that reveals structures down to $a_v\sim1\:$mag. we utilizethe map to: (1) measure a cloud mass $\sim7\times10^4\:m_\odot$ within a radiusof $\sim8\:$pc. $^{13}$co kinematics indicate that the cloud is gravitationallybound. it thus has the potential to form one of the most massive young starclusters known in the galaxy. (2) characterize the structures of 16 massivecores within the irdc, finding they can be fit by singular polytropic sphereswith $\rho\propto{r}^{-k_\rho}$ and $k_\rho=1.3\pm0.3$. they have$\overline{\sigma}\simeq0.1-0.4\:\rm{g~cm^{-2}}$ --- relatively low valuesthat, along with their measured cold temperatures, suggest magnetic fields,rather than accretion-powered radiative heating, are important for controllingfragmentation of these cores. (3) determine the $\sigma$ (equivalently columndensity or $a_v$) probability distribution function (pdf) for a region that isnear complete for $a_v&gt;3\:$mag. the pdf is well fit by a single log-normal withmean $\overline{a}_v\simeq9\:$mag, high compared to other known clouds. it doesnot exhibit a separate high-end power law tail, which has been claimed toindicate the importance of self-gravity. however, we suggest that the pdf doesresult from a self-similar, self-gravitating hierarchy of structure beingpresent over a wide range of scales in the cloud.

1402.0919	massive star formation	the enormous radiative and mechanical luminosities of massive stars impact avast range of scales and processes, from the reionization of the universe, tothe evolution of galaxies, to the regulation of the interstellar medium, to theformation of star clusters, and even to the formation of planets around starsin such clusters. two main classes of massive star formation theory are underactive study, core accretion and competitive accretion. in core accretion, theinitial conditions are self-gravitating, centrally concentrated cores thatcondense with a range of masses from the surrounding, fragmenting clumpenvironment. they then undergo relatively ordered collapse via a central diskto form a single star or a small-n multiple. in this case, the pre-stellar coremass function has a similar form to the stellar initial mass function. incompetitive accretion, the material that forms a massive star is drawn morechaotically from a wider region of the clump without passing through a phase ofbeing in a massive, coherent core. in this case, massive star formation mustproceed hand in hand with star cluster formation. if stellar densities becomevery high near the cluster center, then collisions between stars may also helpto form the most massive stars. we review recent theoretical and observationalprogress towards understanding massive star formation, considering physical andchemical processes, comparisons with low and intermediate-mass stars, andconnections to star cluster formation.

0802.3944	simulating the ism in global disk galaxies	until recently, simulations that modeled entire galaxies were restricted toan isothermal or fixed 2- or 3-phase interstellar medium (ism). this obscuredthe full role of the ism in shaping the observed galactic-scale star formationrelations. in particular the kennicutt relation suggests that star formationrates depend in a simple way on global galactic quantities, such as mean gasmass surface density and dynamical time. contrary to this, observations ofnearby star-forming regions, including images from the spitzer telescope, showthat all the way down to ``local-scales'' ($\sim$ parsecs) star formation is ahighly clustered process with the gas existing at a wide range of densities andmultiple phases, and seemingly decoupled from the larger-scale galaxy. manydifferent physical processes appear to be influencing the star formation rate,including heating and cooling of the gas, ``turbulent'' energy injection fromoutflows, winds and supernova blastwaves, ionization, and magnetic fieldsupport. here we present results from global simulations of disk galaxy starformation that include a fully multiphase ism and compare to simpler isothermalmodels. we also investigate the effect of background heating. we discuss theprocess of giant molecular cloud formation as one of the possible links betweenthe galactic and local scales of star formation.

1409.2503	the structure, dynamics and star formation rate of the orion nebula  cluster	the spatial morphology and dynamical status of a young, still-forming stellarcluster provide valuable clues on the conditions during the star formationevent and the processes that regulated it. we analyze the orion nebula cluster(onc), utilizing the latest censuses of its stellar content and membershipestimates over a large wavelength range. we determine the center of mass of theonc, and study the radial dependence of angular substructure. the core appearsrounder and smoother than the outskirts, consistent with a higher degree ofdynamical processing. at larger distances the departure from circular symmetryis mostly driven by the elongation of the system, with very little additionalsubstructure, indicating a somewhat evolved spatial morphology or an expandinghalo. we determine the mass density profile of the cluster, which is wellfitted by a power law that is slightly steeper than a singular isothermalsphere. together with the ism density, estimated from average stellarextinction, the mass content of the onc is insufficient by a factor $\sim 1.8$to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion from virialized motions, inagreement with previous assessments that the onc is moderately supervirial.this may indicate recent gas dispersal. based on the latest estimates for theage spread in the system and our density profiles, we find that, at thehalf-mass radius, 90% of the stellar population formed within $\sim 5$-$8$free-fall times ($t_{\rm ff}$). this implies a star formation efficiency per$t_{\rm ff}$ of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\sim 0.04$-$0.07$, i.e., relatively slow andinefficient star formation rates during star cluster formation.

1410.4197	the structural evolution of forming and early stage star clusters	we study the degree of angular substructure in the stellar positiondistribution of young members of galactic star-forming regions, looking forcorrelations with distance from cluster center, surface number density ofstars, and local dynamical age. to this end we adopt the catalog of members in18 young ($\sim$1-3 myr) clusters from the massive young star-forming complexstudy in infrared and x-ray (mystix) survey and the statistical analysis of theangular dispersion parameter, $\delta_{\rm adp}$. we find statisticallysignificant correlation between $\delta_{\rm adp}$ and physical projecteddistance from the center of the clusters, with the centers appearing smootherthan the outskirts, consistent with more rapid dynamical processing on localdynamical, free-fall or orbital timescales. similarly, smoother distributionsare seen in regions of higher surface density, or older dynamical ages. theseresults indicate that dynamical processing that erases substructure is alreadywell-advanced in young, sometimes still-forming, clusters. such observations ofthe dissipation of substructure have the potential to constrain theoreticalmodels of the dynamical evolution of young and forming clusters.

1410.5541	kiloparsec-scale simulations of star formation in disk galaxies iii.  structure and dynamics of filaments and clumps in giant molecular clouds	we present hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating dense gas in agalactic disk, exploring scales ranging from 1 kpc down to $\sim 0.1$~pc. ourprimary goal is to understand how dense filaments form in giant molecularclouds (gmcs). these structures, often observed as infrared dark clouds (irdcs)in the galactic plane, are thought to be the precursors to massive stars andstar clusters, so their formation may be the rate limiting step controllingglobal star formation rates in galactic systems as described by thekennicutt-schmidt relation. our study follows on from van loo et al. (2013,paper i), which carried out simulations to 0.5~pc resolution and examinedglobal aspects of the formation of dense gas clumps and the resulting starformation rate. here, using our higher resolution, we examine the detailedstructural, kinematic and dynamical properties of dense filaments and clumps,including mass surface density ($\sigma$) probability distribution functions,filament mass per unit length and its dispersion, lateral $\sigma$ profiles,filament fragmentation, filament velocity gradients and infall, and degree offilament and clump virialization. where possible, these properties are comparedto observations of irdcs. by many metrics, especially too large mass fractionsof high $\sigma&gt;1\:{\rm g\:cm^{-2}}$ material, too high mass per unit lengthdispersion due to dense clump formation, too high velocity gradients and toohigh velocity dispersion for a given mass per unit length, the simulatedfilaments differ from observed irdcs. we thus conclude that irdcs do not formfrom global fast collapse of gmcs. rather, we expect irdc formation andcollapse is slowed significantly by the influence of dynamically importantmagnetic fields, which may thus play a crucial role in regulating galactic starformation rates.

1410.7390	magnetic fields in high-mass infrared dark clouds	high-mass stars are cosmic engines known to dominate the energetics in themilky way and other galaxies. however, their formation is still not wellunderstood. massive, cold, dense clouds, often appearing as infrared darkclouds (irdcs), are the nurseries of massive stars. no measurements of magneticfields in irdcs in a state prior to the onset of high-mass star formation(hmsf) have previously been available, and prevailing hmsf theories do notconsider strong magnetic fields. here, we report observations of magneticfields in two of the most massive irdcs in the milky way. we show that irdcsg11.11-0.12 and g0.253+0.016 are strongly magnetized and that the strongmagnetic field is as important as turbulence and gravity for hmsf. the maindense filament in g11.11-0.12 is perpendicular to the magnetic field, while thelower density filament merging onto the main filament is parallel to themagnetic field. the implied magnetic field is strong enough to suppressfragmentation sufficiently to allow hmsf. other mechanisms reducingfragmentation, such as the entrapment of heating from young stars via high masssurface densities, are not required to facilitate hmsf.

1411.0762	environment and protostellar evolution	even today in our galaxy, stars form from gas cores in a variety ofenvironments, which may affect the properties of resulting star and planetarysystems. here we study the role of pressure, parameterized via ambient clumpmass surface density, on protostellar evolution and appearance, focussing onlow-mass, sun-like stars and considering a range of conditions from relativelylow pressure filaments in taurus, to intermediate pressures of cluster-formingclumps like the orion nebula cluster (onc), to very high pressures that may befound in the densest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) or in the galactic center(gc). we present unified analytic and numerical models for collapse ofprestellar cores, accretion disks, protostellar evolution and bipolar outflows,coupled to radiative transfer (rt) calculations and a simple astrochemicalmodel to predict co gas phase abundances. prestellar cores in high pressureenvironments are smaller and denser and thus collapse with higher accretionrates and efficiencies, resulting in higher luminosity protostars with morepowerful outflows. the protostellar envelope is heated to warmer temperatures,affecting infrared morphologies (and thus classification) and astrochemicalprocesses like co depletion to dust grain ice mantles (and thus comorphologies). these results have general implications for star and planetformation, especially via their effect on astrochemical and dust grainevolution during infall to and through protostellar accretion disks.

1411.2629	vulcan planets: inside-out formation of the innermost super-earths	the compact multi-transiting systems discovered by kepler challengetraditional planet formation theories. these fall into two broad classes: (1)formation further out followed by migration; (2) formation in situ from a diskof gas and planetesimals. in the former, an abundance of resonant chains isexpected, which the kepler data do not support. in the latter, required diskmass surface densities may be too high. a recently proposed mechanismhypothesizes that planets form in situ at the pressure trap associated with thedead-zone inner boundary (dzib) where radially drifting "pebbles" accumulate.this scenario predicts planet masses ($m_p$) are set by the gap-opening processthat then leads to dzib retreat, followed by sequential, inside-out planetformation (iopf). for typical disk accretion rates, iopf predictions for $m_p$,$m_p$ versus orbital radius $r$, and planet-planet separations are consistentwith observed systems. here we investigate the iopf prediction for how themasses, $m_{p,1}$, of the innermost ("vulcan") planets vary with $r$. we showthat for fiducial parameters, $m_{p,1}\simeq5.0(r/{\rm{0.1\:au}})\:m_\oplus$,independent of the disk's accretion rate at time of planet formation. then,using monte carlo sampling of a population of these innermost planets, we testthis predicted scaling against observed planet properties, allowing forintrinsic dispersions in planetary densities and kepler's observational biases.these effects lead to a slightly shallower relation$m_{p,1}\propto{r}^{0.9\pm0.2}$, which is consistent with$m_{p,1}\propto{r}^{0.7\pm0.2}$ of the observed vulcans. the normalization ofthe relation constrains the gap-opening process, favoring relatively lowviscosities in the inner dead zone.

1502.00183	the giant molecular cloud environments of infrared dark clouds	we study giant molecular cloud (gmc) environments surrounding 10 infrareddark clouds (irdcs), using $^{13}$co(1-0) emission from the galactic ringsurvey. we measure physical properties of these irdcs/gmcs on a range of scalesextending to radii, r, of 30 pc. by comparing different methods for definingcloud boundaries and for deriving mass surface densities and velocitydispersions, we settle on a preferred "ce,$\tau$,g" method of "connectedextraction" in position-velocity space plus gaussian fitting toopacity-corrected line profiles for velocity dispersion and mass estimation. weexamine how cloud definition affects measurements of the magnitude anddirection of line-of-sight velocity gradients and velocity dispersions,including associated dependencies on size scale. ce,$\tau$,g-defined gmcs showvelocity dispersion versus size relations $\sigma\propto{s}^{1/2}$, which areconsistent with the large-scale gradients being caused by turbulence. however,irdcs have velocity dispersions that are moderately enhanced above thosepredicted by this scaling relation. we examine the dynamical state of theclouds finding mean virial parameters $\bar{\alpha}_{\rm{vir}}\simeq 1.0$ forgmcs and 1.6 for irdcs, broadly consistent with models of magnetized virializedpressure-confined polytropic clouds, but potentially indicating that irdcs havemore disturbed kinematics. ce,$\tau$,g-defined clouds exhibit a tightcorrelation of $\sigma/r^{1/2}\propto\sigma^n$, with $n\simeq0.7$ for gmcs and1.3 for irdcs (c.f., a value of 0.5 expected for a population of virializedclouds). we conclude that while gmcs show evidence for virialization over arange of scales, irdcs may be moderately super virial. alternatively, irdcscould be virialized but have systematically different $^{13}$co gas phaseabundances, i.e., due to freeze-out, affecting mass estimations.

1505.07504	in-sync iii: the dynamical state of ic 348 - a super-virial velocity  dispersion and a puzzling sign of convergence	most field stars will have encountered the highest stellar density and hencethe largest number of interactions in their birth environment. yet the stellardynamics during this crucial phase are poorly understood. here we analyze theradial velocities measured for 152 out of 380 observed stars in the 2-6 myr oldstar cluster ic 348 as part of the sdss-iii apogee. the radial velocitydistribution of these stars is fitted with one or two gaussians, convolved withthe measurement uncertainties including binary orbital motions. including asecond gaussian improves the fit; the high-velocity outliers that are best fitby this second component may either (1) be contaminants from the nearby perseusob2 association, (2) be a halo of ejected or dispersing stars from ic 348, or(3) reflect that ic 348 has not relaxed to a gaussian velocity distribution. wemeasure a velocity dispersion for ic 348 of $0.72 \pm 0.07$ km s$^{-1}$ (or$0.64 \pm 0.08$ km s$^{-1}$ if two gaussians are fitted), which implies asupervirial state, unless the gas contributes more to the gravitationalpotential than expected. no evidence is found for a dependence of this velocitydispersion on distance from the cluster center or stellar mass. we also findthat stars with lower extinction (in the front of the cloud) tend to beredshifted compared with stars with somewhat higher extinction (towards theback of the cloud). this data suggests that the stars in ic 348 are convergingalong the line of sight. we show that this correlation between radial velocityand extinction is unlikely to be spuriously caused by the small clusterrotation of $0.024 \pm 0.013$ km s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$ or by correlationsbetween the radial velocities of neighboring stars. this signature, ifconfirmed, will be the first detection of line-of-sight convergence in a starcluster(...)

1508.02791	inside-out planet formation. iii. planet-disk interaction at the dead  zone inner boundary	the kepler mission has discovered more than 4000 exoplanet candidates. manyare in systems with tightly packed inner planets. inside-out planet formation(iopf) has been proposed to explain these systems. it involves sequential insitu planet formation at the local pressure maximum of a retreating dead zoneinner boundary (dzib). pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap, which buildsup a ring, and then a planet. the planet is expected to grow until it opens agap, which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and induce dzib retreat thatsets the location of formation of the next planet. this simple scenario may bemodified if the planet migrates significantly from its formation location. thusplanet-disk interactions play a crucial role in the iopf scenario. we presentnumerical simulations that first assess migration of planets of various massesthat are forming at the dzib of an active accretion disk, where the effectiveviscosity rapidly increases in the radially inward direction. we find that thedisk's torques on the planet tend to trap the planet at a location very closeto the initial pressure maximum where it formed. we then study gap opening bythese planets to assess at what mass a significant gap is created. finally wepresent a simple model for dzib retreat due to penetration of x-rays from thestar to the disk midplane. overall, these simulations help to quantify both themass scale of first,"vulcan," planet formation and the orbital separation tothe location of second planet formation.

1509.06754	outflow-confined h ii regions. i. first signposts of massive star  formation	we present an evolutionary sequence of models of the photoionized disk-windoutflow around forming massive stars based on the core accretion model. theoutflow is expected to be the first structure to be ionized by the protostarand can confine the expansion of the hii region, especially in lateraldirections in the plane of the accretion disk. the ionizing luminosityincreases as kelvin-helmholz contraction proceeds, and the hii region is formedwhen the stellar mass reaches ~10-20msun depending on the initial cloud coreproperties. although some part of outer disk surface remains neutral due toshielding by the inner disk and the disk wind, almost the whole of the outflowis ionized in 1e3-1e4 yr after initial hii region formation. having calculatedthe extent and temperature structure of the hii region within the immediateprotostellar environment, we then make predictions for the strength of itsfree-free continuum and recombination line emission. the free-free radioemission from the ionized outflow has a flux density of ~(20-200)x(nu/10ghz)^pmjy for a source at a distance of 1 kpc with a spectral index p~0.4-0.7, andthe apparent size is typically ~500au at 10ghz. the h40alpha line profile has awidth of about 100km/s. these properties of our model are consistent withobserved radio winds and jets around forming massive protostars.

1510.06703	an overview of inside-out planet formation	the kepler-discovered systems with tightly-packed inner planets (stips),typically with several planets of earth to super-earth masses on well-aligned,sub-au orbits may host the most common type of planets, including habitableplanets, in the galaxy. they pose a great challenge for planet formationtheories, which fall into two broad classes: (1) formation further out followedby inward migration; (2) formation in situ, in the very inner regions of theprotoplanetary disk. we review the pros and cons of these classes, beforefocusing on a new theory of sequential in situ formation from the inside-outvia creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuousstream of small (~cm-m size) "pebbles," drifting inward via gas drag. pebblesfirst collect at the pressure trap associated with the transition from amagnetorotational instability (mri)-inactive ("dead zone") region to an inner,mri-active zone. a pebble ring builds up that begins to dominate the local masssurface density of the disk and spawns a planet. the planet continues to grow,most likely by pebble accretion, until it becomes massive enough to isolateitself from the accretion flow via gap opening. this reduces the local gasdensity near the planet, leading to enhanced ionization and a retreat of thedead zone inner boundary. the process repeats with a new pebble ring gatheringat the new pressure maximum associated with this boundary. we discuss thetheory's predictions for planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbitalradius, and minimum orbital separations, and their comparison with observedsystems. finally, we discuss open questions, including potential causes ofdiversity of planetary system architectures, i.e., stips versus solar systemanalogs.

1511.02100	the deuteration clock for massive starless cores	to understand massive star formation requires study of its initialconditions. two massive starless core candidates, c1-n &amp; c1-s, have beendetected in irdc g028.37+00.07 in $\rm n_2d^+$(3-2) with $alma$. from theirline widths, either the cores are subvirial and are thus young structures onthe verge of near free-fall collapse, or they are threaded by $\sim1$ mg$b$-fields that help support them in near virial equilibrium and potentiallyhave older ages. we modeled the deuteration rate of $\rm n_2h^+$ to constraincollapse rates of the cores. first, to measure their current deuteriumfraction, $d_{\rm  frac}^{\rm n_2h^+}$ $\equiv [\rm n_2d^+]/[n_2h^+]$, we observed multipletransitions of $\rm n_2h^+$ and $\rm n_2d^+$ with $carma$, $sma$, $jcmt$,$nro~45m$ and $iram~30m$, to complement the $alma$ data. for both cores wederived $d_{\rm  frac}^{\rm n_2h^+}\sim0.3$, several orders of magnitude above the cosmic[d]/[h] ratio. we then carried out chemodynamical modeling, exploring howcollapse rate relative to free-fall, $\alpha_{\rm ff}$, affects the level of$d_{\rm frac}^{\rm n_2h^+}$ that is achieved from a given initial condition. toreach the observed $d_{\rm frac}^{\rm  n_2h^+}$, most models require slow collapse with $\alpha_{\rm  ff}\sim0.1$, i.e., $\sim1/10$th of free-fall. this makes it more likely thatthe cores have been able to reach a near virial equilibrium state and wepredict that strong $b$-fields will eventually be detected. the methodsdeveloped here will be useful for measurement of the pre-stellar core massfunction.

astro-ph;0203071	massive star formation in 100,000 years from turbulent and pressurized  molecular clouds	massive stars (with mass m_* &gt; 8 solar masses) are fundamental to theevolution of galaxies, because they produce heavy elements, inject energy intothe interstellar medium, and possibly regulate the star formation rate. theindividual star formation time, t_*f, determines the accretion rate of thestar; the value of the former quantity is currently uncertain by many orders ofmagnitude, leading to other astrophysical questions. for example, the variationof t_*f with stellar mass dictates whether massive stars can formsimultaneously with low-mass stars in clusters. here we show that t_*f isdetermined by conditions in the star's natal cloud, and is typically ~10^5 yr.the corresponding mass accretion rate depends on the pressure within the cloud- which we relate to the gas surface density - and on both the instantaneousand final stellar masses. characteristic accretion rates are sufficient toovercome radiation pressure from ~100 solar mass protostars, whilesimultaneously driving intense bipolar gas outflows. the weak dependence oft_*f on the final mass of the star allows high- and low-mass star formation tooccur nearly simultaneously in clusters.

astro-ph;0206037	the formation of massive stars from turbulent cores	observations indicate that massive stars form in regions of very high surfacedensity, ~1 g cm^-2. clusters containing massive stars and globular clustershave a comparable column density. the total pressure in clouds of such a columndensity is p/k~10^8-10^9 k cm^-3, far greater than that in the diffuse ism orthe average in gmcs. observations show that massive star-forming regions aresupersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out of whichindividual massive stars form are as well. the protostellar accretion rate insuch a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the stardivided by the free-fall time of the gas that is accreting onto the star(stahler, shu, &amp; taam 1980). the star-formation time in this turbulent coremodel for massive star formation is several mean free-fall timesscales of thecore, but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded.the typical time for a massive star to form is about 10^5 yr and the accretionrate is high enough to overcome radiation pressure due to the luminosity of thestar. for the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which thestars form have a density structure varying as r^{-1.5}, the protostellaraccretion rate grows linearly with time. we calculate the evolution of theradius of a protostar and determine the accretion luminosity. at the highaccretion rates that are typical in regions of massive star formation,protostars join the main sequence at about 20 solar masses. we apply theseresults to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering severalobserved hot molecular cores, including the orion hot core and w3(h2o). in theappendixes, we discuss the pressure in molecular clouds and we argue that``logatropic'' models for molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.

astro-ph;0307414	the formation of the first stars i. mass infall rates, accretion disk  structure and protostellar evolution	we present a theoretical model for primordial star formation. first wedescribe the structure of the initial gas cores as virialized,quasi-hydrostatic objects in accord with recent high resolution numericalstudies. the accretion rate can then be related to characteristic densities andtemperatures that are set by the cooling properties of molecular hydrogen. weallow for rotation of the gas core, assuming angular momentum conservationinside the sonic point of the flow. in the typical case, most mass then reachesthe star via an accretion disk. the structure of the inner region of this diskis described with the standard theory of viscous disks, but with allowance forthe substantial energies absorbed in ionizing and dissociating the gas. thesize of the protostar and its luminosity depend upon the accretion rate, theenergetics of the accreting gas, and the ability of the radiation to escapefrom the stellar accretion shock. we combine these models for the infall rate,inner disk structure, and protostellar evolution to predict the radiation fieldthat is the basis for radiative feedback processes acting against infall (paperii). for realistic initial angular momenta, the photosphere of the protostar ismuch smaller and hotter than in the spherical case, leading to strongerradiative feedback at earlier stages in the evolution. in particular, once thestar is older than its kelvin-helmholtz time, contraction towards the mainsequence causes a rapid increase in ionizing and far-ultraviolet luminosity atmasses ~30msun in the fiducial case. since the cores out of which the firststars formed were much more massive than 30msun and since feedback isdynamically unimportant at lower masses, we conclude that the first starsshould have had masses &gt;~30msun.

astro-ph;0307455	protostellar disk dynamos and hydromagnetic outflows in primordial star  formation	are magnetic fields important in primordial star formation? assuming thatstar formation occurs via an accretion disk that is turbulent, initiallybecause of local gravitational instability, we calculate the disk structure forrealistic accretion rates. we predict that local gravitational viscosity isable to drive accretion, without the disk fragmenting. we then estimate therate of dynamo amplification of seed magnetic field. turbulence in a stratifieddisk can be helical, with different signs of the helicity in each hemisphere.this provides a key ingredient for production of global scale magnetic fieldswhose sign of flux is sustained over many orbit times. the resulting fields candrive collimated protostellar outflows that reduce the star formationefficiency from the initial gas cloud, especially once the protostar hascontracted to the main sequence, at ~100 msun. we estimate that the outflowsare powerful enough to eject some material from the host dark matter halo andto initiate relatively strong magnetization of the local intergalactic medium.close to the protostar, the outflow acts to shield the disk and equatorialregions from radiative feedback, such as ionizing photons, and this may enableaccretion up to relatively large stellar masses. we conclude that magneticfields cannot be ignored from models of primordial star formation.

astro-ph;0309139	outflow-confined hii regions and the formation of massive stars by  accretion	if massive stars form by disk accretion, then bipolar outflows should begenerated as in the case of low-mass star formation. high accretion rates leadto high outflow rates and make the wind density very large near the protostar.we therefore predict that massive protostars have very small, jet-like hiiregions confined by their outflows; we identify these hii regions with"hypercompact" (&lt;0.01 pc) hii regions. their lifetime is approximately equal tothe accretion timescale (~10^5 yr), much longer than the sound-crossing anddynamical timescales of the ionized region. we present an analytic descriptionof the density distribution of the outflow, relate the overall mass loss rateto the accretion rate, and normalize to values appropriate to massiveprotostars. for a given ionizing luminosity, we calculate the extent of the hiiregion and its radio spectrum. a detailed comparison is made with observationsof radio source "i" in the orion hot core. the spectra and morphologies of manyother sources are broadly consistent with this model. we argue that confinementof ionization allows disk and equatorial accretion to continue up to highmasses, potentially overcoming a major difficulty of standard accretion models.

astro-ph;0310442	x-ray scattering halos from the galactic center: implications for  diffuse emission around sgra*	we consider the absorption and scattering of x-rays observed from thegalactic center. one objective is to characterize the intrinsic x-ray emissionfrom the central black hole, sgra*, in its quiescent and flaring states. wecorrect the fluxes observed by the chandra and xmm telescopes for absorptionand scattering, using realistic models for the dust grain size distribution,gas and dust abundances and spatial distributions. however, there are stilllarge uncertainties. since much of the intervening dust is close to sgra*, thescattered halo of x-ray photons is very concentrated: its intensity candominate the chandra psf inside 1", and so affects estimates of the pointsource flux. it also broadens the radial intensity profiles of galactic centersources - observations of this effect can help constrain models of the spatialdistribution of the dust. we estimate that the combined scattering halos fromobserved galactic center sources within 10" of sgra* contribute up to ~10% ofthe observed diffuse emission in this region. dust-scattered photons suffer atime delay relative to the photons that arrive directly. for dust that is 100pc towards us from the galactic center, this delay is about 1000 s at angles of1", and 100 ks at 10". we illustrate how the evolution of the scattering halofollowing x-ray flares from sgra* or other sources can also help to constrainthe dust's line of sight distribution. we discuss the implications of x-rayscattering halos for the intensity of diffuse emission that has been reportedwithin a few arcseconds of sgra*: in the most extreme, yet viable, model weconsider, ~1/3 of it is due to dust scattering of an unresolved source. theremainder results from an extended source of emission.

astro-ph;0401552	the becklin-neugebauer object as a runaway b star, ejected 4000 years  ago from the theta^1c system	we attempt to explain the properties of the becklin-neugebauer (bn) object asa runaway b star, as originally proposed by plambeck et al. (1995). this is oneof the best-studied bright infrared sources, located in the orion nebulacluster -- an important testing ground for massive star formation theories.  from radio observations of bn's proper motion, we trace its trajectory backto trapezium star theta^1c, the most massive (45 msun) in the cluster and arelatively tight (17 au) visual binary with a b star secondary. this originwould be the most recent known runaway b star ejection event, occurring only\~4000 yr ago and providing a unique test of models of ejection from multiplesystems of massive stars. although highly obscured, we can constrain bn's mass(~7 msun) from both its bolometric luminosity and the recoil of theta^1c.interaction of a runaway b star with dense ambient gas should produce a compactwind bow shock. we suggest that x-ray emission from this shocked gas may havebeen seen by chandra: the offset from the radio position is ~300 au in thedirection of bn's motion. given this model, we constrain the ambient density,wind mass-loss rate and wind velocity. bn made closest approach to the massiveprotostar, source ``i'', 500 yr ago. this may have triggered enhanced accretionand thus outflow, consistent with previous interpretations of the outflow beinga recent (~10^3 yr) "explosive" event.

astro-ph;0403424	the variability of gamma-ray bursts that create afterglows	we consider whether the variability properties of gamma-ray bursts (grbs)that produce bright optical and longer wavelength transient afterglows (a-grbs)are the same as a larger, inclusive sample of bright, long-duration grbs,selected only by their gamma-ray emission. this sample may include asignificant population of physically distinct ``dark'' or ``faint-afterglow''grbs with different variability properties, or may be composed of a singlepopulation, some of which lack afterglows only because of observationalselection effects. we argue that the structure function is the most appropriatemethod for measuring the variability of bursts because of their transient andaperiodic nature. we define a simple statistic: the ratio of the integratedstructure function from 0.1 to 1 s compared to that from 0.1 to 10 s, asmeasured in the observer frame. to avoid instrumental effects we restrict ouranalysis to grbs with batse data. comparing 10 a-grbs to a ``main'' sample ofabout 500 bursts, we find there is a probability of only 0.03 of the samplesbeing drawn from the same population, with the a-grbs tending to haverelatively less power on sub-second timescales. we conclude that this result istentative evidence for variations in the properties of grb progenitors thataffect both the gamma-ray and afterglow properties of long-duration grbs. inaddition, our method of analyzing variability identifies a characteristictimescale of ~1 s, below which variability is suppressed, and finds a trend ofincreased short timescale variability at higher gamma-ray energies. thelong-duration grbs that we identify as having the most sub-second timescalevariability, may be relatively bright examples of short-duration grbs.

astro-ph;0409413	star-forming accretion flows and the low luminosity nuclei of giant  elliptical galaxies	the luminosities of the centers of nearby elliptical galaxies are very lowcompared to models of thin disc accretion to their black holes at the bondirate, typically a few hundredths to a few tenths of a solar mass per year. thishas motivated models of inefficiently-radiated accretion that invoke weakelectron-ion thermal coupling, and/or inhibited accretion rates due toconvection or outflows. here we point out that even if such processes areoperating, a significant fraction of the accreting gas is prevented fromreaching the central black hole because it condenses into stars in agravitationally unstable disc. star formation occurs inside the bondi radius(typically ~100pc in giant ellipticals), but still relatively far from theblack hole in terms of schwarzschild radii. star formation depletes and heatsthe gas disc, eventually leading to a marginally stable, but much reduced,accretion flow to the black hole. we predict the presence of cold (~100k),dusty gas discs, containing clustered h-alpha emission and occasional type iisupernovae, both resulting from the presence of massive stars. star formationaccounts for several features of the m87 system: a thin disc, traced by h-alphaemission, is observed on scales of about 100pc, with features reminiscent ofspiral arms and dust lanes; the star formation rate inferred from the intensityof h-alpha emission is consistent with the bondi accretion rate of the system.star formation may therefore help suppress accretion onto the central enginesof massive ellipticals. we also discuss some implications for the fueling ofthe galactic center and quasars.

astro-ph;0606277	slow star formation in dense gas: evidence and implications	it has been known for more than 30 years that star formation in giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) is slow, in the sense that only ~1% of the gas formsstars every free-fall time. this result is entirely independent of anyparticular model of molecular cloud lifetime or evolution. here we surveyobservational data on higher density objects in the interstellar medium,including infrared dark clouds and dense molecular clumps, to determine ifthese objects form stars slowly like gmcs, or rapidly, converting a significantfraction of their mass into stars in one free-fall time. we find no evidencefor a transition from slow to rapid star formation in structures covering threeorders of magnitude in density. this has important implications for models ofstar formation, since competing models make differing predictions for thecharacteristic density at which star formation should transition from slow torapid. the data are inconsistent with models that predict that star clustersform rapidly and in free-fall collapse. magnetic- and turbulence-regulated starformation models can reproduce the observations qualitatively, and theturbulence-regulated star formation model of krumholz &amp; mckee quantitativelyreproduces the infrared-hcn luminosity correlation recently reported by gao &amp;solomon. slow star formation also implies that the process of star clusterformation cannot be one of global collapse, but must instead proceed over manyfree-fall times. this suggests that turbulence in star-forming clumps must bedriven, and that the competitive accretion mechanism does not operate intypical cluster-forming molecular clumps.

astro-ph;0610488	a search for molecular gas in the nucleus of m87 and implications for  the fueling of supermassive black holes	supermassive black holes in giant elliptical galaxies are remarkably faintgiven their expected accretion rates. this motivates models of radiativelyinefficient accretion, due to either ion-electron thermal decoupling,generation of outflows that inhibit accretion, or settling of gas to agravitationally unstable disk that forms stars in preference to feeding theblack hole. the latter model predicts the presence of cold molecular gas in athin disk around the black hole. here we report submillimeter arrayobservations of the nucleus of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 that probe 230ghz continuum and co(j=2--1) line emission. continuum emission is detected fromthe nucleus and several knots in the jet, including one that has beenundergoing flaring behavior. we estimate a conservative upper limit on the massof molecular gas within ~100pc and +-400km/s line of sight velocity of thecentral black hole of ~8x10^6msun, which includes an allowance for possiblesystematic errors associated with subtraction of the continuum. ignoring sucherrors, we have a 3 sigma sensitivity to about 3x10^6msun. in fact, thecontinuum-subtracted spectrum shows weak emission features extending up to 4sigma above the rms dispersion of the line-free channels. these may beartifacts of the continuum subtraction process. alternatively, if they areinterpreted as co emission, then the implied molecular gas mass is ~5x10^6msunspread out over a velocity range of 700km/s. these constraints on molecular gasmass are close to the predictions of the model of self-gravitating,star-forming accretion disks fed by bondi accretion (tan &amp; blackman 2005).

astro-ph;0611586	the initial cluster mass function of super star clusters in irregular  and spiral galaxies	the initial cluster mass function (icmf) is a fundamental property of starformation in galaxies. to gauge its universality, we measure and compare theicmfs in irregular and spiral galaxies. our sample of irregular galaxies isbased on 13 nearby galaxies selected from a volume-limited sample from thefifth data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the extinctions,ages, and masses were determined by comparing their u'g'i'z' magnitudes tothose generated from starburst models. completeness corrections were performedusing monte carlo simulations in which artificial clusters were inserted intoeach galaxy. we analyzed three nearby spiral galaxies with sdss data in exactlythe same way to derive their icmf based on a similar number of young, massiveclusters as the irregular galaxy icmf. we find that the icmfs of irregular andspiral galaxies for masses &gt;3x10^4 m_sun are statistically indistinguishable.for clusters more massive than 3x10^4 m_sun, the icmf of the irregular galaxiesis reasonably well fit by a power law dn(m)/dm ~ m^-a_m with a_m = 1.88 +/-0.09. similar results were obtained for the icmf of the spiral galaxy samplebut with a_m = 1.75 +/- 0.06. we discuss the implications of our result fortheories of star cluster formation: the shape of the icmf appears to beindependent of metallicity and galactic shear rate.

astro-ph;9904004	a semi-empirical model of the infra-red universe	we present a simple model of the infra-red universe, based as much aspossible on local observations. we model the luminosity and number evolution ofdisk and starburst galaxies, including the effects of dust, gas and spectralevolution. although simple, our approach is able to reproduce observations ofgalaxy number counts and the infra-red and sub-millimeter extra-galacticbackgrounds. it provides a useful probe of galaxy formation and evolution outto high redshift. the model demonstrates the significant role of the starburstpopulation and predicts high star formation rates at redshifts 3 to 4,consistent with recent extinction-corrected observations of lyman breakgalaxies. starbursting galaxies are predicted to dominate the current scubasurveys. their star formation is driven predominantly by strong tidalinteractions and mergers of galaxies. this leads to the creation of spheroidalstellar systems, which may act as the seeds for disk formation as gas infalls.we predict the present-day baryonic mass in bulges and halos is comparable tothat in disks. from observations of the extra-galactic background, the modelpredicts that the vast majority of star formation in the universe occurs atz&lt;5.

astro-ph;9906355	global star formation rates in disk galaxies and circumnuclear  starbursts from cloud collisions	we invoke star formation triggered by cloud-cloud collisions to explainglobal star formation rates of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts.previous theories based on the growth rate of gravitational perturbationsignore the dynamically important presence of magnetic fields. theories based ontriggering by spiral density waves fail to explain star formation in systemswithout such waves. furthermore, observations suggest gas and stellar diskinstabilities are decoupled. following gammie, ostriker &amp; jog (1991), the cloudcollision rate is set by the shear velocity of encounters with initial impactparameters of a few tidal radii, due to differential rotation in the disk.this, together with the effective confinement of cloud orbits to a twodimensional plane, enhances the collision rate above that for particles in athree dimensional box. we predict sigma_{sfr}(r) proportional to sigma_{gas}omega (1-0.7 beta). for constant circular velocity (beta = 0), this is inagreement with recent observations (kennicutt 1998). we predict a b-bandtully-fisher relation: l_{b} proportional to v_{circ}^{7/3}, also consistentwith observations. as additional tests, we predict enhanced star formation inregions with relatively high shear rates, and lower star formation efficienciesin clouds of higher mass.

0810.1140	a 42.3-43.6 ghz spectral survey of orion bn/kl: first detection of the  v=0 j=1-0 line from the isotopologues 29sio and 30sio	we have surveyed molecular line emission from orion bn/kl from 42.3 to 43.6ghz with the green bank telescope. sixty-seven lines were identified andascribed to 13 different molecular species. the spectrum at 7 mm is dominatedby sio, so2, ch3och3, and c2h5cn. five transitions have been detected from thesio isotopologues 28sio, 29sio, and 30sio.  we report here for the first time the spectra of the 29sio and 30sio v=0j=1-0 emission in orion bn/kl, and we show that they have double-peakedprofiles with velocity extents similar to the main isotopologue. the mainmotivation for the survey was the search of high-velocity (100-1000 km/s)outflows in the bn/kl region as traced by sio doppler components. some of theunidentified lines in principle could be high-velocity sio features, butwithout imaging data their location cannot be established.  wings of emission are present in the v=0 28sio, 29sio and 30sio profiles, andwe suggest that the v=0 emission from the three isotopologues might trace amoderately high-velocity (~30-50 km/s) component of the flows around thehigh-mass protostar source i in the orion bn/kl region.  we also confirm the 7 mm detection of a complex oxygen-bearing species,acetone (ch3coch3), which has been recently observed towards the hot core at 3mm, and we have found further indications of the presence of long cyanopolyynes(hc5n and hc7n) in the quiescent cold gas of the extended ridge.

0811.0207	star formation in disk galaxies. i. formation and evolution of giant  molecular clouds via gravitational instability and cloud collisions	we investigate the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds (gmcs)in a milky-way-like disk galaxy with a flat rotation curve. we perform a seriesof 3d adaptive mesh refinement (amr) numerical simulations that follow both theglobal evolution on scales of ~20kpc and resolve down to scales ~&lt;10pc with amultiphase atomic interstellar medium (ism). in this first study, we omit starformation and feedback, and focus on the processes of gravitational instabilityand cloud collisions and interactions. we define clouds as regions withn_h&gt;=100cm^-3 and track the evolution of individual clouds as they orbitthrough the galaxy from their birth to their eventual destruction via merger orvia destructive collision with another cloud. after ~140myr a large fraction ofthe gas in the disk has fragmented into clouds with masses ~10^6 msun and amass spectrum similar to that of galactic gmcs. the disk settles into a quasisteady state in which gravitational scattering of clouds keeps the disk nearthe threshold of global gravitational instability. the cloud collision time isfound to be a small fraction, ~1/5, of the orbital time, and this is anefficient mechanism to inject turbulence into the clouds. this helps to keepclouds only moderately gravitationally bound, with virial parameters of orderunity. many other observed gmc properties, such as mass surface density,angular momentum, velocity dispersion, and vertical distribution, can beaccounted for in this simple model with no stellar feedback.

0812.2882	mid-infrared extinction mapping of infrared dark clouds: probing the  initial conditions for massive stars and star clusters	(abridged) we use 8 micron spitzer glimpse images to make extinction maps of10 irdcs, selected to be relatively nearby and massive. the extinction mappingtechnique requires modeling the ir background intensity behind the cloud, whichis achieved by correcting for foreground emission and then interpolating fromthe surrounding regions. the correction for foreground emission can be quitelarge, thus restricting the utility of this technique to relatively nearbyclouds. we investigate three methods for the interpolation, finding systematicdifferences at about the 10% level, which, for fiducial dust models,corresponds to a mass surface density sigma = 0.013 g cm^-2, above which weconclude this extinction mapping technique attains validity. we examine theprobability distribution function of sigma in irdcs. from a qualitativecomparison with numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence, many cloudsappear to have relatively narrow distributions suggesting relatively low (&lt;5)mach numbers and/or dynamically strong magnetic fields. given cloud kinematicdistances, we derive cloud masses. rathborne, jackson &amp; simon identified coreswithin the clouds and measured their masses via mm dust emission. for 43 cores,we compare these mass estimates with those derived from our extinction mapping,finding good agreement: typically factors of &lt;~2 difference for individualcores and an average systematic offset of &lt;~10% for the adopted fiducialassumptions of each method. we find tentative evidence for a systematicvariation of these mass ratios as a function of core density, which isconsistent with models of ice mantle formation on dust grains and subsequentgrain growth by coagulation, and/or with a temperature decrease in the densestcores.
