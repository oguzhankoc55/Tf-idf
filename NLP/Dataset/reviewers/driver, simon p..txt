0904.3096	the millennium galaxy catalogue: exploring the color-concentration  bimodality via bulge-disc decomposition	we investigate the origin of the galaxy color-concentration bimodality at thebright-end of the luminosity function (m(b) - 5 log h &lt; -18 mag) with regard tothe bulge-disc nature of galaxies. via (2d) surface brightness profile modelingwith gim2d, we subdivide the local galaxy population in the millennium galaxycatalogue into one-component and two-component systems. we reveal thatone-component (elliptical and disc-only) systems define the two peaks of thegalaxy color-concentration distribution (with total stellar mass densities of0.7 +/- 0.1 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10^8 h msol mpc^-3 respectively), whiletwo-component systems contribute to both a bridging population and the red,concentrated peak (with total stellar mass densities of 1.1 +/- 0.1 and 1.8 +/-0.2 x 10^8 h msun mpc^-3 respectively). moreover, luminous, `bulge-less, reddiscs' and `disc-less, blue bulges' (blue ellipticals) are exceptionally rare(with volume-densities of 1.7 +/- 0.3 and 1.1 \pm 0.1 x 10^-4 h^3 mpc^-3respectively). finally, within the two-component population we confirm apreviously-reported correlation between bulge and disc color (with a meanoffset of only &lt;(u-r)_bulge-(u-r)_disc&gt; = 0.22 +/- 0.02 mag).

0908.2102	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the $m_{bh}$--$l_{spheroid}$ derived  supermassive black hole mass function	supermassive black hole mass estimates are derived for 1743 galaxies from themillennium galaxy catalogue using the recently revised empirical relationbetween supermassive black hole mass and the luminosity of the host spheroid.the mgc spheroid luminosities are based on $r^{1/n}$-bulge plusexponential-disc decompositions. the majority of black hole masses residebetween $10^6 m_{\odot}$ and an upper limit of $2\times10^9 m_{\odot}$. usingpreviously determined space density weights, we derive the smbh mass functionwhich we fit with a schechter-like function. integrating the black hole massfunction over $10^6&lt; m_{bh}/ m_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}$ gives a supermassive blackhole mass density of ($3.8 \pm 0.6) \times 10^5 h^{3}_{70} m_{\odot}$mpc$^{-3}$ for early-type galaxies and ($0.96 \pm 0.2) \times10^5 h^{3}_{70}m_{\odot}$ mpc$^{-3}$ for late-type galaxies. the errors are estimated frommonte carlo simulations which include the uncertainties in the $m_{bh}$--$l$relation, the luminosity of the host spheroid and the intrinsic scatter of the$m_{bh}$--$l$ relation. assuming supermassive black holes form via baryonicaccretion we find that ($0.008\pm0.002) h_{70}^{3}$ per cent of the universe'sbaryons are currently locked up in supermassive black holes. this result isconsistent with our previous estimate based on the $m_{bh}$--$n$ (s{\'e}rsicindex) relation.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

1002.3788	the ugrizyjhk luminosity distributions and densities from the combined  mgc, sdss and ukidss las datasets	we combine data from the mgc, sdss and ukidss las surveys to produceugrizyjhk luminosity functions and densities from within a common, low redshiftvolume (z&lt;0.1, ~71,000 h_1^-3 mpc^3 for l* systems) with 100 per centspectroscopic completeness. in the optical the fitted schechter functions arecomparable in shape to those previously reported values but with highernormalisations (typically 0, 30, 20, 15, 5 per cent higher phi*-values in u, g,r, i, z respectively over those reported by the sdss team). we attribute theseto differences in the redshift ranges probed, incompleteness, and adoptednormalisation methods. in the nir we find significantly different schechterfunction parameters (mainly in the m* values) to those previously reported andattribute this to the improvement in the quality of the imaging data overprevious studies. this is the first homogeneous measurement of theextragalactic luminosity density which fully samples both the optical andnear-ir regimes. unlike previous compilations that have noted a discontinuitybetween the optical and near-ir regimes our homogeneous dataset shows a smoothcosmic spectral energy distribution (csed). after correcting for dustattenuation we compare our csed to the expected values based on recentconstraints on the cosmic star-formation history and the initial mass function.

1005.2538	quantifying cosmic variance	we determine an expression for the cosmic variance of any "normal" galaxysurvey based on examination of m* +/- 1 mag galaxies in the sdss dr7 data cube.we find that cosmic variance will depend on a number of factors principally:total survey volume, survey aspect ratio, and whether the area surveyed iscontiguous or comprised of independent sight-lines. as a rule of thumb cosmicvariance falls below 10% once a volume of 10^7h_0.7^-3mpc^3 is surveyed for asingle contiguous region with a 1:1 aspect ratio. cosmic variance will be lowerfor higher aspect ratios and/or non-contiguous surveys. extrapolating outsideour test region we infer that cosmic variance in the entire sdss dr7 mainsurvey region is ~7% to z &lt; 0.1. the equation obtained from the sdss dr7 regioncan be generalised to estimate the cosmic variance for any density measurementdetermined from normal galaxies (e.g., luminosity densities, stellar massdensities and cosmic star-formation rates) within the volume range 10^3 to 10^7h^-3_0.7mpc^3. we apply our equation to show that 2 sightlines are required toensure cosmic variance is &lt;10% in any askap galaxy survey (divided into dz ~0.1intervals, i.e., ~1 gyr intervals for z &lt;0.5). likewise 10 meerkat sightlineswill be required to meet the same conditions. gama, vvds, and zcosmos allsuffer less than 10% cosmic variance (~3%-8%) in dz intervals of 0.1, 0.25, and0.5 respectively. finally we show that cosmic variance is potentially at the50-70% level, or greater, in the hst ultra deep field depending on assumptionsas to the evolution of clustering. 100 or 10 independent sightlines will berequired to reduce cosmic variance to a manageable level (&lt;10%) for hst acs orhst wfc3 surveys respectively (in dz ~ 1 intervals). cosmic variance istherefore a significant factor in the z&gt;6 hst studies currently underway.

1009.0615	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): fuv, nuv, ugrizyjhk petrosian, kron and  s\`ersic photometry	in order to generate credible 0.1-2 {\mu}m seds, the gama project requiresmany gigabytes of imaging data from a number of instruments to be re-processedinto a standard format. in this paper we discuss the software infrastructure weuse, and create self-consistent ugrizyjhk photometry for all sources within thegama sample. using ukidss and sdss archive data, we outline the pre-processingnecessary to standardise all images to a common zeropoint, the steps taken tocorrect for seeing bias across the dataset, and the creation of gigapixel-scalemosaics of the three 4x12 deg gama regions in each filter. from these mosaics,we extract source catalogues for the gama regions using elliptical kron andpetrosian matched apertures. we also calculate s\'ersic magnitudes for allgalaxies within the gama sample using sigma, a galaxy component modellingwrapper for galfit 3. we compare the resultant photometry directly, and alsocalculate the r band galaxy lf for all photometric datasets to highlight theuncertainty introduced by the photometric method. we find that (1) changing theobject detection threshold has a minor effect on the best-fitting schechterparameters of the overall population (m* +/- 0.055mag, {\alpha} +/- 0.014,{\phi}* +/- 0.0005 h^3 mpc^{-3}). (2) an offset between datasets that use kronor petrosian photometry regardless of the filter. (3) the decision to usecircular or elliptical apertures causes an offset in m* of 0.20mag. (4) thebest-fitting schechter parameters from total-magnitude photometric systems(such as sdss modelmag or s\'ersic magnitudes) have a steeper faint-end slopethan photometry dependent on kron or petrosian magnitudes. (5) our universe'stotal luminosity density, when calculated using kron or petrosian r-bandphotometry, is underestimated by at least 15%.

1101.5187	the galex-sdss nuv &amp; fuv flux density and local star-formation rate	we calculate the local uv flux density in the galex mis fuv and nuv bandsusing redshifts provided by sdss dr7. luminosity functions are calculated forthe overlapping mis and sdss sample, allowing flux densities to be measured andthe local star formation rate (sfr) to be calculated using volumes much largerthan previous fuv based estimates. we calculate flux densities for a dustcorrected low redshift (0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1) sample of f[fuv] = 22.24 \pm 3.13\times 10^25 h ergs s^-1 hz^-1 mpc^-3, f[nuv] = 38.54 \pm 5.30 \times 10^25 hergs s^-1 hz^-1 mpc^-3. the star formation rate density found is0.0312\pm0.0045 h m\odot yr^-1 mpc^-3. this is larger than published ratesrecently found using the uv implied sfr, though the major discrepancy is thecorrection made for dust attenuation and once this is dealt with consistentlythe results agree well. these values are also consistent with recent halphaderived sfrs. once cosmic variance is taken into account most of the recentsfrs at low redshift (z &lt; 0.3) found in the literature can be brought intoagreement, however the lowest redshift values (z &lt; 0.045) do appear to besignificantly lower.

1110.1275	the near-ir $m_{bh}$ - l and $m_{bh}$ - n relations	we present near-ir surface photometry (2d-profiling) for a sample of 29nearby galaxies for which super-massive black hole (smbh) masses areconstrained. the data is derived from the ukidss-lass survey representing asignificant improvement in image quality and depth over previous studies basedon 2mass data. we derive the spheroid luminosity and spheroid s\'ersic indexfor each galaxy with galfit3 and use these data to construct smbh mass -bulgeluminosity ($m_{\rm bh}$--$l$) and smbh - s\'ersic index ($m_{\rm bh}$--$n$)relations. the best fit k-band relation for elliptical and disk galaxies is$\log(m_{\rm bh}/m_{\odot})= -0.36(\pm 0.03) (m_{\rm k} + 18) + 6.17(\pm 0.16)$with an intrinsic scatter of 0.4$^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$dex whilst for ellipticalgalaxies we find $\log(m_{\rm bh}/m_{\odot})= -0.42(\pm 0.06) (m_{\rm k} + 22)+ 7.5(\pm 0.15)$ with an intrinsic scatter of 0.31$^{+0.087}_{-0.047}$dex. ourrevised $m_{\rm bh}$--$l$ relation agrees closely with the previous near-irconstraint by \citet{tex:g07}. the lack of improvement in the intrinsic scatterin moving to higher quality near-ir data suggests that the smbh relations arenot currently limited by the quality of the imaging data but is eitherintrinsic or a result of uncertainty in the precise number of requiredcomponents required in the profiling process. contrary to expectation (see\citealt{tex:gd07a}) a relation between smbh mass and the s\'ersic index wasnot found at near-ir wavelengths. this latter outcome is believed to beexplained by the generic inconsistencies between 1d and 2d galaxy profilingwhich are currently under further investigation.

0704.0316	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the local supermassive black hole mass  function in early- and late-type galaxies	we provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass functionusing (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and thesersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured(spheroid) sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the millennium galaxycatalogue. the observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike. we have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass functionwith a schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxysample. considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than m_b = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 m_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} m_sun mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} m_sun mpc^{-3}. theuncertainties are derived from monte carlo simulations which includeuncertainties in the m_bh-n relation, the catalogue of sersic indices, thegalaxy weights and malmquist bias. the combined, cosmological, supermassiveblack hole mass density is thus omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.that is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up insupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.

1212.3332	megamorph - multi-wavelength measurement of galaxy structure: complete  s\'ersic profile information from modern surveys	in this paper, we demonstrate a new method for fitting galaxy profiles whichmakes use of the full multi-wavelength data provided by modern largeoptical-near-infrared imaging surveys. we present a new version of galapagos,which utilises a recently-developed multi-wavelength version of galfit, andenables the automated measurement of wavelength dependent s\'ersic profileparameters for very large samples of galaxies. our new technique is extensivelytested to assess the reliability of both pieces of software, galfit andgalapagos on both real ugrizy jhk imaging data from the gama survey andsimulated data made to the same specifications. we find that fitting galaxylight profiles with multi-wavelength data increases the stability and accuracyof the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningfulmulti-wavelength photometry than has been available previously. the improvementis particularly significant for magnitudes in low s/n bands and for structuralparameters like half-light radius re and s\'ersic index n for which a prior isused by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function ofwavelength. this allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxiesfor which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. the techniqueutilises a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creatingmore physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allowsaccurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-framevalues.

1301.0979	two-phase galaxy evolution: the cosmic star-formation histories of  spheroids and discs	from two very simple axioms: (1) that agn activity traces spheroid formation,and (2) that the cosmic star-formation history is dominated by spheroidformation at high redshift, we derive simple expressions for the star-formationhistories of spheroids and discs, and their implied metal enrichment histories.  adopting a baldry-glazebrook initial mass function we use these relations andapply pegase.2 to predict the z=0 cosmic spectral energy distributions (cseds)of spheroids and discs. the model predictions compare favourably to thedust-corrected csed recently reported by the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)team from the fuv through to the k band. the model also provides a reasonablefit to the total stellar mass contained within spheroid and disc structures asrecently reported by the millennium galaxy catalogue team. three interestinginferences can be made following our axioms: (1) there is a transition redshiftat z ~ 1.7 at which point the universe switches from what we refer to as "hotmode evolution" (i.e., spheroid formation/growth via mergers and/or collapse)to what we term "cold mode evolution" (i.e., disc formation/growth via gasinfall and minor mergers); (2) there is little or no need for anypre-enrichment prior to the main phase of star-formation; (3) in the presentuniverse mass-loss is fairly evenly balanced with star-formation holding theintegrated stellar mass density close to a constant value.  the model provides a simple prediction of the energy output from spheroid anddisc projenitors, the build-up of spheroid and disc mass, and the meanmetallicity enrichment of the universe.

1407.7555	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): stellar mass functions by hubble type	we present an estimate of the galaxy stellar mass function and its divisionby morphological type in the local (0.025 &lt; z &lt; 0.06) universe. adopting robustmorphological classifications as previously presented (kelvin et al.) for asample of 3,727 galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly survey, wedefine a local volume and stellar mass limited sub-sample of 2,711 galaxies toa lower stellar mass limit of m = 10^9.0 m_sun. we confirm that the galaxystellar mass function is well described by a double schechter function given bym* = 10^10.64 m_sun, {\alpha}1 = -0.43, {\phi}*1 = 4.18 dex^-1 mpc^-3,{\alpha}2 = -1.50 and {\phi}*2 = 0.74 dex^-1 mpc^-3. the constituentmorphological-type stellar mass functions are well sampled above our lowerstellar mass limit, excepting the faint little blue spheroid population ofgalaxies. we find approximately 71+3-4% of the stellar mass in the localuniverse is found within spheroid dominated galaxies; ellipticals and s0-sas.the remaining 29+4-3% falls predominantly within late type disk dominatedsystems, sab-scds and sd-irrs. adopting reasonable bulge-to-total ratiosimplies that approximately half the stellar mass today resides in spheroidalstructures, and half in disk structures. within this local sample, we findapproximate stellar mass proportions for e : s0-sa : sab-scd : sd-irr of 34 :37 : 24 : 5.

1409.1358	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): refining the local galaxy merger rate  using morphological information	we use the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey to measure the localuniverse mass dependent merger fraction and merger rate using galaxy pairs andthe cas structural method, which identifies highly asymmetric merger candidategalaxies. our goals are to determine which types of mergers produce highlyasymmetrical galaxies, and to provide a new measurement of the local galaxymajor merger rate. we examine galaxy pairs at stellar mass limits down to$m_{*} = 10^{8}m_{\odot}$ with mass ratios of $&lt;$100:1 and line of sightvelocity differences of $\delta v&lt;500$ km s$^{-1}$. we find a significantincrease in mean asymmetries for projected separations less than the sum of theindividual galaxy's petrosian 90 radii. for systems in major merger pairs withmass ratios of $&lt;$4:1 both galaxies in the pair show a strong increase inasymmetry, while in minor merger systems (with mass ratios of $&gt;$4:1) the lowermass companion becomes highly asymmetric, while the larger galaxy is much lessaffected. the fraction of highly asymmetric paired galaxies which have a majormerger companion is highest for the most massive galaxies and dropsprogressively with decreasing mass. we calculate that the mass dependent majormerger fraction is fairly constant at $\sim1.3-2\%$ between$10^{9.5}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$, and increases to $\sim4\%$ at lowermasses. when the observability time scales are taken into consideration, themajor merger rate is found to approximately triple over the mass range weconsider. the total co-moving volume major merger rate over the range$10^{8.0}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$ is $(1.2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-3}$$h^{3}_{70}$ mpc$^{-3}$ gyr$^{-1}$.

1409.4681	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the dependence of the galaxy luminosity  function on environment, redshift and colour	we use 80922 galaxies in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey tomeasure the galaxy luminosity function (lf) in different environments over theredshift range 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.26. the depth and size of gama allows us to definesamples split by colour and redshift to measure the dependence of the lf onenvironment, redshift and colour. we find that the lf varies smoothly withoverdensity, consistent with previous results, with little environmentaldependent evolution over the last 3 gyrs. the modified galform modelpredictions agree remarkably well with our lfs split by environment,particularly in the most overdense environments. the lfs predicted by the modelfor both blue and red galaxies are consistent with gama for the environmentsand luminosities at which such galaxies dominate. discrepancies between themodel and the data seen in the faint end of the lf suggest too many faint redgalaxies are predicted, which is likely to be due to the over-quenching ofsatellite galaxies. the excess of bright blue galaxies predicted in underdenseregions could be due to the implementation of agn feedback not beingsufficiently effective in the lower mass halos.

1411.6355	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mass-size relations of z$&lt;$0.1 galaxies  subdivided by s\'ersic index, colour and morphology	we use data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey in the redshiftrange 0.01$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.1 (8399 galaxies in $g$ to $k_s$ bands) to derive thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations for various divisions of 'early'and 'late'-type samples. we find the choice of division between early and late(i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, theadopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection ofoutliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. in particular wenote that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits($&lt;10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$) the s\'ersic index bimodality, evident for highmass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separatorof early- and late-type systems. the final set of stellar mass $-$ half-lightradius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10bands ($ugrizzyjhk_s$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-zbenchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. exploring the variation of thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlierfindings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at asmaller level than previously noted: at $10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$ bothspiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from $g$ to $k_s$(which is near linear in log wavelength). finally we note that the sizes usedin this work are derived from 2d s\'ersic light profile fitting (usinggalfit3), i.e., elliptical semi-major half light radii, improving on earlierlow-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.

astro-ph;0107553	the nature of the dwarf population in abell 868	we present the results of a study of the morphology of the dwarf galaxypopulation in abell 868, a rich, intermediate redshift (z=0.154) cluster whichhas a galaxy luminosity function with a steep faint-end slope (alpha=-1.26 +/-0.05). a statistical background subtraction method is employed to study the b-rcolour distribution of the cluster galaxies. this distribution suggests thatthe galaxies contributing to the faint-end of the measured cluster lf can besplit into three populations: dirrs with b-r&lt;1.4; des with 1.4&lt;b-r&lt;2.5; andcontaminating background giant ellipticals (ges) with b-r&gt;2.5. the remvoal ofthe contribution of the background ges from the counts only marginally lessensthe faint-end slope (alpha=-1.22 +/- 0.16). however, the removal of thecontribution of the dirrs from the counts produces a flat lf (alpha=-0.91 +/-0.16). the des and the dirrs have similar spatial distributions within thecluster except that the dirrs appear to be totally absent within a centralprojected radius of about 0.2 mpc (ho=75 km/s /mpc). the number density of bothdes and dirrs appear to fall off beyond a projected radius of about 0.35 mpc.we suggest that the de and dirr populations of a868 have been associated withthe cluster for similar timescales but that evolutionary processes such as`galaxy harassment' tend to fade the dirr galaxies while having much lesseffect on the de galaxies. the harassement would be expected to have thegreatest effect on dwarfs residing in the central parts of the cluster.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0110402	the bivariate brightness function of galaxies and a demonstration of the  impact of surface brightness selection effects on luminosity function  estimations	in this paper we fit an analytic function to the bivariate brightnessdistribution (bbd) of galaxies. it is a combination of the classical schechterfunction convolved with a gaussian distribution in surface brightness: thusincorporating the luminosity-surface brightness correlation as seen in manyrecent datasets. we fit this function to a recent measurement of the bbd basedon 45,000 galaxies from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (cross etal. 2001).  using a bbf we explore the impact of the limiting detection isophote onclassical measures of the galaxy luminosity distribution. if gaussian correctedmagnitudes are used these change to $\delta m^*_{b_j} \sim 0.38 $ mags, $\delta\phi^* \sim 11%$ and $\delta \alpha &lt; 0.01$ for $\mu_{lim,b_j}=24.0$ magarcsec$^{-2}$. hence while the faint-end slope, $\alpha$, appears fairly robustto surface brightness issues, both the $m^*$ and $\phi^*$ values are highlydependent. the range over which these parameters were seen to vary is fullyconsistent with the scatter in the published values, reproducing the range ofobserved luminosity densities ($1.1&lt;j_{b_j}&lt;2.2\times10^8h l_{\odot}$mpc$^{-3}$see cross et al. 2001). we conclude that surface brightness selection effectsare primarily responsible for this variation. after due consideration of theseeffects, we derive a value of $j_{b_j}=2.16\times10^8h l_{\odot}$mpc$^{-3}$.

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0201396	constraints on the [omega_matter-omega_lambda]-plane from elliptical  galaxy counts ?	here we present a pilot study into whether elliptical galaxy counts alone,can place a useful constraint on the omega_m - omega_lambda-plane. theelliptical galaxy counts are drawn from three surveys: the millennium galaxycatalogue (16 &gt; b_kpno &gt; 20), the b-band parallel survey (20 &gt; b_ab &gt;24) andthe hubble deep fields (23 &gt; b_ab &gt; 28). the elliptical luminosity functionused in the modeling was derived from a combination of the millennium galaxycatalogue, the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey and the sloan digitalsky survey (m_*=-19.90, phi_*=0.0019/mpc^3 and alpha =-0.75 forh_o=75km/s/mpc). we adopt a benchmark model and tweak the various inputparameters by their uncertainties to determine the impact upon the counts. wefind that if the faint-end slope of the elliptical galaxy luminosity functionis known to better than 0.1$, then over the magnitude range 16 &lt; b &lt; 23 thecounts depend most critically upon the cosmology, and can be used to place aweak constraint on the [omega_matter-omega_lambda]-plane.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

astro-ph;0503176	a concise reference to (projected) sersic r^{1/n} quantities, including  concentration, profile slopes, petrosian indices, and kron magnitudes	given the growing use of sersic's (1963, 1968) r^{1/n} model for describingthe stellar distributions in galaxies, and the lack of any single referencethat provides the various associated mathematical expressions, we haveendeavoured to compile such a resource here. we present the standard intensityprofile, and its various guises such as the luminosity, surface-brightness, andaperture-magnitude profile. expressions to transform the effective surfacebrightness into the mean effective and central surface brightness are alsogiven, as is the expression to transform between effective radii andexponential scale-lengths. we additionally provide expressions for deriving the`concentration' of an r^{1/n} profile, and two useful equations for thelogarithmic slope of the light-profile are given. petrosian radii and fluxesare also derived for a range of sersic profiles and compared with the effectiveradii and total flux. similarly, expressions to obtain kron radii and fluxesare presented as a function of the sersic index n and the number of effectiveradii sampled. illustrative figures are provided throughout. finally, thecore-sersic model, consisting of an inner power-law and an outer-sersicfunction, is presented.

astro-ph;0504287	total galaxy magnitudes and effective radii from petrosian magnitudes  and radii	petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task ofdetermining a galaxy's total light. although these magnitudes (taken here asthe flux within 2r_p, with the inverted petrosian index 1/eta(r_p)=0.2) canrepresent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside ofthe petrosian aperture (2r_p). the size of this flux deficit variesmonotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., itsconcentration. in the case of a de vaucouleurs r^{1/4} profile, the deficit is0.20 mag; for an r^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. here we providea simple method for recovering total (sersic) magnitudes from petrosianmagnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (r_90/r_50 or r_80/r_20) withinthe petrosian aperture. the corrections hold to the extent that sersic's modelprovides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. we show how theconcentration can also be used to convert petrosian radii into effectivehalf-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surfacebrightness. our technique is applied to the sdss dr2 petrosian parameters,yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and meaneffective surface brightnesses obtained from the nyu--vagc sersic r^{1/n} fitsby blanton et al. (2005). although the corrective procedure described here isspecifically applicable to the sdss dr2 and dr3, it is generally applicable toall imaging data where any petrosian index and concentration can beconstructed.

astro-ph;0508207	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: correlation with the rosat-eso flux  limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey	the rosat-eso flux limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey and the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) respectively comprise the largest, homogeneousx-ray selected cluster catalogue and completed galaxy redshift survey. in thiswork we combine these two outstanding datasets in order to study the effect ofthe large-scale cluster environment, as traced by x-ray luminosity, on theproperties of the cluster member galaxies. we measure the lx-sigma relationfrom the correlated dataset and find it to be consistent with recent resultsfound in the literature. using a sample of 19 clusters with lx&gt;=0.36*10^44 ergs^-1 in the (0.1-2.4 kev) band, and 49 clusters with lower x-ray luminosity, wefind that the fraction of early spectral type (eta&lt;=-1.4), passively-evolvinggalaxies is significantly higher in the high-lx sample within r200. we extendthe investigation to include composite bj cluster luminosity functions, andfind that the characteristic magnitude of the schechter-function fit to theearly-type luminosity function is fainter for the high-lx sample compared tothe low-lx sample (delta m*=0.58+/-0.14). this seems to be driven by a deficitof such galaxies with m_bj ~ -21. in contrast, we find no significantdifferences between the luminosity functions of star-forming, late-typegalaxies. we believe these results are consistent with a scenario in which thehigh-lx clusters are more dynamically evolved systems than the low-lx clusters.

astro-ph;0602240	the millennium galaxy catalogue: morphological classification and  bimodality in the colour-concentration plane	using 10 095 galaxies (b &lt; 20 mag) from the millennium galaxy catalogue, wederive b-band luminosity distributions and selected bivariate brightnessdistributions for the galaxy population. all subdivisions extract highlycorrelated sub-sets of the galaxy population which consistently point towardstwo overlapping distributions. a clear bimodality in the observed distributionis seen in both the rest-(u-r) colour and log(n) distributions. the rest-(u-r)colour bimodality becomes more pronounced when using the core colour as opposedto global colour. the two populations are extremely well separated in thecolour-log(n) plane. using our sample of 3 314 (b &lt; 19 mag) eyeball classifiedgalaxies, we show that the bulge-dominated, early-type galaxies populate onepeak and the bulge-less, late-type galaxies occupy the second. the early- andmid-type spirals sprawl across and between the peaks. this constitutesextremely strong evidence that the fundamental way to divide the luminousgalaxy population is into bulges and discs and that the galaxy bimodalityreflects the two component nature of galaxies and not two distinct galaxyclasses. we argue that these two-components require two independent formationmechanisms/processes and advocate early bulge formation through initialcollapse and ongoing disc formation through splashback, infall andmerging/accretion. we calculate the b-band luminosity-densities andstellar-mass densities within each subdivision and estimate that the z ~ 0stellar mass content in spheroids, bulges and discs is 35 +/- 2 per cent, 18+/- 7 and 47 +/- 7 per cent respectively.

astro-ph;0605699	the millennium galaxy catalogue: bulge/disc decomposition of 10095  nearby galaxies	we have modelled the light distribution in 10095 galaxies from the millenniumgalaxy catalogue (mgc), providing publically available structural cataloguesfor a large, representative sample of galaxies in the local universe. threedifferent models were used: (1) a single sersic function for the whole galaxy,(2) a bulge-disc decomposition model using a de vaucouleurs (r^{1/4}) bulgeplus exponential disc, (3) a bulge-disc decomposition model using a sersic(r^{1/n}) bulge plus exponential disc. repeat observations for 700 galaxiesdemonstrate that stable measurements can be obtained for object components witha half-light radius comparable to, or larger than, the seeing half-width athalf maximum. we show that with careful quality control, robust measurementscan be obtained for large samples such as the mgc. we use the catalogues toshow that the galaxy colour bimodality is due to the two-component nature ofgalaxies (i.e. bulges and discs) and not to two distinct galaxy populations. weconclude that understanding galaxy evolution demands the routine bulge-discdecomposition of the giant galaxy population at all redshifts.

astro-ph;0607378	a log-quadratic relation for predicting supermassive black hole masses  from the host bulge sersic index	we reinvestigate the correlation between black hole mass and bulgeconcentration. with an increased galaxy sample, updated estimates of galaxydistances, black hole masses, and sersic indices `n' - a measure ofconcentration - we perform a least-squares regression analysis to obtain arelation suitable for the purpose of predicting black hole masses in othergalaxies. in addition to the linear relation, log(m_bh) = 7.81(+/-0.08) +2.69(+/-0.28)[log(n/3)] with epsilon_(intrin)=0.31 dex, we investigated thepossibility of a higher order m_bh-n relation, finding the second order term inthe best-fitting quadratic relation to be inconsistent with a value of zero atgreater than the 99.99% confidence level. the optimal relation is given bylog(m_bh) = 7.98(+/-0.09) + 3.70(+/-0.46)[log(n/3)] -3.10(+/-0.84)[log(n/3)]^2, with epsilon_(intrin)=0.18 dex and a total absolutescatter of 0.31 dex. extrapolating the quadratic relation, it predicts blackholes with masses of ~10^3 m_sun in n=0.5 dwarf elliptical galaxies, comparedto ~10^5 m_sun from the linear relation, and an upper bound on the largestblack hole masses in the local universe, equal to 1.2^{+2.6}_{-0.4}x10^9m_sun}. in addition, we show that the nuclear star clusters at the centers oflow-luminosity elliptical galaxies follow an extrapolation of the samequadratic relation. moreover, we speculate that the merger of two suchnucleated galaxies, accompanied by the merger and runaway collision of theircentral star clusters, may result in the late-time formation of somesupermassive black holes. finally, we predict the existence of, and provideequations for, a relation between m_bh and the central surface brightness ofthe host bulge.

astro-ph;0609178	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the star formation histories of  luminous red galaxies	we present a detailed investigation into the recent star formation historiesof 5,697 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) based on the hdelta (4101a) and [oii](3727a) lines. lrgs are luminous (l&gt;3l*), galaxies which have been selected tohave photometric properties consistent with an old, passively evolving stellarpopulation. for this study we utilise lrgs from the recently completed 2df-sdsslrg and qso survey (2slaq). equivalent widths of the hdelta and [oii] lines aremeasured and used to define three spectral types, those with only strong hdeltaabsorption (k+a), those with strong [oii] in emission (em) and those with both(em+a). all other lrgs are considered to have passive star formation histories.the vast majority of lrgs are found to be passive (~80 per cent), howeversignificant numbers of k+a (2.7 per cent), em+a (1.2 per cent) and em lrgs (8.6per cent) are identified. an investigation into the redshift dependence of thefractions is also performed. a sample of sdss main galaxies with colours andluminosities consistent with the 2slaq lrgs is selected to provide a lowredshift comparison. while the em and em+a fractions are consistent with thelow redshift sdss sample, the fraction of k+a lrgs is found to increasesignificantly with redshift. this result is interpreted as an indication of anincreasing amount of recent star formation activity in lrgs with redshift. byconsidering the expected life time of the k+a phase, the number of lrgs whichwill undergo a k+a phase can be estimated. a crude comparison of this estimatewith the predictions from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows thatthe predicted level of k+a and em+a activity is not sufficient to reconcile thepredicted mass growth for massive early-types in a hierarchical mergingscenario.

astro-ph;0610752	the millennium galaxy catalogue: galaxy bimodality	galaxy bimodality is caused by the bulge-disc nature of galaxies as opposedto two distinct galaxy classes. this is evident in the colour-structure planewhich clearly shows that elliptical galaxies (bulge-only) lie in the redcompact peak and late-type spiral galaxies (disc-dominated) lie in the bluediffuse peak. early-type spirals (bulge plus disc systems) sprawl across bothpeaks. however after bulge-disc decomposition the bulges of early-type spiralslie exclusively in the red compact peak and their discs in the blue diffusepeak (exceptions exist but are rare, e.g., dust reddened edge-on discs and bluepseudo-bulges). movement between these two peaks is not trivial because whilstswitching off star-formation can transform colours from blue to red, modifyingthe orbits of ~1 billion stars from a planar diffuse structure to a triaxialcompact structure is problematic (essentially requiring an equal mass merger).we propose that the most plausible explanation for the dual structure ofgalaxies is that galaxy formation proceeds in two stages. first an initialcollapse phase (forming a centrally concentrated core and black hole), followedby splashback, infall and accretion (forming a planar rotating disc). dwarfsystems could perhaps follow the same scenario but the lack of low luminositybulge-disc systems would imply that the two components must rapidly blend toform a single flattened spheroidal system.

astro-ph;0701728	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the luminosity functions of bulges and  discs and their implied stellar mass densities	we derive the luminosity functions of elliptical galaxies, galaxy bulges,galaxy pseudo-bulges and galaxy discs from our structural catalogue of 10,095galaxies. in addition we compute their associated luminosity and stellar massdensities. we show that spheroidal systems (elliptical galaxies and the bulgesof disc galaxies) exhibit a strong color bimodality indicating two distincttypes of spheroid which are separated by a core color of (u-r) ~ 2 mag. weargue that the similarity of the red elliptical and the red bulge luminosityfunctions supports our previous arguments that they share a common origin andsurprisingly find that the same follows for the blue ellipticals and bluebulges, the latter of which we refer to as pseudo-bulges. in terms of thestellar mass budget we find that $58\pm6$ per cent is currently in the form ofdiscs, 39+/-6 per cent in the form of red spheroids (13+/-4 per centellipticals, 26+/-4 per cent bulges) and the remainder is in the form of bluespheroidal systems (~1.5 per cent blue ellipticals and ~1.5 per centpseudo-bulges). in terms of galaxy formation we argue that our data on galaxycomponents strongly supports the notion of a two-stage formation process(spheroid first, disc later) but with the additional complexity of secularevolution occurring in quiescent discs giving rise to two distinct bulge types:genuine 'classical' bulges and pseudo-bulges. we therefore advocate that thereare three significant structures underpinning galaxy evolution: classicalspheroids (old); pseudo-bulges (young) and discs (intermediate). the luminousnearby galaxy population is a mixture of these three structural types.[abridged].

astro-ph;9511123	the contribution of late-type/irregulars to the faint galaxy counts from  hst medium deep survey images	we present a complete morphologically classified sample of 144 faint fieldgalaxies from the hst medium deep survey with 20.0 &lt; i &lt;22.0 mag. we comparethe global properties of the ellipticals, early and late-type spirals, and finda non-negligible fraction (13/144) of compact blue [(v-i) &lt; 1.0 mag] systemswith $r^{1/4}$-profiles. we give the differential galaxy number counts forellipticals and early-type spirals independently, and find that the data areconsistent with no-evolution predictions based on conventional flat schechterluminosity functions (lf's) and a standard cosmology.  conversely, late-type/irregulars show a steeply rising differential numbercount with slope $(\frac{\delta log n}{\delta m}) = 0.64\pm 0.1$. no-evolutionmodels based on the loveday et al. (1992) and marzke et al. (1994b) {\it local}luminosity functions under-predict the late-type/irregular counts by 1.0 and0.5 dex, respectively, at i = 21.75 mag. examination of the irregulars aloneshows that $\sim 50$% appear inert and the remainder have multiple cores. ifthe inert galaxies represent a non-evolving late-type population, then aloveday-like lf ($\alpha\simeq -1.0$) is ruled out for these types, and a lfwith a steep faint-end ($\alpha\simeq -1.5$) is suggested. if multiple corestructure indicates recent star-formation, then the observed excess of faintblue field galaxies is likely due to {\it evolutionary} processes acting on a{\it steep} field lf for late-type/irregulars. the evolutionary mechanism isunclear, but 60% of the multiple-core irregulars show close companions. toreconcile a marzke-like lf with the faint redshift surveys, this evolution mustbe preferentially occurring in the brightest late-type galaxies with z &gt; 0.5 ati = 21.75 mag.

astro-ph;9511132	the morphological mix of field galaxies to i=24.25 magnitudes (b=26  magnitudes) from a deep hubble space telescope wfpc2 image	we determine the morphological mix of field galaxies down to $m_{i}\simeq24.25$ mag ($m_{b}\sim 26.0$ mag) from a single ultradeep hst wfpc2 image inboth the $v_{606}$ and $i_{814}$ filters. in total, we find 227 objects with$m_{i}\le 24.5$ mag and classify these into three types: ellipticals (16%),early-type spirals (37%) and late-type spirals/irregulars (47%). thedifferential number counts for each type are compared to simple models in astandard flat cosmology. we find that both the elliptical and early-type spiralnumber counts are well described by {\it little or no}-evolution models, butonly when normalized at $b_{j} = 18.0$ mag. given the uncertainties in theluminosity function (lf) normalization, both populations are consistent with amild evolutionary scenario based on a normal/low rate of star-formation. thisconstrains the end of the last {\it major} star-formation epoch in the giantgalaxy populations to $z\geq 0.8$.  conversely, the density of the observed late-type/irregular population isfound to be a factor of 10 in excess of the conventional no-evolution model.this large population might be explained by either a modified {\it local}dwarf-rich lf, and/or strong evolution acting on the {\it local} lf. for thedwarf-rich case, a {\it steep} faint-end schechter-slope ($\alpha\simeq -1.8$)is required plus a five-fold increase in the dwarf normalization. for a purelyevolving model based on a {\it flat} loveday {\it et al.} (1992) lf($\alpha\simeq -1.0$), a ubiquitous starburst of $\delta i\sim$2.0 mag isneeded at z$\simeq 0.5$ for the {\it entire} late-type population. we argue fora combination of these possibilities, and show that for a steep marzke {\it etal.} (1994) lf ($\alpha\simeq -1.5$), a starburst of $\sim$ 1.3 mag is required

astro-ph;9511141	hubble space telescope counts of elliptical galaxies: constraints on  cosmological models ?	the interpretation of galaxy number counts in terms of cosmological models isfraught with difficulty due to uncertainties in the overall galaxy population(mix of morphological types, luminosity functions etc.) and in the observations(loss of low surface brightness images, image blending etc.). many of these canbe overcome if we use deep high resolution imaging of a single class of highsurface brightness galaxies, whose evolution is thought to be fairly wellunderstood. this is now possible by selecting elliptical and s0 galaxies usinghubble space telescope images from the medium deep survey and other ultradeepwfpc2 images. in the present paper, we examine whether such data can be used todiscriminate between open and closed universes, or between conventionalcosmological models and those dominated by a cosmological constant. we find,based on the currently available data, that unless elliptical galaxies undergovery strong merging since $z \sim 1$ (and/or very large errors exist in themorphological classifications), then flat models dominated by a cosmologicalconstant are ruled out. however, both an einstein-de sitter ($\omega_{0}=1$)model with standard passive stellar evolution and an open ($\omega_{0}=0.05$)model with no net evolution ({\it i.e.} cancelling stellar and dynamicalevolution) predict virtually identical elliptical and s0 galaxy counts.  based on these findings and the recent reportings of $h_{o} \simeq 80$ km/smpc/s, we find that the maximum acceptable age of the universe is 13.3 gyrs anda value of $\leq 9$ gyrs favored. a flat---$\lambda \neq 0$---universe istherefore {\it not} a viable solution to the $h_{o}$/globular cluster ageproblem.

astro-ph;9605048	the inferred redshift distribution of the faint blue excess	we infer the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxy excess (fbe) atb=23.5 by subtracting the predicted distribution of giant/normal galaxies fromthe observed n(z) distribution for all types. this is possible because of therecent deep {\it hubble space telescope} (hst) wfpc2 morphological numbercounts which have convincingly demonstrated that little evolution of the giantpopulation is seen to b=26.0. the mean redshift of the fbe at b=23.5 is foundto be &lt;z&gt;_{fbe}=0.40 +/- 0.07 with upper and lower quartiles defined byz_{0.75}=0.58 +/- 0.05 and z_{0.25}=0.28 +/- 0.05, respectively.  we compare this inferred fbe n(z) distribution to the predictions from threegeneric faint galaxy models: dwarf dominated (no evolution), pure luminosityevolution, and evolving dwarfs. the inferred fbe n(z) distribution stronglysupports a hybrid evolving dwarf--rich model wherein a large population ofdwarfs present at z=0.5 has subsequently faded to obscurity. the totalintegrated number density of dwarfs (down to m_{b}=-11) is estimated to be afactor of 20 times greater than that of e---sc galaxies and the estimatedfading to be 1.0 &lt; \delta m &lt; 1.4 mags. thus, the dwarf population is estimatedto be responsible for ~30% of the luminosity density locally, rising to ~57% atz=0.5.

astro-ph;9704170	luminosity distributions within rich clusters - i: a ubiquitous  dwarf-rich luminosity function ?	from deep ccd observations of the cluster abell 2554 we have recovered thecluster's luminosity distribution over a wide range of magnitude (-24 &lt; m(r) &lt;-16). we compare the derived a2554 cluster luminosity function (at redshift0.1) with that of the local coma cluster (a1656) and the more distant (z = 0.2)cluster a963. the distribution is remarkably similar for these three clustersof comparable richness and morphology. all show a flat (\alpha = -1.0)luminosity function for the giant galaxies (-24 &lt; m(r) &lt; -19.5) which exhibitsa sharp upturn (\alpha = -1.7) at some intermediate magnitude (m(r) = -19) andcontinues to rise to the limits of existing data. we suggest that such aluminosity function may be ubiquitous among rich clusters and that a similarform may apply for poorer clusters and possibly the field as well. the threecluster dwarf lfs are seen over a range of lookback times covering a quarter ofthe age of the universe. therefore the similarity between the three measuredlfs seems to rule out strong evolution of the dwarf populations in rich clusterenvironments, at least out to z = 0.2, unless richness effects conspire toconceal evolutionary changes.

astro-ph;9809190	luminosity distributions within rich clusters - ii: demonstration and  verification via simulation	we present detailed simulations of long exposure ccd images. the simulationsare used to explore the validity of the statistical method for reconstructingthe luminosity distribution of galaxies within a rich cluster i.e. by thesubtraction of field number-counts from those of a sight-line through thecluster. in particular we use the simulations to establish the reliability ofour observational data presented in paper 3. based on our intended ccdfield-of-view (6.5 by 6.5 arcmins) and a 1-sigma detection limit of 26 mags persq arcsecond, we conclude that the luminosity distribution can be robustlydetermined over a wide range of absolute magnitude (-23 &lt; m_{r} &lt; -16)provided:  (a) the cluster has an abell richness 1.5 or greater,  (b) the cluster's redshift lies in the range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3,  (c) the seeing is better than fwhm 1.25'' and  (d) the photometric zero points are accurate to within delta m = \pm 0.12.  if these conditions are not met then the recovered luminosity distribution isunreliable and potentially grossly miss-leading. finally although the methodclearly has limitations, within these limitations the technique represents anextremely promising probe of galaxy evolution and environmental dependencies.
