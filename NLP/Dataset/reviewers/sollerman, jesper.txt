0902.0609	the he-rich core-collapse supernova 2007y: observations from x-ray to  radio wavelengths	a detailed study spanning approximately a year has been conducted on the typeib supernova 2007y. imaging was obtained from x-ray to radio wavelengths, and acomprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u'g'r'i'ubvyjhks) light curves andoptical spectroscopy is presented. a virtually complete bolometric light curveis derived, from which we infer a (56)ni-mass of 0.06 m_sun. the early spectrumstrongly resembles sn 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of caii andh_alpha; during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of a ejecta-windinteraction. nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit profilesthat indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. late phase spectra aremodeled with a non-lte code, from which we find (56)ni, o and total-ejectamasses (excluding he) to be 0.06, 0.2 and 0.42 m_sun, respectively, below 4,500km/s. the (56)ni mass confirms results obtained from the bolometric lightcurve. the oxygen abundance suggests the progenitor was most likely a ~3.3m_sun he core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10-13m_sun. the explosion energy is determined to be ~10^50 erg, and the mass-lossrate of the progenitor is constrained from x-ray and radio observations to be&lt;~10^-6 m_sun/yr. sn 2007y is among the least energetic normal type ibsupernovae ever studied.

0904.3737	dust and the type ii-plateau supernova 2004et	we present mid-infrared (mir) observations of the type ii-plateau supernova(sn) 2004et, obtained with the {\it spitzer space telescope} between days 64and 1406 past explosion. late-time optical spectra are also presented. for theperiod 300-795 days past explosion, we argue that the spectral energydistribution of sn 2004et comprises (a) a hot component due to emission fromoptically thick gas, as well as free-bound radiation, (b) a warm component dueto newly formed, radioactively heated dust in the ejecta, and (c) a coldcomponent due to an ir echo from the interstellar-medium dust of the hostgalaxy, ngc 6946. there may also have been a small contribution to the ir seddue to free-free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta. we reveal thefirst-ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of asupernova. this is supported by our detection of a large, but progressivelydeclining, mass of sio. however, we conclude that the mass of directly detectedejecta dust grew to no more than a few times 10^(-4)msun. we also provideevidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. we arguethat, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shapedoptical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitorcircumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shellwas responsible for a later rise in the mir flux. this study demonstrates therich, multi-faceted ways in which a typical core-collapse supernova and itsprogenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains. the work presentedhere adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contentionthat sne are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high-redshiftgalaxies.

0906.2065	optical and infrared observations of the crab pulsar and its nearby knot	we study the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the crab pulsar and itsnearby knot in the optical and in the infrared (ir) regime.  we present high-quality ubvriz, as well as adaptive optics jhk_sl'photometry, achieved under excellent conditions with the fors1 and naos/conicainstruments at the vlt. we combine these data with re-analyzed archival spitzerspace telescope data to construct a sed for the pulsar, and quantify thecontamination from the knot. we have also gathered optical imaging data from1988 to 2008 from several telescopes in order to examine the predicted seculardecrease in luminosity.  for the crab pulsar sed we find a spectral slope of alpha_nu = 0.27+-0.03 inthe optical/near-ir regime, when we exclude the contribution from the knot. forthe knot itself, we find a much redder slope of alpha_nu = -1.3 +- 0.1. ourbest estimate of the average decrease in luminosity for the pulsar is 2.9+-1.6mmag per year. we have demonstrated the importance of the nearby knot inprecision measurements of the crab pulsar sed, in particular in the near-ir. wehave scrutinized the evidence for the traditional view of a synchrotronself-absorption roll-over in the infrared, and find that these claims areunfounded. we also find evidence for a secular decrease in the optical lightfor the crab pulsar, in agreement with current pulsar spin-down models.however, although our measurements of the decrease significantly improve onprevious investigations, the detection is still tentative. we finally point tofuture observations that can improve the situation significantly.

0908.4274	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  hubble diagram and cosmological parameters	we present measurements of the hubble diagram for 103 type ia supernovae(sne) with redshifts 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.42, discovered during the first season (fall2005) of the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey. these datafill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift sn ia surveys. wecombine the sdss-ii measurements with new distance estimates for published sndata from the essence survey, the supernova legacy survey, the hubble spacetelescope, and a compilation of nearby sn ia measurements. combining the snhubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the sdssluminous red galaxy sample and with cmb temperature anisotropy measurementsfrom wmap, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and omega_m, assuming aspatially flat cosmological model (fwcdm) with constant dark energy equation ofstate parameter, w. for the fwcdm model and the combined sample of 288 sne ia,we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), omega_m = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat)+- 0.023(syst) using mlcs2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), omega_m= 0.265 +- 0.016(stat) +- 0.025(syst) using the salt-ii fitter. we trace thediscrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame uv modelcombined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; thesedifferences mostly affect the distance estimates for the snls and hstsupernovae. we present detailed discussions of systematic errors for bothlight-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies inrest-frame $u$-band. for the salt-ii approach, we also see strong evidence forredshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). restricting theanalysis to the 136 sne ia in the nearby+sdss-ii samples, we find much betteragreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.

0910.5597	type ii-p supernovae from the sdss-ii supernova survey and the  standardized candle method	we apply the standardized candle method (scm) for type ii plateau supernovae(sne ii-p), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a sn to its luminosityduring the plateau, to 15 sne ii-p discovered over the three season run of thesloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey. the redshifts of these sne -0.027 &lt; z &lt; 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;in particular, our sne ii-p sample contains nearly as many sne in the hubbleflow (z &gt; 0.01) as all of the current literature on the scm combined. we findthat the sdss sne have a very small intrinsic i-band dispersion (0.22 mag),which can be attributed to selection effects. when the scm is applied to thecombined sdss-plus-literature set of sne ii-p, the dispersion increases to 0.29mag, larger than the scatter for either set of sne separately. we show that thestandardization cannot be further improved by eliminating sne with positiveplateau decline rates, as proposed in poznanski et al. (2009). we thoroughlyexamine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the scm to beuseful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the fe iivelocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompassthe intrinsic variations of type ii-p sne will be needed.

0911.5484	nebular spectra and explosion asymmetry of type ia supernovae	the spectral signatures of asymmetry in type ia supernova (sn ia) explosionsare investigated, using a sample of late-time nebular spectra. first, akinematical model is constructed for sn ia 2003hv, which can account for themain features in its optical, near-infrared (nir), and mid-infrared (mid-ir)late-time spectra. it is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explainthe observed characteristics of sn 2003hv. this model includes a relativelyhigh density, fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and arelatively low density, extended 56ni-rich region which is more sphericallydistributed. the high density region consists of the inner stable fe-ni regionand outer 56ni-rich region. such a distribution may be the result of adelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces theglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation canlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. this configuration, if viewed from thedirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of theemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in sn 2003hv. forthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and theimplications for sne ia in general. the model predicts that a variation of thecentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in somelines (e.g., [ni ii]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [fe iii] blend at4700a) will not show this effect. by examining optical nebular spectra of 12sne ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists. we suggest that theglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, as likely imprint of the deflagrationflame propagation, is a generic feature of sne ia (abridged).

1001.3428	the rise and fall of type ia supernova light curves in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we analyze the rise and fall times of type ia supernova (sn ia) light curvesdiscovered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. from a set of 391 light curvesk-corrected to the rest frame b and v bands, we find a smaller dispersion inthe rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. this is inqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations inradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of thedecline rates. the differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggestthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properlymodel the range of sn ia light curve shapes. we select a subset of 105 lightcurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves anddevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall timesindependently. we find the average time from explosion to b-band peakbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. our average rise time is shorter than the19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different lightcurve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. we findthat slow declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that thedistribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single-peaked. thisdistribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was firstsuggested by strovink (2007) from an analysis of a small set of local sne ia.we divide the sdss-ii sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, tr-tf&lt;= 2 days and tr-tf&gt;2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxyproperties and hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxyproperties or hubble residuals in our sample.

1001.4995	measurements of the rate of type ia supernovae at redshift z &lt; ~0.3 from  the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) ratebased on data from the sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey.the adopted sample of supernovae (sne) includes 516 sne ia at redshift z\lesssim 0.3, of which 270 (52%) are spectroscopically identified as sne ia.the remaining 246 sne ia were identified through their light curves; 113 ofthese objects have spectroscopic redshifts from spectra of their host galaxy,and 133 have photometric redshifts estimated from the sn light curves. based onconsideration of 87 spectroscopically confirmed non-ia sne discovered by thesdss-ii sn survey, we estimate that 2.04+1.61-0.95 % of the photometric sne iamay be misidentified. the sample of sne ia used in this measurement representsan order of magnitude increase in the statistics for sn ia rate measurements inthe redshift range covered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. if we assume a snia rate that is constant at low redshift (z &lt; 0.15), then the sn observationscan be used to infer a value of the sn rate of rv = (2.69+0.34+0.21-0.30-0.01)x10^{-5} sne yr^{-1} mpc-3 (h0 /(70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}))^{3} at a mean redshiftof ~ 0.12, based on 79 sne ia of which 72 are spectroscopically confirmed.however, the large sample of sne ia included in this study allows us to placeconstraints on the redshift dependence of the sn ia rate based on the sdss-iisupernova survey data alone. fitting a power-law model of the sn rateevolution, r_v(z) = a_p x ((1 + z)/(1 + z0))^{\nu}, over the redshift range 0.0&lt; z &lt; 0.3 with z0 = 0.21, results in a_p = (3.43+0.15-0.15) x 10^{-5} sneyr^{-1} mpc-3 (h0 /(70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}))^{3} and \nu = 2.04+0.90-0.89.

1005.4687	the effect of host galaxies on type ia supernovae in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we present an analysis of the host galaxy dependencies of type ia supernovae(sne ia) from the full three year sample of the sdss-ii supernova survey. werediscover, to high significance, the strong correlation between host galaxytypeand the width of the observed sn light curve, i.e., fainter, quicklydeclining sne ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly decliningia's favor star-forming galaxies. we also find evidence (at between 2 to 3sigma) that sne ia are ~0.1 magnitudes brighter in passive host galaxies, thanin star-forming hosts, after the sn ia light curves have been standardizedusing the light curve shape and color variations: this difference in brightnessis present in both the salt2 and mcls2k2 light curve fitting methodologies. wesee evidence for differences in the sn ia color relationship between passiveand star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the mlcs2k2 technique, we see thatsne ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of r_v ~1, while sne ia instar-forming hosts require r_v ~2. the significance of these trends depends onthe range of sn colors considered. we demonstrate that these effects can beparameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a confidence of&gt;4 sigma) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical fitto our data. our results suggest that future cosmological analyses of sn iasamples should include host galaxy information.

1010.2749	a mismatch in the ultraviolet spectra between low-redshift and  intermediate-redshift type ia supernovae as a possible systematic uncertainty  for supernova cosmology	we present keck high-quality rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) through opticalspectra of 21 type ia supernovae (sne ia) in the redshift range 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.37and a mean redshift of 0.22 that were discovered during the sloan digital skysurvey-ii (sdss-ii) sn survey. using the broad-band photometry of the sdsssurvey, we are able to reconstruct the sn host-galaxy spectral energydistributions (seds), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxycontamination in the sn ia spectra. comparison of composite spectra constructedfrom a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from alow-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the keck/sdsssne ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but showa uv flux excess. this observation is confirmed by comparing synthesizedbroad-band colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in meancolors at the 2.4 - 4.4 sigma level for various uv colors. we further see aslight difference in the uv spectral shape between sne with low-mass andhigh-mass host galaxies. additionally, we detect a relationship between theflux ratio at 2770 and 2900 a and peak luminosity that differs from thatobserved at low redshift. we find that changing the uv sed of an sn ia withinthe observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag.this effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame uv. we suggest thatthis discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population ofthe two sn samples or to small-sample statistics.

1012.2912	the effect of peculiar velocities on supernova cosmology	we present an analysis of peculiar velocities and their effect on supernovacosmology. in particular, we study (a) the corrections due to our own motion,(b) the effects of correlations in peculiar velocities induced by large-scalestructure, and (c) uncertainties arising from a possible local under- orover-density. for all of these effects we present a case study of their impacton the cosmology derived by the sloan digital sky survey-ii supernova survey(sdss-ii sn survey). correcting supernova redshifts for the cmb dipole slightlyover-corrects nearby supernovae that share some of our local motion. we showthat while neglecting the cmb dipole would cause a shift in the derivedequation of state of delta w ~ 0.04 (at fixed matter density) the additionallocal-motion correction is currently negligible (delta w&lt;0.01). we use acovariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiarvelocities. this down-weights nearby supernovae and effectively acts as agraduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. neglecting coherentvelocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of ~2% in thepreferred value of w and will therefore have to be considered carefully whenfuture surveys aim for percent-level accuracy. finally, we perform n-bodysimulations to estimate the likely magnitude of any local density fluctuation(monopole) and estimate the impact as a function of the low-redshift cutoff. wesee that for this aspect the low-z cutoff of z=0.02 is well-justifiedtheoretically, but that living in a putative local density fluctuation leavesan indelible imprint on the magnitude-redshift relation.

1108.4923	the sdss-ii supernova survey: parameterizing the type ia supernova rate  as a function of host galaxy properties	using data from the sloan digital sky supernova survey-ii, we measure therate of type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of galaxy properties atintermediate redshift. a sample of 342 sne ia with 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.25 is constructed.using broad-band photometry we use the pegase spectral energy distributions(seds) to estimate host galaxy stellar masses and recent star-formation rates.we find that the rate of sne ia per unit stellar mass is significantly higher(by a factor of ~30) in highly star-forming galaxies compared to passivegalaxies. when parameterizing the sn ia rate (snr_ia) based on host galaxyproperties, we find that the rate of sne ia in passive galaxies is not linearlyproportional to the stellar mass, instead a snr_ia proportional to m^0.68 isfavored. however, such a parameterization does not describe the observed sn iarate in star-forming galaxies. the sn ia rate in star-forming galaxies is wellfit by snr_ia = 1.05\pm0.16x10^{-10} m ^{0.68\pm0.01} + 1.01\pm0.09x10^{-3}sfr^{1.00\pm0.05} (statistical errors only), where m is the host galaxy massand sfr is the star-formation rate. these results are insensitive to theselection criteria used, redshift limit considered and the inclusion ofnon-spectroscopically confirmed sne ia. we also show there is a dependencebetween the distribution of the mlcs light-curve decline rate parameter,\delta, and host galaxy type. passive galaxies host less luminous sne ia thanseen in moderately and highly star-forming galaxies, although a population ofluminous sne is observed in passive galaxies, contradicting previous assertionsthat these sne ia are only observed in younger stellar systems. the mlcsextinction parameter, a_v, is similar in passive and moderately star-forminggalaxies, but we find indications that it is smaller, on average, in highlystar-forming galaxies. we confirm these results using the salt2 light-curvefitter.

1111.1735	hst-cos observations of hydrogen, helium, carbon and nitrogen emission  from the sn 1987a reverse shock	we present the most sensitive ultraviolet observations of supernova 1987a todate. imaging spectroscopy from the hubble space telescope-cosmic originsspectrograph shows many narrow (dv \sim 300 km/s) emission lines from thecircumstellar ring, broad (dv \sim 10 -- 20 x 10^3 km/s) emission lines fromthe reverse shock, and ultraviolet continuum emission. the high signal-to-noise(&gt; 40 per resolution element) broad lya emission is excited by soft x-ray andeuv heating of mostly neutral gas in the circumstellar ring and outer supernovadebris. the ultraviolet continuum at \lambda &gt; 1350a can be explained by hi2-photon emission from the same region. we confirm our earlier, tentativedetection of nv \lambda 1240 emission from the reverse shock and we present thefirst detections of broad heii \lambda1640, civ \lambda1550, and niv]\lambda1486 emission lines from the reverse shock. the helium abundance in thehigh-velocity material is he/h = 0.14 +/- 0.06. the nv/h-alpha line ratiorequires partial ion-electron equilibration (t_{e}/t_{p} \approx 0.14 - 0.35).we find that the n/c abundance ratio in the gas crossing the reverse shock issignificantly higher than that in the circumstellar ring, a result that may beattributed to chemical stratification in the outer envelope of the supernovaprogenitor. the n/c abundance ratio may have been stratified prior to the ringexpulsion, or this result may indicate continued cno processing in theprogenitor subsequent to the expulsion of the circumstellar ring.

1111.4527	the highly energetic expansion of sn2010bh associated with grb 100316d	we present the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of the nearby (z =0.059) spectroscopically confirmed type ic supernova, sn 2010bh, associatedwith the soft, long-duration gamma-ray burst (x-ray flash) grb 100316d.intensive follow-up observations of sn 2010bh were performed at the eso verylarge telescope (vlt) using the x-shooter and fors2 instruments. owing to thedetailed temporal coverage and the extended wavelength range (3000--24800 a),we obtained an unprecedentedly rich spectral sequence among the hypernovae,making sn 2010bh one of the best studied representatives of this sn class. wefind that sn 2010bh has a more rapid rise to maximum brightness (8.0 +/- 1.0rest-frame days) and a fainter absolute peak luminosity (l_bol~3e42 erg/s) thanpreviously observed sn events associated with grbs. our estimate of the ejected(56)ni mass is 0.12 +/- 0.02 msun. from the broad spectral features we measureexpansion velocities up to 47,000 km/s, higher than those of sne 1998bw (grb980425) and 2006aj (grb 060218). helium absorption lines he i lambda5876 and hei 1.083 microm, blueshifted by ~20,000--30,000 km/s and ~28,000--38,000 km/s,respectively, may be present in the optical spectra. however, the lack ofcoverage of the he i 2.058 microm line prevents us from confirming suchidentifications. the nebular spectrum, taken at ~186 days after the explosion,shows a broad but faint [o i] emission at 6340 a. the light-curve shape andphotospheric expansion velocities of sn 2010bh suggest that we witnessed ahighly energetic explosion with a small ejected mass (e_k ~ 1e52 erg and m_ej ~3 msun). the observed properties of sn 2010bh further extend the heterogeneityof the class of grb supernovae.

1206.2210	type ia supernova properties as a function of the distance to the host  galaxy in the sdss-ii sn survey	we use type-ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the sdss-ii sn survey tosearch for dependencies between sn ia properties and the projected distance tothe host galaxy center, using the distance as a proxy for local galaxyproperties (local star-formation rate, local metallicity, etc.). the sampleconsists of almost 200 spectroscopically or photometrically confirmed sne ia atredshifts below 0.25. the sample is split into two groups depending on themorphology of the host galaxy. we fit light-curves using both mlcs2k2 andsalt2, and determine color (av, c) and light-curve shape (delta, x1) parametersfor each sn ia, as well as its residual in the hubble diagram. we thencorrelate these parameters with both the physical and the normalized distancesto the center of the host galaxy and look for trends in the mean values andscatters of these parameters with increasing distance. the most significant (atthe 4-sigma level) finding is that the average fitted av from mlcs2k2 and cfrom salt2 decrease with the projected distance for sne ia in spiral galaxies.we also find indications that sne in elliptical galaxies tend to have narrowerlight-curves if they explode at larger distances, although this may be due toselection effects in our sample. we do not find strong correlations between theresiduals of the distance moduli with respect to the hubble flow and thegalactocentric distances, which indicates a limited correlation between snmagnitudes after standardization and local host metallicity.

1206.5575	multi-wavelength observations of the enduring type iin supernovae 2005ip  and 2006jd	we present an observational study of the type iin supernovae (sne iin) 2005ipand 2006jd. broad-band uv, optical and near-ir photometry, andvisual-wavelength spectroscopy of sn 2005ip complement and extend uponpublished observations to 6.5 years past discovery. our observations of sn2006jd extend from uv to mid-infrared wavelengths, and like sn 2005ip, arecompared to reported x-ray measurements to understand the nature of theprogenitor. both objects display a number of similarities with the 1988z-likesubclass of sn iin including: (i) remarkably similar early- and late-phaseoptical spectra, (ii) a variety of high ionization coronal lines, (iii)long-duration optical and near-ir emission and, (iv) evidence of cold and warmdust components. however, diversity is apparent including an unprecedentedlate-time r-band excess in sn 2006jd.the observed differences are attributed todifferences between the mass-loss history of the progenitor stars. we concludethat the progenitor of sn 2006jd likely experienced a significant mass-lossevent during its pre-sn evolution akin to the great 19th century eruption of\eta carinae. contrarily, as advocated by smith et al. (2009), we find thecircumstellar environment of sn 2005ip to be more consistent with a clumpy windprogenitor.

1207.5975	the type iib supernova 2011dh from a supergiant progenitor	a set of hydrodynamical models based on stellar evolutionary progenitors isused to study the nature of sn 2011dh. our modeling suggests that a largeprogenitor star ---with r ~200 rsun---, is needed to reproduce the early lightcurve of sn 2011dh. this is consistent with the suggestion that the yellowsuper-giant star detected at the location of the sn in deep pre-explosionimages is the progenitor star. from the main peak of the bolometric light curveand expansion velocities we constrain the mass of the ejecta to be ~2 msun, theexplosion energy to be e= 6-10 x 10^50 erg, and the 56ni mass to beapproximately 0.06 msun. the progenitor star was composed of a helium core of 3to 4 msun and a thin hydrogen-rich envelope of ~0.1 m_sun with a main sequencemass estimated to be in the range of 12--15 msun. our models rule outprogenitors with helium-core masses larger than 8 msun, which correspond tom_zams &gt; 25 msun. this suggests that a single star evolutionary scenario for sn2011dh is unlikely.

1211.4480	cosmology with photometrically-classified type ia supernovae from the  sdss-ii supernova survey	we present the cosmological analysis of 752 photometrically-classified typeia supernovae (sne ia) obtained from the full sloan digital sky survey ii(sdss-ii) supernova (sn) survey, supplemented with host-galaxy spectroscopyfrom the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). ourphotometric-classification method is based on the sn typing technique of sakoet al. (2011), aided by host galaxy redshifts (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.55). snana simulationsof our methodology estimate that we have a sn ia typing efficiency of 70.8%,with only 3.9% contamination from core-collapse (non-ia) sne. we demonstratethat this level of contamination has no effect on our cosmological constraints.we quantify and correct for our selection effects (e.g., malmquist bias) usingsimulations. when fitting to a flat lambdacdm cosmological model, we find thatour photometric sample alone gives omega_m=0.24+0.07-0.05 (statistical errorsonly). if we relax the constraint on flatness, then our sample providescompetitive joint statistical constraints on omega_m and omega_lambda,comparable to those derived from the spectroscopically-confirmed three-yearsupernova legacy survey (snls3). using only our data, the statistics-onlyresult favors an accelerating universe at 99.96% confidence. assuming aconstant wcdm cosmological model, and combining with h0, cmb and lrg data, weobtain w=-0.96+0.10-0.10, omega_m=0.29+0.02-0.02 and omega_k=0.00+0.03-0.02(statistical errors only), which is competitive with similar spectroscopicallyconfirmed sne ia analyses. overall this comparison is re-assuring, consideringthe lower redshift leverage of the sdss-ii sn sample (z&lt;0.55) and the lack ofspectroscopic confirmation used herein. these results demonstrate the potentialof photometrically-classified sne ia samples in improving cosmologicalconstraints.

1212.5051	the morphology of the ejecta in supernova 1987a: a study over time and  wavelength	we present a study of the morphology of the ejecta in supernova 1987a basedon images and spectra from the hst as well as integral field spectroscopy fromvlt/sinfoni. the hst observations were obtained between 1994 - 2011 andprimarily probe the outer hydrogen-rich zones of the ejecta. the sinfoniobservations were obtained in 2005 and 2011 and instead probe the [si i]/[feii] emission from the inner regions. we find a strong temporal evolution of themorphology in the hst images, from a roughly elliptical shape before ~5,000days, to a more irregular, edge-brightened morphology thereafter. thistransition is a natural consequence of the change in the dominant energy sourcepowering the ejecta, from radioactive decay before ~5,000 days to x-ray inputfrom the circumstellar interaction thereafter. the [si i]/[fe ii] imagesdisplay a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significantcontribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance ofthese elements in the core. both the h-alpha and the [si i]/[fe ii] lineprofiles show that the ejecta are distributed fairly close to the plane of theinner circumstellar ring, which is assumed to define the rotational axis of theprogenitor. the h-alpha emission extends to higher velocities than [si i]/[feii] as expected. there is no clear symmetry axis for all the emission and weare unable to model the ejecta distribution with a simple ellipsoid model witha uniform distribution of dust. instead, we find that the emission isconcentrated to clumps and that the emission is distributed somewhat closer tothe ring in the north than in the south. this north-south asymmetry may bepartially explained by dust absorption. we compare our results with explosionmodels and find some qualitative agreement, but note that the observations showa higher degree of large-scale asymmetry.

1212.5052	late spectral evolution of the ejecta and reverse shock in sn1987a	we present observations with vlt and hst of the broad emission lines from theinner ejecta and reverse shock of sn 1987a from 1999 until 2012 (days 4381 --9100 after explosion). we detect broad lines from h-alpha, h-beta, mg i], na i,[o i], [ca ii] and a feature at 9220 a. we identify the latter line with mg ii9218, 9244,most likely pumped by ly-alpha fluorescence. h-alpha, and h-betaboth have a centrally peaked component, extending to 4500 km/s and a very broadcomponent extending to 11,000 km/s, while the other lines have only the centralcomponent. the low velocity component comes from unshocked ejecta, heatedmainly by x-rays from the circumstellar ring collision, whereas the broadcomponent comes from faster ejecta passing through the reverse shock. thereverse shock flux in h-alpha has increased by a factor of 4-6 from 2000 to2007. after that there is a tendency of flattening of the light curve, similarto what may be seen in soft x-rays and in the optical lines from the shockedring. the core component seen in h-alpha, [ca ii] and mg ii has experienced asimilar increase, consistent with that found from hst photometry. the ring-likemorphology of the ejecta is explained as a result of the x-ray illumination,depositing energy outside of the core of the ejecta. the energy deposition inthe ejecta of the external x-rays illumination is calculated using explosionmodels for sn 1987a and we predict that the outer parts of the unshocked ejectawill continue to brighten because of this. we finally discuss evidence for dustin the ejecta from line asymmetries.

1302.0755	deep optical imaging of the gamma-ray pulsar j1048-5832 with the vlt	(abridged) psr j1048-5832 is a young vela-like pulsar that was recentlydetected in gamma-rays with fermi, and also in x-rays with chandra andxmm-newton. it powers a compact pwn visible in x-rays. we present deep opticalobservations with the eso very large telescope to search for opticalcounterparts of the pulsar and its nebula and to explore their multi-wavelengthemission properties. the data were obtained in v and r bands and compared witharchival data in other spectral domains. we do not detect the pulsar in theoptical and derive informative upper limits of r &gt; 28.1 mag and v &gt; 28.4 magfor its brightness. using a red-clump star method, we estimate an interstellarextinction towards the pulsar of 2 mag, which is consistent with the absorbingcolumn density derived form x-rays. the respective distance agrees with thedispersion measure distance. we reanalyse the chandra x-ray data and comparethe dereddened upper limits with the unabsorbed x-ray spectrum of the pulsar.we find that regarding its optical-x-ray spectral properties this gamma-raypulsar is not distinct from other pulsars detected in both ranges. however,like the vela pulsar, it is very inefficient in the optical and x-rays. among adozen optical sources overlapping with the pulsar x-ray nebula we find one withv = 26.9 and r = 26.3 mag, whose colour is slightly bluer then that of thefield stars and consistent with the peculiar colours typical for pulsar nebulafeatures. it positionally coincides with a relatively bright feature of thepulsar x-ray nebula, resembling the crab wisp and locating in 2 arcsec from thepulsar. we suggest this source as a counterpart candidate to the feature. basedon the substantial interstellar extinction towards the pulsar and its opticalinefficiency, further optical studies should be carried out at longerwavelengths.

1307.2566	the effect of weak lensing on distance estimates from supernovae	using a sample of 608 type ia supernovae from the sdss-ii and boss surveys,combined with a sample of foreground galaxies from sdss-ii, we estimate theweak lensing convergence for each supernova line-of-sight. we find that thecorrelation between this measurement and the hubble residuals is consistentwith the prediction from lensing (at a significance of 1.7sigma. strongcorrelations are also found between the residuals and supernova nuisanceparameters after a linear correction is applied. when these other correlationsare taken into account, the lensing signal is detected at 1.4sigma. we show forthe first time that distance estimates from supernovae can be improved whenlensing is incorporated by including a new parameter in the salt2 methodologyfor determining distance moduli. the recovered value of the new parameter isconsistent with the lensing prediction. using cmb data from wmap7, h0 data fromhst and sdss bao measurements, we find the best-fit value of the new lensingparameter and show that the central values and uncertainties on omega_m and ware unaffected. the lensing of supernovae, while only seen at marginalsignificance in this low redshift sample, will be of vital importance for thenext generation of surveys, such as des and lsst, which will be systematicsdominated.

1312.6617	high density circumstellar interaction in the luminous type iin sn  2010jl: the first 1100 days	hst and ground based observations of the type iin sn 2010jl are analyzed,including photometry, spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, optical and nir bands,26-1128 days after first detection. at maximum the bolometric luminosity was$\sim 3\times10^{43}$ erg/s and even at 850 days exceeds $10^{42}$ erg/s. a nirexcess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in thecircumstellar medium (csm). the total radiated energy is $&gt; 6.5\times10^{50}$ergs, excluding the dust component. the spectral lines can be separated intoone broad component due to electron scattering, and one narrow with expansionvelocity $\sim 100$ km/s from the csm. the broad component is initiallysymmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after $\sim 50$ days,while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. dust absorption inthe ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shiftinstead to acceleration by the sn radiation. from the optical lines and thex-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large scale asymmetriesin the csm. the ultraviolet lines indicate cno processing in the progenitor,while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the x-rays.the bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an $r^{-2}$csm with a mass loss rate of $\sim 0.1$ m_sun/yr. the total mass lost is $&gt; 3$m_sun. these properties are consistent with the sn expanding into a csmcharacteristic of an lbv progenitor with a bipolar geometry. the apparentabsence of nuclear processing is attributed to a csm still opaque to electronscattering.

1401.4893	mass-loss histories of type iin supernova progenitors within decades  before their explosion	we present results of a systematic study of the mass-loss properties of typeiin supernova progenitors within decades before their explosion. we apply ananalytic light curve model to 11 type iin supernova bolometric light curves toderive the circumstellar medium properties. we reconstruct the mass-losshistories based on the estimated circumstellar medium properties. the estimatedmass-loss rates are mostly higher than 1e-3 msun/yr and they are consistentwith those obtained by other methods. the mass-loss rates are often found to beconstantly high within decades before their explosion. this indicates thatthere exists some mechanism to sustain the high mass-loss rates of type iinsupernova progenitors for at least decades before their explosion. thus, theshorter eruptive mass loss events observed in some type iin supernovaprogenitors are not always responsible for creating their dense circumstellarmedia. in addition, we find that type iin supernova progenitors may tend toincrease their mass-loss rates as they approach to the time of their explosion.we also show a detailed comparison between our analytic prediction andnumerical results.

1507.02501	measuring nickel masses in type ia supernovae using cobalt emission in  nebular phase spectra	the light curves of type ia supernovae (sne ia) are powered by theradioactive decay of $^{56}$ni to $^{56}$co at early times, and the decay of$^{56}$co to $^{56}$fe from ~60 days after explosion. we examine the evolutionof the [co iii] 5892 a emission complex during the nebular phase for sne iawith multiple nebular spectra and show that the line flux follows the square ofthe mass of $^{56}$co as a function of time. this result indicates bothefficient local energy deposition from positrons produced in $^{56}$co decay,and long-term stability of the ionization state of the nebula. we compile 77nebular spectra of 25 sn ia from the literature and present 17 new nebularspectra of 7 sne ia, including sn2014j. from these we measure the flux in the[co iii] 5892 a line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer theinitial mass of $^{56}$ni ($m_{ni}$) produced in the explosion. we then examine$^{56}$ni yields for different sn ia ejected masses ($m_{ej}$ - calculatedusing the relation between light curve width and ejected mass) and find the$^{56}$ni masses of sne ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (lowstretch s~0.7-0.9), $m_{ni}$ is clustered near $m_{ni}$ ~ 0.4$m_\odot$ andshows a shallow increase as $m_{ej}$ increases from ~1-1.4$m_\odot$; at highstretch, $m_{ej}$ clusters at the chandrasekhar mass (1.4$m_\odot$) while$m_{ni}$ spans a broad range from 0.6-1.2$m_\odot$. this could constituteevidence for two distinct sn ia explosion mechanisms.

1508.04775	search for precursor eruptions among type iib supernovae	the progenitor stars of several type iib supernovae (sne) show indicationsfor extended hydrogen envelopes. these envelopes might be the outcome ofluminous energetic pre-explosion events, so-called precursor eruptions. we usethe palomar transient factory (ptf) pre-explosion observations of a sample of27 nearby type iib sne to look for such precursors during the final years priorto the sn explosion. no precursors are found when combining the observations in15-day bins, and we calculate the absolute-magnitude-dependent upper limit onthe precursor rate. at the 90% confidence level, type iib sne have on average$&lt;0.86$ precursors as bright as absolute $r$-band magnitude $-14$ in the final3.5 years before the explosion and $&lt;0.56$ events over the final year. incontrast, precursors among sne iin have a $\gtrsim 5$ times higher rate. thekinetic energy required to unbind a low-mass stellar envelope is comparable tothe radiated energy of a few-weeks-long precursor which would be detectable forthe closest sne in our sample. therefore, mass ejections, if they are common insuch sne, are radiatively inefficient or have durations longer than months.indeed, when using 60-day bins a faint precursor candidate is detected prior tosn 2012cs ($\sim2$% false-alarm probability). we also report the detection ofthe progenitor of sn 2011dh which does not show detectable variability over thefinal two years before the explosion. the suggested progenitor of sn 2012p isstill present, and hence is likely a compact star cluster, or an unrelatedobject.

0806.1387	prospects and pitfalls of gravitational lensing in large supernova  surveys	to investigate the effect of gravitational lensing of supernovae in largeongoing surveys, we simulate the effect of gravitational lensing magnificationon individual supernovae using observational data input from two largesupernova surveys. to estimate the magnification due to matter in theforeground, we simulate galaxy catalogs and compute the magnification alongindividual lines of sight using the multiple lens plane algorithm. the darkmatter haloes of the galaxies are modelled as gravitational lenses usingsingular isothermal sphere or navarro-frenk-white profiles. scaling lawsbetween luminosity and mass, provided by faber-jackson and tully-fisherrelations, are used to estimate the masses of the haloes.  while our simulations show that the sdssii supernova survey is marginallyaffected by gravitational lensing, we find that the effect will be measurablein the snls survey that probes higher redshifts. our simulations show that theprobability to measure a significant (3 sigma) correlation between the hubblediagram residuals and the calculated lensing magnification is ~95% in the snlsdata. moreover, with this data it should be possible to constrain thenormalisation of the masses of the lensing galaxy haloes at the 1 sigma and 2sigma confidence level with ~30% and ~60% accuracy, respectively.

1511.04522	polarimetry of the superluminous supernova lsq14mo: no evidence for  significant deviations from spherical symmetry	we present the first polarimetric observations of a type i superluminoussupernova (slsn). lsq14mo was observed with vlt/fors2 at five different epochsin the v band, with the observations starting before maximum light and spanning26 days in the rest frame (z=0.256). during this period, we do not detect anystatistically significant evolution (&lt; 2$\sigma$) in the stokes parameters. theaverage values we obtain, corrected for interstellar polarisation in thegalaxy, are q = -0.01% ($\pm$ 0.15%) and u = - 0.50% ($\pm$ 0.14%). this lowpolarisation can be entirely due to interstellar polarisation in the sn hostgalaxy. we conclude that, at least during the period of observations and at theoptical depths probed, the photosphere of lsq14mo does not present significantasymmetries, unlike most lower-luminosity hydrogen-poor sne ib/c.alternatively, it is possible that we may have observed lsq14mo from a specialviewing angle. supporting spectroscopy and photometry confirm that lsq14mo is atypical slsn i. further studies of the polarisation of type i slsne arerequired to determine whether the low levels of polarisation are acharacteristic of the entire class and to also study the implications for theproposed explosion models.

astro-ph;0002374	observations of the crab nebula and its pulsar in the far-ultraviolet  and in the optical	we present hst/stis far-uv observations of the crab nebula and its pulsar.broad, blueshifted absorption arising in the nebula is seen in c iv 1550,reaching about 2500 km/s. this can be interpreted as evidence for a fast outershell, and we adopt a spherically symmetric model to constrain the propertiesof this. we find that the density appears to decrease outward in the shell. alower limit to the mass is 0.3 solar masses with an accompanying kinetic energyof 1.5ee{49} ergs. a massive 10^{51} erg shell cannot be excluded, but is lesslikely if the density profile is much steeper than r^{-4} and the velocity is&lt;6000 km/s. the observations cover the region 1140-1720 a. with the time-tagmode of the spectrograph we obtain the pulse profile. it is similar to that inthe near-uv, although the primary peak is marginally narrower. together withthe near-uv data, and new optical data from not, our spectrum of the pulsarcovers the entire region from 1140-9250 a. dereddening the spectrum gives aflat spectrum for e(b-v)=0.52, r=3.1. this dereddened spectrum of the crabpulsar can be fitted by a power law with spectral index alpha_{\nu} = 0.11 +/-0.04. the main uncertainty is the amount and characteristics of the interstel-lar reddening, and we have investigated the dependence of \alpha_{\nu} one(b-v) and r. in the extended emission covered by our 25" x 0.5" slit in thefar-uv, we detect c iv 1550 and he ii 1640 emission lines from the crab nebula.several interstellar absorption lines are detected toward the pulsar. the lyalpha absorption indicates a column density of 3.0+/-0.5\ee{21} cm^{-2} ofneutral hydrogen, which agrees well with our estimate of e(b-v)=0.52 mag. otherlines show no evidence of severe depletion of metals in atomic gas.

astro-ph;0305008	cosmological results from high-z supernovae	the high-z supernova search team has discovered and observed 8 new supernovaein the redshift interval z=0.3-1.2. these independent observations, confirm theresult of riess et al. (1998a) and perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernovaluminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. more importantly, theyextend the redshift range of consistently observed sn ia to z~1, where thesignature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausiblesystematic effects. consequently, these measurements not only provide anotherquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitutea powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.we find a rate for sn ia of 1.4+/-0.5e-04 h^3/mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of0.5. we present distances and host extinctions for 230 sn ia. these place thefollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then h0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and o_l - 1.4o_m = 0.35+/-0.14. including the constraint of a flat universe, we find o_m =0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. adopting aprior based on the 2df redshift survey constraint on o_m and assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy liesin the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. if we further assume that w&gt;-1,we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence. these constraints are similar in precisionand in value to recent results reported using the wmap satellite, also incombination with the 2df redshift survey.

astro-ph;0306347	a very energetic supernova associated with the gamma-ray burst of 29  march 2003	over the past five years evidence has mounted that long-duration (&gt; 2 s)gamma-ray bursts (grbs)--the most brilliant of all astronomicalexplosions--signal the collapse of massive stars in our universe. this evidencewas originally based on the probable association of one unusual grb with asupernova, but now includes the association of grbs with regions of massivestar formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' inthe optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshlysynthesized elements in the spectra of a few x-ray afterglows. theseobservations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea thatlong-duration grbs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumablyarising from core collapse. here we report evidence that a very energeticsupernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a grb atredshift z = 0.1685. the timing of the supernova indicates that it explodedwithin a few days of the grb, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events cangive rise to grbs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model.

astro-ph;0409338	the late-time light curve of the type ia supernova 2000cx	we have conducted a systematic and comprehensive monitoring programme of thetype ia supernova 2000cx at late phases using the vlt and hst. the vltobservations cover phases 360 to 480 days past maximum brightness and includephotometry in the bvrijh bands, together with a single epoch in each of u andks. while the optical bands decay by about 1.4 mag per 100 days, we find thatthe near-ir magnitudes stay virtually constant during the observed period. thismeans that the importance of the near-ir to the bolometric light curveincreases with time. the finding is also in agreement with our detailedmodeling of a type ia supernova in the nebular phase. in these models, theincreased importance of the near-ir is a temperature effect. we note that thiscomplicates late-time studies where often only the v band is well monitored. inparticular, it is not correct to assume that any optical band follows thebolometric light curve at these phases, and any conclusions based on suchassumptions, e.g., regarding positron-escape, must be regarded as premature. avery simple model where all positrons are trapped can reasonably well accountfor the observations. the nickel mass deduced from the positron tail of thislight curve is lower than found from the peak brightness, providing an estimateof the fraction of late-time emission that is outside of the observedwavelength range. our detailed models show the signature of an infraredcatastrophe at these epochs, which is not supported by the observations.

astro-ph;0504317	three-dimensional modeling of type ia supernovae - the power of late  time spectra	late time synthetic spectra of type ia supernovae, based on three-dimensionaldeflagration models, are presented. we mainly focus on onemodel,"c3_3d_256_10s", for which the hydrodynamics (roepke 2005) andnucleosynthesis (travaglio et al. 2004) was calculated up to the homologousphase of the explosion. other models with different ignition conditions anddifferent resolution are also briefly discussed. the synthetic spectra arecompared to observed late time spectra. we find that while the model spectraafter 300 to 500 days show a good agreement with the observed fe ii-iiifeatures, they also show too strong o i and c i lines compared to the observedlate time spectra. the oxygen and carbon emission originates from thelow-velocity unburned material in the central regions of these models. to getagreement between the models and observations we find that only a small mass ofunburned material may be left in the center after the explosion. this may be aproblem for pure deflagration models, although improved initial conditions, aswell as higher resolution decrease the discrepancy. the relative intensity fromthe different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of theemitting iron-rich material. we find that clumping, with the presence of lowdensity regions, is needed to reproduce the observed iron emission, especiallyin the range between 4000 and 6000 aa. both temperature and ionization dependsensitively on density, abundances and radioactive content. this work thereforeillustrates the importance of including the inhomogeneous nature of realisticthree-dimensional explosion models. we briefly discuss the implications of thespectral modeling for the nature of the explosion.

astro-ph;0608313	no supernovae associated with two long-duration gamma ray bursts	it is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are producedduring the collapse of a massive star. the standard "collapsar" model predictsthat a broad-lined and luminous type ic core-collapse supernova (sn)accompanies every long-duration grb. this association has been confirmed inobservations of several nearby grbs. here we present observations of two nearbylong-duration grbs that challenge this simple view. in the grbs 060505 and060614 we demonstrate that no sn emission accompanied these long-durationbursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal sn 1998bwthat accompanied grb 980425, and fainter than any type ic sn ever observed.multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of thehost galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and showthat the bursts originated in star-forming regions. the absence of a sn to suchdeep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long grbs andsuggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. from thesupplementary material: now we have observed sn-less grbs in star-formingregions, suggesting that a non-detection of a sn does not preclude a massiveprogenitor. the position of the grb, i.e. in a star-forming region or in anolder component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compactobjects and massive stars as progenitors. in fact, several host galaxies forshort grbs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxiesof long-duration grbs. the grb labels "long" and "short" have become synonymouswith "massive stars" and "other progenitors". these distinctions may need to berelaxed.

astro-ph;0609232	consistent estimates of (56)ni yields for type ia supernovae	we present (56)ni mass estimates for seventeen well-observed type iasupernovae determined by two independent methods. estimates of the (56)ni massfor each type ia supernova are determined from (1) modeling of the late-timenebular spectrum and (2) through the combination of the peak bolometricluminosity with arnett's rule. the attractiveness of this approach is that thecomparison of estimated (56)ni masses circumvents errors associated with theuncertainty in the adopted values of reddening and distance. we demonstratethat these two methods provide consistent estimates of the amount of (56)nisynthesized. we also find a strong correlation between the derived (56)ni massand the absolute b-band magnitude (m(b)). spectral synthesis can be used as adiagnostic to study the explosion mechanism. by obtaining more nebular spectrathe nif--m(b) correlation can be calibrated and can be used to investigate anypotential systematic effects this relationship may have on the determination ofcosmological parameters, and provide a new way to estimate extra-galacticdistances of nearby type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0612137	the velocity field of the local universe from measurements of type ia  supernovae	we present a measurement of the velocity flow of the local universe relativeto the cmb rest frame, based on the jha, riess &amp; kirshner (2007) sample of 133low redshift type ia supernovae. at a depth of 4500 km/s we find a dipoleamplitude of 279+-68 km/s in the direction (l,b) = (285+-18,-10+-15),consistent with earlier measurements and with the assumption that the localvelocity field is dominated by the great attractor region. at a larger depth of5900 km/s we find a shift in the dipole direction towards the shapleyconcentration. we also present the first measurement of the quadrupole term inthe local velocity flow at these depths. finally, we have performed detailedstudies based on n-body simulations of the expected precision with which thelowest multipoles in the velocity field can be measured out to redshifts oforder 0.1. our mock catalogues are in good agreement with current observations,and demonstrate that our results are robust with respect to assumptions aboutthe influence of local environment on the type ia supernova rate.

astro-ph;0702117	signatures of delayed detonation, asymmetry, and electron capture in the  mid-infrared spectra of supernovae 2003hv and 2005df	we present the first mid-infrared (5.2-15.2 micron) spectra of type iasupernovae (sne 2003hv and 2005df). the detection of ni emission in sn 2005df135 days after the explosion provides direct observational evidence ofhigh-density nuclear burning forming a significant amount of stable ni in atype ia supernova. the observed emission line profiles in the sn 2005dfspectrum indicate a chemically stratified ejecta structure. the sn 2005df arlines also exhibit a two-pronged emission profile implying that the ar emissiondeviates significantly from spherical symmetry. the spectrum of sn 2003hv alsoshows signs of asymmetry, exhibiting blueshifted [co iii] which matches theblueshift of [fe ii] lines in nearly coeval nir spectra. finally, localthermodynamic equilibrium abundance estimates for the yield of radioactive 56nigive ~0.5 msun, for sn 2003hv, but only ~0.13-0.22 msun for the apparentlysubluminous sn 2005df, supporting the notion that the luminosity of sne ia isprimarily a function of the radioactive 56ni yield.  the chemically stratified ejecta structure observed in sn 2005df matches thepredictions of delayed-detonation (dd) models, but is entirely incompatiblewith current three-dimensional deflagration models. furthermore the degree thatthis layering persists to the innermost regions of the supernova is difficultto explain even in a dd scenario, where the innermost ejecta are still theproduct of deflagration burning. thus, while these results are roughlyconsistent with a delayed detonation, it is clear that a key piece of physicsis still missing from our understanding of the earliest phases of sn iaexplosions.

astro-ph;0703407	spatially resolved properties of the grb 060505 host: implications for  the nature of the progenitor	grb 060505 was the first well-observed nearby possible long-duration grb thathad no associated supernova. here we present spatially resolved spectra of thehost galaxy of grb 060505, an sbc spiral, at redshift z=0.0889. the grboccurred inside a star-forming region in the northern spiral arm at 6.5 kpcfrom the center. from the position of the emission lines, we determine amaximum rotational velocity for the galaxy of v~212km/s corresponding to a massof 1.14x10^11 m_solar within 11 kpc from the center. by fitting single-agespectral synthesis models to the stellar continuum, we derive a very young agefor the grb site, confirmed by photometric and halpha line measurements, ofaround 6 myr which corresponds to the lifetime of a 32 m_solar star. themetallicity derived from several emission line measurements is lowest at thegrb site with 1/5 z_solar but roughly solar in the rest of the galaxy. usingthe 2df galaxy redshift survey we can locate the host galaxy in its large scale(mpc) environment. the galaxy lies in the foreground of a filamentaryoverdensity extending south west from the galaxy cluster abell 3837 atz=0.0896. the properties of the grb site are similar to those found for otherlong-duration grb host galaxies with high specific star formation rate and lowmetallicity, which is an indication that grb 060505 originated from a youngmassive star that died without making a supernova.

astro-ph;0703788	high resolution spectroscopy of the line emission from the inner  circumstellar ring of sn 1987a and its hot spots	we discuss high resolution vlt/uves observations (fwhm ~ 6 km/s) from october2002 (day ~5700 past explosion) of the shock interaction of sn 1987a and itscircumstellar ring. a nebular analysis of the narrow lines from the unshockedgas indicates gas densities of (1.5-5.0)e3 cm-3 and temperatures of 6.5e3-2.4e4k. this is consistent with the thermal widths of the lines. from the shockedcomponent we observe a large range of ionization stages from neutral lines to[fe xiv]. from a nebular analysis we find that the density in the lowionization region is 4e6-1e7 cm-3. there is a clear difference in the highvelocity extension of the low ionization lines and that of lines from [fex-xiv], with the latter extending up to ~ -390 km/s in the blue wing for [fexiv], while the low ionization lines extend to typically ~ -260 km/s. forh-alpha a faint extension up to ~ -450 km/s can be seen probably arising from asmall fraction of shocked high density clumps. we discuss these observations inthe context of radiative shock models, which are qualitatively consistent withthe observations. a fraction of the high ionization lines may originate in gaswhich has yet not had time to cool down, explaining the difference in widthbetween the low and high ionization lines. the maximum shock velocities seen inthe optical lines are ~ 510 km/s. we expect the maximum width of especially thelow ionization lines to increase with time.

astro-ph;9709061	a very low mass of ni-56 in the ejecta of sn 1994w	we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the luminous narrow-line type iip (plateau) supernova 1994w. after the plateau phase (t &gt;120 days),the light curve dropped by 3.5 mag in v in only 12 days. between 125 and 197days after explosion the supernova faded substantially faster than the decayrate of co-56, and by day 197 it was 3.6 magnitudes less luminous in r comparedto sn 1987a. the low r-luminosity could indicate less than 0.0026 {+0.0017}/{-0.0011} msun of ni-56 ejected at the explosion, but the emission between 125and 197 days must then have been dominated by an additional power source, pre-sumably circumstellar interaction. alternatively, the late light curve wasdominated by co-56 decay. in this case, the mass of the ejected ni-56 was 0.015{+0.012}/{-0.008} msun, and the rapid fading between 125 and 197 days was mostlikely due to dust formation. though this value of the mass is higher than inthe case with the additional power source, it is still lower than estimated forany previous type ii supernova. only progenitors with m(zams) = 8-10 msun andm(zams) &gt; 25 msun are expected to eject such low masses of ni-56. if m(zams) =8-10 msun, the plateau phase indicates a low explosion energy, while for aprogenitor with m(zams) &gt; 25 msun the energy can be the canonical 1.0e{51}ergs. as sn 1994w was unusually luminous, the low-mass explosion may require anuncomfortably high efficiency in converting explosion energy into radiation.this favors a m(zams) &gt; 25 msun progenitor. the supernova's narrow (roughly1000 km s^{-1}) emission lines were excited by the hot supernova spectrum,rather than a circumstellar shock. the thin shell from which the lines origi-nated was most likely accelerated by the radiation from the supernova.

astro-ph;9712355	stis near ultraviolet time-tagged spectra of the crab pulsar	we present the spectrum and pulse profile of the crab pulsar in the nearultraviolet (1600-3200 angstroms) observed with the space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis) during the hubble space telescope (hst) second servicingmission orbital verification (smov) period. the two-dimensionalnear-ultraviolet multi-anode microchannel array (nuv mama) was used in time-tagmode with a 2 arcsec by 2 arcsec aperture and the low dispersion grating,g230l, to obtain a cube with axes of slit position, wavelength, and time. theobservation-derived pulse profile is consistent with radio measurements, andthe pulse profile agrees well with previous nuv broadband measurements by thehigh speed photometer. the pulsar spectrum includes the 2200 a dust absorptionfeature, plus several interstellar absorption lines. dereddening the spectrumusing the savage-mathis model with e(b-v)=0.55+- 0.05 leads to a good fit to apower law with slope of -0.3+-0.2. spectra of the main pulse, the interpulse,and the individual rising and falling edges are similar to the total spectrumwithin the limits of photon statistics. the pulse profile is stable across thenuv spectral range. histogram analysis reveals no evidence for the superpulsesseen at radio wavelengths. the interstellar absorption line equivalent widthsof mg i, mg ii and feii are lower than expected based upon the implied hicolumn density from e(b-v)=0.5. while several explanations are possible,additional studies will be necessary to narrow the options.

0810.4329	reducing the gravitational lensing scatter of type ia supernovae without  introducing any extra bias	magnification and de-magnification due to gravitational lensing willcontribute to the brightness scatter of type ia supernovae (sne ia). thepurpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility to decrease thisscatter by correcting individual sne ia using observations of galaxies in theforeground, without introducing any extra bias. we simulate a large number ofsn ia lines of sight populated by galaxies. for each line of sight the truemagnification factor and an estimate thereof are calculated. the estimatedmagnification factor corresponds to what an observer would infer from a surveylike snls. using the simulated data we investigate the possibility to estimatethe magnification of individual supernovae with enough precision to be able tocorrect their brightness for gravitational lensing with negligible bias. oursimulations show that the bias arising from gravitational lensing correctionsof individual sne ia is negligible for current and next generation surveys andthat the scatter from lensing can be reduced by approximately a factor 2. thetotal scatter in the sn ia magnitudes could be reduced by 4% for an intrinsicdispersion of 0.13 mag. for an intrinsic dispersion of 0.09 mag, which mightnot be to unrealistic for future surveys, the total scatter could be reduced by6%. this will reduce the errors on cosmological parameters derived fromsupernova data by 4-8%. the prospect of correcting for lensing is thus verygood.
