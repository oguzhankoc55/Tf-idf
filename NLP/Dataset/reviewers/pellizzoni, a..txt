0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0908.1908	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from the short gamma-ray  burst grb 090510	short gamma-ray bursts (grbs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a specialclass of grbs of great interest. we report the detection by the agile satelliteof the short grb 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: aprompt phase lasting ~ 200 msec and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. theprompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 mev range with a spectrumcharacterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 mev, in this phase, nosignificant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. at the end of theprompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 mev is detected showing apower-law time decay of the flux of the type t^-1.3 and a broad-band spectrumremarkably different from that of the prompt phase. it extends from sub-mev tohundreds of mev energies with a photon index alpha ~ 1.5. grb 090510 providesthe first case of a short grb with delayed gamma-ray emission. we present thetiming and spectral data of grb 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkableproperties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short grbs.

0707.0937	vlt observations of the central compact object in the vela jr. supernova  remnant	x-ray observations have unveiled the existence of enigmatic point-likesources at the center of young (a few kyrs) supernova remnants. these sources,known as central compact objects (ccos), are thought to be neutron starsproduced by the supernova explosion, although their x-ray phenomenology makesthem markedly different from all the other young neutron stars discovered sofar.the aim of this work is to search for the optical/ir counterpart of thevela junior cco and to understand the nature of the associated halpha nebuladiscovered by pellizzoni et al. (2002).}{we have used deep optical (r band) andir (j,h,ks bands) observations recently performed by our group with the eso vltto obtain the first deep, high resolution images of the field with the goal ofresolving the nebula structure and pinpointing a point-like source possiblyassociated with the neutron star.our r-band image shows that both the nebula'sflux and its structure are very similar to the halpha ones, suggesting that thenebula spectrum is dominated by pure halpha line emission. however, the nebulais not detected in our ir observations, whick makes it impossible to toconstrain its spectrum. a faint point-like object (j&gt;22.6, h~21.6, ks ~ 21.4)compatible with the neutron star's chandra x-ray position is detected in our irimages (h and ks) but not in the optical one (r &gt; 25.6), where it is buried bythe nebula background. the nebula is most likely a bow-shock produced by theneutron star motion through the ism or, alternatively, a photo-ionizationnebula powered by uv radiation from a hot neutron star.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.4895	monitoring the hard x-ray sky with superagile	superagile is the hard x-ray monitor of the agile gamma ray mission, in orbitsince 23$^{rd}$ april 2007. it is an imaging experiment based on a set of fourindependent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks,operating in the nominal energy range 18-60 kev. the main goal of superagile isthe observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray agileexperiment, the gamma ray imaging detector (grid). given its$\sim$steradian-wide field of view and its $\sim$15 mcrab day-sensitivity,superagile is also well suited for the long-term monitoring of galactic compactobjects and the detection of bright transients. the superagile detectorproperties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of thetwo independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. photon byphoton data are continuously available by the experiment telemetry, and areused to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration timesdepending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. in thispaper we report on the main scientific results achieved by superagile over itsfirst two years in orbit, until april 2009.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

0911.3743	temporal properties of gx 301-2 over a year-long observation with  superagile	we present the long-term monitoring of the high mass x-ray binary gx 301-2performed with the superagile instrument on-board the agile mission. the sourcewas monitored in the 20-60 kev energy band during the first year of the missionfrom 2007 july 17 to 2008 august 31, covering about one whole orbital periodand three more pre-periastron passages for a total net observation time ofabout 3.7 ms. the superagile dataset represents one of the most continuous andcomplete monitoring at hard x-ray energies of the 41.5 day long binary periodavailable to date. the source behavior was characterized at all orbital phasesin terms of hard x-ray flux, spectral hardness, spin period history, pulsedfraction and pulse shape profile. we also complemented the superagileobservations with the soft x-ray data of the rossixte/asm. our analysis shows aclear orbital modulation of the spectral hardness, with peaks in correspondencewith the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25. the hardness peaks we foundcould be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order toexplain the orbital light curve modulation of gx 301-2. timing analysis of thepulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the about 680 s pulse periodis consistent with the previous observations, although there is evidence of aslight decrease in the spin-down rate. the analysis of the hard x-ray pulsedemission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of theorbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron,and a clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in turn stronglyanti-correlated with the source intensity.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1009.5539	study of the gamma-ray source 1agl j2022+4032 in the cygnus region	identification of gamma-ray-emitting galactic sources is a long-standingproblem in astrophysics. one such source, 1agl j2022+4032, coincident with theinterior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant gamma cygni (snrg78.2+2.1) in the cygnus region, has recently been identified by fermi as agamma-ray pulsar, lat psr j2021+4026. we present long-term observations of 1aglj2022+4032 with the agile gamma-ray telescope, measuring its flux and lightcurve. we compare the light curve of 1agl j2022+4032 with that of 1aglj2021+3652 (psr j2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1aglj2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical andsystematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate theprobability of the apparent observed variability. we evaluate the possibilitythat the gamma-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or morepoint sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possiblecounterparts. we consider the possibility of a nearby x-ray quiet microquasarcontributing to the flux of 1agl j2022+4032 to be more likely than thehypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic gamma-ray variabilty of lat psrj2021+4026.

1101.5100	x-ray and optical observations of the closest isolated radio pulsar	with a parallactic distance of 170 pc, psr j2144-3933 is the closest isolatedradio pulsar currently known. it is also the slowest (p = 8.51 s) and leastenergetic (edot = 2.6e28 erg/s) radio pulsar; its radio emission is difficultto account for with standard pulsar models, since the position of psrj2144-3933 in the period-period derivative diagram is far beyond the typicalradio `death lines'. here we present the first deep x-ray and opticalobservations of psr j2144-3933, performed in 2009 with xmm-newton and europeansouthern observatory (eso)/very large telescope (vlt), from which we derive,assuming a blackbody emission spectrum, a surface temperature upper limit of2.3e5 k for a 13 km radius neutron star, 4.4e5 k for a 500 m radius hot spotand 1.9e6 k for a 10 m radius polar cap. in addition, our non-detection of psrj2144-3933 constrains its non-thermal luminosity to be &lt;30 per cent and &lt;2 percent of the pulsar rotational energy loss in the 0.5-2 kev x-ray band and inthe b optical band, respectively.

1102.4754	detection of continuum radio emission associated with geminga	a deep very large array observation of the geminga pulsar field led to thediscovery, at a higher than 10 sigma significance level, of radio emissiontrailing the neutron star proper motion. this 10-arcsec-long radio feature,detected with a flux of 0.4 mjy at 4.8 ghz, is marginally displaced (2.7\pm1.8arcsec) from the pulsar (which, at any rate, is unlikely to contribute withmagnetospheric pulsed emission more than 15% to the total observed radioluminosity, about 1e26 erg/s) and positionally coincident with the x-ray axialtail recently discovered by chandra and ascribed to the pulsar wind nebula(pwn). overall, the geminga radio tail is compatible with the scenario of asynchrotron-emitting pwn, but the present data do not allow us to discriminatebetween different (and not always necessarily mutually exclusive) possibleprocesses for producing that. if this radio feature does not result fromintrinsic peculiarities of geminga, but its proximity and radio-quiet nature(both helping in not hindering the faint diffuse radio emission), otherrelatively near and energetic radio-quiet pulsars could show similar structuresin dedicated interferometric observations.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1111.4868	neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant  w44	we present the agile gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 mev - 10gev of the supernova remnant (snr) w44, one of the most interesting systems forstudying cosmic-ray production. w44 is an intermediate-age snr (20, 000 years)and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,nearby molecular clouds, and bright [sii] emitting regions. we extend ourgamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurementswhich could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. we findthat gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape ofthe inner snr shocked plasma. furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows aprominent peak near 1 gev with a clear decrement at energies below a fewhundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay. here we demonstrate that:(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelengthconstraints derived from radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously thewell-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellardensity much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadronenergy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)and a low-energy cut-off at ec = 6 \pm 1 gev. direct evidence for pion emissionis then established in an snr for the first time.

1111.4960	agile detection of cygnus x-3 {\gamma}-ray active states during the  period mid-2009/mid-2010	cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emissionat all wavelengths. cyg x-3 is a prominent x-ray binary producing relativisticjets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding ofthe fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. aims. ourgoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\gamma}-ray productionabove 100 mev during special spectral states of cyg x- 3 usually characterizedby a low hard x-ray flux and enhanced soft x-ray states. we observed cyg x-3with the agile satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 jun.-jul., and2009 nov.-2010 jul. we report here the results of the agile {\gamma}-raymonitoring of cyg x-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelengthcampaigns involving radio (ratan-600, ami-la and mets\"{a}hovi radioobservatories) and x-ray monitoring data (xte and swift). we detect a series ofrepeated {\gamma}-ray flaring activity from cyg x-3 that correlate with thesoft x-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard x-rayemission. furthermore, we detect {\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends tobe associated with radio flares greater than 1 jy at 15 ghz, confirming a trendalready detected in previous observations. the source remained active above 100mev for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 jun.-jul. and 1month in 2010 may). we study in detail the short timescale {\gamma}-ray flaresthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. our results confirm the transientnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar cyg x-3. aseries of repeated {\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and x-rayemission confirming a well established trend of emission. we compare ourresults with fermi-lat and magic tev observations of cyg x-3.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1310.4029	an updated list of agile bright gamma-ray sources and their variability  in pointing mode	we present a variability study of a sample of bright gamma-ray (30 mev -- 50gev) sources. this sample is an extension of the first agile catalogue ofgamma-ray sources (1agl), obtained using the complete set of agile observationsin pointing mode performed during a 2.3 year period from july 9, 2007 untiloctober 30, 2009. the dataset of agile pointed observations covers a long timeinterval and its gamma-ray data archive is useful for monitoring studies ofmedium-to-high brightness gamma-ray sources. in the analysis reported here, weused data obtained with an improved event filter that covers a wider field ofview, on a much larger (about 27.5 months) dataset, integrating data onobservation block time scales, which mostly range from a few days to thirtydays.  the data processing resulted in a better characterized source list than 1aglwas, and includes 54 sources, 7 of which are new high galactic latitude (|bii|&gt;= 5) sources, 8 are new sources on the galactic plane, and 20 sources from theprevious catalogue with revised positions. eight 1agl sources (2 high-latitudeand 6 on the galactic plane) were not detected in the final processing eitherbecause of low ob exposure and/or due to their position in complex galacticregions. we report the results in a catalogue of all the detections obtained ineach single ob, including the variability results for each of these sources. inparticular, we found that 12 sources out of 42 or 11 out of 53 are variable,depending on the variability index used, where 42 and 53 are the number ofsources for which these indices could be calculated. seven of the 11 variablesources are blazars, the others are crab pulsar+nebula, ls i +61{\deg}303, cygx-3, and 1aglr j2021+4030.

0802.0350	psr j0737-3039: interacting pulsars in x-rays	we present the results of a ~230 ks long x-ray observation of therelativistic double-pulsar system psr j0737-3039 obtained with the xmm-newtonsatellite in 2006 october. we confirm the detection in x-rays of pulsedemission from psr j0737-3039a (psr a), mostly ascribed to a soft non-thermalpower-law component (photon index ~ 3.3) with a 0.2-3 kev luminosity of~1.9e+30 erg/s (assuming a distance of 500 pc). for the first time, pulsedx-ray emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) is also detected in part of theorbit. this emission, consistent with thermal radiation with temperature kt=30ev and a bolometric luminosity of ~1e+32 erg/s, is likely powered by heating ofpsr b's surface caused by psr a's wind. a hotter (~130 ev) and fainter (~5e+29erg/s) thermal component, probably originating from back-falling particlesheating polar caps of either psr a or psr b is also required by the data. nosigns of x-ray emission from a bow-shock between psr a's wind and theinterstellar medium or psr b's magnetosphere are present. the upper limit onthe luminosity of such a shock component (~1e+29 erg/s) constrains the windmagnetization parameter sigma of psr a to values greater than 1.

1401.3573	the agile alert system for gamma-ray transients	in recent years, a new generation of space missions offered greatopportunities of discovery in high-energy astrophysics. in this article wefocus on the scientific operations of the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid)onboard the agile space mission. the agile-grid, sensitive in the energy rangeof 30 mev-30 gev, has detected many gamma-ray transients of galactic andextragalactic origins. this work presents the agile innovative approach to fastgamma-ray transient detection, which is a challenging task and a crucial partof the agile scientific program. the goals are to describe: (1) the agilegamma-ray alert system, (2) a new algorithm for blind search identification oftransients within a short processing time, (3) the agile procedure forgamma-ray transient alert management, and (4) the likelihood of ratio teststhat are necessary to evaluate the post-trial statistical significance of theresults. special algorithms and an optimized sequence of tasks are necessary toreach our goal. data are automatically analyzed at every orbital downlink by analert pipeline operating on different timescales. as proper flux thresholds areexceeded, alerts are automatically generated and sent as sms messages tocellular telephones, e-mails, and push notifications of an application forsmartphones and tablets. these alerts are crosschecked with the results of twopipelines, and a manual analysis is performed. being a small scientific-classmission, agile is characterized by optimization of both scientific analysis andground-segment resources. the system is capable of generating alerts within twoto three hours of a data downlink, an unprecedented reaction time in gamma-rayastrophysics.

1408.6526	the large observatory for x-ray timing	the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft) was studied within esa m3cosmic vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, loft will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. the science payload is based on a large area detector (lad, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 kev, 240 ev spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a widefield monitor (wfm, 2-50 kev, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 ev spectral resolution). the wfm isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. grb) localization. thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. in this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its phase a study.

1412.4252	x-ray coherent pulsations during a sub-luminous accretion disk state of  the transitional millisecond pulsar xss j12270-4859	we present the first detection of x-ray coherent pulsations from thetransitional millisecond pulsar xss j12270-4859, while it was in a sub-luminousaccretion disk state characterized by a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 5e33 erg/s(assuming a distance of 1.4 kpc). pulsations were observed by xmm-newton at anrms amplitude of (7.7 +/- 0.5)% with a second harmonic stronger than the thefundamental frequency, and were detected when the source is neither flaring nordipping. the most likely interpretation of this detection is that matter fromthe accretion disk was channelled by the neutron star magnetosphere andaccreted onto its polar caps. according to standard disk accretion theory, forpulsations to be observed the mass in-flow rate in the disk was likely largerthan the amount of plasma actually reaching the neutron star surface; anoutflow launched by the fast rotating magnetosphere then probably took place,in agreement with the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution. we alsoreport about the non-detection of x-ray pulsations during a recent observationperformed while the source behaved as a rotationally-powered radio pulsar.

0805.1808	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. i. behavior  outside outbursts	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a new class of hmxbs discoveredthanks to the monitoring of the galactic plane performed with the integralsatellite in the last 5 years. these sources display short outbursts(significantly shorter than typical be/x-ray binaries) with a peak luminosityof a few 1e36 erg/s. the quiescent level, measured only in a few sources, isaround 1e32 erg/s. we are performing a monitoring campaign with swift of foursfxts (igrj16479-4514, xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 andaxj1841.0-0536/igrj18410-0535). we report on the first four months of swiftobservations, started on 2007 october 26. we detect a low level x-ray activityin all four sfxts which demonstrates that these transient sources accretematter even outside their outbursts. this fainter x-ray activity is composed ofmany flares with a large flux variability, on timescales of thousands ofseconds. the lightcurve variability is also evident on larger timescales ofdays, weeks and months, with a dynamic range of more than one order ofmagnitude in all four sfxts. the x-ray spectra are typically hard, with anaverage 2-10 kev luminosity during this monitoring of about 1e33-1e34 erg/s. wedetected pulsations from the pulsar axj1841.0-0536, with a period of4.7008+/-0.0004 s. this monitoring demonstrates that these transients spendmost of the time accreting matter, although at a much lower level (~100-1000times lower than during the bright outbusts), and that the true quiescence,characterized by a soft spectrum and a luminosity of a few 1e32 erg/s, observedin the past only in a couple of members of this class, is probably a very rarestate.

1512.03241	long term study of the double pulsar j0737-3039 with xmm-newton: pulsar  timing	the relativistic double neutron star binary psr j0737-3039 shows clearevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radioand x-rays. in this paper we present the results of timing analysis of psrj0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 xmm-newton large programs thatcollected ~20,000 x-ray counts from the system. we detected pulsations from psrj0737-3039a (psr a) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained byxmm-newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. psr a's pulseprofile in x-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spinprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. this yields aconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentumaxis delta_a ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radiodata. we confirmed pulsed emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) in x-rays evenafter its disappearance in radio. the unusual phenomenology of psr b's x-rayemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a lossof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. we hypothesize that this isdue to the interaction of psr a's wind with psr b's magnetosphere andorbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto psr b closed field lines.finally, the analysis of the full xmm-newton dataset provided evidences oforbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shockscenario between psr a's wind and psr b's magnetosphere.

0808.3464	long-term agile monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3eg  j1835+5918	we present the agile gamma-ray observations of the field containing thepuzzling gamma-ray source 3eg j1835+5918. this source is one of the mostremarkable unidentified egret sources. an unprecedentedly long agile monitoringof this source yields important information on the positional error box, fluxevolution, and spectrum. 3eg j1835+5918 has been in the agile field of viewseveral times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007sept 04 to 2008 june 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage. withan exposure time approximately twice that of egret, agile confirms theexistence of a prominent gamma-ray source (agl j1836+5926) at a positionconsistent with that of egret, although with a remarkably lower average fluxvalue for photon energies greater than 100 mev. a 5-day bin temporal analysisof the whole data set of agl j1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability ofthe gamma-ray flux. the source spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev can be fittedwith a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent withthe egret value. the faint x-ray source rx j1836.2+5925 that has been proposedas a possible counterpart of 3eg j1835+5918 is well within the agile error box.future continuous monitoring (both by agile and glast) is needed to confirm thegamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that iscurrently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.
