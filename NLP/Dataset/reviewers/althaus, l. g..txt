0901.1836	on the formation of hot dq white dwarfs	we present the first full evolutionary calculations aimed at exploring theorigin of hot dq white dwarfs. these calculations consistently cover the wholeevolution from the born-again stage to the white dwarf cooling track. ourcalculations provide strong support to the diffusive/convective-mixing picturefor the formation of hot dqs. we find that the hot dq stage is a short-livedstage and that the range of effective temperatures where hot dq stars are foundcan be accounted for by different masses of residual helium and/or differentinitial stellar masses. in the frame of this scenario, a correlation betweenthe effective temperature and the surface carbon abundance in dqs should beexpected, with the largest carbon abundances expected in the hottest dqs. fromour calculations, we suggest that most of the hot dqs could be the coolerdescendants of some pg1159 stars characterized by he-rich envelopes markedlysmaller than those predicted by the standard theory of stellar evolution. atleast for one hot dq, the high-gravity white dwarf sdss j142625.70+575218.4, anevolutionary link between this star and the massive pg1159 star h1504+65 isplausible.

0706.2571	the contribution of oxygen-neon white dwarfs to the macho content of the  galactic halo	the interpretation of microlensing results towards the large  magellanic cloud (lmc) still remains controversial. white dwarfs have beenproposed to explain these results and, hence, to contribute significantly tothe mass budget of our galaxy. however, several constraints on the role playedby regular carbon-oxygen white dwarfs exist. massivewhite dwarfs are thought tobe made of a mixture of oxygen and neon. correspondingly, their cooling rate islarger than those of typical carbon-oxygen white dwarfs and they fade toinvisibility in short timescales. consequently, they constitute a goodcandidate for explaining the microlensing results. here, we examine in detailthis hypothesis by using the most recent and up-to-date cooling tracks formassive white dwarfs and a monte carlo simulator which takes into account themost relevant galactic inputs. we find that oxygen-neon white dwarfs cannotaccount for a substantial fraction of the microlensing depth towards the lmc,independently of the adopted initial mass function, although some microlensingevents could be due to oxygen--neon white dwarfs. the white dwarf populationcontributes at most a 5% to the mass of the galactic halo.

0905.1939	evolution and colors of helium-core white dwarf stars with  high-metallicity progenitors	motivated by the recent detection of single and binary he-core white dwarfsin metal-rich clusters, we present a full set of evolutionary calculations andcolors appropriate for the study of such white dwarfs. the paper is also aimedat investigating whether stable hydrogen burning may constitute a main sourceof energy for massive he-core white dwarfs resulting from high-metallicityprogenitors. white dwarf sequences are derived by taking into account theevolutionary history of progenitor stars with supersolar metallicities. we alsoincorporate a self-consistent, time-dependent treatment of gravitationalsettling and chemical diffusion, as well as of the residual nuclear burning. wefind that the influence of residual nuclear burning during the late stages ofwhite dwarf evolution is strongly dependent on the occurrence of chemicaldiffusion at the base of the hydrogen-rich envelope. when no diffusion isconsidered, residual hydrogen burning strongly influences the advanced stagesof white dwarf cooling, introducing evolutionary delays of several gyr. bycontrast, when diffusion is taken into account the role of residual nuclearburning is strongly mitigated, and the evolution is dictated only by thethermal content stored in the ions. in addition, for all of our sequences, weprovide accurate color and magnitudes on the basis of new and improved non graymodel atmospheres which explicitly include ly$\alpha$ quasi-molecular opacity.

0906.2387	on the possible existence of short-period g-mode instabilities powered  by nuclear burning shells in post-agb h-deficient (pg1159-type) stars	we present a pulsational stability analysis of hot post-agb h-deficientpre-white dwarf stars with active he-burning shells. the stellar modelsemployed are state-of-the-art equilibrium structures representative of pg1159stars derived from the complete evolution of the progenitor stars. on the basisof fully nonadiabatic pulsation computations, we confirmed theoretical evidencefor the existence of a separate pg1159 instability strip in the $\log t_{\rmeff} - \log g$ diagram characterized by short-period $g$-modes excited by the$\epsilon$-mechanism. this instability strip partially overlaps the alreadyknown gw vir instability strip of intermediate/long period $g$-modesdestabilized by the classical $\kappa$-mechanism acting on the partialionization of c and/or o in the envelope of pg1159 stars. we found that pg1159stars characterized by thick he-rich envelopes and located inside thisoverlapping region could exhibit both short and intermediate/long periodssimultaneously. we study the particular case of vv 47, a pulsating planetarynebula nucleus that has been reported to exhibit a series of unusually shortpulsation periods. we found that the long periods exhibited by vv 47 can bereadily explained by the classical $\kappa$-mechanism, while the observedshort-period branch below $\approx 300$ s could correspond to modes triggeredby the he-burning shell through the $\epsilon$-mechanism, although moreobservational work is needed to confirm the reality of these short-periodmodes. were the existence of short-period $g$-modes in this star convincinglyconfirmed by future observations, vv 47 could be the first known pulsating starin which both the $\kappa$-mechanism and the $\epsilon$-mechanism of modedriving are simultaneously operating.

0907.3900	hot c-rich white dwarfs: testing the db-dq transition through pulsations	hot dq white dwarfs constitute a new class of white dwarf stars, uncoveredrecently within the framework of the sdss project. recently, three hot dq whitedwarfs have been reported to exhibit photometric variability with periodscompatible with pulsation g-modes. here, we present a nonadiabatic pulsationanalysis of the recently discovered carbon-rich hot dq white dwarf stars. oneof our main aims is to test the convective-mixing picture for the origin of hotdqs through the pulsational properties. our study relies on the fullevolutionary models of hot dq white dwarfs recently developed by althaus et al.(2009), that consistently cover the whole evolution from the born-again stageto the white dwarf cooling track. specifically, we present a stability analysisof white dwarf models from stages before the blue edge of the dbv instabilitystrip until the domain of the hot dq white dwarfs, including the transition db--&gt; hot dq white dwarf. we found that at evolutionary phases in which themodels are characterized by he-dominated atmospheres, they exhibit unstable$g$-mode pulsations typical of dbv stars, and when the models become dq whitedwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres, they continue being pulsationallyunstable with similar characteristics than db models, and in agreement with theperiods detected in variable hot dq white dwarfs. our calculations providestrong support to the convective-mixing picture for the formation of hot dqs.in particular, our results point to the existence of pulsating db white dwarfswith very thin he-rich envelopes, which after passing the dbv instability stripbecome variable hot dq stars. the existence of these db stars with very thinenvelopes could be investigated through asteroseismology.

1001.5248	axions and the pulsation periods of variable white dwarfs revisited	axions are the natural consequence of the introduction of the peccei-quinnsymmetry to solve the strong cp problem. all the efforts to detect such elusiveparticles have failed up to now. nevertheless, it has been recently shown thatthe luminosity function of white dwarfs is best fitted if axions with a mass ofa few mev are included in the evolutionary calculations. our aim is to showthat variable white dwarfs can provide additional and independent evidenceabout the existence of axions. the evolution of a white dwarf is a slow coolingprocess that translates into a secular increase of the pulsation periods ofsome variable white dwarfs, the so-called dav and dbv types. since axions canfreely escape from such stars, their existence would increase the cooling rateand, consequently, the rate of change of the periods as compared with thestandard ones. the present values of the rate of change of the pulsation periodof g117-b15a are compatible with the existence of axions with the massessuggested by the luminosity function of white dwarfs, in contrast with previousestimations. furthermore, it is shown that if such axions indeed exist, thedrift of the periods of pulsation of dbv stars would be noticeably perturbed.

1005.2612	new chemical profiles for the asteroseismology of zz ceti stars	we compute new chemical profiles for the core and envelope of white dwarfsappropriate for pulsational studies of zz ceti stars. these profiles areextracted from the complete evolution of progenitor stars, evolved through themain sequence and the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stages,and from time-dependent element diffusion during white dwarf evolution. wediscuss the importance of the initial-final mass relationship for the whitedwarf carbon-oxygen composition. in particular, we find that the central oxygenabundance may be underestimated by about 15% if the white dwarf mass is assumedto be the hydrogen-free core mass before the first thermal pulse. we alsodiscuss the importance for the chemical profiles expected in the outermostlayers of zz ceti stars of the computation of the thermally-pulsing agb phaseand of the phase in which element diffusion is relevant. we find a strongdependence of the outer layer chemical stratification on the stellar mass. inparticular, in the less massive models, the double-layered structure in thehelium layer built up during the thermally-pulsing agb phase is not removed bydiffusion by the time the zz ceti stage is reached. finally, we performadiabatic pulsation calculations and discuss the implications of our newchemical profiles for the pulsational properties of zz ceti stars. we find thatthe whole $g-$mode period spectrum and the mode-trapping properties of thesepulsating white dwarfs as derived from our new chemical profiles aresubstantially different from those based on chemical profiles widely used inexisting asteroseismological studies. thus, we expect the asteroseismologicalmodels derived from our chemical profiles to be significantly different fromthose found thus far.

1009.3254	lyman-alpha wing absorption in cool white dwarf stars	kowalski &amp; saumon (2006) identified the missing absorption mechanism in theobserved spectra of cool white dwarf stars as the ly-alpha red wing formed bythe collisions between atomic and molecular hydrogen and successfully explainedentire spectra of many cool da-type white dwarfs. owing to the importantastrophysical implications of this issue, we present here an independentassessment of the process. for this purpose, we compute free-freequasi-molecular absorption in lyman-alpha due to collisions with h and h2within the one-perturber, quasi-static approximation. line cross-sections areobtained using theoretical molecular potentials to describe the interactionbetween the radiating atom and the perturber. the variation of theelectric-dipole transition moment with the interparticle distance is alsoconsidered. six and two allowed electric dipole transitions due to h-h and h-h2collisions, respectively, are taken into account. the new theoreticallyman-alpha line profiles are then incorporated in our stellar atmosphereprogram for the computation of synthetic spectra and colours of da-type whitedwarfs. illustrative model atmospheres and spectral energy distributions arecomputed, which show that ly-alpha broadening by atoms and molecules has asignificant effect on the white dwarf atmosphere models. the inclusion of thiscollision-induced opacity significantly reddens spectral energy distributionsand affects the broadband colour indices for model atmospheres with teff&lt;5000k. these results confirm those previously obtained by kowalski &amp; saumon (2006).our study points out the need for reliable evaluations of h3 potential energysurfaces covering a large region of nuclear configurations, in order to obtaina better description of h-h2 collisions and a more accurate evaluation of theirinfluence on the spectrum of cool white dwarfs.

1101.0986	the evolution of white dwarfs with a varying gravitational constant	within the theoretical framework of some modern unification theories theconstants of nature are functions of cosmological time. white dwarfs offer thepossibility of testing a possible variation of g and, thus, to placeconstraints to these theories. we present full white dwarf evolutionarycalculations in the case that g decreases with time. white dwarf evolution iscomputed in a self-consistent way, including the most up-to-date physicalinputs, non-gray model atmospheres and a detailed core chemical compositionthat results from the calculation of the full evolution of progenitor stars. wefind that the mechanical structure and the energy balance of white dwarfs arestrongly modified by the presence of a varying g. in particular, for certainvalues of the rate of change of g, the evolution of cool white dwarfs ismarkedly affected. the impact of a varying g is more notorious in the case ofmore massive white dwarfs. in view of the recent results reporting that a veryaccurate white dwarf cooling age can be derived for the old and metal-rich opencluster ngc 6791, our study suggests that this cluster could be a potentialtarget to constrain or detect a ypothetical secular variation of g.

1104.0832	thermohaline mixing and the photospheric composition of low-mass giant  stars	we compute full evolutionary sequences of red giant branch stars close to theluminosity bump by including state of the art composition transportprescriptions for the thermohaline mixing regimes. in particular we adopt aself-consistent double-diffusive convection theory, that allows to handle theinstabilities that arise when thermal and composition gradients compete againsteach other, and a very recent empirically motivated and parameter freeasymptotic scaling law for thermohaline composition transport. in agreementwith previous works, we find that during the red giant stage, a thermohalineinstability sets in shortly after the hydrogen burning shell (hbs) encountersthe chemical discontinuity left behind by the first dredge-up. we also findthat the thermohaline unstable region, initially appearing at the exterior wingof the hbs, is unable to reach the outer convective envelope, with theconsequence that no mixing of elements that produces a non-canonicalmodification of the stellar surface abundances occurs. also in agreement withprevious works, we find that by artificially increasing the mixing efficiencyof thermohaline regions it is possible to connect both unstable regions, thusaffecting the photospheric composition. however, we find that in order toreproduce the observed abundances of red giant branch stars close to theluminosity bump, thermohaline mixing efficiency has to be artificiallyincreased by about 4 orders of magnitude from that predicted by recent 3dnumerical simulations of thermohaline convection close to astrophysicalenvironments. from this we conclude the chemical abundance anomalies of redgiant stars cannot be explained on the basis of thermohaline mixing alone.

1107.3016	the white dwarf cooling sequence of ngc 6791: a unique tool for stellar  evolution	ngc 6791 is a well-studied, metal-rich open cluster that is so close to usthat can be imaged down to luminosities fainter than that of the termination ofits white dwarf cooling sequence, thus allowing for an in-depth study of itswhite dwarf population. we use a monte carlo simulator that employs up-to-dateevolutionary cooling sequences for white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich andhydrogen-deficient atmospheres, with carbon-oxygen and helium cores. thecooling sequences for carbon-oxygen cores account for the delays introduced byboth ne^22 sedimentation in the liquid phase and by carbon-oxygen phaseseparation upon crystallization. we do not find evidence for a substantialfraction of helium-core white dwarfs, and hence our results support thesuggestion that the origin of the bright peak of the white dwarf luminosityfunction can only be attributed to a population of unresolved binary whitedwarfs. moreover, our results indicate that the number distribution ofsecondary masses of the population of unresolved binaries has to increase withincreasing mass ratio between the secondary and primary components of theprogenitor system. we also find that the observed cooling sequence appears tobe able to constrain the presence of progenitor sub-populations with differentchemical compositions and the fraction of non-da white dwarfs. our simulationsplace interesting constraints on important characteristics of the stellarpopulations of ngc 6791. in particular, we find that the fraction of singlehelium-core white dwarfs must be smaller than 5%, that a sub-population ofstars with zero metallicity must be &lt;12%, while if the adopted metallicity ofthe sub-population is solar the upper limit is ~8%. finally, we also find thatthe fraction of non-da white dwarfs in this particular cluster is surprinsinglysmall &lt;6%.

0710.3394	on the systematics of asteroseismological mass determinations of pg1159  stars	we analyze systematics in the asteroseismological mass determination methodsin pulsating pg 1159 stars. we compare the seismic masses resulting from thecomparison of the observed mean period spacings with the usually adoptedasymptotic period spacings, and the average of the computed period spacings.computations are based on full pg1159 evolutionary models with stellar massesranging from 0.530 to 0.741 mo that take into account the complete evolution ofprogenitor stars. we conclude that asteroseismology is a precise and powerfultechnique that determines the masses to a high internal accuracy, but itdepends on the adopted mass determination method. in particular, we find thatin the case of pulsating pg 1159 stars characterized by short pulsationperiods, like pg 2131+066 and pg 0122+200, the employment of the asymptoticperiod spacings overestimates the stellar mass by about 0.06 mo as comparedwith inferences from the average of the period spacings. in this case, thediscrepancy between asteroseismological and spectroscopical masses is markedlyreduced when use is made of the mean period spacing instead of the asymptoticperiod spacing.

1408.6708	pulsating low-mass white dwarfs in the frame of new evolutionary  sequences: i. adiabatic properties	the discovery of pulsations in some low-mass white dwarfs, including theso-called extremely low-mass white dwarfs, has opened the unprecedentedopportunity of probing the internal structure of these ancient stars. wepresent a detailed adiabatic pulsational study of these stars based on a newset of he-core white-dwarf models with masses ranging from $0.1554$ to $0.4352m_{\odot}$ derived by computing the non-conservative evolution of a binarysystem consisting of an initially $1 m_{\odot}$ zams star and a $1.4 m_{\odot}$neutron star. we computed adiabatic radial ($\ell= 0$) and non-radial ($\ell=1, 2$) $p$ and $g$ modes to assess the dependence of the pulsational propertiesof these objects on stellar parameters such as the stellar mass and theeffective temperature, as well as the effects of element diffusion. we foundthat for white dwarf models with masses below $\sim 0.18 m_{\odot}$, $g$ modesmainly probe the core regions and $p$ modes the envelope, therefore pulsationsoffer the opportunity of constraining both the core and envelope chemicalstructure of these stars via asteroseismology. for models with $m_* \gtrsim0.18 m_{\odot}$, on the other hand, $g$ modes are very sensitive to the he/hcompositional gradient and therefore can be used as a diagnostic tool forconstraining the h envelope thickness. because both types of objects have notonly very distinct evolutionary histories (according to whether the progenitorstars have experienced cno-flashes or not), but also have strongly differentpulsation properties, we propose to define white dwarfs with masses below $\sim0.18 m_{\odot}$ as elm (extremely low-mass) white dwarfs, and white dwarfs with$m_* \gtrsim 0.18 m_{\odot}$ as lm (low-mass) white dwarfs.

1408.6724	short-period $g$-mode pulsations in low-mass white dwarfs triggered by h  shell burning	the detection of pulsations in white dwarfs with low mass offers thepossibility of probing their internal structure through asteroseismology andplace constraints on the binary evolutionary processes involved in theirformation. in this paper we assess the impact of stable h burning on thepulsational stability properties of low-mass he-core white dwarf modelsresulting from binary star evolutionary calculations. we found that, apart froma dense spectrum of unstable radial modes and nonradial $g$- and $p$-modesdriven by the $\kappa$-mechanism due to the partial ionization of h in thestellar envelope, some unstable $g$-modes with short pulsation periods arepowered also by h burning via the $\varepsilon$-mechanism of mode driving. thisis the first time that $\varepsilon$-destabilized modes are found in modelsrepresentative of cool white dwarf stars. the short periods recently detectedin the pulsating low-mass white dwarf sdss j111215.82+111745.0 could constitutethe first evidence of the existence of stable h burning in these stars, inparticular in the so-called extremely low-mass white dwarfs.

1409.4216	fingering convection in red giants revisited	fingering (thermohaline) convection has been invoked for several years as apossible extra-mixing which could occur in red giant stars due to themodification of the chemical composition induced by nuclear reactions in thehydrogen burning zone. recent studies show however that this mixing is notsufficient to account for the needed surface abundances. a new prescription forfingering convection, based on 3d numerical simulations has recently beenproposed (bgs). the resulting mixing coefficient is larger than the onespreviously given in the literature. we compute models using this newcoefficient and compare them to previous studies. we use the lpcode stellarevolution code with the gna generalized version of the mixing length theory tocompute red giant models and we introduce fingering convection using the bgsprescription. the results show that, although the fingering zone now reachesthe outer dynamical convective zone, the efficiency of the mixing is not enoughto account for the observations. the fingering mixing coefficient should beincreased by two orders of magnitude for the needed surface abundances to bereached. we confirm that fingering convection cannot be the mixing processneeded to account for surface abundances in rgb stars.

1507.06208	revisiting the luminosity function of single halo white dwarfs	white dwarfs are the fossils left by the evolution of low-andintermediate-mass stars, and have very long evolutionary timescales. thisallows us to use them to explore the properties of old populations, like thegalactic halo. we present a population synthesis study of the luminosityfunction of halo white dwarfs, aimed at investigating which information can bederived from the currently available observed data. we employ an up-to-datepopulation synthesis code based on monte carlo techniques, that incorporatesthe most recent and reliable cooling sequences for metal poor progenitors aswell as an accurate modeling of the observational biases. we find that becausethe observed sample of halo white dwarfs is restricted to the brightest starsonly the hot branch of the white dwarf luminosity function can be used for suchpurposes, and that its shape function is almost insensitive to the mostrelevant inputs, like the adopted cooling sequences, the initial mass function,the density profile of the stellar spheroid, or the adopted fraction ofunresolved binaries. moreover, since the cut-off of the observed luminosity hasnot been yet determined only lower limits to the age of the halo population canbe placed. we conclude that the current observed sample of the halo white dwarfpopulation is still too small to obtain definite conclusions about theproperties of the stellar halo, and the recently computed white dwarf coolingsequences which incorporate residual hydrogen burning should be assessed usingmetal-poor globular clusters.

1507.08806	the white dwarf population of ngc 6397	ngc 6397 is one of the most interesting, well observed and theoreticallystudied globular clusters. the existing wealth of observations allows us tostudy the reliability of the theoretical white dwarf cooling sequences of lowmetallicity progenitors,to determine its age and the percentage of unresolvedbinaries, and to assess other important characteristics of the cluster, likethe slope of the initial mass function, or the fraction of white dwarfs withhydrogen deficient atmospheres. we present a population synthesis study of thewhite dwarf population of ngc 6397. in particular, we study the shape of thecolor-magnitude diagram, and the corresponding magnitude and colordistributions. we do this using an up-to-date monte carlo code thatincorporates the most recent and reliable cooling sequences and an accuratemodeling of the observational biases. we find a good agreement between ourtheoretical models and the observed data. in particular, we find that thisagreement is best for those cooling sequences that take into account residualhydrogen burning. this result has important consequences for the evolution ofprogenitor stars during the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase,since it implies that appreciable third dredge-up in low-mass, low-metallicityprogenitors is not expected to occur. using a standard burst duration of 1.0gyr, we obtain that the age of the cluster is 12.8+0.50-0.75 gyr. larger agesare also compatible with the observed data, but then realistic longer durationsof the initial burst of star formation are needed to fit the luminosityfunction. we conclude that a correct modeling of the white dwarf opulation ofglobular clusters, used in combination with the number counts of main sequencestars provides an unique tool to model the properties of globular clusters.

astro-ph;0012545	diffusion and the occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes in helium white  dwarf stars	we investigate the effects of element diffusion on the structure andevolution of low-mass helium white dwarfs (wd). attention is focused on theoccurrence of hydrogen shell flashes induced by diffusion processes duringcooling phases. initial models from 0.406 to 0.161 solar masses are constructedby applying mass loss rates at different stages of the rgb evolution of a solarmodel. the multicomponent flow equations describing gravitational settling, andchemical and thermal diffusion are solved and the diffusion calculations arecoupled to an evolutionary code. in addition, the same sequences are computedbut neglecting diffusion. we find that element diffusion strongly affects thestructure and cooling history of helium wd. in particular, diffusion inducesthe occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes in models with masses ranging from0.18 to 0.41 solar masses, which is in sharp contrast from the situation whendiffusion is neglected. in connection with the further evolution, thesediffusion-induced flashes lead to much thinner hydrogen envelopes, preventingstable nuclear burning from being an appreciable energy source at advancedstages of evolution. this implies much shorter cooling ages than in the casewhen diffusion is neglected. these new wd models are discussed in light ofrecent observational data of some millisecond pulsar systems with wdcompanions. we find that age discrepancies between the predictions of standardevolutionary models and such observations appear to be the result of ignoringelement diffusion in such models. indeed, such discrepancies vanish whenaccount is made of diffusion.

astro-ph;0104103	the potential of the variable da white dwarf g117-b15a as a tool for  fundamental physics	white dwarfs are well studied objects. the relative simplicity of theirphysics allows to obtain very detailed models which can be ultimately comparedwith their observed properties. among white dwarfs there is a specific class ofstars, known as zz-ceti objects, which have a hydrogen-rich envelope and showperiodic variations in their light curves. g117-b15a belongs to this particularset of stars. the luminosity variations have been successfully explained as dueto g-mode pulsations. g117-b15a has been recently claimed to be the most stableoptical clock ever found, being the rate of change of its 215.2 s period verysmall: \dot{p}= (2.3 +- 1.4)x10^{-15} s s^-1, with a stability comparable tothat of the most stable millisecond pulsars. the rate of change of the periodis closely related to its cooling timescale, which can be accurately computed.in this paper we study the pulsational properties of g117-b15a and we use theobserved rate of change of the period to impose constraints on the axionemissivity and, thus, to obtain a preliminary upper bound to the mass of theaxion. this upper bound turns out to be 4cos^{2}{\beta} mev at the 95%confidence level. although there are still several observational andtheoretical uncertainties, we conclude that g117-b15a is a very promisingstellar object to set up constraints on particle physics.

astro-ph;0110662	calculation of the masses of the binary star hd 93205 by application of  the theory of the apsidal motion	we present a method to calculate masses for components of both eclipsing andnon-eclipsing binary systems as long as their apsidal motion rates areavailable. the method is based on the fact that the equation that gives therate of apsidal motion is a supplementary equation that allows the computationof the masses of the components, if the radii and the internal structureconstants of them can be obtained from theoretical models. for this reason theuse of this equation makes the method presented here model dependent.  we apply this method to calculate the mass of the components of thenon-eclipsing massive binary system hd 93205 (o3v+o8v), which is suspected tobe a very young system. to this end, we computed a grid of evolutionary modelscovering the mass range of interest, and taking the mass of the primary (m_1)as the only independent variable, we solve the equation of apsidal motion form_1 as a function of the age of the system. the mass of the primary we findranges from m_1= 60+-19 msun for zams models, which sets an upper limit form_1, down to m_1= 40+-9 msun for an age of 2 myr. accordingly, the upper limitderived for the mass of the secondary (m_2= q m_1) is m_2= 25 msun is in verygood agreement with the masses derived for other o8v stars occurring ineclipsing binaries.

astro-ph;0205084	improved synthetic spectra of helium-core white dwarf stars	we examine the emergent fluxes from helium-core white dwarfs following theirevolution from the end of pre-white dwarf stages down to advanced coolingstages. for this purpose, we include a detailed treatment of the physics of theatmosphere, particularly an improved representation of the state of the gas bytaking into account non-ideal effects according to the so-called occupationprobability formalism. the present calculations also incorporate hydrogen lineopacity from lyman, balmer and paschen series, pseudo-continuum absorptions andnew updated induced-dipole absorption from h$_2$-h$_2$, h$_2$-he and h-hepairs. we find that the non-ideal effects and line absorption alter theappearance of the stellar spectrum and have a significant influence upon thephotometric colours in the ubvri-jhkl system. this occurs specially for hotmodels $t_{\rm eff}\ga 8000$ due to line and pseudo-continuum opacities, andfor cool models $t_{\rm eff}\la 4000$ where the perturbation of atoms andmolecules by neighbour particles affects the chemical equilibrium of the gas.in the present study, we also include new cooling sequences for helium-corewhite dwarfs of very low mass (0.160 and 0.148 m$_\odot$) with metallicity$z=0.02$. these computations provide theoretical support to search for andidentify white dwarfs of very low mass, specially useful for recent and futureobservational studies of globular cluster, where these objects have began to bedetected.

astro-ph;0603846	full evolutionary models for pg1159 stars. implications for the  helium-rich o(he) stars	we present full evolutionary calculations appropriate to post-agb pg1159stars for a wide range of stellar masses.  we take into account the complete evolutionary stages of pg1159 progenitorsstarting from the zero age main sequence. we consider the two kinds of bornagain scenarios, the very late thermal pulse (vltp) and the late thermal pulse(ltp), that give rise to hydrogen-deficient compositions. the location of ourpg1159 tracks in the effective temperature - gravity diagram and theircomparison with previous calculations as well as the resulting surfacecompositions are discussed at some length.  our results reinforce the idea that the different abundances of $^{14}$nobserved at the surface of those pg1159 stars with undetected hydrogen is anindication that the progenitors of these stars would have evolved through avltp episode, where most of the hydrogen content of the remnant is burnt, orltp, where hydrogen is not burnt but instead diluted to very low surfaceabundances. we derive new values for spectroscopical masses based on these newmodels. we discuss the correlation between the presence of planetary nebulaeand the $^{14}$n abundance as another indicator that $^{14}$n-rich objectsshould come from a vltp episode while $^{14}$n-deficient ones should be theresult of a ltp. finally, we discuss an evolutionary scenario that couldexplain the existence of pg1159 stars with unusually high helium abundances anda possible evolutionary connection between these stars and the low mass o(he)stars.

astro-ph;0607012	new nonadiabatic pulsation computations on full pg1159 evolutionary  models: the theoretical gw vir instability strip revisited	we reexamine the theoretical instability domain of pulsating pg1159 stars (gwvir variables). we performed an extensive g-mode stability analysis on pg1159evolutionary models with stellar masses ranging from 0.530 to 0.741 mo forwhich the complete evolutionary stages of their progenitors from the zams,through the thermally pulsing agb and born-again phases to the domain of thepg1159 stars have been considered. we found that pulsations in pg1159 stars areexcited by the kappa-mechanism due to partial ionization of carbon and oxygen,and that no composition gradients are needed between the surface layers and thedriving region, much in agreement with previous studies. we show, for the firsttime, the existence of a red edge of the instability strip at highluminosities. we found that all of the gw vir stars lay within our theoreticalinstability strip. our results suggest a qualitative good agreement between theobserved and the predicted ranges of unstable periods of individual stars.finally, we found that generally the seismic masses (derived from the periodspacing) of gw vir stars are somewhat different from the masses suggested byevolutionary tracks coupled with spectroscopy. improvements in the evolutionduring the thermally pulsing agb phase and/or during the core helium burningstage and early agb could help to alleviate the persisting discrepancies.

astro-ph;0610420	asteroseismological constraints on the pulsating planetary nebula  nucleus (pg1159-type) rx j2117.1+3412	we present asteroseismological inferences on rx j2117.1+3412, the hottestknown pulsating pg1159 star. our results are based on full pg1159 evolutionarymodels recently presented by miller bertolami &amp; althaus (2006). we performedextensive computations of adiabatic g-mode pulsation periods on pg1159evolutionary models with stellar masses ranging from 0.530 to 0.741 mo. pg1159stellar models are extracted from the complete evolution of progenitor starsstarted from the zams, through the thermally pulsing agb and born-again phasesto the domain of the pg 1159 stars. we constrained the stellar mass of rxj2117.1+3412 by comparing the observed period spacing with the asymptoticperiod spacing and with the average of the computed period spacings. we alsoemployed the individual observed periods to find a representative seismologicalmodel. we derive a stellar mass of 0.56-0.57 mo from the period spacing dataalone. in addition, we found a best-fit model representative for rxj2117.1+3412 with an effective temperature of 163,400 k, a stellar mass of0.565 mo, and a surface gravity log g= 6.61. the derived stellar luminosity andradius are log(l/lo)= 3.36 and log(r/ro)= -1.23, respectively, and the he-richenvelope thickness is menv= 0.02 mo. we derive a seismic distance of 452 pc anda linear size of the planetary nebula of 1.72 pc. these inferences seem tosolve the discrepancy between the rx j2117.1+3412 evolutionary timescale andthe size of the nebula. all of the seismological tools we use concur to theconclusion that rx j2117.1+3412 must have a stellar mass of 0.565 mo much inagreement with recent asteroseismology studies and in clear conflict with thepredictions of spectroscopy plus evolutionary tracks.

astro-ph;0703339	low-mass, helium-enriched pg1159 stars: a possible evolutionary origin  and the implications for their pulsational stability properties	we examine a recently-proposed evolutionary scenario that could explain theexistence of the low-mass, helium-enriched pg1159 stars. we assess theoverstability of pulsation g-modes of stellar models as evolution proceedsalong the pg1159 domain. stellar models are extracted from the full evolutionof a 1 mo model star that experiences its first thermal pulse as a late thermalpulse (ltp) after leaving the agb. the evolutionary stages corresponding to theborn-again episode and the subsequent helium sub-flashes are taken into accountin detail. under reasonable mass-loss rate assumptions, the evolutionaryscenario reproduces the high helium abundances observed in some pg1159 stars.we find that, despite the high helium abundance in the driving layers, thereexists a narrow region in the log g-log teff diagram for which thehelium-enriched pg1159 sequence exhibits unstable pulsation modes with periodsin the range 500 to 1600 s. in particular, the nonpulsating helium-enrichedpg1159 star, mct 0130-1937, is located outside the theoretical instabilitydomain. our results suggest that mct 0130-1937 is a real non-pulsating star andthat the lack of pulsations should not be attributed to unfavorable geometry.our study hints at a consistent picture between the evolutionary scenario thatcould explain the existence of helium-enriched pg1159 stars and the nonvariablenature of mct 0130-1937. we also present theoretical support for the unusuallyhigh helium abundance observed in the nonpulsating pg1159 star hs 1517+7403. wesuggest that hs 1517+7403 could be a transition object linking the low-masshelium-rich o(he) stars with the helium-enriched pg1159 stars via theevolutionary connection k1-27--&gt;hs 1517+7403--&gt;mct 0130-1937.

astro-ph;9811414	grids of white dwarf evolutionary models with masses from m= 0.1 to 1.2  ms	we present detailed evolutionary calculations for carbon  - oxygen - and helium - core white dwarf (wd) models with masses ranging fromm= 0.1 to m= 1.2 solar masses and for metallicities z= 0.001 and z= 0. thesequences cover a wide range of hydrogen envelopes as well. we employed adetailed wd evolutionary code. in particular, the energy transport byconvectcion is treated within the formalism of the full spectrum turbulencetheory. the set of models presented here is very detailed and should bevaluable for the interpretation of the observational data on low - mass wdsrecently discovered in numerous binary configurations and also for the generalproblem of determining the theoretical luminosity function for wds. in thiscontext, we compare our cooling sequences with the observed wd luminosityfunction recently improved by leggett, ruiz and bergeron (1998) and we obtainan age for the galactic disc of approximately 8 gyr. finally, we applied theresults of this paper to derive stellar masses of a sample of low - mass whitedwarfs.

astro-ph;9812062	evolution of da white dwarfs in the context of a new theory of  convection	in this study we compute the structure and evolution of carbon-oxygen dawhite dwarfs by means of a detailed and updated evolutionary code. we treat theenergy transport by convection within the formalism of the full spectrumturbulence theory, as given by the canuto, goldman and mazzitelli (cgm) model.we explore the effect of various hydrogen layer masses on both the surfacegravity and the hydrogen burning. convective mixing at low luminosities is alsoconsidered. one of our main interests in this work has been to study theevolution of zz ceti models, with the aim of comparing the cgm and mixinglength theory (mlt) predictions. in this connection, we find that thetemperature profile given by the cgm model is markedly different from that ofthe ml1 and ml2 versions of mlt. we have also computed approximate effectivetemperatures for the theoretical blue edge of the da instability strip by usingthermal timescale arguments for our evolving models. in this context, we foundthat the cgm theory leads to blue edges that are cooler than the observed ones.however, because the determination of the atmospheric parameters of zz cetistars is dependent on the assumed convection description in model atmospherecalculation, observed blue edges computed considering the cgm theory arerequired in order to perform a sef consistent comparison of our results withobservations. finally, detailed pulsation calculations of zz ceti modelsconsidering the cgm convection would be necessary to place the results found inthis paper on a firmer basis.

0810.4828	modeling he-rich subdwarfs through the hot-flasher scenario (brief  version)	we present 1d numerical simulations aimed at studying the hot-flasherscenario for the formation of he-rich subdwarf stars. sequences were calculatedfor a wide range of metallicities and with the he core flash at differentpoints of the post-rgb evolution (i.e. different remnant masses). we followedthe complete evolution from the zams, through the hot-flasher event, and to thesubdwarf stage for all kinds of hot-flashers. this allows us to present ahomogeneous set of abundances for different metallicities and all flavors ofhot-flashers. we extend the scope of our work by analyzing the effects in thepredicted surface abundances of some standard assumptions in convective mixingand the effects of element diffusion.  we find that the hot-flasher scenario is a viable explanation for theformation of he-sdo stars. our results also show that element diffusion mayproduce the transformation of (post hot-flasher) he-rich atmospheres intohe-deficient ones. if this is so, then the hot-flasher scenario is able toreproduce both the observed properties and distribution of he-sdo stars.

0706.0713	on the robustness of h-deficient post-agb tracks	we analyze the robustness of h--deficient post--agb tracks regarding previousevolution of their progenitor stars and the constitutive physics of theremnants. our motivation is a recent suggestion of werner &amp; herwig (2006) thatprevious evolution should be important in shaping the final post--agb track andthe persisting discrepancy between asteroseismological and spectroscopical massdeterminations. this work is thus complementary to our previous work (millerbertolami &amp; althaus 2006) and intends to shed some light on the uncertaintybehind the evolutionary tracks presented there. we compute full evolutionarymodels for pg1159 stars taking into account different extramixing(overshooting) efficiencies and lifetimes on the tp-agb during the progenitorevolution. we also assess the effect of possible differences in the opacitiesand equation of state by artificially changing them before the pg1159 stage.also comparisons are made with the few h-deficient post--agb tracks availablein the literature. contrary to our expectations, we found that previousevolution is not a main factor in shaping h--deficient post--agb tracks.interestingly enough, we find that only an increase of $\sim50%$ in theintershell opacities at high effective temperatures may affect the tracks as toreconcile spectroscopic and asteroseismologic mass determinations. this forcesus to conclude that our previous tracks (miller bertolami &amp; althaus 2006) arerobust enough as to be used for spectroscopic mass determinations, unlessopacities in the intershell region are substantially different. our results,then, call for an analysis of possible systematics in the usually adoptedasteroseismological mass determination methods.

0811.4154	on the origin of white dwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres: the  case of h1504+65	we explore different evolutionary scenarios to explain the helium deficiencyobserved in h1504+65, the most massive known pg1159 star. we concentrate mainlyon the possibility that this star could be the result of mass loss shortlyafter the born-again and during the subsequent evolution through the [wcl]stage. this possibility is sustained by recent observational evidence ofextensive mass-loss events in sakurai's object and is in line with the recentfinding that such mass losses give rise to pg1159 models with thin helium-richenvelopes and large rates of period change, as demanded by the pulsating starpg1159-035. we compute the post born again evolution of massive sequences bytaking into account different mass-loss rate histories. our results show thatstationary winds during the post-born-again evolution fail to remove completelythe helium-rich envelope so as to explain the helium deficiency observed inh1504+65. stationary winds during the sakurai and [wcl] stages only remove atmost half of the envelope surviving the violent hydrogen burning during theborn-again phase. in view of our results, the recently suggested evolutionaryconnection born-again stars --&gt; h1504+65 --&gt; white dwarfs with carbon-richatmospheres is difficult to sustain unless the whole helium-rich envelope couldbe ejected by non-stationary mass-loss episodes during the sakurai stage.
