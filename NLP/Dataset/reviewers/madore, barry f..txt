0901.2907	the cepheid period-luminosity relation (the leavitt law) at mid-infrared  wavelengths: iv. cepheids in ic 1613	we present mid-infrared period-luminosity relations for cepheids in the localgroup galaxy ic1613. using archival irac imaging data from spitzer we were ableto measure single-epoch magnitudes for five, 7 to 50-day, cepheids at 3.6 and4.5 microns. when fit to the calibrating relations, measured for the largemagellanic cloud cepheids, the data give apparent distance moduli of 24.29 +/-0.07 and 24.28 +/- 0.07 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively. amulti-wavelength fit to previously published bvrijhk apparent moduli and thetwo irac moduli gives a true distance modulus of 24.27 +/- 0.02 mag with e(b-v)= 0.08 mag, and a corresponding metric distance of 715 kpc. given that theseresults are based on single-phase observations derived from exposures havingtotal integration times of only 1,000 sec/pixel we suggest that cepheids out toabout 2 mpc are accessible to spitzer with modest integration times during itswarm mission. we identify the main limiting factor to this method to becrowding/contamination induced by the ubiquitous population of infrared-brightagb stars.

0902.0609	the he-rich core-collapse supernova 2007y: observations from x-ray to  radio wavelengths	a detailed study spanning approximately a year has been conducted on the typeib supernova 2007y. imaging was obtained from x-ray to radio wavelengths, and acomprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u'g'r'i'ubvyjhks) light curves andoptical spectroscopy is presented. a virtually complete bolometric light curveis derived, from which we infer a (56)ni-mass of 0.06 m_sun. the early spectrumstrongly resembles sn 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of caii andh_alpha; during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of a ejecta-windinteraction. nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit profilesthat indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. late phase spectra aremodeled with a non-lte code, from which we find (56)ni, o and total-ejectamasses (excluding he) to be 0.06, 0.2 and 0.42 m_sun, respectively, below 4,500km/s. the (56)ni mass confirms results obtained from the bolometric lightcurve. the oxygen abundance suggests the progenitor was most likely a ~3.3m_sun he core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10-13m_sun. the explosion energy is determined to be ~10^50 erg, and the mass-lossrate of the progenitor is constrained from x-ray and radio observations to be&lt;~10^-6 m_sun/yr. sn 2007y is among the least energetic normal type ibsupernovae ever studied.

0706.3424	keck/deimos spectroscopy of a galex uv selecte sample from the medium  imaging survey	we report results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopy for objectsdetected in the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium imaging survey (mis).our study examines the properties of galaxies detected by galex fainter thanthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic survey. this is the firststudy to extend the techinques of salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,star formation rates (sfr) and the b (star formation history) parameter forstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. we obtain redshifts for 50 galex missources reaching nuv=23.9 (ab mag), having counterparts in the sdss datarelease 4 (dr4). of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z&lt;0.7, 3 haveemission line ratios indicative of agn with z&lt;0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 areqsos, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. we compare our sample to a muchlarger sample of ~50,000 matched galex/sdss galaxies with sdss spectroscopy;while our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3magnitudes fainter in sdss r magnitude than the sdss spectroscopic sample. weuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the samplecontains mostly star-forming galaxies. the galaxies in the sample populate theblue sequence in the nuv-r vs m_r color-magnitude diagram. our sample has sfrs,luminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faintcompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by koo et.al 1995, guzman et. al 1996 &amp; phillips et. al 1997. however, our sample is ~2mag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. we find thatthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent witha recent starburst within the last 100 myr.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0910.3317	the carnegie supernova project: analysis of the first sample of  low-redshift type-ia supernovae	we present the analysis of the first set of low-redshift type ia supernovae(sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project. well-sampled, high-precisionoptical (ugribv) and near-infrared (nir; yjhks) light curves obtained in awell-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters,and ugribvyjh template light curves. the intrinsic colors at maximum light arecalibrated to compute optical--nir color excesses for the full sample, thusallowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to bestudied. a low value of rv~1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of sne.however, when the two highly reddened sne in the sample are excluded, a valuegalactic standard of rv~3.2 is obtained. the colors of these two events arewell matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. the peakluminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the declinerates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. in both cases,dispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending onthe filter-color combination. in contrast to the results obtained from colorexcesses, these fits give rv~1--2, even when the two highly reddened sne areexcluded. this discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellarreddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion inthe colors of sne ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of thedecline rate. finally, a hubble diagram is produced by combining the results ofthe fits for each filter. the resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to belimited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation betweenthe distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. the implication isthat the actual precision of sn ia distances is 3--4%.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1005.3462	star formation timescales and the schmidt law	we offer a simple parameterization of the rate of star formation in galaxies.in this new approach, we make explicit and decouple the timescales associated(a) with disruptive effects the star formation event itself, from (b) thetimescales associated with the cloud assembly and collapse mechanisms leadingup to star formation. the star formation law in near-by galaxies, as measuredon sub-kiloparsec scales, has recently been shown by bigiel et al. to bedistinctly non-linear in its dependence on total gas density. ourparameterization of the spatially resolved schmidt-sanduleak relation naturallyaccommodates that dependence. the parameterized form of the relation is rho_* ~epsilon x rho_g/(tau_s + rho_g ^{-n}), where rho_g is the gas density, epsilonis the efficiency of converting gas into stars, and rho_g^{-n} captures thephysics of cloud collapse. accordingly at high gas densities quiescent starformation is predicted to progress as rho_* ~ rho_g, while at low gas densitiesrho_* ~ rho_g^{1+n}, as is now generally observed. a variable efficiency inlocally converting gas into stars as well as the unknown plane thicknessvariations from galaxy to galaxy, and radially within a given galaxy, canreadily account for the empirical scatter in the observed (surface densityrather than volume density) relations, and also plausibly account for the notedupturn in the relation at very high apparent projected column densities.

1006.5447	the galex arecibo sdss survey ii: the star formation efficiency of  massive galaxies	we use measurements of the hi content, stellar mass and star formation ratesin ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun, obtainedfrom the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) described in paper i (catinella etal. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with thebin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the hi mass, which we callthe hi-based star formation efficiency (sfe). unlike the mean specific starformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surfacedensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across thesample with a value close to sfe = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gasconsumption timescale of ~3 gyr). specifically, we find little variation in sfewith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, nuv-r color and concentration.we interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedbackmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating starformation in massive galaxies. an investigation into the detailed distributionof sfes reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencieswith sfe &gt; 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to adeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. conversely,we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich fortheir given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both ahigher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formationrate. both of these populations are plausible candidates for "transition"galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in theirspecific star formation rate in the near future. we also find that 36+/-5% ofthe total hi mass density and 47+/-5% of the total sfr density is found ingalaxies with stellar mass greater than 10^10 msun.

(2) an offset between datasets that use kronor petrosian photometry regardless of the filter. (3) the decision to usecircular or elliptical apertures causes an offset in m* of 0.20mag.

1010.1592	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s^4g)	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies s^4g is an explorationscience legacy program approved for the spitzer post-cryogenic mission. it is avolume-, magnitude-, and size-limited (d &lt; 40 mpc, |b| &gt; 30 degrees, m_(bcorr)&lt; 15.5, d25&gt;1') survey of 2,331 galaxies using irac at 3.6 and 4.5 microns.each galaxy is observed for 240 s and mapped to &gt; 1.5 x d25. the finalmosaicked images have a typical 1 sigma rms noise level of 0.0072 and 0.0093mjy / sr at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively. our azimuthally-averaged surfacebrightness profile typically traces isophotes at mu_3.6 (ab) (1 sigma) ~ 27 magarcsec^-2, equivalent to a stellar mass surface density of ~ 1 msun pc^-2. s^4gthus provides an unprecedented data set for the study of the distribution ofmass and stellar structures in the local universe. this paper introduces thesurvey, the data analysis pipeline and measurements for a first set ofgalaxies, observed in both the cryogenic and warm mission phase of spitzer. forevery galaxy we tabulate the galaxy diameter, position angle, axial ratio,inclination at mu_3.6 (ab) = 25.5 and 26.5 mag arcsec^-2 (equivalent to ~ mu_b(ab) =27.2 and 28.2 mag arcsec^-2, respectively). these measurements will formthe initial s^4g catalog of galaxy properties. we also measure the totalmagnitude and the azimuthally-averaged radial profiles of ellipticity, positionangle, surface brightness and color. finally, we deconstruct each galaxy usinggalfit into its main constituent stellar components: the bulge/spheroid, disk,bar, and nuclear point source, where necessary. together these data productswill provide a comprehensive and definitive catalog of stellar structures, massand properties of galaxies in the nearby universe.

1010.4040	the carnegie supernova project: light curve fitting with snoopy	in providing an independent measure of the expansion history of the universe,the carnegie supernova project (csp) has observed 71 high-z type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the near-infrared bands y and j. these can be used to constructrest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yielddistance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-ratecorrections than in the optical. however, working with nir observed and i-bandrest frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated thedevelopment of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyzeboth the low-z and high-z csp sample. we present in this paper the methods usedto generate ubvgriyjh light-curve templates based on a sample of 24high-quality low-z csp sne. we also present two methods for determining thedistances to the hosts of sn ia events. a larger sample of 30 low-z sne ia inthe hubble flow are used to calibrate these methods. we then apply the methodand derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motionsare not dominated by the hubble flow.

1011.2942	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies. v. the dust and  pah emission seds of disk galaxies	we present a self-consistent model of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of spiral galaxies from the ultraviolet (uv) to the mid-infrared(mir)/far-infrared (fir)/submillimeter (submm) based on a full radiativetransfer calculation of the propagation of starlight in galaxy disks. thismodel predicts not only the total integrated energy absorbed in the uv/opticaland re-emitted in the infrared/submm, but also the colours of the dust emissionbased on an explicit calculation of the strength and colour of the uv/opticalradiation fields heating the dust, and incorporating a full calculation of thestochastic heating of small dust grains and pah molecules.  the geometry of the translucent components of the model is empiricallyconstrained using the results from the radiation transfer analysis of xilouriset al. on spirals in the middle range of the hubble sequence, while thegeometry of the optically thick components is constrained from physicalconsiderations with a posteriori checks of the model predictions withobservational data.  these geometrical constraints enable the dust emission to be predicted interms of a minimum set of free parameters: the central face-on dust opacity inthe b-band tau^f_b, a clumpiness factor f for the star-forming regions, thestar-formation rate sfr, the normalised luminosity of the old stellarpopulation old and the bulge-to-disk ratio b/d. we show that these parametersare almost orthogonal in their predicted effect on the colours of the dust/pahemission.  the results of the calculations are made available in the form of a largelibrary of simulated dust emission seds spanning the whole parameter space ofour model, together with the corresponding library of dust attenuationcalculated using the same model.

1011.3512	the extreme hosts of extreme supernovae	we use galex ultraviolet (uv) and optical integrated photometry of the hostsof seventeen luminous supernovae (lsne, having peak m_v &lt; -21) and compare themto a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the sdss dr4 spectralcatalog and galex interim release 1.1. we place the lsne hosts on the galaxynuv-r versus m_r color magnitude diagram (cmd) with the larger sample toillustrate how extreme they are. the lsn hosts appear to favor low-densityregions of the galaxy cmd falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward thelow luminosity end. from the uv-optical photometry, we estimate the starformation history of the lsn hosts. the hosts have moderately low starformation rates (sfrs) and low stellar masses (m_*) resulting in high specificstar formation rates (ssfr). compared with the larger sample, the lsn hostsoccupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting ssfr versus m_* in the areahaving higher ssfr and lower m_*. this preference for low m_*, high ssfr hostsimplies the lsne are produced by an effect having to do with their localenvironment. the correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhapswind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents lsne from arising inhigher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. the massive progenitors of the lsne(&gt;100 m_sun), by appearing in low-sfr hosts, are potential tests for theoriesof the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on thesfr.

0709.0730	the star formation and extinction co-evolution of uv-selected galaxies  over 0.05&lt;z&lt;1.2	we use a new stacking technique to obtain mean mid ir and far ir to far uvflux ratios over the rest near-uv/near-ir color-magnitude diagram. we employcombo-17 redshifts and combo-17 optical, galex far and near uv, spitzer iracand mips mid ir photometry. this technique permits us to probe infrared excess(irx), the ratio of far ir to far uv luminosity, and specific star formationrate (ssfr) and their co-evolution over two orders of magnitude of stellar massand redshift 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2. we find that the ssfr and the characteristic mass (m_0)above which the ssfr drops increase with redshift (downsizing). at any givenepoch, irx is an increasing function of mass up to m_0. above this mass irxfalls, suggesting gas exhaustion. in a given mass bin below m_0 irx increaseswith time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. we interpret these trendsusing a simple model with a schmidt-kennicutt law and extinction that tracksgas density and enrichment. we find that the average irx and ssfr follows agalaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and timesince formation. we conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties whichshow simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-upof heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and theexhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. the irxrepresents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.

1101.6051	the recent star formation in ngc 6822: an ultraviolet study	we characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy ngc 6822over the past few hundred million years, using galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 a)and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 a) imaging, and ground-based ha imaging. from galexfuv image, we define 77 star-forming (sf) regions with area &gt;860 pc^2, andsurface brightness &lt;=26.8 mag(ab)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of thecenter of the galaxy. we estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in eachsf region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: e(b-v) rangesfrom the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. theintegrated fuv and nuv photometry, compared with stellar population models,yields ages of the sf complexes up to a few hundred myr, and masses from 2x10^2msun to 1.5x10^6 msun. the derived ages and masses strongly depend on theassumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary acrossthe galaxy. the total mass of the fuv-defined sf regions translates into anaverage star formation rate (sfr) of 1.4x10^-2 msun/yr over the past 100 myr,and sfr=1.0x10^-2 msun/yr in the most recent 10 myr. the latter is in agreementwith the value that we derive from the ha luminosity, sfr=0.008 msun/yr. thesfr in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the sfr=0.02 msun/yrinferred from far-ir measurements, which trace star formation still embedded indust (age &lt;= a few myr).

1103.6235	two new tests of the metallicity sensitivity of the cepheid  period-luminosity relation (the leavitt law)	we undertake a new test of the metallicity sensitivity of the leavitt law forclassical cepheids. we derive an empirical calibration of the apparentluminosities of cepheids as measured from the optical through the mid-infrared(0.45-8.0um) as a function of spectroscopic [fe/h] abundances of individualcepheids in the large magellanic cloud from romaniello et al. (2008). thecumulative trend over the entire wavelength range shows a nearly monotonicbehavior. the sense of the trend is consistent with differentialline-blanketing in the optical, leading to stars of high metallicity beingfainter in the optical. this is followed by a reversal in the trend at longerwavelengths, with the cross-over occurring near the k band at about 2.2um,consistent with a subsequent redistribution of energy resulting in a mildbrightening of cepheids (with increased metallicity) at mid-infraredwavelengths. this conclusion agrees with that of romaniello et al. based on adifferential comparison of the mean v- and k-band leavitt laws for the galaxy,smc and lmc, but is opposite in sign to most other empirical tests of thesensitivity of cepheid distances to mean [o/h] hii region abundances. we alsosearch for a correlation of cepheid host-galaxy metallicity with deviations ofthe galaxy's cepheid distance from that predicted from a pure hubble flow.based on cepheid distances to 26 nearby galaxies in the local flow, only a veryweak signal is detected giving dmu_o = -0.17 (+/- 0.31) ([o/h] - 8.80) - 0.21(+/-0.10). this is in agreement with previous determinations, but statisticallyinconclusive.

1108.4672	the carnegie hubble program: the leavitt law at 3.6 \mu m and 4.5 \mu m  in the large magellanic cloud	the carnegie hubble program (chp) is designed to improve the extragalacticdistance scale using data from the post-cryogenic era of spitzer. the ultimategoal is a determination of the hubble constant to an accuracy of 2%. this paperis the first in a series on the cepheid population of the large magellaniccloud, and focusses on the period-luminosity relations (leavitt laws) that willbe used, in conjunction with observations of milky way cepheids, to set theslope and zero--point of the cepheid distance scale in the mid-infrared. tothis end, we have obtained uniformly-sampled light curves for 85 lmc cepheids,having periods between 6 and 140 days. period-luminosity and period-colorrelations are presented in the 3.6 \mu m and 4.5\mu m bands. we demonstratethat the 3.6 \mu m band is a superb distance indicator. the cyclical variationof the [3.6]-[4.5] color has been measured for the first time. we attribute theamplitude and phase of the color curves to the dissociation and recombinationof co molecules in the cepheid's atmosphere. the co affects only the 4.5 \mu mflux making it a potential metallicity indicator.

1110.3789	unburned material in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	(abridged) the presence of unburned material in the ejecta of normal type iasupernovae (sneia) is investigated using early-time spectroscopy obtained bythe csp. the tell-tale signature of pristine material from a c+o white dwarfprogenitor star is the presence of carbon. the most prominent carbon lines inoptical spectra of sneia are due to c ii. we find that at least 30% of theobjects in the sample show an absorption at ~6300 aa which is attributed to cii 6580. an association to h_alpha is considered to be unlikely. these findingsimply a larger incidence of carbon in sneia ejecta than previously noted. weshow how observational biases and physical conditions may hide these c iilines, and account for the scarcity of previous carbon detections. thisrelatively large frequency of carbon detections has crucial implications on ourunderstanding of the explosive process. the observations indicate that carbonis present merely ~1000 km s^-1 above the bulk of si ii. spectral modelingshows the detections are consistent with a mass of carbon of 10^-3--10^-2m_sun. this would imply substantial mixing, which may be related to asymmetriesof the flame propagation or clumps of unburned material along the line ofsight. however, the uniformity of the relation between c ii and si iivelocities is not consistent with the latter scenario. the observationalproperties of sneia with and without carbon signatures are compared. a trendtoward bluer color and lower luminosity is found for objects with carbon.

1202.2116	the universal initial mass function in the xuv disk of m83	we report deep subaru halpha observations of the xuv disk of m83. these newobservations enable the first complete census of very young stellar clustersover the entire xuv disk. combining subaru and galex data with a stellarpopulation synthesis model, we find that (1) the standard, butstochastically-sampled, initial mass function (imf) is preferred over thetruncated imf, because there are low mass stellar clusters (10^{2-3}msun) thathost massive o-type stars; that (2) the standard salpeter imf and a simpleaging effect explain the counts of fuv-bright and halpha-bright clusters withmasses &gt;10^3msun; and that (3) the halpha to fuv flux ratio over the xuv disksupports the standard imf. the subaru prime focus camera (suprime-cam) covers alarge area even outside the xuv disk -- far beyond the detection limit of thehi gas. this enables us to statistically separate the stellar clusters in thedisk from background contamination. the new data, model, and previousspectroscopic studies provide overall consistent results with respect to theinternal dust extinction (av~0.1 mag) and low metallicity (~0.2zsun) using thedust extinction curve of smc.

1203.0467	the s4g perspective on circumstellar dust extinction of agb stars in  m100	we examine the effect of circumstellar dust extinction on the near-ircontribution of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in intermediate-ageclusters throughout the disk of m100. for our sample of 17 agb-dominatedclusters we extract optical-to-mid-ir seds and find that nir brightness iscoupled to the mid-ir dust emission in such a way that a significant reductionof agb light, of up to 1 mag in k-band, follows from extinction by the dustshell formed during this stage. since the dust optical depth varies with agbchemistry (c-rich or o-rich), our results suggest that the contribution of agbstars to the flux from their host clusters will be closely linked to themetallicity and the progenitor mass of the agb star, to which dust chemistryand mass-loss rate are sensitive. our sample of clusters--each the analogue ofa ~1 gyr old post-starburst galaxy--has implications within the context of massand age estimation via sed modelling at high z: we find that the average ~0.5mag extinction estimated here may be sufficient to reduce the agb contributionin (rest-frame) k-band from ~70%, as predicted in the latest generation ofsynthesis models, to ~35%. our technique for selecting agb-dominated clustersin nearby galaxies promises to be effective for discriminating theuncertainties associated with agb stars in intermediate-age populations thatplague age and mass estimation in high-z galaxies.

1204.3879	early type galaxies with tidal debris and their scaling relations in the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	tidal debris around galaxies can yield important clues on their evolution. wehave identified tidal debris in 11 early type galaxies (t \leq 0) from a sampleof 65 early types drawn from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s4g). the tidal debris includes features such as shells, ripples andtidal tails. a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional decompositionof galactic structures, was used to quantify the residual tidal features. thetidal debris contributes ~3 - 10% to the total 3.6 {\mu}m luminosity of thehost galaxy. structural parameters of the galaxies were estimated usingtwo-dimensional profile fitting. we investigate the locations of galaxies withtidal debris in the fundamental plane and kormendy relation. we find thatgalaxies with tidal debris lie within the scatter of early type galaxieswithout tidal features. assuming that the tidal debris is indicative of recentgravitational interaction or merger, this suggests that these galaxies haveeither undergone minor merging events so that the overall structural propertiesof the galaxies are not significantly altered, or they have undergone a majormerging events but already have experienced sufficient relaxation andphase-mixing so that their structural properties become similar to those of thenon-interacting early type galaxies.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1301.4833	calibration of the mid-infrared tully-fisher relation	distance measures on a coherent scale around the sky are required to addressthe outstanding cosmological problems of the hubble constant and of departuresfrom the mean cosmic flow. the correlation between galaxy luminosities androtation rates can be used to determine distances to many thousands of galaxiesin a wide range of environments potentially out to 200 mpc. mid-infrared (3.6microns) photometry with the spitzer space telescope is particularly valuableas the source of the luminosities because it provides products of uniformquality across the sky. from a perch above the atmosphere, essentially thetotal magnitude of targets can be registered in exposures of a few minutes.extinction is minimal and the flux is dominated by the light from old starswhich is expected to correlate with the mass of the targets.  in spite of the superior photometry, the correlation between mid-infraredluminosities and rotation rates extracted from neutral hydrogen profiles isslightly degraded from the correlation found with i band luminosities. a colorcorrection recovers a correlation that provides comparable accuracy to thatavailable at i band (~20% 1sigma in an individual distance) while retaining theadvantages identified above. without the color correction the relation betweenlinewidth and [3.6] magnitudes is m^{b,i,k,a}_{[3.6]} = -20.34 - 9.74 (logw_{mx}^{i} -2.5). this description is found with a sample of 213 galaxies in 13clusters that define the slope and 26 galaxies with cepheid or tip of the redgiant branch distances that define the zero point. a color corrected parameterm_{c_{[3.6]}} is constructed that has reduced scatter: m_{c_{[3.6]}} = -20.34 -9.13 (log w_{mx}^{i} -2.5). consideration of the 7 calibration clusters beyond50 mpc, outside the domain of obvious peculiar velocities, provides apreliminary hubble constant estimate of h_0=74+/-5 km/s/mpc.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1305.2940	on the origin of lopsidedness in galaxies as determined from the spitzer  survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	we study the m=1 distortions (lopsidedness) in the stellar components of 167nearby galaxies that span a wide range of morphologies and luminosities. weconfirm the previous findings of 1) a high incidence of lopsidedness in thestellar distributions, 2) increasing lopsidedness as a function of radius outto at least 3.5 exponential scale lengths, and 3) greater lopsidedness, overthese radii, for galaxies of later type and lower surface brightness.additionally, the magnitude of the lopsidedness 1) correlates with thecharacter of the spiral arms (stronger arm patterns occur in galaxies with lesslopsidedness), 2) is not correlated with the presence or absence of a bar, orthe strength of the bar when one is present, 3) is inversely correlated to thestellar mass fraction, f_*, within one radial scale length, and 4) correlatesdirectly with f_* measured within the radial range over which we measurelopsidedness. we interpret these findings to mean that lopsidedness is ageneric feature of galaxies and does not, generally, depend on a rare event,such as a direct accretion of a satellite galaxy onto the disk of the parentgalaxy. while lopsidedness may be caused by several phenomena, moderatelopsidedness (&lt;a_1&gt;_i + &lt;a_1&gt;_o)/2 &lt; 0.3) is likely to reflect halo asymmetriesto which the disk responds or a gravitationally self-generated mode . wehypothesize that the magnitude of the stellar response depends both on howcentrally concentrated the stars are with respect to the dark matter andwhether there are enough stars in the region of the lopsidedness thatself-gravity is dynamically important.

1305.6997	spectroscopy of type ia supernovae by the carnegie supernova project	this is the first release of optical spectroscopic data of low-redshift typeia supernovae (sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project including 604previously unpublished spectra of 93 sne ia. the observations cover a range ofphases from 12 days before to over 150 days after the time of b-band maximumlight. with the addition of 228 near-maximum spectra from the literature westudy the diversity among sne ia in a quantitative manner. for that purpose,spectroscopic parameters are employed such as expansion velocities fromspectral line blueshifts, and pseudo-equivalent widths (pw). the values ofthose parameters at maximum light are obtained for 78 objects, thus providing acharacterization of sne ia that may help to improve our understanding of theproperties of the exploding systems and the thermonuclear flame propagation.two objects, namely sne 2005m and 2006is, stand out from the sample by showingpeculiar si ii and s ii velocities but otherwise standard velocities for therest of the ions. we further study the correlations between spectroscopic andphotometric parameters such as light-curve decline rate and color. in agreementwith previous studies, we find that the pw of si ii absorption features arevery good indicators of light-curve decline rate. furthermore, we demonstratethat parameters such as pw2(siii4130) and pw6(siii5972) provide precisecalibrations of the peak b-band luminosity with dispersions of ~0.15 mag. inthe search for a secondary parameter in the calibration of peak luminosity forsne ia, we find a ~2--3-sigma correlation between b-band hubble residuals andthe velocity at maximum light of s ii and si ii lines.

1311.0147	on the source of the dust extinction in type ia supernovae and the  discovery of anomalously strong na i absorption	high-dispersion observations of the na i d 5890, 5896 and k i 7665, 7699interstellar lines, and the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms in thespectra of 32 type ia supernovae are used as an independent means of probingdust extinction. we show that the dust extinction of the objects where thediffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms is detected is consistent with thevisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. this strongly suggeststhat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar materialassociated with the progenitor system. one quarter of the supernovae displayanomalously large na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dustextinction derived from their colors. remarkably, all of the cases of unusuallystrong na i d absorption correspond to "blueshifted" profiles in theclassification scheme of sternberg et al. (2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

1312.3384	unveiling the structure of barred galaxies at 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ with the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): i. disk breaks	we have performed two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 localbarred spiral galaxies using 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ images from the spitzer surveyof stellar structure in galaxies. our model fit includes up to four components(bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes intoaccount disk breaks. we find that ignoring the disk break and using a singledisk scale length in the model fit for type ii (down-bending) disk galaxies canlead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-totalluminosity ratio (b/t), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. we find thatfor galaxies with b/t $\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\rmbr}/r_{\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of b/t the ratioremains roughly constant. this suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies thedisk break is likely related to the outer lindblad resonance (olr) of the bar,and thus moves outwards as the bar grows. for galaxies with small bulges, b/t$&lt;$ 0.1, $r_{\rm br}/r_{\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. this suggeststhat the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be differentfrom that in galaxies with more massive bulges. consistent with previousstudies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges mayoriginate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, orbe related to star formation thresholds.

1405.3934	the carnegie supernova project: intrinsic colors of type ia supernovae	we present an updated analysis of the intrinsic colors of sne ia using thelatest data release of the carnegie supernova project. we introduce a newlight-curve parameter very similar to stretch that is better suited forfast-declining events, and find that these peculiar types can be seen asextensions to the population of "normal" sne ia. with a larger number ofobjects, an updated fit to the lira relation is presented along with evidencefor a dependence on the late-time slope of the b-v color-curves with stretchand color. using the full wavelength range from u to h band, we placeconstraints on the reddening law for the sample as a whole and also forindividual events/hosts based solely on the observed colors. the photometricdata continue to favor low values of rv, though with large variations fromevent to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. we confirm the findingsof other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derivedreddening law, rv, and the color excess, e(b-v), such that larger e(b-v) tendsto favor lower rv. the intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatterthat cannot be explained by variations in rv or by the goobar (2008) power-lawfor circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features ofthe supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.

0803.1924	lyman alpha emitting galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.35 from galex spectroscopy	the galex (galaxy evolution explorer) spectroscopic survey mode, with aresolution of about 8 a in the fuv (1350 - 1750 a) and about 20 a in the nuv(1950 - 2750 a) is used for a systematic search of ly-a emitting galaxies atlow redshift. this aims at filling a gap between high-redshift surveys and asmall set of objects studied in detail in the nearby universe. a blind searchof 7018 spectra extracted in 5 deep exposures (5.65 sq.deg) has resulted in 96ly-a emitting galaxy candidates in the fuv domain, after accounting forbroad-line agns. the ly-a ews (equivalent width) are consistent with stellarpopulation model predictions and show no trends as a function of uv color or uvluminosity, except a possible decrease in the most luminous that may be due tosmall-number statistics. their distribution in ew is similar to that at z about3 but their fraction among star-forming galaxies is smaller. avoiding uncertaincandidates, a sub-sample of 66 objects in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.35 has beenused to build a ly-a lf (luminosity function). the incompleteness due toobjects with significant ly-a emission but a uv continuum too low for spectralextraction has been evaluated. a comparison with h-a lf in the same redshiftdomain is consistent with an average ly-a/h-a of about 1 in about 15 % of thestar-forming galaxies. a comparison with high-redshift ly-a lfs implies anincrease of the ly-a luminosity density by a factor of about 16 from z about0.3 to z about 3. by comparison with the factor 5 increase of the uv luminositydensity in the same redshift range, this suggests an increase of the averagely-a escape fraction with redshift.

1408.2602	irac near-infrared features in the outer parts of s4g galaxies	we present a catalogue and images of visually detected features, such asasymmetries, extensions, warps, shells, tidal tails, polar rings, and obvioussigns of mergers or interactions, in the faint outer regions (at and outside ofr_25) of nearby galaxies. this catalogue can be used in future quantitativestudies that examine galaxy evolution due to internal and external factors. weare able to reliably detect outer region features down to a brightness level of0.03 mjy/sr per pixel at 3.6 microns in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g). we also tabulate companion galaxies. we find asymmetries inthe outer isophotes in 22+/-1 per cent of the sample. the asymmetry fractiondoes not correlate with galaxy classification as an interacting galaxy ormerger remnant, or with the presence of companions. we also compare thedetected features to similar features in galaxies taken from cosmological zoomre-simulations. the simulated images have a higher fraction (33 per cent) ofouter disc asymmetries, which may be due to selection effects and an uncertainstar formation threshold in the models. the asymmetries may have either aninternal (e.g., lopsidedness due to dark halo asymmetry) or external origin.

1411.4650	the mass profile and shape of bars in the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s4g): search for an age indicator for bars	we have measured the radial light profiles and global shapes of bars usingtwo-dimensional 3.6 $\mu m $ image decompositions for 144 face-on barredgalaxies from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). thebar surface brightness profile is correlated with the stellar mass andbulge-to-total (b/t) ratio of their host galaxies. bars in massive andbulge-dominated galaxies (b/t$&gt;$0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in lessmassive, disk-dominated galaxies (b/t$\sim$0) show an exponential, disk-likeprofile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominatedgalaxies. the global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, arerectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. we speculatethat because bars are formed out of disk, bars initially have an exponential(disk-like) profile which evolves over time, trapping more stars into the boxybar orbits. this leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. thenarrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that thesebars formed earlier (z$&gt;$1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spreadin the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradualevolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred fromobservational studies. therefore, we expect that the flatness of the barprofile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the timeelapsed since the bar formation. we argue that cosmic gas accretion is requiredto explain our results on bar profile and the presence of gas within the barregion.

1505.05518	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): trends in galaxy colours, morphology,  and stellar populations with large scale structure, group, and pair  environments	we explore trends in galaxy properties with mpc-scale structures usingcatalogues of environment and large scale structure from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. existing gama catalogues of large scale structure,group and pair membership allow us to construct galaxy stellar mass functionsfor different environmental types. to avoid simply extracting the knownunderlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create amass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses between $9.5 \leq\log{m_*/h^{-2} m_{\odot}} \leq 11$ for each environmental population. usingthese samples, we show that mass normalised galaxies in different large scaleenvironments have similar energy outputs, $u-r$ colours, luminosities, andmorphologies. extending our analysis to group and pair environments, we showgalaxies that are not in groups or pairs exhibit similar characteristics toeach other regardless of broader environment. for our mass controlled sample,we fail to see a strong dependence of s\'{e}rsic index or galaxy luminosity onhalo mass, but do find that it correlates very strongly with colour. repeatingour analysis for galaxies that have not been mass controlled introduces andamplifies trends in the properties of galaxies in pairs, groups, and largescale structure, indicating that stellar mass is the most important predictorof the galaxy properties we examine, as opposed to environmentalclassifications.

1506.05153	the odd offset between the galactic disk and its bar in ngc 3906	we use mid-infrared 3.6 and 4.5microns imaging of ngc 3906 from the spitzersurvey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) to understand the nature of anunusual offset between its stellar bar and the photometric center of anotherwise regular, circular outer stellar disk. we measure an offset of ~720 pcbetween the center of the stellar bar and photometric center of the stellardisk; the bar center coincides with the kinematic center of the disk determinedfrom previous hi observations. although the undisturbed shape of the disksuggests that ngc 3906 has not undergone a significant merger event in itsrecent history, the most plausible explanation for the observed offset is aninteraction. given the relatively isolated nature of ngc 3906 this interactioncould be with dark matter sub structure in the galaxy's halo or from a recentinteraction with a fast moving neighbor which remains to be identified.simulations aimed at reproducing the observed offset between the stellar bar /kinematic center of the system and the photometric center of the disk arenecessary to confirm this hypothesis and constrain the interaction history ofthe galaxy.

0807.3955	a new distance to the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/39) based on the type  ia supernova 2007sr	traditionally, the distance to ngc 4038/39 has been derived from the systemicrecession velocity, yielding about 20 mpc for h_0 = 72 km/s/mpc. recently, thiswidely adopted distance has been challenged based on photometry of the presumedtip of the red giant branch (trgb), which seems to yield a shorter distance of13.3+-1.0 mpc and, with it, nearly 1 mag lower luminosities and smaller radiifor objects in this prototypical merger. here we present a new distanceestimate based on observations of the type ia supernova (sn) 2007sr in thesouthern tail, made at las campanas observatory as part of the carnegiesupernova project. the resulting distance of d(sn ia) = 22.3+-2.8 mpc [(m-m)_0= 31.74+-0.27 mag] is in good agreement with a refined distance estimate basedon the recession velocity and the large-scale flow model developed by tonry andcollaborators, d(flow) = 22.5+-2.8 mpc. we point out three serious problemsthat a short distance of 13.3 mpc would entail, and trace the claimed shortdistance to a likely misidentification of the trgb. reanalyzing hubble spacetelescope (hst) data in the archive with an improved method, we find a trgbfainter by 0.9 mag and derive from it a preliminary new trgb distance ofd(trgb) = 20.0+-1.6 mpc. finally, assessing our three distance estimates werecommend using a conservative, rounded value of d = 22+-3 mpc as the bestcurrently available distance to the antennae.

astro-ph;0002111	comparing galaxy morphology at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths	we have undertaken an imaging survey of 34 nearby galaxies in far-ultraviolet(fuv, ~1500a) and optical (ubvri) passbands to characterize galaxy morphologyas a function of wavelength. this sample, which includes a range of classicalhubble types from elliptical to irregular with emphasis on spirals at lowinclination angle, provides a valuable database for comparison with images ofhigh-z galaxies whose fuv light is redshifted into the optical and near-infrared bands. ultraviolet data are from the uit astro-2 mission. we presentimages and surface brightness profiles for each galaxy, and we discuss thewavelength-dependence of morphology for different hubble types in the contextof understanding high-z objects. in general, the dominance of young stars inthe fuv produces the patchy appearance of a morphological type later than thatinferred from optical images. prominent rings and circumnuclear star formationregions are clearly evident in fuv images of spirals, while bulges, bars, andold, red stellar disks are faint to invisible at these short wavelengths.however, the magnitude of the change in apparent morphology ranges fromdramatic in early--type spirals with prominent optical bulges to slight inlate-type spirals and irregulars, in which young stars dominate both the uv andoptical emission. starburst galaxies with centrally concentrated, symmetricbursts display an apparent ``e/s0'' structure in the fuv, while starburstsassociated with rings or mergers produce a peculiar morphology. we brieflydiscuss the inadequacy of the optically-defined hubble sequence to describe fuvgalaxy images and estimate morphological k-corrections, and we suggest somedirections for future research with this dataset.

astro-ph;0011101	ultraviolet signposts of resonant dynamics in the starburst-ringed sab  galaxy, m94 (ngc 4736)	m94 (ngc 4736) is investigated using images from the ultraviolet imagingtelescope (fuv-band), hubble space telescope (nuv-band), kitt peak 0.9-mtelescope (h-alpha, r, and i bands), and palomar 5-m telescope (b-band), alongwith spectra from the international ultraviolet explorer and lick 1-mtelescopes. the wide-field uit image shows fuv emission from (a) an elongatednucleus, (b) a diffuse inner disk, where h-alpha is observed in absorption, (c)a bright inner ring of h ii regions at the perimeter of the inner disk (r = 48arcsec. = 1.1 kpc), and (d) two 500-pc size knots of hot stars exterior to thering on diametrically opposite sides of the nucleus (r= 130 arcsec. = 2.9 kpc).the hst/foc image resolves the nuv emission from the nuclear region into abright core and a faint 20 arcsec. long ``mini-bar'' at a position angle of 30deg. optical and iue spectroscopy of the nucleus and diffuse inner diskindicates an approximately 10^7 or 10^8 yr-old stellar population fromlow-level starbirth activity blended with some liner activity. analysis of theh-alpha, fuv, nuv, b, r, and i-band emission along with other observed tracersof stars and gas in m94 indicates that most of the star formation is beingorchestrated via ring-bar dynamics involving the nuclear mini-bar, inner ring,oval disk, and outer ring. the inner starburst ring and bi-symmetric knots atintermediate radius, in particular, argue for bar-mediated resonances as theprimary drivers of evolution in m94 at the present epoch. similar processes maybe governing the evolution of the ``core-dominated'' galaxies that have beenobserved at high redshift. the gravitationally-lensed ``pretzel galaxy''(0024+1654) at a redshift of approximately 1.5 provides an important precedentin this regard.

astro-ph;0012377	a revised cepheid distance to ngc 4258 and a test of the distance scale	in a previous paper (maoz et al. 1999), we reported a hubble space telescope(hst) cepheid distance to the galaxy ngc 4258 obtained using the calibrationsand methods then standard for the key project on the extragalactic distancescale. here, we reevaluate the cepheid distance using the revised key projectprocedures described in freedman et al. (2001). these revisions alter the zeropoints and slopes of the cepheid period-luminosity (p-l) relations derived atthe large magellanic cloud (lmc), the calibration of the hst wfpc2 camera, andthe treatment of metallicity differences. we also provide herein fullinformation on the cepheids described in maoz et al. 1999. using the refinedkey project techniques and calibrations, we determine the distance modulus ofngc 4258 to be 29.47 +/- 0.09 mag (unique to this determination) +/- 0.15 mag(systematic uncertainties in key project distances), corresponding to a metricdistance of 7.8 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.5 mpc and 1.2 sigma from the maser distance of7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc. we also test the alternative cepheid p-l relations of feast(1999), which yield more discrepant results. additionally, we place weak limitsupon the distance to the lmc and upon the effect of metallicity in cepheiddistance determinations.

astro-ph;0106454	quantitative morphology of galaxies observed in the ultraviolet	we present a quantitative study of the far-ultraviolet (fuv) and opticalmorphology in 32 nearby galaxies and estimate the ``morphologicalk-correction'' expected if these objects were observed unevolved at highredshift. using the common indices of central concentration (c) and rotationalasymmetry (a) to quantify morphology, we consider independently two phenomenathat give rise to this k-correction. bandshifting, the decrease in rest-framewavelength of light observed through optical filters, is explored by measuringthese indices in several passbands for each galaxy, and it is found to be theprimary driver of changes in c and a. in general, the optical trend found fordecreasing c and increasing a when going to shorter wavelengths extends to thefuv. however, the patchy nature of recent star-formation in late-type galaxies,which is accentuated in the fuv, results in poor quantitative correspondencebetween morphologies determined in the optical and fuv. we then artificiallyredshift our fuv images into the hubble deep field (hdf) filters to simulatevarious cosmological distance effects such as surface brightness dimming andloss of spatial resolution. hubble types of many galaxies in our sample are notreadily identifiable at redshifts beyond z ~ 1, and the galaxies themselves aredifficult to detect beyond z ~ 3. only features of the highest surfacebrightness remain visible at cosmological distances. our simulations suggestthat k-corrections alone are indeed capable of producing the peculiarmorphologies observed at high redshift.

(2002) in bands centered on 60, 100 and 170microns. 30 out of 38 galaxies detected at all three wavelengths contain a colddust emission component, present within all morphological types of late-typesystems ranging from early giant spirals to blue compact dwarfs (bcds), andwhich could not have been recognized by iras. the temperatures of the cold dustwere found to be broadly distributed, with a median of 18 k, some 8-10 k lowerthan would have been predicted from iras. the derived total dust masses arecorrespondingly increased by factors of typically 6 - 13. a particularlysignificant result concerns the low dust temperatures (ranging down to lessthan 10 k) and large dust masses associated with the im and bcd galaxies in oursample. we propose two scenarios to account for the fir characteristics ofthese systems.

astro-ph;0204192	deviations from the local hubble flow. i. the tip of the red giant  branch as a distance indicator	the properties of the velocity field in the local volume (cz &lt; 550 km/s) havebeen difficult to constrain due to a lack of a consistent set of galaxydistances. the sparse observations available to date suggest a remarkably quietflow, with little deviation from a pure hubble law. however, velocity fieldmodels based on the distribution of galaxies in the 1.2 jy iras redshiftsurvey, predict a quadrupolar flow pattern locally with strong infall at thepoles of the local supergalactic plane. we probe this velocity field and beginto establish a consistent set of galactic distances. we have obtained images ofnearby galaxies in the i and v band from the w.m. keck observatory and in f814wand f555w filters from the hubble space telescope. where these galaxies arewell resolved into stars we may use the tip of the red giant branch (trgb) as adistance indicator. using a maximum likelihood analysis to quantitativelymeasure the i magnitude of the trgb we determine precise distances to sevennearby galaxies: leo i, sextans b, ngc 1313, ngc 3109, ugc 03755, ugc 06456,and ugc 07577.

astro-ph;0411302	the galaxy evolution explorer: a space ultraviolet survey mission	we give an overview of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex), a nasa explorermission launched on april 28, 2003. galex is performing the first space uvsky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750angstroms and 1750-2750 angstroms). the surveys include an all-sky imagingsurvey (m[ab] ~ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[ab] ~23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[ab] ~ 25), and a nearbygalaxy survey. spectroscopic grism surveys (r=100-200) are underway withvarious depths and sky coverage. many targets overlap existing or plannedsurveys. we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies, along withcorollary observations, to calibrate the uv-global star formation raterelationship in local galaxies. we will apply this calibration to distantgalaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map thehistory of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. the galex missionincludes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programsmade possible by the first uv sky survey.

astro-ph;0411319	uv emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we present the first galex uv images of the well known interacting group ofgalaxies, stephan's quintet (sq). we detect widespread uv emission throughoutthe group. however, there is no consistent coincidence between uv structure andemission in the optical, h\alpha, or hi. excluding the foreground galaxyngc7320 (sd), most of the uv emission is found in regions associated with thetwo spiral members of the group, ngc7319 and ngc7318b, and the intragroupmedium starburst sq-a. the extinction corrected uv data are analyzed toinvestigate the overall star formation activity in sq. it is found that thetotal star formation rate (sfr) of sq is 6.69+-0.65 m_\sun/yr. among this,1.34+-0.16 m_sun/yr is due to sq-a. this is in excellent agreement with thatderived from extinction corrected h\alpha luminosity of sq-a. the sfr inregions related to ngc 7319 is 1.98+-0.58 m_\sun/yr, most of which(68%) iscontributed by the disk. the contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. inthe uv, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-likestructure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic hii regions recentlydiscovered in h\alpha, and other uv emission regions discovered for the firsttime. the uv and optical colors of the 'old tail' are consistent with a singlestellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. the uv emission associated withngc 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net sfr of 3.37+-0.25m_sun/yr. several large uv emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from thenucleus of ngc7318b. although both ngc7319 and ngc7318b show peculiar uvmorphology, their sfr is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies,indicating that the strength of star formation activity is not enhenced byinteractions.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0504489	the galex ultraviolet variability (guvv) catalog	we present version 1.0 of the nasa galaxy evolution explorer (galex)ultraviolet variability catalog (guvv) that contains information on 84time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and farultraviolet photometric observations. these time-variable sources wereserendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently beingsurveyed by the galex satellite in two ultraviolet bands (nuv 1750-2750a, fuv1350-1750a) with limiting ab magnitudes of 23-25. the largest-amplitudevariable objects presently detected by galex are m-dwarf flare stars, which canbrighten by 5-10 mag in both the nuv and fuv bands during short duration (&lt;500s) outbursts. other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objectsinclude ab-type rr lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in thegalex fuv band. this first guvv catalog lists galactic positions and possiblesource identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with alist of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at otherwavelengths. we expect the total number of time-variable source detections toincrease as the galex mission progresses, such that later version numbers ofthe guvv catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.

astro-ph;0507396	galex observations of an energetic ultraviolet flare on the dm4e star gj  3685a	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite has obtained high timeresolution ultraviolet photometry during a large flare on the m4 dwarf star gj3685a. simultaneous nuv (1750 - 2800a) and fuv (1350 - 1750a) time-taggedphotometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overallbrightness in the fuv band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. under theassumption that the nuv emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and thatthe fuv flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, then thereis evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. the first flaretype is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or noincrease in temperature. the other involves rapid increases in both temperatureand flux. while the decay time for the first flare component may be severalhours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting thatthere was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.

astro-ph;0509731	sn 2005bf: a possible transition event between type ib/c supernovae and  gamma ray bursts	we present u'g'r'i'bv photometry and optical spectroscopy of the type ib/icsn 2005bf covering the first ~100 days following discovery. the u'g'bv lightcurves displayed a double-peaked morphology, which is among type ib/icsupernovae. the bolometric light curve indicates that sn 2005bf was aremarkably luminous event. spectroscopically, sn 2005bf underwent a uniquetransformation from a type ic-like event at early times to a typical type ibsupernova at later phases. the initial maximum in u'g'bv was accompanied by thepresence in the spectrum of high velocity absorption lines of fe ii, ca ii, andh i. the photospheric velocity derived from spectra at early epochs wasunusually low compared with ordinary type ib supernovae. we describeone-dimensional computer simulations which attempt to account for theseremarkable properties. the most favored model is that of a very energetic (2 x10^{51} erg), asymmetric explosion of a massive (8.3 m_sun) wolf-rayet wn starthat had lost most of its hydrogen envelope. we speculate that an unobservedrelativistic jet was launched producing a two-component explosion consisting of1) a polar explosion containing a small fraction of the total mass and movingat high velocity, and 2) the explosion of the rest of the star. at first, onlythe polar explosion is observed, producing the initial maximum and the highvelocity absorption-line spectrum resembling a type ic event. at late times,this fast-moving component becomes optically-thin, revealing the slower-movingexplosion of the rest of the star and transforming the observed spectrum tothat of a typical type ib supernova. if this scenario is correct, then sn2005bf is the best example to date of a transition object between normal typeib/ic supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0512039	the carnegie supernova project: the low-redshift survey	supernovae are essential to understanding the chemical evolution of theuniverse. type ia supernovae also provide the most powerful observational toolcurrently available for studying the expansion history of the universe and thenature of dark energy. our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the studyof their photometric and spectroscopic properties. however, the presentlyavailable data sets of optical and near-infrared light curves of supernovae arerather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that arepoorly characterized. similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whosespectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, withprecise spectrophotometric observations. the low-redshift portion of thecarnegie supernova project (csp) seeks to remedy this situation by providingphotometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken ontelescope/filter/detector systems that are well understood and wellcharacterized. during a five-year program which began in september 2004, weexpect to obtain high-precision u'g'r'i'bvyjhks light curves and opticalspectrophotometry for about 250 supernovae of all types. in this paper weprovide a detailed description of the csp survey observing and data reductionmethodology. in addition, we present preliminary photometry and spectraobtained for a few representative supernovae during the first observingcampaign.

astro-ph;0604058	uv and fir selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and  overlaps	we study two samples of local galaxies, one is uv (galex) selected and theother fir (iras) selected, to address the question whether uv and fir surveyssee the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the samepopulation of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.no significant difference between the l$_{tot}$ ($=l_{60}+l_{fuv}$) luminosityfunctions of the uv and fir samples is found. also, after the correction forthe `malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the fir-to-uv ratio v.s.l$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. in therange of $9 \la \log(l_{tot}/l_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by asimple linear relation of $\log (l_{60}/l_{fuv})=\log(l_{tot}/l_\sun)-9.66$.these are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent thesame population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differencesin l$_{tot}$ and in fir-to-uv ratio are due only to the selection effect. acomparison between the uv luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for apopulation of faint uv galaxies missing in the fir selected sample. thecontribution from these 'fir-quiet' galaxies to the overall uv population isinsignificant, given that the k-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellarmass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;9809025	cepheid and tip of the red giant branch distances to the dwarf irregular  galaxy ic10	we present color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions of stars in thenearby galaxy ic 10, based on vi ccd photometry acquired with the cosmicprime-focus camera on the palomar 5m telescope. the apparent i-band luminosityfunction of stars in the halo of ic 10 shows an identifiable rise at i~21.7mag. this is interpreted as being the tip of the red giant branch (trgb) atm_v~-4 mag. since ic 10 is at a very low galactic latitude, its foregroundextinction is expected to be high and the uncertainty associated with thatcorrection is the largest contributor to the error associated with its distancedetermination. multi-wavelength observations of cepheid variable stars in ic 10give a population i distance modulus of 24.1 +- 0.2 mag, which corresponds to alinear distance of 660 +- 66 kpc for a total line-of-sight reddening of e(b-v)= 1.16 +- 0.08 mag, derived self-consistently from the cepheid data alone.applying this population i reddening to the population ii halo stars gives atrgb distance modulus of 23.5 +- 0.2 mag, corresponding to 500 +- 50 kpc. weconsider this to be a lower limit on the trgb distance. reconciling the cepheidand trgb distances would require that the reddening to the halo is$\delta$e(b-v) = 0.31 mag lower than that into the main body of the galaxy.this then suggests that the galactic extinction in the direction of ic10 is(b-v) ~ 0.85.

(1) assuming thisdistance for the fornax cluster as a whole yields a local hubble constant of 70+/-18_{random} [+/-7]_{systematic} km/s/mpc. (2) nine cepheid-based distancesto groups of galaxies out to and including the fornax and virgo clusters yieldho = 73 (+/-16)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/mpc. (3) recalibrating the i-band tully-fisherrelation using ngc 1365 and six nearby spiral galaxies, and applying it to 15galaxy clusters out to 100 mpc gives ho = 76 (+/-3)_r [+/-8]_s km/s/mpc. (4)using a broad-based set of differential cluster distance moduli ranging fromfornax to abell 2147 gives ho = 72 (+/-)_r [+/-6]_s km/s/mpc. and finally, (5)assuming the ngc 1365 distance for the two additional type ia supernovae infornax and adding them to the snia calibration (correcting for light curveshape) gives ho = 67 (+/-6)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/mpc out to a distance in excess of500 mpc. all five of these ho determinations agree to within their statisticalerrors. the resulting estimate of the hubble constant combining all thesedeterminations is ho = 72 (+/-5)_r [+/-12]_s km/s/mpc.

astro-ph;9904368	a cepheid distance to ngc 4603 in centaurus	in an attempt to use cepheid variables to determine the distance to thecentaurus cluster, we have obtained images of ngc 4603 with the hubble spacetelescope on 9 epochs using wfpc2 and the f555w and f814w filters. this galaxyhas been suggested to lie within the ``cen30'' portion of the cluster and isthe most distant object for which this method has been attempted. previousdistance estimates for cen30 have varied significantly and some have presenteddisagreements with the peculiar velocity predicted from redshift surveys,motivating this investigation. using our observations, we have found 61candidate cepheid variable stars; however, a significant fraction of thesecandidates are likely to be nonvariable stars whose magnitude measurementerrors happen to fit a cepheid light curve of significant amplitude for somechoice of period and phase. through a maximum likelihood technique, wedetermine that we have observed 43 +/- 7 real cepheids and that ngc 4603 has adistance modulus of 32.61 +0.11/-0.10 (random, 1 sigma) +0.24/-0.25(systematic, adding in quadrature), corresponding to a distance of 33.3 mpc.this is consistent with a number of recent estimates of the distance to ngc4603 or cen30 and implies a small peculiar velocity consistent with predictionsfrom the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey if the galaxy lies in the foreground ofthe cluster.

astro-ph;9908140	a cepheid distance to ngc 4258	distances measured using cepheid variable stars have been essential forestablishing the cosmological distance scale and the value of the hubbleconstant. these stars have remained the primary extragalactic distanceindicator since 1929 because of the small observed scatter in the relationshipbetween their pulsation period and luminosity, their large numbers, which allowmany independent measures of the distance to a galaxy, and the simplicity ofthe basic physics underlying their variability. potential systematicuncertainties in the use of the lmc-calibrated cepheid period-luminosityrelation to determine distances using hst are estimated to be 8-10%. here wedescribe the results of a search for cepheids in the nearby galaxy ngc 4258,which has an independently determined geometric distance of 7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc(herrnstein et al. 1999). we obtain a cepheid distance of 8.1 +/- 0.4(excluding possible systematic errors affecting all hst cepheid distances) mpc;there is a 1.3 sigma difference between the two measurements. if themaser-based distance is adopted and other hst cepheid distances are revisedaccording to our results, the derived value of the hubble constant would beincreased by 12 +/- 9%, and the corresponding age of the universe woulddecrease by the same factor.

astro-ph;9908149	the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale xxv. a  recalibration of cepheid distances to type ia supernovae and the value of the  hubble constant	cepheid-based distances to seven type ia supernovae (sne)-host galaxies havebeen derived using the standard hst key project on the extragalactic distancescale pipeline. for the first time, this allows for a transparent comparison ofdata accumulated as part of three different hst projects, the key project, thesandage et al. type ia sne program, and the tanvir et al. leo i group study.re-analyzing the tanvir et al. galaxy and six sandage et al. galaxies we find amean (weighted) offset in true distance moduli of 0.12+/-0.07 mag -- i.e., 6%in linear distance -- in the sense of reducing the distance scale, orincreasing h0. adopting the reddening-corrected hubble relations of suntzeff etal. (1999), tied to a zero point based upon sne~1990n, 1981b, 1998bu, 1989b,1972e and 1960f and the photometric calibration of hill et al. (1998), leads toa hubble constant of h0=68+/-2(random)+/-5(systematic) km/s/mpc. adopting thekennicutt et al. (1998) cepheid period-luminosity-metallicity dependencydecreases the inferred h0 by 4%. the h0 result from type ia sne is now in goodagreement, to within their respective uncertainties, with that from thetully-fisher and surface brightness fluctuation relations.

astro-ph;9908192	the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale xxvi. the  calibration of population ii secondary distance indicators and the value of  the hubble constant	a cepheid-based calibration is derived for four distance indicators thatutilize stars in the old stellar populations: the tip of the red giant branch(trgb), the planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf), the globular clusterluminosity function (gclf) and the surface brightness fluctuation method (sbf).the calibration is largely based on the cepheid distances to 18 spiral galaxieswithin cz =1500 km/s obtained as part of the hst key project on theextragalactic distance scale, but relies also on cepheid distances fromseparate hst and ground-based efforts. the newly derived calibration of the sbfmethod is applied to obtain distances to four abell clusters in the velocityrange between 3800 and 5000 km/s, observed by lauer et al. (1998) using thehst/wfpc2. combined with cluster velocities corrected for a cosmological flowmodel, these distances imply a value of the hubble constant of h0 = 69 +/- 4(random) +/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result assumes that the cepheid plrelation is independent of the metallicity of the variable stars; adopting ametallicity correction as in kennicutt et al. (1998), would produce a (5 +/-3)% decrease in h0. finally, the newly derived calibration allows us toinvestigate systematics in the cepheid, pnlf, sbf, gclf and trgb distancescales.

astro-ph;9909222	the extragalactic distance scale key project xxvii. a derivation of the  hubble constant using the fundamental plane and dn-sigma relations in leo i,  virgo, and fornax	using published photometry and spectroscopy, we construct the fundamentalplane and d_n-sigma relations in leo i, virgo and fornax. the published cepheidp-l relations to spirals in these clusters fixes the relation between angularsize and metric distance for both the fundamental plane and d_n-sigmarelations. using the locally calibrated fundamental plane, we infer distancesto a sample of clusters with a mean redshift of cz \approx 6000 \kms, andderive a value of h_0=78+- 5+- 9 km/s/mpc (random, systematic) for the localexpansion rate. this value includes a correction for depth effects in thecepheid distances to the nearby clusters, which decreased the deduced value ofthe expansion rate by 5% +- 5%. if one further adopts the metallicitycorrection to the cepheid pl relation, as derived by the key project, the valueof the hubble constant would decrease by a further 6%+- 4%. these two sourcesof systematic error, when combined with a +- 6% error due to the uncertainty inthe distance to the large magellanic cloud, a +- 4% error due to uncertaintiesin the wfpc2 calibration, and several small sources of uncertainty in thefundamental plane analysis, combine to yield a total systematic uncertainty of+- 11%. we find that the values obtained using either the cmb, or a flow-fieldmodel, for the reference frame of the distant clusters, agree to within 1%. thedn-sigma relation also produces similar results, as expected from thecorrelated nature of the two scaling relations. a complete discussion of thesources of random and systematic error in this determination of the hubbleconstant is also given, in order to facilitate comparison with the othersecondary indicators being used by the key project.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
