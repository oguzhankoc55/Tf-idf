0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

1001.0005	environmental dependence of 8um luminosity functions of galaxies at  z~0.8: comparison between rxj1716.4+6708 and the akari nep deep field	we aim to reveal environmental dependence of infrared luminosity functions(ir lfs) of galaxies at z~0.8 using the akari satellite. we construct restframe8um ir lfs in the cluster region rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81, and compare themwith a blank field using the akari north ecliptic pole deep field data at thesame redshift. akari's wide field of view (10'x10') is suitable to investigatewide range of galaxy environments. akari's 15um filter is advantageous heresince it directly probes restframe 8um at z~0.8, without relying on a largeextrapolation based on a sed fit, which was the largest uncertainty in previouswork. we have found that cluster ir lfs at restframe 8um have a factor of 2.4smaller l^* and a steeper faint-end slope than that of the field. confirmingthis trend, we also found that faint-end slopes of the cluster lfs becomesflatter and flatter with decreasing local galaxy density. these changes in lfscannot be explained by a simple infall of field galaxy population into acluster. physics that can preferentially suppress ir luminous galaxies in highdensity regions is required to explain the observed results.

1001.0013	evolution of infrared luminosity functions of galaxies in the akari  nep-deep field: revealing the cosmic star formation history hidden by dust	dust-obscured star-formation becomes much more important with increasingintensity, and increasing redshift. we aim to reveal cosmic star-formationhistory obscured by dust using deep infrared observation with the akari.  we construct restframe 8um, 12um, and total infrared (tir) luminosityfunctions (lfs) at 0.15&lt;z&lt;2.2 using 4128 infrared sources in the akari nep-deepfield. a continuous filter coverage in the mid-ir wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7,9, 11, 15, 18, and 24um) by the akari satellite allows us to estimate restframe8um and 12um luminosities without using a large extrapolation based on a sedfit, which was the largest uncertainty in previous work. we have found that all8um (0.38&lt;z&lt;2.2), 12um (0.15&lt;z&lt;1.16), and tir lfs (0.2&lt;z&lt;1.6), show acontinuous and strong evolution toward higher redshift. in terms of cosmicinfrared luminosity density (omega_ir), which was obtained by integratinganalytic fits to the lfs, we found a good agreement with previous work atz&lt;1.2, and that the omega_ir evolves as propto (1+z)^4.4+-1.0. when we separatecontributions to omega_ir by lirgs and ulirgs, we found more ir luminoussources are increasingly more important at higher redshift. we found that theulirg (lirg) contribution increases by a factor of 10 (1.8) from z=0.35 toz=1.4.

1002.3654	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) luminous galaxies at z~1	using an akari multi-wavelength mid-infrared (ir) survey, we identifyluminous starburst galaxies at z&gt; 0.5 based on the pah luminosity, andinvestigate the nature of these pah-selected starbursts. an extragalacticsurvey with akari towards the north ecliptic pole (nep), the nep-deep survey,is unique in terms of a comprehensive wavelength coverage from 2 to 24um usingall 9 photometric bands of the infrared camera (irc). this survey allows us tophotometrically identify galaxies whose mid-ir emission is clearly dominated bypahs. we propose a single colour selection method to identify such galaxies,using two mid-ir flux ratios at 11-to-7um and 15-to-9um (pah-to-continuum fluxratio in the rest-frame), which are useful to identify starburst galaxies atz~0.5 and 1, respectively. we perform a fitting of the spectral energydistributions (seds) from optical to mid-ir wavelengths, using an evolutionarystarburst model with a proper treatment of radiative transfer (sburt), in orderto investigate their nature. the sburt model reproduces observedoptical-to-mid-ir seds of more than a half of pah-selected galaxies. based onthe 8um luminosity, we find ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) amongpah-selected galaxies. their pah luminosity is higher than local ulirgs with asimilar luminosity, and the pah-to-total ir luminosity ratio is consistent withthat of less luminous starburst galaxies. they are a unique galaxy populationat high redshifts and we call these pah-selected ulirgs "pah-luminous"galaxies. although they are not as massive as submillimetre galaxies at z~2,they have the stellar mass of &gt;3x10^{10} msun and therefore moderately massive.

1002.3674	detection of the cosmic far-infrared background in the akari deep field  south	we report the detection and measurement of the absolute brightness andspatial fluctuations of the cosmic infrared background (cib) with the akarisatellite. we have carried out observations at 65, 90, 140 and 160 um as acosmological survey in akari deep field south (adf-s), which is one of thelowest cirrus regions with contiguous area on the sky. after removing brightgalaxies and subtracting zodiacal and galactic foregrounds from the measuredsky brightness, we have successfully measured the cib brightness and itsfluctuations across a wide range of angular scales from arcminutes to degrees.the measured cib brightness is consistent with previous results reported fromcobe data but significantly higher than the lower limits at 70 and 160 umobtained with the spitzer satellite from the stacking analysis of 24-umselected sources. the discrepancy with the spitzer result is possibly due to anew galaxy population at high redshift obscured by hot dust. from powerspectrum analysis at 90 um, three components are identified: shot noise due toindividual galaxies; galactic cirrus emission dominating at the largest angularscales of a few degrees; and an additional component at an intermediate angularscale of 10-30 arcminutes, possibly due to galaxy clustering. the spectralshape of the clustering component at 90 um is very similar to that at longerwavelengths as observed by spitzer and blast. moreover, the color of thefluctuations indicates that the clustering component is as red asultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at high redshift, these galaxies arenot likely to be the majority of the cib emission at 90 um, but responsible forthe clustering component. our results provide new constraints on the evolutionand clustering properties of distant infrared galaxies.

0708.0845	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- v. submillimetre  properties of near-infrared--selected galaxies in the subaru/xmm--newton deep  field	we have studied the submillimetre (submm) properties of the following classesof near-infrared (nir)-selected massive galaxies at high redshifts:bzk-selected star-forming galaxies (bzks); distant red galaxies (drgs); andextremely red objects (eros). we used the scuba half degree extragalacticsurvey (shades), the largest uniform submm survey to date. partial overlap ofsirius/nir images and shades in sxdf has allowed us to identify 4 submm-brightnir-selected galaxies, which are detected in the mid-infrared, 24 micron, andthe radio, 1.4 ghz. we find that all of our submm-bright nir-selected galaxiessatisfy the bzk selection criteria, except for one galaxy whose b-z and z-kcolours are however close to the bzk colour boundary. two of the submm-brightnir-selected galaxies satisfy all of the selection criteria we considered, i.e.they belong to the bzk-drg-ero overlapping population, or `extremely red' bzks.although these extremely red bzks are rare (0.25 arcmin^{-2}), up to 20 % ofthis population could be submm galaxies. this fraction is significantly higherthan that found for other galaxy populations studied here. via a stackinganalysis, we have detected the 850 micron flux of submm-faint bzks and eros inour scuba maps. while the contribution of z~2 bzks to the submm background isabout 10--15 % and similar to that from eros typically at z~1, bzks have ahigher fraction (~30 %) of submm flux in resolved sources compared with erosand submm sources as a whole. from the sed fitting analysis for bothsubmm-bright and submm-faint bzks, we found no clear signature thatsubmm-bright bzks are experiencing a specifically luminous evolutionary phase,compared with submm-faint bzks. an alternative explanation might be thatsubmm-bright bzks are more massive than submm-faint ones.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

1010.5787	herschel-atlas: first data release of the science demonstration phase  source catalogues	the herschel-atlas is a survey of 550 square degrees with the herschel spaceobservatory in five far--infrared and submillimetre bands. the first data forthe survey, observations of a field 4x4 sq. degrees in size, were taken duringthe science demonstration phase, and reach a 5 sigma noise level of 33 mjy/beamat 250 microns. this paper describes the source extraction methods used tocreate the corresponding science demonstration phase catalogue, which contains6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees. spire sourcesare extracted using a new method specifically developed for herschel data; pacscounterparts of these sources are identified using circular apertures placed atthe spire positions. aperture flux densities are measured for sourcesidentified as extended after matching to optical wavelengths. the reliabilityof this catalogue is also discussed, using full simulated maps at the threespire bands. these show that a significant number of sources at 350 and 500microns have undergone flux density enhancements of up to a factor of ~2, duemainly to source confusion. correction factors are determined for theseeffects. the sdp dataset and corresponding catalogue will be available fromhttp://www.h-atlas.org/.

1011.5116	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey vi: the distribution of gas and  star formation in m81	we present a first complete 12 co j=3-2 map of m81, observed as part of thenearby galaxies legacy survey being carried out at the james clerk maxwelltelescope. we detect 9 regions of significant co emission located at differentpositions within the spiral arms, and confirm that the global co emission inthe galaxy is low. we combine these data with a new h-alpha map obtained usingthe isaac newton telescope and archival hi, 24 microns and fuv images touncover a correlation between the molecular gas and star forming regions inm81. for the nine regions detected in co j=3-2, we combine our co j=3-2 datawith existing co j=1-0 data to calculate line ratios. we find that the ratioj=(3-2)/(1-0) is in agreement with the range of typical values found in theliterature (0.2-0.8). making reasonable assumptions, this allows us toconstrain the hydrogen density to the range (10^3-10^4) cm^{-3}. we alsoestimated the amount of hydrogen produced in photo-dissociation regions nearthe locations where co j=3-2 was detected.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

0802.0497	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - vii. optical/ir  photometry and stellar masses of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present estimates of the photometric redshifts, stellar masses and starformation histories of sources in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades). this paper describes the 60 scuba sources detected in the lockmanhole covering an area of ~320 square arcmin. using photometry spanning the bband to 8um, we find that the average scuba source forms a significant fractionof its stars in an early period of star formation and that most of theremainder forms in a shorter more intense burst around the redshift it isobserved. this trend does not vary significantly with source redshift but theexact ratio of early to late mass is quite sensitive to the way extinction istreated in the modelling. however, the sources show a clear increase in stellarmass with redshift, consistent with downsizing. in terms of sed types, only twoout of the 51 sources we have obtained photometric redshifts for are best fitby a quasar-like spectral energy distribution, with approximately 80 per centof the sources being best fit with late-type spectra (sc, im and starburst). byincluding photometry at 850um, we conclude that the average scuba source isforming stars at a rate somewhere between 6 and 30 times the rate implied fromthe rest-frame optical in a dust obscured burst and that this burst creates15-65 per cent of the total stellar mass. using a simplistic calculation, weestimate from the average star formation history that between one in five andone in 15 bright (l_* +2 mag &lt; l_optical &lt; l_* -1 mag) galaxies in the fieldover the interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 will at some point in their lifetime experience asimilar energetic dusty burst of star formation. finally, we compute theevolution of the star formation rate density and find it peaks around z=2.

1311.5898	herschel-atlas: deep hst/wfc3 imaging of strongly lensed submillimeter  galaxies	we report on deep near-infrared observations obtained with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope (hst) of the first fiveconfirmed gravitational lensing events discovered by the herschel astrophysicalterahertz large area survey (h-atlas). we succeed in disentangling thebackground galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the twocomponents. the hst data allow us to significantly improve on previousconstraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy and to perform accuratelens modelling of these systems, as described in the accompanying paper by dyeet al. we fit the spectral energy distributions of the background sources fromnear-ir to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification factors estimatedby dye et al. to derive the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies. wefind these galaxies to have star-formation rates of approximately 400 to 2000m_sol/yr, with approximately (6-25)x10^10 m_sol of their baryonic mass alreadyturned into stars. at these rates of star formation, all remaining moleculargas will be exhausted in less than 100 myr, reaching a final mass in stars of afew 10^11 m_sol. these galaxies are thus proto-ellipticals caught during theirmajor episode of star formation, and observed at the peak epoch z=1.5-3 of thecosmic star formation history of the universe.

0802.2458	properties of dusty tori in agn: i. the case of swire/sdss quasars	we derive the properties of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (agn) fromthe comparison of observed spectral energy distributions (seds) of sdss quasarsand a precomputed grid of torus models. the observed seds comprise sdssphotometry, 2mass j, h, and k data, whenever available and mid-infrared (mir)data from the spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) survey. theadopted model is that of fritz et al., 2006. the fit is performed by standardchi^2 minimisation, the model however can be multi-component comprising astellar and a starburst components, whenever necessary. models with lowequatorial optical depth, tau_9.7, were allowed as well as ``traditional''models with tau_9.7 &gt; 1.0, corresponding to a_v &gt; 22 and the results werecompared. fits using high optical depth tori models only produced dust morecompactly distributed than in the configuration where all tau_9.7 models werepermitted. tori with decreasing dust density with the distance from the centrewere favoured while there was no clear preference for models with or withoutangular variation of the dust density. the computed outer radii of the tori areof some tens of parsecs large but can reach, in a few cases, a few hundreds ofparsecs. the mass of dust, m_dust, and infrared luminosity, l_ir, integrated inthe wavelength range between 1 and 1000 micron, do not show significantvariations with redshift, once the observational biases are taken into account.objects with 70 micron detections, representing 25% of the sample, are studiedseparately and the starburst contribution (whenever present) to the irluminosity can reach, in the most extreme but very few cases, 80%.

0803.0475	the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades) - viii. the nature  of faint submm galaxies in shades, swire and sxdf surveys	we present the optical-to-submm spectral energy distributions for 33 radio &amp;mid-ir identified submillimetre galaxies discovered via the shades 850 micronscuba imaging in the subaru-xmm deep field (sxdf). optical data for the sourcescomes from the subaru-xmm deep field (sxdf) and mid- and far-ir fluxes fromswire. we obtain photometric redshift estimates for our sources using opticaland irac 3.6 and 4.5 micron fluxes. we then fit spectral energy distribution(sed) templates to the longer wavelength data to determine the nature of thefar-ir emission that dominates the bolometric luminosity of these sources. theinfrared template fits are also used to resolve ambiguous identifications andcases of redshift aliasing. the redshift distribution obtained broadly matchesprevious results for submm sources and on the shades sxdf field. our templatefitting finds that agn, present in about 10% of sources, do not contributesignificantly to their bolometric luminosity. dust heating by starbursts, witheither arp220 or m82 type seds, appears to be responsible for the luminosity inmost sources (23/33 are fitted by arp220 templates, 2/33 by the warmer m82templates). 8/33 sources, in contrast, are fit by a cooler cirrus dusttemplate, suggesting that cold dust has a role in some of these highly luminousobjects. three of our sources appear to have multiple identifications orcomponents at the same redshift, but we find no statistical evidence that closeassociations are common among our shades sources. examination of rest-frame k-band luminosity suggests that 'downsizing' is underway in the submm galaxypopulation, with lower redshift systems lying in lower mass host galaxies. ofour 33 identifications six are found to be of lower reliability but theirexclusion would not significantly alter our conclusions.

1405.2633	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature deficit of starburst galaxies in  the akari north ecliptic pole deep field	we study the behaviour of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission ingalaxies at z=0.3-1.4 using 1868 samples from the revised catalogue of akarinorth ecliptic pole deep survey. the continuous filter coverage at 2-24um makesit possible to measure 8um luminosity, which is dominated by polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon emission for galaxies at up to z=2. we compare the ir8 (=lir/l(8)) and 8um to 4.5um luminosity ratio (l(8)/l(4.5)) with thestarburstiness, rsb, defined as excess of specific star -formation rate overthat of main-sequence galaxy. all agn candidates were excluded from our sampleusing an sed fitting. we found l(8)/l(4.5) increases with starburstiness at logrsb &lt; 0.5 and stays constant at higher starburstiness. on the other hand, ir8is constant at log rsb &lt; 0, while it increases with starburstiness at log rsb &gt;0. this behaviour is seen in all redshift range of our study. these resultsindicate that starburst galaxies have deficient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonemission compared with main-sequence galaxies. we also find that galaxies withextremely high l(8)/l(4.5) ratio have only moderate starburstiness. theseresults suggest that starburst galaxies have compact star-forming regions withintense radiation, which destroys pahs and/or have dusty hii regions resultingin a lack of ionising photons.

0705.1365	multi-wavelength analysis of 18um-selected galaxies in the akari/irc  monitor field towards the north ecliptic pole	we present an initial analysis of akari 18um-selected galaxies using all 9photometric bands at 2-24um available in the infrared camera (irc), in order todemonstrate new capabilities of akari cosmological surveys. we detected 72sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the akari/irc monitor fieldtowards the north ecliptic pole (nep). from this sample, 25 galaxies withprobable redshifts z&gt;~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (n2-n3&gt;0.1)for a detailed sed analysis with ground-based bvri'z'jk data. using an sedradiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range uv --submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-mir seds of18um-selected galaxies. from the best-fit sed models, we show that the ircall-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blueside of the pah 6.2um emission feature. this indicates that the irc all-bandphotometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies,specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000a break. also, wefind that the flux dip between the pah 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature isrecognizable in the observed seds of galaxies at z~1. by using such a colouranomaly due to the pah and silicate absorption features, unique samples ofulirgs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from largecosmological surveys of akari towards the nep, i.e. the nep-deep and nep-widesurvey. this pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interestinggalaxy properties in the nep-deep and wide surveys, such as a systematicdifference in seds between high- and low-z ulirgs, and a large variation of thepah inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

1502.03362	strong gravitational lensing with the ska	strong gravitational lenses provide an important tool to measure masses inthe distant universe, thus testing models for galaxy formation and dark matter;to investigate structure at the epoch of reionization; and to measure thehubble constant and possibly w as a function of redshift. however, the limitingfactor in all of these studies has been the currently small samples of knowngravitational lenses (~10^2). the era of the ska will transform ourunderstanding of the universe with gravitational lensing, particularly at radiowavelengths where the number of known gravitational lenses will increase to~10^5. here we discuss the technical requirements, expected outcomes and mainscientific goals of a survey for strong gravitational lensing with the ska. wefind that an all-sky (3pi sr) survey carried out with the ska1-mid array at anangular resolution of 0.25-0.5 arcsec and to a depth of 3 microjy / beam isrequired for studies of galaxy formation and cosmology with gravitationallensing. in addition, the capability to carryout vlbi with the ska1 is requiredfor tests of dark matter and studies of supermassive black holes at highredshift to be made using gravitational lensing.

1504.00248	dust attenuation up to z~2 in the akari north ecliptic pole deep field	(abridged) we aim to study the evolution of dust attenuation in galaxiesselected in the ir in the redshift range in which they are known to dominatethe star formation activity in the universe. the comparison with othermeasurements of dust attenuation in samples selected using different criteriawill give us a global picture of the attenuation at work in star-forminggalaxies and its evolution with redshift. using multiple filters of ircinstrument, we selected more than 4000 galaxies from their rest-frame emissionat 8 microns, from z~0.2 to 2$. we built seds from the rest-frame uv to thefar-ir by adding data in the optical-nir and from galex and herschel surveys.we fit seds with the physically-motivated code cigale. we test differenttemplates for agns and recipes for dust attenuation and estimate stellarmasses, sfrs, amount of dust attenuation, and agn contribution to the total irluminosity. the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity is found to be onaverage approximately 10% with a slight increase with redshift. dustattenuation in galaxies dominating the ir luminosity function is found toincrease from z=0 to z=1 and to remain almost constant from z=1 to z=1.5.conversely, when galaxies are selected at a fixed ir luminosity, their dustattenuation slightly decreases as redshift increases but with a largedispersion. the attenuation in our mid-ir selected sample is found ~ 2 maghigher than that found globally in the universe or in uv and halpha lineselections in the same redshift range. this difference is well explained by anincrease of dust attenuation with the stellar mass, in global agreement withother recent studies. starbursting galaxies do not systematically exhibit ahigh attenuation

astro-ph;0106275	hst/wfpc2 imaging of the qdot ultraluminous infrared galaxy sample	we present hst wfpc2 v band imaging for 23 ultraluminous infrared galaxiestaken from the qdot redshift survey. the fraction of sources observed to beinteracting is 87%. most of the merging systems show a number of compact`knots', whose colour and brightness differ substantially from their immediatesurroundings. colour maps for nine of the objects show a non-uniform colourstructure. features include blue regions located towards the centres of mergingsystems which are likely to be areas of enhanced star formation, and compactred regions which are likely to be dust shrouded starbursts or agn. the hostgalaxies of the qsos in the sample were found to be either interacting systemsor ellipticals. our data shows no evidence that ulirgs are a simple transitionstage between galaxy mergers and qsos. we propose an alternative model forulirgs based on the morphologies in our sample and previous n-body simulations.under this model ulirgs as a class are much more diverse than a simpletransition between galaxy merger and qso. the evolution of ir power source andmerger morphology in ulirgs is driven solely by the local environment and themorphologies of the merger progenitors.

astro-ph;0107446	the scuba 8-mjy survey - i: sub-millimetre maps, sources and number  counts	we present maps, source lists, and number counts from the largest, unbiassed,extragalactic sub-mm survey so far undertaken with the scuba camera on thejcmt. our maps cover 260 sq. arcmin, to a noise level s(850)=2.5 mjy/beam. wehave reduced the data using both surf, and our own pipeline which produceszero-footprint maps and noise images. the uncorrelated noise maps produced bythe latter approach have allowed application of a maximum-likelihood method tomeasure the statistical significance of each peak, leading to properlyquantified flux-density errors for all potential sources. we detect 19 sourceswith s/n &gt; 4, 38 with s/n &gt; 3.5, and 72 with s/n &gt; 3. to assess completenessand the impact of source confusion we have applied our source extractionalgorithm to a series of simulated images. the result is a new estimate of thesub-mm source counts in the flux-density range s(850)=5-15mjy, which we comparewith other estimates, and with model predictions. our estimate of thecumulative source count at s(850) &gt; 8 mjy is 320 (+80,-100) per square degree.assuming that the majority of sources have z &gt; 1.5, the co-moving numberdensity of high-z galaxies forming stars at a rate &gt;1000 solar masses per yearis 10^-5 per mpc^3, with only a weak dependence on the precise redshiftdistribution. this number density corresponds to that of massive ellipticalswith l &gt; 3-4 l* at low redshift and is also the same as the co-moving numberdensity of comparably massive, passively-evolving objects in the redshift band1&lt;z&lt;2 inferred from recent surveys of extremely red objects. thus the brightsub-mm sources can plausibly account for the formation of all present-daymassive ellipticals. improved z constraints, and a proper measurement of sub-mmclustering can refine or refute this picture.

astro-ph;0107585	the scuba 8-mjy survey - ii: multiwavelength analysis of bright sub-mm  sources	we present the results of a multi-wavelength study of the 19 most significantsub-mm sources detected in the scuba 8-mjy survey. as described in scott et al.(2001), this survey covers ~260 arcmin^2 using the sub-millimetre camera scuba,to a limiting source detection limit s(850um) ~ 8 mjy. one advantage of thisrelatively bright flux-density limit is that accurate astrometric positions arepotentially achievable for every source using existing radio and/or mm-waveinterferometers. however, an associated advantage is that sed-based redshiftconstraints should be more powerful than in fainter sub-mm surveys. here wetherefore exploit the parallel scuba 450um data, in combination with existingradio and iso data at longer and shorter wavelengths to set constraints on theredshift of each source. we also analyse new and existing optical andnear-infrared imaging of our scuba survey fields to select potentialidentifications consistent with these constraints. our derived sed-basedredshift constraints, and the lack of statistically significant associationswith even moderately bright galaxies allow us to conclude that all 19 sourceslie at z &gt; 1, and at least half of them apparently lie at z &gt; 2.

astro-ph;0108400	the coincidence and angular clustering of chandra and scuba sources	we explore the relationship between the hard x-ray and sub-mm populationsusing deep chandra observations of a large, contiguous scuba survey. inagreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap issmall. of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only oneis coincident with a chandra source. the resulting limits imply that themajority of scuba sources are not powered by agn, unless the central engine isobscured by compton-thick material with a low (&lt;1 per cent) scatteredcomponent. furthermore, since chandra detects only ~5 per cent of scubasources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. the x-rayupper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburstsed at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of scuba sources lie at z&gt;1even if they are purely starburst galaxies. despite the low detection rate, wefind evidence for strong angular clustering between the x-ray and sub-mmpopulations. the implication is that agn and scuba sources trace the samelarge-scale structure but do not generally coincide. if bright sub-mm sourcesrepresent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for agiven galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from theperiod of observable quasar activity.

astro-ph;0201502	sub-millimetre observations of the hubble deep field and flanking fields	we present an extended analysis of the scuba observations of the hubble deepfield (hdf), expanding the areal coverage of the hughes et al. 1998 study by afactor of ~1.8 and containing at least three further sources in addition to thefive in that study. we also announce the public release of the reduced dataproducts. the map is the deepest ever made in the sub-millimetre, obtained inexcellent conditions (median 850um optical depth of 0.16). two independentreductions were made, one with surf and the other with a wholly algorithmic idlanalysis which we present in detail here. of the three new sources, all appearto be at z&gt;~0.9 and one is provisionally associated with an extremely redobject (i-k&gt;5). there appears to be no significant cross-correlation signalbetween the 850um fluctuations and sources detected by isocam, the vla orchandra, nor with very red objects (i-k&gt;4), nor quasars and quasar candidatesin the hdf (notwithstanding a small number of individual weak candidatedetections). this is consistent with interpretations where the 850um-selectedgalaxies are at higher redshifts than those currently probed by isocam/vla, andpredominantly not compton-thin agn. there are only one or two compelling casesfor the radio source being the sub-mm source. nevertheless, most scuba-hdfpoint sources have a nearby radio source apparently well-separated from thesub-mm centroid.

astro-ph;0201510	observations of the hubble deep field south with the infrared space  observatory - ii. associations and star formation rates	we present results from a deep mid-ir survey of the hubble deep field south(hdf-s) region performed at 7 and 15um with the cam instrument on board iso. wefound reliable optical/near-ir associations for 32 of the 35 sources detectedin this field by oliver et al. (2002, paper i): eight of them were identifiedas stars, one is definitely an agn, a second seems likely to be an agn, too,while the remaining 22 appear to be normal spiral or starburst galaxies. usingmodel spectral energy distributions (seds) of similar galaxies, we comparemethods for estimating the star formation rates (sfrs) in these objects,finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) ir luminosityreproduces the model sfrs best. applying this estimator to model fits to theseds of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are formingstars at rates of ~1-100 m_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40m_sol/yr, assumingan einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of 50 km/s/mpc, andstar formation taking place according to a salpeter (1955) imf across the massrange 0.1-100m_sol. we split the redshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.6 into two equal-volumebins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed bythese sources, assuming the same cosmology and imf as above and computingerrors based on estimated uncertainties in the sfrs of individual galaxies. wecompare these results with other estimates of the sfr density made with thesame assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of flores etal. (1999) from their iso survey of the cfrs 1415+52 field. however, therelatively small volume of our survey means that our sfr density estimatessuffer from a large sampling variance, implying that our results, bythemselves, do not place tight constraints on the global mean sfr density.

astro-ph;0202427	the evolution of type 1 agn in the ir (15mu). the view from elais-s1	we present the 15 micron luminosity function of type 1 agn (qso + seyfert 1).our sample of 21 high-redshift sources is selected from the preliminaryanalysis catalogue in the s1 field of the european large area iso survey(elais). to study the cosmological evolution of the agn1 luminosity function,our sample has been combined with a local sample of 41 sources observed byiras. we find that the luminosity function of agn1 at 15 micron is fairly wellrepresented by a double-power-law-function. there is evidence for significantcosmological evolution consistent with a pure luminosity evolution (ple) modell(z) (1+z)^k, with k=3.0-3.3. the value of k depends on the existence or not ofan evolution cut-off at redshift ~2, and on the adopted cosmology. from theluminosity function and its evolution we estimate a contribution of agn1 to thecosmic infrared background (cirb) of nui_nu ~ 6 x 10^{-11}w m^{-2} sr^{-1} at15 micron. this corresponds to ~2-3% of the total observed cirb at thiswavelength. under the usual assumptions of unified models for agn, the expectedcontribution of the whole agn population to the cirb at 15 micron is 10-15%.

astro-ph;0205173	new method for isocam data reduction - ii. mid-infrared extragalactic  source counts in the southern elais field	we present the 15 micron extragalactic source counts from the final analysiscatalogue of the european large area iso survey southern hemisphere field s1,extracted using the lari method. the large number of extragalactic sources(about 350) detected over this area between 0.5 and 100 mjy guarantee a highstatistical significance of the source counts in the previously poorly coveredflux density range between iras and the deep isocam surveys. the bright countsin s1 (&gt; 2mjy) are consistent with a flat, euclidean slope, suggesting thedominance of a non-evolving population. in contrast, at fainter fluxes (&lt; 2mjy) our counts show a strong departure from no evolution models, with a verysteep super-euclidean slope down to our flux limit. strong luminosity anddensity evolution is needed at least for the population of star-forminggalaxies, together with a luminosity break around 10^10.8 lsun in their localluminosity function in order to reproduce our sharp increase of the countsbelow 2 mjy and the redshift distributions observed for 15 micron sources atdifferent flux levels. the contribution of the strongly evolving starburstpopulation (down to 50 microjy) to the 15 micron cosmic background is estimatedto be 2.2 nw m^-2 sr^-1 (67% of the total mid-infrared background estimate).

astro-ph;0205422	sub-millimetre observations of hyperluminous infrared galaxies	we present sub-mm photometry for 11 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (hlirgs)and use radiative transfer models for starbursts and agn to investigate the iremission. in all sources both a starburst and agn are required to explain their emission. the mean starburst fraction is 35%, with a range spanning 80%starburst dominated to 80% agn dominated. in all cases the starburst dominatesat rest-frame wavelengths &gt;50 microns, with star formation rates &gt;500 solarmasses per year. the trend of increasing agn fraction with increasing irluminosity seen in iras galaxies peaks in hlirgs, and is not higher than thefraction seen in bright ulirgs. the agn and starburst luminosities correlate,suggesting that a common physical factor, plausibly the dust masses, governstheir luminosities. our results suggest that the hlirg population is comprisedboth of ulirg-like galaxy mergers, and of young galaxies going through theirmaximal star formation periods whilst harbouring an agn. the coeval agn andstarburst activity in our sources implies that starburst and agn activity, andthe peak starburst and agn luminosities, can be coeval in active galaxiesgenerally. when extrapolated to high-z our sources have comparable sub-mmfluxes to sub-mm survey sources. at least some sub-mm survey sources aretherefore likely to be comprised of similar galaxy populations to those foundin the hlirg population. it is also plausible from these results that high-zsub-mm sources harbour heavily obscured agn. the differences in x-ray andsub-mm properties between hlirgs at z~1 and sub-mm sources at z~3 impliesevolution between the two epochs. either the mean agn obscuration level isgreater at z~3 than at z~1, or the fraction of ir-luminous sources at z~3 thatcontain agn is smaller than that at z~1.

astro-ph;0205480	discovery of the host galaxy of hdf850.1, the brightest sub-mm source in  the hubble deep field	despite extensive observational efforts, the brightest sub--mm source in thehubble deep field, hdf850.1, has failed to yield a convincing optical/infraredidentification almost 4 years after its discovery. this failure is all the morenotable given the availability of supporting multi-frequency data ofunparalleled depth, and sub-arcsec positional accuracy for the sub-mm/mmsource. consequently, hdf850.1 has become a test case of the possibility thatthe most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/ordistant to be seen in the deepest optical images. here we report the discoveryof the host galaxy of hdf850.1. this object has been revealed by carefulanalysis of a new, deep k-prime image of the hdf obtained with the subaru 8.2-mtelescope. its reality is confirmed by a similar analysis of the hst nicmosf160w image of the same region. this object is extremely faint (k=23.5), clumpy(on sub-arcsec scales) and very red (i-k &gt; 5.2; h-k = 1.4 +- 0.35). thelikelihood that it is the correct identification is strongly reinforced by areanalysis of the combined merlin+vla 1.4-ghz map of the field which yields anew radio detection of hdf850.1 only 0.1 arcsec from the new near-ircounterpart, and with sufficient positional accuracy to exclude all previouslyconsidered alternative optical candidates. we have calculated new confidencelimits on the estimated redshift of hdf850.1 and find z = 4.1 +- 0.5. we alsocalculate that the flux density of hdf850.1 has been boosted by a factor of ~3through lensing by the intervening elliptical 3-586.0, consistent withpredictions that a small but significant fraction of blank-field sub-mm sourcesare lensed by foreground galaxies. we discuss the wider implications of theseresults for the sub-mm population and cosmic star-formation history.

astro-ph;0210248	obscured agn from the elais deep x-ray survey	the sources discovered in deep hard x-ray surveys with 2-8 kev fluxes of10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 make up the bulk of the x-ray background at theseenergies. we present here detailed multi-wavelength observations of three suchsources from the elais deep x-ray survey. the observations include sensitivenear-infrared spectroscopy with the subaru telescope and x-ray spectralinformation from the chandra x-ray observatory. the sources observed all haveoptical-to-near-ir colours redder than an unobscured quasar and comprise areddened quasar, a radio galaxy and an optically-obscured agn. the reddenedquasar is at a redshift z=2.61 and shows a very large x-ray absorbing column ofn_h approx 3.10^23 cm^-2. this contrasts with the relatively small amount ofdust reddening, implying a gas-to-dust ratio along the line-of-sight a hundredtimes greater than that of the milky way. the radio galaxy at z=1.57 shows onlynarrow emission lines, but has a surprisingly soft x-ray spectrum. the softnessof this spectrum either indicates an unusually low gas-to-dust ratio for theabsorbing medium or x-ray emission related to the young radio source. the hostgalaxy is extremely red (r-k=6.4) and its optical/near-ir spectrum is best fitby a strongly reddened (a_v~2) starburst. the third x-ray source discussed isalso extremely red (r-k=6.1) and lies in a close grouping of three other r-k&gt;6galaxies. no emission or absorption lines were detected from this object, butits redshift (and that of one of the nearby galaxies) are constrained bysed-fitting to be just greater than z=1. the extremely red colours of these twogalaxies can be accounted for by old stellar populations. these observationsillustrate the diverse properties of hard x-ray selected agn.

astro-ph;0406028	sub-millimeter detections of spitzer space telescope galaxy populations	we present sub-millimeter statistical detections of galaxies discovered inthe 5'x5' spitzer early release observations (to 4-15 microjy 5 sigma at 3.6-8microns, 170 microjy at 24 microns) through a stacking analysis of ourreanalysed scuba 8mjy survey maps, and a spitzer identification of a newsub-millimeter point source in the 8mjy survey region. for sources detected at5.8 or 8 microns (154 and 111 sources respectively), we detect positive skewsin the sub-millimeter flux distributions at 99.2-99.8% confidence usingkolmogorov-smirnov tests, at both 850 microns and 450 microns. we alsomarginally detect the spitzer 24 micron galaxies at 850 microns at 97%confidence, and place limits on the mean sub-millimeter fluxes of the 3.6 and4.5 micron sources. integrating the sub-millimeter fluxes of the spitzerpopulations, we find the 5.8 micron galaxies contribute 0.12 +/- 0.05 nw/m^2/srto the 850 micron background, and 2.4 +/- 0.7 nw/m^2/sr to the 450 micronbackground; similar contributions are made by the 8 micron-selected sample. weinfer that the populations dominating the 5.8 and 8 micron extragalacticbackground light also contribute around a quarter of the 850 micron backgroundand the majority of the 450 micron background.

astro-ph;0406158	spitzer observations of mambo galaxies: weeding out active nuclei in  starbursting proto-ellipticals	we present spitzer observations in five wavebands between 3.6 and 24um of anunbiased sample of 9 luminous, dusty galaxies selected at 1200um by the mambocamera on the iram 30-m telescope, a population akin to the well-known submm or`scuba' galaxies (hereafter smgs). owing to the coarse resolution of submm/mminstrumentation, smgs have traditionally been difficult to identify at otherwavelengths. we compare our multi-wavelength catalogs to show that the overlapbetween 24 and 1200um must be close to complete at these flux levels. we findthat all (4/4) of the most secure &gt;=4sigma smgs have robust &gt;=4sigmacounterparts at 1.4ghz, while the fraction drops to 7/9 using all &gt;=3sigmasmgs. we show that combining mid-ir and marginal (&gt;=3sigma) radio detectionsprovides plausible identifications in the remaining cases, enabling us toidentify the complete sample. accretion onto an obscured central engine isbetrayed by the shape of the mid-ir continuum emission for several sources,confirming spitzer's potential to weed out active galaxies. we demonstrate thepower of a s(24um)/s(8um) vs s(8um)/s(4.5um) color-color plot as a diagnosticfor this purpose. however, we conclude that the majority (~75%) of smgs haverest-frame mid-/far-ir seds commensurate with obscured starbursts. sensitive24-um observations are clearly a useful route to identify and characterizereliable counterparts to high-redshift far-ir-bright galaxies, complementingwhat is possible via deep radio imaging.

astro-ph;0409723	mid-infrared sources in the elais deep x-ray survey	we present a cross-correlation of the european large area iso survey (elais)with the elais deep x-ray survey of the n1 and n2 fields. there are 7 chandrapoint sources with matches in the elais final analysis 15um catalogue, out of atotal of 28 extragalactic iso sources present in the chandra fields. five ofthese are consistent with agn giving an agn fraction of ~19 per cent in the15um flux range 0.8-6 mjy. we have co-added the hard x-ray fluxes of theindividually-undetected iso sources and find a low significance detectionconsistent with star formation in the remaining population. we combine ourpoint source cross-correlation fraction with the xmm-newton observations of thelockman hole and chandra observations of the hubble deep field north toconstrain source count models of the mid-infrared galaxy population. the lowdust-enshrouded agn fraction in elais implied by the number ofcross-identifications between the elais mid-infrared sample and the chandrapoint sources is encouraging for the use of mid-infrared surveys to constrainthe cosmic star formation history, provided there are not further largeundetected populations of compton-thick agn.

(2003) for signal processing from erd(edited raw data) to scp (signal per chopper plateau). the elais 90mumcatalogue contains 229 reliable sources with fluxes larger than 70 mjy and isavailable at www.blackwell-synergy.com. number counts are presented and show anexcess above the no-evolution model prediction. this confirms the strongevolution detected at shorter(15mum) and longer (170mum) wavelengths in otheriso surveys. the elais counts are in agreement with previous works at 90mum andin particular with the deeper counts extracted from the lockman holeobservations. comparison with recent evolutionary models show that the modelsof franceschini et al. and guiderdoni et al. which includes aheavily-extinguished population of galaxies give the best fit to the data.deeper observations are nevertheless required to better discriminate betweenthe model predictions in the far-infrared and are scheduled with the spitzerspace telescope which already started operating and will also be performed byastro-f.

astro-ph;0412184	spectral energy distributions and luminosities of galaxies and agn in  the spitzer swire legacy survey	we discuss optical associations, spectral energy distributions andphotometric redshifts for swire sources in the elais-n1 area and the lockmanvalidation field. the band-merged irac (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 mu) and mips (24,70, 160 mu) data have been associated with optical ugriz data from the int widefield survey in elais-n1, and with our own optical ugri data in lockman-vf. thespectral energy distributions of selected elais sources in n1 detected byswire, most with spectroscopic redshifts, are modelled in terms of a simple setof galaxy and quasar templates in the optical and near infrared, and with a setof dust emission templates (cirrus, m82 starburst, arp 220 starburst, and agndust torus) in the mid infrared. the optical data, together with the irac 3.6and 4.5 mu data, have been used to determine photometric redshifts. forgalaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts there is a notable improvement inthe photometric redshift when the irac data are used, with a reduction in therms scatter from 10% in (1+z) to 7%. the photometric redshifts are used toderive the 3.6 and 24 mu redshift distribution and to compare this with thepredictions of models. for those sources with a clear mid infrared excess,relative to the galaxy starlight model used for the optical and near infrared,the mid and far infrared data are modelled in terms of the same dust emissiontemplates. the proportions found of each template type are: cirrus 31%, m8229%, arp 220 10%, agn dust tori 29%. the distribution of the different infraredsed types in the l_{ir}/l_{opt} versus l_{ir} plane, where l_{ir} and l_{opt}are the infrared and optical bolometric luminosities, is discussed.

astro-ph;0507612	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- i. survey  motivation, design and data processing	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) is a major blank-fieldextragalactic sub-mm survey underway at the james clerk maxwelltelescope.shades aims to cover half a square degree at 450+850microns to a4sigma depth of ~8mjy at 850microns. two fields are being observed, thesubaru/xmm--newton deep field (sxdf) and the lockman hole east. the survey has3 main aims to investigate: i) the cosmic history of massive dust enshroudedstar-formation activity, ii) the clustering properties of sub-mm-selectedgalaxies in order to determine whether these objects could be progenitors ofpresent-day massive ellipticals, and iii) the fraction of sub-mm-selectedsources that harbour agn. to achieve these aims requires the sub-mm data becombined with co-spatial information spanning the radio-to-x-ray frequencyrange, the resulting extensive multi-wavelength dataset providing completephotometric redshift information accurate to delta z &lt;~0.5 and detailed sedsfor the vast majority of the sub-mm-selected sources. in this paper, the firstof a series on shades, we present an overview of the motivation for the survey,describe the survey strategy and provide a detailed description of the primarydata analysis pipeline. as of feb. 2004, 720arcmin^2 had been mapped with scuba(about 40% of the anticipated final total) to a median 1sigma depth of 2.2mjyper beam at 850microns (25mjy per beam at 450microns), and a source density of650+/-50 sources/deg^2 &gt;3sigma at 850microns, uncorrected for eddington bias. arefined re-analysis of the original 8-mjy survey lockman hole data was carriedout in order to evaluate the new data reduction pipeline. of the 17 most securesources in the original sample, 12 have been re-confirmed, including 10 of the11 for which radio ids were previously secured.(abridged)

astro-ph;0509898	a robust sample of submillimetre galaxies: constraints on the prevalence  of dusty, high-redshift starbursts	the modest significance of most sources detected in current submm surveys canpotentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sourcesin catalogues typically selected at &gt;3.0-3.5sigma. here, we develop and apply adual-survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole.cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of smgs is more robust than previous samples,with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint smgs (beneath and around theconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. the effective fluxlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-ghz image. the former issensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latterprobes the z&lt;3 regime. a high fraction of our robust smgs (~80%) have radiocounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggeststhat very distant smgs (z&gt;&gt;3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of thebright smg population. this implies that almost all of the bright smgpopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. we usethese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positionaluncertainty in smg catalogues. we then go on to outline the acquisition ofredshifts for radio-identified smgs, from sample selection in the submm, tocounterpart selection in the radio and optical/ir, to slit placement onspectrograph masks. we determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample ofsix secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/orless reliable redshifts. these figures are consistent with previous estimates,suggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright smgs populationhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.

astro-ph;0608482	a combined re-analysis of existing blank-field scuba surveys:  comparative 850-micron source lists, combined number counts, and evidence for  strong clustering of the bright sub-mm galaxy population	taken together, the blank-field sub-mm surveys undertaken with scuba prior tothe shades survey cover a total area of 460 sq. arcmin to a range of depths.however combining the results from these surveys has hitherto been complicatedby the fact that different survey groups have used different methods of datareduction and source extraction. here we present the results of re-reducing andanalysing all of these blank field scuba in an almost identical manner to thatemployed in the scuba 8-mjy survey. comparative source catalogues are givenwhich include a number of new significant source detections as well as failingto confirm some of those objects previously published. these new sourcecatalogues have been combined to produce the most accurate number counts todate from 2 to 12.5 mjy. the cumulative number counts appear to steepen beyonds(850)=8mjy, which could indicate an intrinsic turn-over in the underlyingluminosity function placing an upper limit on the luminosity (and hence mass)of a high redshift galaxy. we have also investigated the clustering propertiesof the bright scuba population by means of 2-point angular correlationfunctions. we find evidence for strong clustering broadly consistent with thatmeasured for extremely red objects (eros). nearest-neighbour analyses furthersupport strong clustering on arcmin scales, rejecting the null hypothesis thatthe distribution of the bright submm sources is random at the 99% confidencelevel.

astro-ph;0609039	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- ii. submillimetre  maps, catalogue and number counts	we present the maps, source catalogue and number counts of the largest, mostcomplete and unbiased extragalactic submillimetre survey ever undertaken: the850-micron scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades). using thesubmillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt), shades mapped two separate regions of sky: thesubaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf) and the lockman hole east (lh). these scubamaps cover 720 square arcmin with an rms noise level of about 2 mjy and haveuncovered &gt;100 submillimetre galaxies. in order to ensure the utmost robustnessof the resulting source catalogue, data reduction was independently carried outby four sub-groups drawn within the shades team, providing an unprecedenteddegree of reliability with respect to other scuba catalogues available from theliterature. individual source lists from the four groups were combined toproduce a robust 120-object shades catalogue; an invaluable resource forfollow-up campaigns aiming to study the properties of a complete and consistentsample of submillimetre galaxies. we present differential and integral sourcenumber counts of submillimetre galaxies and find that the differential countsare better fit with a broken power-law or a schechter function than with asingle power-law; the shades data alone significantly show that a break isrequired at several mjy, although the precise position of the break is not wellconstrained. we also find that an 850-micron survey complete down to 2 mjywould resolve 20-30 per cent of the far-ir background into point sources.[abridged]

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.

astro-ph;9912070	clustering of galaxies around radio quasars at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8	we have observed the galaxy environments around a sample of 21 radio-loud,steep-spectrum quasars at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.82, spanning several orders of magnitude inradio luminosity. the observations also include background control fields usedto obtain the excess number of galaxies in each quasar field. the galaxy excesswas quantified using the spatial galaxy-quasar correlation amplitude, b_gq, andan abell-type measurement, n_0.5 (hill &amp; lilly 1991). a few quasars are foundin relatively rich clusters, but on average, they seem to prefer galaxy groupsor clusters of approximately abell class 0. we have combined our sample withliterature samples extending down to z=0.2 and covering the same range in radioluminosity. by using spearman statistic to disentangle redshift and luminositydependences, we detect a weak, but significant, positive correlation betweenthe richness of the quasar environment and the quasar's radio luminosity.however, we do not find any epoch dependence in b_gq, as has previously beenreported for radio quasars and galaxies. we discuss the radioluminosity-cluster richness link and possible explanations for the weakcorrelation that is seen.

astro-ph;9912231	starburst galaxies and structure in the submillimetre background towards  the hubble deep field	we use an 850-micron scuba map of the hdf to study the dust properties ofoptically-selected starburst galaxies at high redshift. although the 850-micronmap does not allow detection of the majority of individual sources, we showthat the galaxies with the highest uv star-formation rates are detectedstatistically, with a flux density of about s_{850}=0.2 mjy for an apparent uvstar-formation rate of 1 h^{-2} msun yr^{-1}. this level of submillimetreoutput indicates that the total star-forming activity is on average a factor ofapproximately 6 times larger than the rate inferred from the uv output of thesegalaxies. the general population of optical starbursts is then predicted tocontribute at least 25 per cent of the 850-micron background. we carry out apower-spectrum analysis of the map, which yields some evidence for angularclustering of the background source population, but at a level lower than thatseen in lyman-break galaxies. together with other lines of argument,particularly from the nicmos hdf data, this suggests that the 850-micronbackground originates over an extremely wide range of redshifts -- perhaps 1 &lt;z &lt; 6.

0706.0068	far-infrared distributions in nearby spiral galaxies ngc2841 and ngc2976  observed with akari/fis	far-infrared (ir) images of the nearby sb galaxy ngc2841 and the sc galaxyngc2976 at wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, and 160 um have been obtained with thefar-infrared surveyor (fis) onboard akari. both galaxies reveal similarmorphologies of dust rings. they are, however, significantly different in thedust temperature: a cold (21 k) ring for ngc2841 and a warm (30 k) ring forngc2976, which presumably reflects the difference in the origin of the ringstructure for the different hubble type of the galaxy. in addition to the dustring structure, a warm dust component is detected from the central region ofngc2841, which may be attributed to the heating by its low-ionization nuclearemission-line region nucleus. as for ngc2976, an extended dust component isobserved along the minor axis, which shows a distribution somewhat asymmetricalto the galactic disk; this might be associated with the hi bridge in them81/m82 group that ngc2976 belongs to. by taking advantage of a wealth of thefar-ir bands of the fis, it is demonstrated that the spectral energydistribution of ngc2841 is spatially more variable than that of ngc2976.

0811.4158	photometric redshift accuracy in akari deep surveys	we investigate the photometric redshift accuracy achievable with the akariinfrared data in deep multi-band surveys, such as in the north ecliptic polefield. we demonstrate that the passage of redshifted policyclic aromatichydrocarbons and silicate features into the mid-infrared wavelength windowcovered by akari is a valuable means to recover the redshifts of starburstgalaxies. to this end we have collected a sample of ~60 galaxies drawn from thegoods-north field with spectroscopic redshift 0.5&lt;~z_spec&lt;~1.5 and photometryfrom 3.6 to 24 micron, provided by the spitzer, iso and akari satellites. theinfrared spectra are fitted using synthetic galaxy spectral energydistributions which account for starburst and active nuclei emission. for ~90%of the sources in our sample the redshift is recovered with an accuracy|z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&lt;~10%. a similar analysis performed on different setsof simulated spectra shows that the akari infrared data alone can providephotometric redshifts accurate to |z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&lt;~10% (1-sigma) atz&lt;~2. at higher redshifts the pah features are shifted outside the wavelengthrange covered by akari and the photo-z estimates rely on the less prominent 1.6micron stellar bump; the accuracy achievable in this case on (1+z) is ~10-15%,provided that the agn contribution to the infrared emission is subdominant. ourtechnique is no more prone to redshift aliasing than optical-uv photo-z, and itmay be possible to reduce this aliasing further with the addition ofsubmillimetre and/or radio data.

0812.1718	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey i. star forming molecular gas in  virgo cluster spiral galaxies	we present large-area maps of the co j=3-2 emission obtained at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope for four spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster. wecombine these data with published co j=1-0, 24 micron, and halpha images tomeasure the co line ratios, molecular gas masses, and instantaneous gasdepletion times. for three galaxies in our sample (ngc 4254, ngc4321, and ngc4569), we obtain molecular gas masses of 7e8-3e9 msun and disk-averagedinstantaneous gas depletion times of 1.1-1.7 gyr. we argue that the co j=3-2line is a better tracer of the dense star forming molecular gas than the coj=1-0 line, as it shows a better correlation with the star formation ratesurface density both within and between galaxies. ngc 4254 appears to have alarger star formation efficiency(smaller gas depletion time), perhaps becauseit is on its first passage through the virgo cluster. ngc 4569 shows alarge-scale gradient in the gas properties traced by the co j=3-2/j=1-0 lineratio, which suggests that its interaction with the intracluster medium isaffecting the dense star-forming portion of the interstellar medium directly.the fourth galaxy in our sample, ngc 4579, has weak co j=3-2 emission despitehaving bright 24 micron emission; however, much of the central luminosity inthis galaxy may be due to the presence of a central agn.
