0910.4471	v5116 sgr: a disc-eclipsed sss post-outburst nova?	nova v5116 sgr 2005 no. 2, discovered on 2005 july 4, was observed withxmm-newton in march 2007, 20 months after the optical outburst. the x-rayspectrum showed that the nova had evolved to a pure supersoft x-ray source,indicative of residual h-burning on top of the white dwarf. the x-raylight-curve shows abrupt decreases and increases of the flux by a factor 8 witha periodicity of 2.97h, consistent with the possible orbital period of thesystem. the epic spectra are well fit with an one white dwarf atmosphere model,with the same temperature both in the low and the high flux periods. this rulesout an intrinsic variation of the x-ray source as the origin of the fluxchanges, and points to a possible partial eclipse as the origin of the variablelight curve. the rgs high resolution spectra support this scenario showing anumber of emission features in the low flux state, which either disappear orchange into absorption features in the high flux state. a new xmm-newtonobservation in march 2009 shows the sss had turned off and v5116 sgr hadevolved into a weaker and harder x-ray source.

1009.4063	optical/ir counterpart to the resolved x-ray jet source cxo  j172337.5-373442 and its distance	we present results of observations in the optical to mid-infrared wavelengthsof the x-ray source cxo j172337.5-373442, which was serendipitously discoveredin the chandra images and was found to have a fully resolved x-ray jet. theobservations include a combination of photometry and spectroscopy in theoptical using ground-based telescopes and mid-infrared photometry usingspitzer. we detect the optical/ir counterpart of cxo j172337.5-373442 andidentify it to be a g9-v star located at a distance of 334+-60~pc. comparablevalues of the hydrogen column densities determined independently from theoptical/ir observations and x-ray observations indicate that the optical sourceis associated with the x-ray source. since the x-ray luminosity can not beexplained in terms of emission from a single g9-v star, it is likely that cxoj172337.5-373442 is an accreting compact object in a binary system. thus, cxoj172337.5-373442 is the nearest known resolved x-ray jet from a binary system,which is not a symbiotic star. based on the existing x-ray data, the nature ofthe compact object can not be confirmed. however the low luminosity of thex-ray point source, 7.1x10^{30} lsun combined with estimates of the age of thejet and a lack of detection of bright outburst, suggests that the x-ray jet waslaunched during extreme quiescence of the object. the measured low x-rayluminosity of the jet suggests the likelihood of such jets being moreubiquitous than our current understanding.

1009.5045	time-resolved spectroscopy of the 3 brightest and hardest short  gamma-ray bursts observed with the fgst gamma-ray burst monitor	from july 2008 to october 2009, the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) on boardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fgst) has detected 320 gamma-ray bursts(grbs). about 20% of these events are classified as short based on their t90duration below 2 s. we present here for the first time time-resolvedspectroscopy at timescales as short as 2 ms for the three brightest short grbsobserved with gbm. the time-integrated spectra of the events deviate from theband function, indicating the existence of an additional spectral component,which can be fit by a power-law with index ~-1.5. the time-integrated epeakvalues exceed 2 mev for two of the bursts, and are well above the valuesobserved in the brightest long grbs. their epeak values and their low-energypower-law indices ({\alpha}) confirm that short grbs are harder than long ones.we find that short grbs are very similar to long ones, but with light curvescontracted in time and with harder spectra stretched towards higher energies.in our time-resolved spectroscopy analysis, we find that the epeak values rangefrom a few tens of kev up to more than 6 mev. in general, the hardnessevolutions during the bursts follows their flux/intensity variations, similarto long bursts. however, we do not always see the epeak leading the light-curverises, and we confirm the zero/short average light-curve spectral lag below 1mev, already established for short grbs. we also find that the time-resolvedlow-energy power-law indices of the band function mostly violate the limitsimposed by the synchrotron models for both slow and fast electron cooling andmay require additional emission processes to explain the data. finally, weinterpreted these observations in the context of the current existing modelsand emission mechanisms for the prompt emission of grbs.

1010.2679	when a standard candle flickers	the crab nebula is the only hard x-ray source in the sky that is both brightenough and steady enough to be easily used as a standard candle. as a result,it has been used as a normalization standard by most x-ray/gamma raytelescopes. although small-scale variations in the nebula are well-known, sincethe start of science operations of the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) inaugust 2008, a ~ 7% (70 mcrab) decline has been observed in the overall crabnebula flux in the 15 - 50 kev band, measured with the earth occultationtechnique. this decline is independently confirmed with three otherinstruments: the swift burst alert telescope (swift/bat), the rossi x-raytiming explorer proportional counter array (rxte/pca), and the internationalgamma-ray astrophysics laboratory imager on board integral (ibis). a similardecline is also observed in the ~3 - 15 kev data from the rxte/pca and integraljoint european monitor (jem-x) and in the 50 - 100 kev band with gbm andintegral/ibis. observations from 100 to 500 kev with gbm suggest that thedecline may be larger at higher energies. the pulsed flux measured withrxte/pca since 1999 is consistent with the pulsar spin-down, indicating thatthe observed changes are nebular. correlated variations in the crab nebula fluxon a ~3 year timescale are also seen independently with the pca, bat, and ibisfrom 2005 to 2008, with a flux minimum in april 2007. as of august 2010, thecurrent flux has declined below the 2007 minimum.

1101.2458	a new derivation of grb jet opening angles from the prompt gamma-ray  emission	the jet opening angle of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is an important parameterfor determining the characteristics of the progenitor, and the informationcontained in the opening angle gives insight into the relativistic outflow andthe total energy that is contained in the burst. unfortunately, a confidentinference of the jet opening angle usually requires broadband measurement ofthe afterglow of the grb, from the x-ray down to the radio and from minutes todays after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. forthis reason, very few of all detected grbs have constrained jet angles. wepresent an alternative approach to derive jet opening angles from the promptemission of the grb, given that the grb has a measurable epeak and fluence, andwhich does not require any afterglow measurements. we present the distributionof derived jet opening angles for the first two years of the fermi gamma-rayburst monitor (gbm) operation, and we compare a number of our derived openingangles to the reported opening angles using the traditional afterglow method.we derive the collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy, e_{\gamma}, for grbs withredshift and find that some of the grbs in our sample are inconsistent with aproto-magnetar progenitor. finally, we show that the use of the derived jetopening angles results in a tighter correlation between the rest-frame epeakand e_{\gamma} than has previously been presented, which places long grbs andshort grbs onto one empirical power law.

1101.3325	first-year results of broadband spectroscopy of the brightest fermi-gbm  gamma-ray bursts	we present here our results of the temporal and spectral analysis of a sampleof 52 bright and hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed with the fermi gamma-rayburst monitor (gbm) during its first year of operation (july 2008-july 2009).our sample was selected from a total of 253 gbm grbs based on each event peakcount rate measured between 0.2 and 40mev. the final sample comprised 34 longand 18 short grbs. these numbers show that the gbm sample contains a muchlarger fraction of short grbs, than the cgro/batse data set, which we explainas the result of our (different) selection criteria and the improved gbmtrigger algorithms, which favor collection of short, bright grbs over batse. afirst by-product of our selection methodology is the determination of adetection threshold from the gbm data alone, above which grbs most likely willbe detected in the mev/gev range with the large area telescope (lat) onboardfermi. this predictor will be very useful for future multiwavelength grb followups with ground and space based observatories. further we have estimated theburst durations up to 10mev and for the first time expanded the duration-energyrelationship in the grb light curves to high energies. we confirm that grbdurations decline with energy as a power law with index approximately -0.4, aswas found earlier with the batse data and we also notice evidence of a possiblecutoff or break at higher energies. finally, we performed time-integratedspectral analysis of all 52 bursts and compared their spectral parameters withthose obtained with the larger data sample of the batse data. we find that thetwo parameter data sets are similar and confirm that short grbs are in generalharder than longer ones.

1107.5307	swift j2058.4+0516: discovery of a possible second relativistic tidal  disruption flare?	we report the discovery by the swift hard x-ray monitor of the transientsource swift j2058.4+0516 (sw j2058+05). our multi-wavelength follow-upcampaign uncovered a long-lived (duration &gt;~ months), luminous x-ray (l_x,iso ~3 x 10^47 erg s^-1) and radio (nu l_nu,iso ~ 10^42 erg s^-1) counterpart. theassociated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dustextinction in the host galaxy. based on numerous similarities with the recentlydiscovered grb 110328a / swift j164449.3+573451 (sw j1644+57), we suggest thatsw j2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outburstsresulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. ifso, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate oftidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowlycollimated (theta &lt; 1 degree), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptionsgenerate relativistic ejecta. analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-raybursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the blackhole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component.alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus[agn]), sw j2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in thesesources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with knownclasses of agns capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxies).

1107.6024	constraints on the synchrotron shock model for the fermi gbm gamma-ray  burst 090820a	discerning the radiative dissipation mechanism for prompt emission ingamma-ray bursts (grbs) requires detailed spectroscopic modeling that straddlesthe $\nu f_{\nu}$ peak in the 100 kev - 1 mev range. historically, empiricalfits such as the popular band function have been employed with considerablesuccess in interpreting the observations. while extrapolations of the bandparameters can provide some physical insight into the emission mechanismsresponsible for grbs, these inferences do not provide a unique way ofdiscerning between models. by fitting physical models directly this degeneracycan be broken, eliminating the need for empirical functions; our analysis hereoffers a first step in this direction. one of the oldest, and leading,theoretical ideas for the production of the prompt signal is the synchrotronshock model (ssm). here we explore the applicability of this model to a bright{\it fermi} gbm burst with a simple temporal structure, grb {\it 090820}a. ourinvestigation implements, for the first time, thermal and non-thermalsynchrotron emissivities in the rmfit forward-folding spectral analysissoftware often used in gbm burst studies. we find that these synchrotronemissivities, together with a blackbody shape, provide at least as good a matchwith the data as the band grb spectral fitting function. this success isachieved in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectral fits.

1109.2810	grb 091127: the cooling break race on magnetic fuel	using high-quality, broad-band afterglow data for grb 091127, we investigatethe validity of the synchrotron fireball model for gamma-ray bursts, and inferphysical parameters of the ultra-relativistic outflow. we used multi-wavelengthfollow-up observations obtained with grond and the xrt onboard the swiftsatellite. the resulting afterglow light curve is of excellent accuracy, andthe spectral energy distribution is well-sampled over 5 decades in energy.these data present one of the most comprehensive observing campaigns for asingle grb afterglow and allow us to test several proposed emission models andoutflow characteristics in unprecedented detail. both the multi-color lightcurve and the broad-band sed of the afterglow of grb 091127 show evidence of acooling break moving from high to lower energies. the early light curve is welldescribed by a broken power-law, where the initial decay in the optical/nirwavelength range is considerably flatter than at x-rays. detailed fitting ofthe time-resolved sed shows that the break is very smooth with a sharpnessindex of 2.2 +- 0.2, and evolves towards lower frequencies as a power-law withindex -1.23 +- 0.06. these are the first accurate and contemporaneousmeasurements of both the sharpness of the spectral break and its timeevolution. the measured evolution of the cooling break (nu_c propto t^-1.2) isnot consistent with the predictions of the standard model, wherein nu_c proptot^-0.5 is expected. a possible explanation for the observed behavior is a timedependence of the microphysical parameters, in particular the fraction of thetotal energy in the magnetic field epsilon_b. this conclusion provides furtherevidence that the standard fireball model is too simplistic, and time-dependentmicro-physical parameters may be required to model the growing number ofwell-sampled afterglow light curves.

1109.4064	temporal deconvolution study of long and short gamma-ray burst light  curves	the light curves of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are believed to result frominternal shocks reflecting the activity of the grb central engine. theirtemporal deconvolution can reveal potential differences in the properties ofthe central engines in the two populations of grbs which are believed tooriginate from the deaths of massive stars (long) and from mergers of compactobjects (short). we present here the results of the temporal analysis of 42grbs detected with the gamma-ray burst monitor onboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope. we deconvolved the profiles into pulses, which we fit withlognormal functions. the distributions of the pulse shape parameters andintervals between neighboring pulses are distinct for both burst types and alsofit with lognormal functions. we have studied the evolution of these parametersin different energy bands and found that they differ between long and shortbursts. we discuss the implications of the differences in the temporalproperties of long and short bursts within the framework of the internal shockmodel for grb prompt emission.

1110.4109	the fast evolution of sn 2010bh associated with xrf 100316d	(...) since 1998, only half a dozen spectroscopically confirmed associationshave been discovered and xrf 100316d associated with the type-ic sn 2010bh at z= 0.059 is among the latest. we began observations with grond 12 hours afterthe grb trigger and continued until 80 days after the burst. grond providedexcellent photometric data in six filter bands covering a wavelength range fromapprox. 350 to 1800 nm, significantly expanding the pre-existing data set forthis event. combining grond and swift data, the early broad-band sed ismodelled with a blackbody and afterglow component attenuated by dust and gasabsorption. the best-fit sed models imply moderate reddening along the line ofsight through the host galaxy (a_v = 1.2 \pm 0.1 mag). the temperature andradius evolution of the thermal component are analysed and combined withearlier measurements available from the literature. this reveals a coolingenvelope at an apparent initial radius of 7 \times 10^11 cm, which iscompatible with a dense wind surrounding a wolf-rayet star. multicolourtemplates of sn 1998bw are fitted to the sn to directly compare the light-curveproperties. this shows that sn 2010bh is ~65% as bright as sn 1998bw. reachingmaximum brightness at ~8 days after the burst in the blue bands, sn 2010bhproves to be the most rapidly evolving grb-sne to date. finally, atwo-component parametrised model is fitted to the quasi-bolometric light curve,which delivers physical parameters of the explosion. this yields m_ni = 0.21\pm 0.03 m\bigodot and m_ej = 2.6 \pm 0.2 m\bigodot, typical of values withinthe grb-sn population. the kinetic energy is 2.4 \pm 0.7 \times 10^52 erg,which is making this sn the second most energetic grb-sn after sn 1998bw. thissupernova has one of the earliest peaks ever recorded and thereafter fades morerapidly than other grb-sne, hypernovae, or typical type-ic sne.

1210.1210	on the association of the ultraluminous x-ray sources in the antennae  galaxies with young stellar clusters	the nature of the ultra-luminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in the nearby galaxiesis a matter of debates. one of the popular hypothesis associates them withaccretion at a sub-eddington rate on to intermediate mass black holes. anotherpossibility is a stellar-mass black hole in a high-mass x-ray binary accretingat super-eddington rates. in this paper we find a highly significantassociation between brightest x-ray sources in the antennae galaxies andstellar clusters. on the other hand, we show that most of the x-ray sources arelocated outside of these clusters. we study clusters associated with the ulxsusing the eso very large telescope spectra and the hubble space telescope datatogether with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages tobe below 6 myr. this implies that the ulx progenitor masses certainly exceed 30and for some objects are closer to 100 solar masses. we also estimate the agesof clusters situated close to the less luminous x-ray sources (with luminosityin the range 3x10^38 &lt; l_x &lt; 10^39 erg/s) and find that most of them areyounger than 10 myr, because they are surrounded by strong h$\alpha$ emission.these findings are consistent with the idea that majority of ulxs are massivex-ray binaries that have been ejected in the process of formation of stellarclusters by a few-body encounters and at the same time rules out the proposalthat most of the ulxs are intermediate mass black holes.

1212.4698	bright radio emission from an ultraluminous stellar-mass microquasar in  m31	a subset of ultraluminous x-ray sources (those with luminosities &lt; 10^40erg/s) are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto black holes withmasses of ~5-20 m_solar, probably via an accretion disc. the x-ray and radioemission are coupled in such galactic sources, with the radio emissionoriginating in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermostregions near the black hole, with the most powerful emission occurring when therate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the eddingtonlimit). only four such maximal sources are known in the milky way, and theabsorption of soft x-rays in the interstellar medium precludes determining thecausal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. here we reportradio and x-ray observations of a bright new x-ray source whose peak luminositycan exceed 10^39 erg/s in the nearby galaxy, m31. the radio luminosity isextremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguingthat the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close to theeddington limit onto a stellar mass black hole. continued radio and x-raymonitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between theaccretion flow and the powerful jet emission.

1301.4859	anomalies in low-energy gamma-ray burst spectra with the fermi gamma-ray  burst monitor	a band function has become the standard spectral function used to describethe prompt emission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). however, deviationsfrom this function have previously been observed in grbs detected by batse andin individual grbs from the \textit{fermi} era. we present a systematic andrigorous search for spectral deviations from a band function at low energies ina sample of the first two years of high fluence, long bursts detected by the\textit{fermi} gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm). the sample contains 45 burstswith a fluence greater than 2$\times10^{-5}$ erg / cm$^{2}$ (10 - 1000 kev). anextrapolated fit method is used to search for low-energy spectral anomalies,whereby a band function is fit above a variable low-energy threshold and thenthe best fit function is extrapolated to lower energy data. deviations arequantified by examining residuals derived from the extrapolated function andthe data and their significance is determined via comprehensive simulationswhich account for the instrument response. this method was employed for bothtime-integrated burst spectra and time-resolved bins defined by a signal tonoise ratio of 25 $\sigma$ and 50 $\sigma$. significant deviations are evidentin 3 bursts (grb\,081215a, grb\,090424 and grb\,090902b) in the time-integratedsample ($\sim$ 7%) and 5 bursts (grb\,090323, grb\,090424, grb\,090820,grb\,090902b and grb\,090926a) in the time-resolved sample ($\sim$ 11%).} theadvantage of the systematic, blind search analysis is that it can demonstratethe requirement for an additional spectral component without any priorknowledge of the nature of that extra component. deviations are found in alarge fraction of high fluence grbs; fainter grbs may not have sufficientstatistics for deviations to be found using this method.

1302.6362	clustering of galaxies around grb sight-lines	there is evidence of an overdensity of strong intervening mgii absorptionline systems distributed along the lines of sight towards grb afterglowsrelative to quasar sight-lines. if this excess is real, one should also expectan overdensity of field galaxies around grb sight-lines, as strong mgii tendsto trace these sources. in this work, we test this expectation by calculatingthe two point angular correlation function of galaxies within120$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim470~h_{71}^{-1}~\mathrm{kpc}$ at $\langle z\rangle\sim0.4$) of grb afterglows. we compare the gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector (grond) grb afterglow sample -- one of the largest andmost homogeneous samples of grb fields -- with galaxies and agn found in thecosmos-30 photometric catalog. we find no significant signal of anomalousclustering of galaxies at an estimated median redshift of $z\sim0.3$ around grbsight-lines, down to $k_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;19.3$. this result is contrary to theexpectations from the mgii excess derived from grb afterglow spectroscopy,although many confirmed galaxy counterparts to mgii absorbers may be too faintto detect in our sample -- especially those at $z&gt;1$. we note that the additionof higher sensitivity spitzer irac or hst wfc3 data for even a subset of oursample would increase this survey's depth by several orders of magnitude,simultaneously increasing statistics and enabling the investigation of a muchlarger redshift space.}

1309.4980	kinematics of massive star ejecta in the milky way as traced by 26al	massive stars form in groups and their winds and supernova explosions createsuperbubbles up to kpc in size. their ejecta are important for the dynamics ofthe interstellar medium and chemical evolution models. however, ejectakinematics and the characteristic scales in space and time are ratherunexplored beyond ~10 ka.  through measurement of radioactive 26al with its decay time constant of ~10^6years, we aim to trace the kinematics of massive-star and supernova ejecta overmillion-year time scales. our goal is to identify the mixing time scale and thespatio-kinematics of such ejecta from the pc to kpc scale.  we use the spi spectrometer on integral and its observations along thegalactic ridge to trace the line shape of the 1808.63 kev gamma-ray line from26al decay. we determine line centroids and compare these to doppler shiftexpectations from large-scale systematic rotation around the galaxy's center,as observed in other galactic objects.  we measure the radial velocities of gas traced by 26al, averaged over theline of sight, as a function of galactic longitude. we find substantiallyhigher velocities than expected from galactic rotation, the average bulkvelocity being ~200 km s^-1 larger than the galactic-rotation prediction. theobserved radial velocity spread implies a doppler-broadening of the gamma-rayline that is consistent with our measurements of the overall line width. we canreproduce the observed characteristics with 26al sources located along theinner spiral arms, when we add a global blow-out into the forward directionaway from arms, such as expected from massive stars offset towards thespiral-arm leading edge. the superbubbles-halo connection impliesangular-momentum transfer in the disk-halo system and also radial gas flows.

1407.5569	optical properties of (162173) 1999 ju3: in preparation for the jaxa  hayabusa 2 sample return mission	we investigated the magnitude-phase relation of (162173) 1999 ju3, a targetasteroid for the jaxa hayabusa 2 sample return mission. we initially employedthe international astronomical union's h-g formalism but found that it fitsless well using a single set of parameters. to improve the inadequate fit, weemployed two photometric functions, the shevchenko and hapke functions. withthe shevchenko function, we found that the magnitude-phase relation exhibitslinear behavior in a wide phase angle range (alpha = 5-75 deg) and shows weaknonlinear opposition brightening at alpha&lt; 5 deg, providing a more reliableabsolute magnitude of hv = 19.25 +- 0.03. the phase slope (0.039 +- 0.001mag/deg) and opposition effect amplitude (parameterized by the ratio ofintensity at alpha=0.3 deg to that at alpha=5 deg, i(0.3)/i(5)=1.31+-0.05) areconsistent with those of typical c-type asteroids. we also attempted todetermine the parameters for the hapke model, which are applicable forconstructing the surface reflectance map with the hayabusa 2 onboard cameras.although we could not constrain the full set of hapke parameters, we obtainedpossible values, w=0.041, g=-0.38, b0=1.43, and h=0.050, assuming a surfaceroughness parameter theta=20 deg. by combining our photometric study with athermal model of the asteroid (mueller et al. in preparation), we obtained ageometric albedo of pv = 0.047 +- 0.003, phase integral q = 0.32 +- 0.03, andbond albedo ab = 0.014 +- 0.002, which are commensurate with the values forcommon c-type asteroids.

1409.5477	sn2014j gamma-rays from the 56ni decay chain	the measurement of gamma-ray lines from the decay chain of 56ni providesunique information about the explosion in supernovae. the 56ni freshly-producedin the supernova powers the optical light curve, as it emits gamma-rays uponits radioactive decay to 56co and then 56fe. gamma-ray lines from 56co decayare expected to become directly visible through the overlying white dwarfmaterial several weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate theoverlying material of the supernova envelope, diluted as it expands. the linesare expected to be doppler-shifted or broadened from the kinematics of the 56niejecta. with the spi spectrometer on integral and using an improvedinstrumental background method, we detect the two main lines from 56co decay at847 and 1238 kev from sn2014j at 3.3 mpc, significantly doppler-broadened, andat intensities (3.65+/-1.21) 10^-4 and (2.27+/-0.69) 10^-4 ph cm^-2s^-1,respectively, at brightness maximum. we measure their rise towards a maximumafter about 60-100 days and decline thereafter. the intensity ratio of the twolines is found consistent with expectations from 56co decay (0.62+/-0.28 atbrightness maximum, expected is 0.68). we find that the broad lines seen in thelate, gamma-ray transparent phase are not representative for the earlygamma-ray emission, and rather notice the emission spectrum to be complex andirregular until the supernova is fully transparent to gamma-rays, withprogressive uncovering of the bulk of 56ni. we infer that the explosionmorphology is not spherically symmetric, both in the distribution of 56ni andof the unburnt material which occults the 56co emission. comparing light curvesfrom different plausible models, the resulting 56ni mass is determined as0.49+/-0.09 m_sol.

[...] we link this to the sizedistribution of hi supershells and assess the properties of likely26al-carrying superbubbles. 26al is produced by star clusters of all massesabove about 200 solar masses, roughly equally contributed over a logarithmicstar cluster mass scale, and strongly linked to the injection of feedbackenergy. the observed superbubble size distribution cannot be related to thestar cluster mass function in a straight forward manner. in order to avoid thatthe added volume of all superbubbles exceeds the volume of the milky way,individual superbubbles have to merge frequently. if any two superbubblesmerge, or if 26al is injected off-centre in a bigger hi supershell we expectthe hot 26al-carrying gas to obtain velocities of the order of the typicalsound speed in superbubbles, about 300 km/s before decay.

1512.00325	gamma-ray spectroscopy of positron annihilation in the milky way	the annihilation of positrons in the galaxy's interstellar medium producescharacteristic gamma-rays with a line at 511 kev. this emission has beenobserved with the spectrometer spi on integral, confirming a puzzlingmorphology with bright emission from an extended bulge-like region, and faintdisk emission. most plausible sources of positrons are believed to bedistributed throughout the disk of the galaxy. we aim to constraincharacteristic spectral shapes for different spatial components in the disk andbulge with the high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer spi, based on a newinstrumental background method and detailed multi-component sky model fitting.we confirm the detection of the main extended components of characteristicannihilation gamma-ray signatures at 58$\sigma$ significance in the line. thetotal galactic line intensity amounts to$(2.7\pm0.3)\times10^{-3}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ for our assumed spatialmodel. we derive spectra for the bulge and disk, and a central point-like andat the position of sgr a*, and discuss spectral differences. the bulge shows a511 kev line intensity of$(0.96\pm0.07)\times10^{-3}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and anortho-positronium continuum equivalent to a positronium fraction of($1.08\pm0.03$). the 2d-gaussian representing the disk has an extent of$60^{+10}_{-5}$ deg in longitude and a latitudinal extent of$10.5^{+2.5}_{-1.5}$ deg; the line intensity is$(1.7\pm0.4)\times10^{-3}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ with a marginal detectionof ortho-positronium and an overall diffuse galactic continuum of$(5.85\pm1.05)\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~kev^{-1}}$ at 511 kev.the disk shows no flux asymmetry between positive and negative longitudes,although spectral details differ. the flux ratio between bulge and disk is($0.6\pm0.1$). the central source has an intensity of$(0.8\pm0.2)\times10^{-4}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.

astro-ph;0305307	a xmm-newton observation of nova lmc 1995, a bright supersoft x-ray  source	nova lmc 1995, previously detected during 1995-1998 with rosat, was observedagain as a luminous supersoft x-ray source with xmm-newton in december of 2000.this nova offers the possibility to observe the spectrum of a hot white dwarf,burning hydrogen in a shell and not obscured by a wind or by nebular emissionlike in other supersoft x-ray sources. notwithstanding uncertainties in thecalibration of the epic instruments at e&lt;0.5 kev, using atmospheric models inlocal thermonuclear equilibrium we derived t(eff)=400,000-450,000 k, l(bol)=2.3x 110(-14) 0(37) erg cm(-2) s(-1) and we verified that the c abundance is notsignificantly enhanced. the rgs spectra do not show emission lines of a wind ornebula, but the white dwarf absorption lines cannot be resolved. the upperlimit to the flux in the 0.6-10 kev range is 10(-14) erg cm(-2) s(-1). there isno rapid or large variability in the light curve, but we find a peak at 5.25hours in the power spectrum.

astro-ph;0306347	a very energetic supernova associated with the gamma-ray burst of 29  march 2003	over the past five years evidence has mounted that long-duration (&gt; 2 s)gamma-ray bursts (grbs)--the most brilliant of all astronomicalexplosions--signal the collapse of massive stars in our universe. this evidencewas originally based on the probable association of one unusual grb with asupernova, but now includes the association of grbs with regions of massivestar formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' inthe optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshlysynthesized elements in the spectra of a few x-ray afterglows. theseobservations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea thatlong-duration grbs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumablyarising from core collapse. here we report evidence that a very energeticsupernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a grb atredshift z = 0.1685. the timing of the supernova indicates that it explodedwithin a few days of the grb, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events cangive rise to grbs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model.

astro-ph;0407144	the glast burst monitor	the next large nasa mission in the field of gamma-ray astronomy, glast, isscheduled for launch in 2007. aside from the main instrument lat (large-areatelescope), a gamma-ray telescope for the energy range between 20 mev and &gt; 100gev, a secondary instrument, the glast burst monitor (gbm), is foreseen. withthis monitor one of the key scientific objectives of the mission, thedetermination of the high-energy behaviour of gamma-ray bursts and transientscan be ensured. its task is to increase the detection rate of gamma-ray burstsfor the lat and to extend the energy range to lower energies (from ~10 kev to\~30 mev). it will provide real-time burst locations over a wide fov withsufficient accuracy to allow repointing the glast spacecraft. time-resolvedspectra of many bursts recorded with lat and the burst monitor will allow theinvestigation of the relation between the kev and the mev-gev emission fromgrbs over unprecedented seven decades of energy. this will help to advance ourunderstanding of the mechanisms by which gamma-rays are generated in gamma-raybursts.

astro-ph;0603284	constraining the grb collimation with a survey for orphan afterglows	gamma-ray bursts are believed to be produced in highly-relativisticcollimated outflows. support for this comes among others from the associationof the times of detected breaks in the decay of afterglow light curves with thecollimation angle of the jets. an alternative approach to estimate a limit onthe collimation angle uses grb afterglows without detected prompt-emissioncounterparts. here we report on the analysis of a dedicated survey for thesearch of these orphan afterglows using the wide field imager at the 2.2mmpi/eso telescope at la silla, chile. we monitored ~12 square degrees. in up to25 nights typically spaced by one to two nights with a limiting magnitude ofr=23. four previously unknown optical transients were discovered and three ofthese associated with a flare star, a cataclysmic variable and a dwarf nova.the fourth source shows indications for an extragalactic origin but the sparsesampling of the light curve prevents a reliable classification. we discuss theresults in the context of the collimation of grbs.

astro-ph;0607195	constraining the environment of grb 990712 through emission line fluxes	the energy output in the gamma-ray burst (grb) prompt emission and afterglowphase is expected to photoionize the surrounding medium out to large radii.cooling of this gas produces line emission, particularly strong in the optical,whose variability is a strong diagnostics of the gas density and geometry inthe close environment of the burst. we present the results of a spectral timeseries analysis of the host galaxy of grb 990712 observed up to ~6 years afterthe burst. we analyze the emission line fluxes together with those of theprevious observations of the same grb, in search for photoionizationsignatures. we find that the emission line fluxes show no variation within theuncertainities up to 6 years after the burst, and we use the measured lineintensities to set a limit on the density of the gas within a few parsecs ofthe burst location. this is the first time that emission from cooling grbremnants is probed on years time scales.

astro-ph;0611555	the host galaxy of grb 011121: morphology and spectral energy  distribution	(abridged) we present a detailed study of the host galaxy of grb 011121 (at z= 0.36) based on high-resolution imaging in 5 broad-band, optical andnear-infrared filters with hst and vlt/isaac. the surface brightness profile ofthis galaxy is best fitted by a sersic law with index ~ 2 - 2.5 and a ratherlarge effective radius (~ 7.5 kpc). both the morphological analysis and thef450w - f702w colour image suggest that the host galaxy of grb 011121 is eithera disk-system with a rather small bulge, or one hosting a central,dust-enshrouded starburst. hence, we modeled the integrated spectral energydistribution of this galaxy by combining stellar population and radiativetransfer models, assuming properties representative of nearby starburst ornormal star-forming, sbc-like galaxies. a range of plausible fitting solutionsindicates that the host galaxy of grb 011121 has a stellar mass of 3.1 - 6.9x10^9 msun, stellar populations with a maximum age ranging from 0.4 to 2 gyr,and a metallicity ranging from 1 to 29 per cent of the solar value. starburstmodels suggest this galaxy to be nearly as opaque as local starbursts (with ana_v = 0.27 - 0.76 mag). alternatively, normal star-forming sbc-like modelssuggest a high central opacity whereas a_v = 0.12$ -- 0.57 mag along the lineof sight. for this subluminous galaxy (with l_b/lstar_b = 0.26), we determine amodel-dependent sfr of 2.4 - 9.4 msun/yr. the sfr per unit luminosity (9.2 -36.1 msun/yr/(l_b/lstar_b)) is high compared to those of most grb hostgalaxies, but consistent with those of most of the hosts at similar lowredshift. our results suggest that the host galaxy of grb 011121 is a ratherlarge disk-system in a relatively early phase of its star formation history.

astro-ph;0611772	ism studies of grb 030329 with high resolution spectroscopy	we present a series of early uves/vlt high resolution spectra of theafterglow of grb 030329 at redshift z=0.16867+-0.00001. in contrast to otherspectra from this burst, both emission and absorption lines were detected. noneof them showed any temporal evolution. from the emission lines, we determinethe properties of the host galaxy which has a star formation rate (sfr) of0.198 m_solar yr^-1 and a low metallicity of 1/7 z_solar. given the low totalstellar host mass m_star=10^7.75+-0.15 m_solar and an absolute luminositym_v=-16.37, we derive specific sfrs (ssfr) of log sfr/m = -8.5 yr^-1 and sfr/l= 14.1 m_solar yr^-1 l_*^-1. this fits well into the picture of grb hosts asbeing low mass, low metallicity, actively star forming galaxies. the mgii andmgi absorption lines from the host show multiple narrow (doppler width b=5-10km/s) components spanning a range of v about 260 km/s, mainly blueshiftedcompared to the redshift from the emission lines. these components are likelyprobing outflowing material of the host galaxy, which could arise from formergalactic superwinds, driven by supernovae from star forming regions. similarfeatures have been observed in qso spectra. the outflowing material is mainlyneutral with high column densities of log n(mgii)=14.0+-0.1 cm^-2 and logn(mgi)=12.3+-0.1 cm^-2.

astro-ph;9705064	multifrequency observations of the galactic microquasars grs1915+105 and  groj1655-40	the two galactic `microquasars' with superluminal radio jets have been quiteactive during 1996, generatinga variety of studies involving both nasa andground-based observatories. grs~1915+105 has displayed dramatic accretioninstability in observations with rxte, revealing x-ray light curves andemission states unlike anything previously seen. variable qpos in the range of0.07--10 hz have been monitored with the capability to track the individualoscillations. the qpo amplitude is as high as 40% of the mean flux, while bothamplitude and phase lag increase with photon energy. the results imply a directlink between the qpo mechanism and the origin of the energetic electronsbelieved to radiate the x-ray power-law component. grs1915+105 also displays atransient yet stationary qpo at 67 hz. the other source, gro j1655-40, is anoptically established black hole binary. recent optical reports include anexcellent model for the binary inclination and masses, while an opticalprecursor to the april 1996 x-ray outburst has been measured. we report newresults from recent rxte observations. groj1655-40 has displayed both thecanonical ``soft/high'' and ``very high'' x-ray states, with qpos at 8--22 hzduring the latter state. in addition, there is a high-frequency qpo at 300 hz.the rapid oscillations in these sources are suspected of providing a measure ofthe mass and rotation of the accreting black holes, although several competingmodels may be applied when evaluating the results.

astro-ph;9803190	rosat hri discovery of luminous extended x-ray emission in ngc 6240	we report the detection of luminous extended x-ray emission in ngc 6240 onthe basis of rosat hri observations of this ultraluminous ir galaxy. thespatial structure and temporal behavior of the x-ray source were analyzed. wefind that &gt;= 70% of the soft x-ray emission is extended beyond a radius of 5arcsec. strong emission can be traced out to a radius of 20 arcsec and weakeremission extends out to 50 arcsec. with a luminosity of at least 10^{42} erg/sthis makes ngc 6240 one of the most luminous x-ray emitters in extendedemission known. evidence for a nuclear compact variable component is indicatedby a drop of 32% in the hri count rate as compared to the pspc data taken oneyear earlier. no short-timescale variability is detected. the hri data, whichrepresent the first high-resolution study of the x-ray emission from ngc 6240,complement previous spectral fits to rosat pspc data (astro-ph/9710098; a&amp;a330, 823) that suggested a two-component model consisting of thermal emissionfrom shocked gas immersed in a starburst wind plus a powerlaw source attributedto scattered light from an obscured agn. we discuss several models to accountfor the extended and compact emission. although pushed to its limits thestarburst outflow model is tenable for the essential part of the extendedemission. for the agn-type component we propose a model consisting of anear-nuclear `warm scatterer' that explains the apparent fading of the x-rayflux within a year as well as the strong fekalpha complex seen in an ascaspectrum.

astro-ph;9809088	the ulirg ngc 6240: luminous extended x-ray emission and evidence for an  agn	we briefly review and extend our discussion of the rosat detection of theextraordinarily luminous (&gt;10^{42} erg/s) partly extended (&gt; 30 kpc diameter)x-ray emission from the double-nucleus ultraluminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240.the rosat spectrum can be well fit by emission from two components in roughlyequal proportions: a thermal optically thin plasma with kt \sim 0.6 kev and ahard component that can be represented by a canonical agn powerlaw. sourcecounts appear to have dropped by 30% within a year. altogether, these findingscan be well explained by a contribution of radiation from an agn essentiallyhidden at other wavelengths. fits of asca spectra, conducted by various groups,corroborate this result, revealing a high-equivalent width fek blend whichagain is straightforwardly interpreted by scattered agn light.  if radiating at the eddington limit, the central black hole mass does notexceed 10^7 m_sun. we discuss implications for the formation of this agn.however, the luminosity in the remaining extended thermal component is still atthe limits of a pure starburst-wind-induced source. we suggest that the deeplyburied starburst has switched to a partially dormant phase so that heating ofthe outflow is diminished and a cooling flow could have been established. thisflow may account for the extended shock heating traced by liner-like emissionline ratios and the extremely luminous h_2 emission from the central region ofthis galaxy. next-generation x-ray telescopes will be able to test thisproposal.

(b) the possibility of adusty warm absorber in iras 13349+2438 is explored on the basis ofphotoionization models for dusty warm gas and explicit rosat spectral fits.

(d) the strong spectralvariability of rx j0134.3-4258 (from g_x = -4.4 in the rosat surveyobservation, to ~ -2.2$ in our subsequent pointing) is examined in terms ofwarm absorption.
