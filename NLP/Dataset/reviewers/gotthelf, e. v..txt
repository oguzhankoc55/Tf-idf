0902.3007	discovery of a 112 ms x-ray pulsar in puppis a: further evidence of  neutron stars weakly magnetized at birth	we report the discovery of 112-ms x-ray pulsations from rx j0822-4300, thecompact central object (cco) in the supernova remnant puppis a, in two archivalnewton x-ray multi-mirror mission observations taken in 2001. the sinusoidallight curve has a pulsed fraction of 11% with an abrupt 180 deg. change inphase at 1.2 kev. the observed phase shift and modulation are likely the resultof emission from opposing thermal hot spots of distinct temperatures.phase-resolved spectra reveal an emission feature at e(line) = 0.8 kevassociated with the cooler region, possibly due to an electron cyclotronresonance effect similar to that seen in the spectrum of the cco pulsar 1e1207.4-5209. no change in the spin period of psr j0821-4300 is detected in 7months, with a 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative less than 8.3e-15.this implies limits on the spin-down energy loss rate of less than 2.3e35erg/s, the surface magnetic dipole field strength b_s &lt; 9.8e11 g, and thespin-down age tau &gt; 220 kyr. the latter is much longer than the snr age,indicating that psr j0821-4300 was born spinning near its present period. itsproperties are remarkably similar to those of the two other known cco pulsars,demonstrating the existence of a class of neutron stars born with weak magneticfields related to a slow original spin. these results are also of importance inunderstanding the extreme transverse velocity of psr j0821-4300, favoring thehydrodynamic instability mechanism in the supernova explosion.

0907.0137	discovery of a highly energetic x-ray pulsar powering hess j1813-178 in  the young supernova remnant g12.82-0.02	we report the discovery of 44.7 ms pulsations from the x-ray source cxouj181335.1-174957 using data obtained with the xmm-newton observatory. psrj1813-1749 lies near the center of the young radio supernova remnantg12.82-0.02, which overlaps the compact tev source hess j1813-178. thisrotation-powered pulsar is the second most energetic in the galaxy, with aspin-down luminosity of edot = (6.8 +/- 2.7)e37 erg/s. in the rotating dipolemodel, the surface dipole magnetic field strength is b_s = (2.7 +/- 0.6)e12 gand the spin-down age of 3.3-7.5 kyr, consistent with the location in thesmall, shell-type radio remnant. at an assumed distance of 4.7 kpc byassociation with an adjacent young stellar cluster, the efficiency of psrj1813-1749 in converting spin-down luminosity to radiation is approx. 0.03% forits 2-10 kev flux, approx. 0.1% for its 20-100 kev integral flux, and approx.0.07% for the &gt;200 gev emission of hess j1813-178, making it a likely powersource for the latter. the nearby young stellar cluster is possibly thebirthplace of the pulsar progenitor, as well as an additional source of seedphotons for inverse compton scattering to tev energies.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0910.3074	discovery of a highly energetic pulsar associated with igr j14003-6326  in a young uncataloged galactic supernova remnant g310.6-1.6	we report the discovery of 31.18 ms pulsations from the integral source igrj14003-6326 using the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). this pulsar is mostlikely associated with the bright chandra x-ray point source lying at thecenter of g310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised galactic composite supernovaremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and x-ray nebula, taken to bethe pulsar wind nebula (pwn). psr j1400-6325 is amongst the most energeticrotation-powered pulsars in the galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of edot =5.1e+37 erg.s-1. in the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magneticfield strength is b_s = 1.1e+12 g and the characteristic age tau_c = p/2pdot =12.7 kyr. the high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indicesof the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,and a 2-10 kev flux ratio f_pwn/f_psr ~ 8. follow-up parkes observationsresulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from psr j1400-6325at a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively largedistance of 10 +/- 3 kpc. however, the resulting location off the galacticplane of ~ 280 pc would be much larger than the typical thickness of themolecular disk, and we argue that g310.6-1.6 lies at a distance of ~ 7 kpc.there is no gamma-ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the fermi datapublished so far. a multi-wavelength study of this new composite supernovaremnant, from radio to very-high energy gamma-rays, suggests a young (&lt; 1000yr) system, formed by a sub-energetic (~ 1e+50 ergs), low ejecta mass (m_ej ~ 3msun) sn explosion that occurred in a low-density environment (n_0 ~ 0.01cm-3).

0911.0093	spin-down measurement of psr j1852+0040 in kesteven 79: central compact  objects as anti-magnetars	using xmm-newton and chandra, we achieved phase-connected timing of the 105ms x-ray pulsar psr j1852+0040 that provides the first measurement of thespin-down rate of a member of the class of central compact objects (ccos) insupernova remnants. we measure p-dot = 8.68(9)e-18, and find no evidence fortiming noise or variations in x-ray flux over 4.8 yr. in the dipole spin-downformalism, this implies a surface magnetic field strength b_s = 3.1e10 g, thesmallest ever measured for a young neutron star, and consistent with being afossil field. in combination with upper limits on b_s from other cco pulsars,this is strong evidence in favor of the "anti-magnetar" explanation for theirlow luminosity and lack of magnetospheric activity or synchrotron nebulae.while this dipole field is small, it can prevent accretion of sufficientfall-back material so that the observed x-ray luminosity of l_x = 5.3e33(d/7.1kpc)^2 erg/s must instead be residual cooling. the spin-down luminosity of psrj1852+0040, e-dot = 3.0e32 erg/s, is an order-of-magnitude smaller than l_x.fitting of the x-ray spectrum to two blackbodies finds small emitting radii,r_1 = 1.9 km and r_2 = 0.45 km, for components of kt_1 = 0.30 kev and kt_2 =0.52 kev, respectively. such small, hot regions are ubiquitous among ccos, andare not yet understood in the context of the anti-magnetar picture becauseanisotropic surface temperature is usually attributed to the effects of strongmagnetic fields.

0707.2935	x-ray observations and infrared identification of the transient 7.8 s  x-ray binary pulsar xte j1829-098	xmm-newton and chandra observations of the transient 7.8 s pulsar xtej1829-098 are used to characterize its pulse shape and spectrum, and tofacilitate a search for an optical or infrared counterpart. in outburst, theabsorbed, hard x-ray spectrum with gamma = 0.76+/-0.13 and n_h = (6.0+/-0.6) x10^{22} cm^{-2} is typical of x-ray binary pulsars. the precise chandralocalization in a faint state leads to the identification of a probableinfrared counterpart at r.a. = 18h29m43.98s, decl. = -09o51'23.0" (j2000.0)with magnitudes k=12.7, h=13.9, i&gt;21.9, and r&gt;23.2. if this is a highlyreddened o or b star, we estimate a distance of 10 kpc, at which the maximumobserved x-ray luminosity is 2x10^{36} ergs s^{-1}, typical of be x-raytransients or wind-fed systems. the minimum observed luminosity is3x10^{32}(d/10 kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}. we cannot rule out the possibility that thecompanion is a red giant. the two known x-ray outbursts of xte j1829-098 areseparated by ~1.3 yr, which may be the orbital period or a multiple of it, withthe neutron star in an eccentric orbit. we also studied a late m-giantlong-period variable that we found only 9" from the x-ray position. it has apulsation period of ~1.5 yr, but is not the companion of the x-ray source.

0912.4985	two magnetar candidates in hess supernova remnants	we identify two candidate magnetars in archival x-ray observations of hessdetected shell-type snrs. x-ray point sources in ctb 37b coincident with hessj1713-381 and in g353.6-0.7 coincident with hess j1731-347 both have axp-likespectra, much softer than those of ordinary, rotation powered pulsars, and nooptical/ir counterparts. the spectrum of cxou j171405.7-381031 in ctb 37b has ahard excess above 6 kev, which may be similar to such components seen in someaxps. a new chandra observation of this object reveals a highly significantpulsed signal at p = 3.82 s with pulsed fraction f_p = 0.31. analysis of anxmm-newton observation of the second candidate, xmmu j173203.3-344518 ing353.6-0.7, yields only marginal evidence for a 1 s period. if it is not amagnetar, then it could be a weakly magnetized central compact object (cco).considering that these hess sources previously attributed to the snr shells arepossibly centrally peaked, we hypothesize that their pulsars may contribute todiffuse tev emission. these identifications potentially double the number ofmagnetar/snr associations in the galaxy, and can be used to investigate theenergetics and asymmetries of the supernovae that give rise to magnetars.

1008.2558	an energetic magnetar in hess j1713-381/ctb 37b	we obtained a second chandra timing measurement of the 3.82 s pulsar cxouj171405.7-381031 in the supernova remnant (snr) ctb 37b, which shows that it isspinning down rapidly. the average period derivative of (5.88+/-0.08)e-11 overthe 1 year time span corresponds to a dipole magnetic field strength b = 4.8e14g, well into the magnetar range. the spin-down power e-dot = 4.2e34 erg/s isamong the largest for magnetars, and the corresponding characteristic age tau =p/2p-dot = 1030 years is comparable to estimates of the age of the snr. theperiod derivative enables us to recover probable pulsations in an ascaobservation taken in 1996, which yields a mean characteristic age of 860 yearsover the longer 13 year time span. the source is well detected up to 10 kev,and its composite spectrum is typical of a magnetar. ctb 37b hosts hessj1713-381, the first tev source that is coincident with a magnetar. while thetev emission has been attributed to the snr shell, it is possibly centrallypeaked, and we hypothesize that this particularly young, energetic magnetar maycontribute to the hess source. we also searched for pulsations from anothersource in a hess snr, xmmu j173203.3-344518 in hess j1731-347/g353.6-0.7 butcould not confirm pulsations or long-term flux variability, making it morelikely that this source is a weakly magnetized central compact object.

1009.4473	modeling the surface x-ray emission and viewing geometry of psr  j0821-4300 in puppis a	we show that a pair of thermal, antipodal hot-spots on the neutron starsurface is able to fully account for the pulsar's double blackbody spectrum andenergy-dependent pulse profile, including the observed 180 degree phasereversal at approximately 1.2 kev. by comparing the observed pulse modulationand phase to the model predictions, we strongly constrain the hot-spot pole(xi) and the line-of-sight (psi) angles with respect to the spin axis. for anominal radius of r = 12 km and distance d = 2.2 kpc, we find (xi,psi) =(86d,6d), with 1-sigma error ellipse of (2d,1d); this solution is degenerate inthe two angles. the best-fit spectral model for this geometry requires that thetemperatures of the two emission spots differ by a factor of 2 and their areasby a factor of ~ 20. including a cosine-beamed pattern for the emittedintensity modifies the result, decreasing the angles to (84d,3d); however thismodel is not statistically distinguishable from the isotropic emission case. wealso present a new upper limit on the period derivative of pdot &lt; 3.5e-16(2-sigma), which limits the global dipole magnetic field to b_s &lt; 2.0e11 g,confirming psr j0821-4300 as an "anti-magnetar." we discuss the results in thecontext of observations and theories of nonuniform surface temperature onisolated nss of both weak and strong magnetic field. to explain the nonuniformtemperature of psr j0821-4300 may require a crustal field that is much strongerthan the external, global dipole field.

0704.2255	precise timing of the x-ray pulsar 1e 1207.4-5209: a steady neutron star  weakly magnetized at birth	we analyze all x-ray timing data on 1e 1207.4-5209 in supernova remnant pks1209-51/52 gathered in 2000-2005, and find a highly stable rotation withp=424.130451(4) ms and period derivative of (9.6 +/- 9.4)e-17 s/s. this refutesprevious claims of large timing irregularities in these data. in the dipolespin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies anenergy loss rate &lt; 1.5e32 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength b_p &lt; 3.5e11g, and characteristic age tau &gt; 24 myr. this tau exceeds the remnant age by 3orders of magnitude, requiring that the pulsar was born spinning at its presentperiod. the x-ray luminosity of 1e 1207.4-5209, l(bol) ~= 2e33 ergs/s at 2 kpc,exceeds its spin-down energy loss, implying that l(bol) derives from residualcooling, and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. the upper limiton b_p is small enough to favor the electron cyclotron model for at least oneof the prominent absorption lines in its soft x-ray spectrum. this is thesecond demonstrable case of a pulsar born spinning slowly and with a weakb-field, after psr j1852+0040 in kesteven 79.

0711.1554	cco pulsars as anti-magnetars: evidence of neutron stars weakly  magnetized at birth	our new study of the two central compact object pulsars, psr j1210-5226 (p =424 ms) and psr j1852+0040 (p = 105 ms), leads us to conclude that a weak natalmagnetic field shaped their unique observational properties. in the dipolespin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limits on their period derivatives, &lt;2e-16 for both pulsars, implies surface magnetic field strengths of b_s &lt; 3e11g and spin periods at birth equal to their present periods to three significantdigits. their x-ray luminosities exceed their respective spin-downluminosities, implying that their thermal spectra are derived from residualcooling and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. for sufficientlyweak magnetic fields an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder andinteract with the magnetosphere while resulting torques on the neutron starremain within the observed limits. we propose the following as the origin ofradio-quiet ccos: the magnetic field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, isweaker if the ns is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete sndebris. accretion excludes neutron stars born with both b_s &lt; 1e11 g and p &gt;0.1 s from radio pulsar surveys, where such weak fields are not encounteredexcept among very old (&gt; 40 myr) or recycled pulsars. we predict that thesebirth properties are common, and may be attributes of the youngest detectedneutron star, the cco in cassiopeia a, as well as an undetected infant neutronstar in the sn 1987a remnant. in view of the far-infrared light echo discoveredaround cas a and attributed to an sgr-like outburst, it is especially importantto determine via timing whether cas a hosts a magnetar or not. if not amagnetar, the cas a ns may instead have undergone a one-time phase transition(corequake) that powered the light echo.

1301.2717	the spin-down of psr j0821-4300 and psr j1210-5226: confirmation of  central compact objects as anti-magnetars	using xmm-newton and chandra, we measure period derivatives for the secondand third known pulsars in the class of central compact objects (ccos) insupernova remnants, proving that these young neutron stars have exceptionallyweak dipole magnetic field components. for the 112 ms psr j0821-4300 in puppisa, pdot = (9.28 +/- 0.36)e-18. its proper motion, mu = 61 +/- 9 mas/yr, wasalso measured using chandra. this contributes a kinematic term to the periodderivative via the shklovskii effect, which is subtracted from pdot to derivedipole bs = 2.9e10 g, a value similar to that of first measured cco psrj1852+0040 in kes 79, which has bs = 3.1e10 g. antipodal surface hot spots withdifferent temperatures and areas are deduced from the x-ray spectrum and pulseprofiles. paradoxically, such nonuniform surface temperature appears to requirestrong crustal magnetic fields, probably toroidal or quadrupolar componentsmuch stronger than the external dipole. a spectral feature, consisting ofeither an emission line at approximately 0.75 kev or absorption atapproximately 0.46 kev, is modulated in strength with the rotation. it may bedue to a cyclotron process in a magnetic field on the surface that is slightlystronger than the dipole deduced from the spin-down. we also timed anew the 424ms psr j12010-5226, resolving previous ambiguities about its spin-down rate.its pdot = (2.22 +/- 0.02)e-17, corresponding to bs = 9.8e10 g. this iscompatible with a cyclotron resonance interpretation of its prominentabsorption line at 0.7 kev and harmonics. these results deepen the mystery ofthe origin and evolution of ccos: why are their numerous descendants notevident?

1307.2146	x-ray observations of disrupted recycled pulsars: no refuge for orphaned  central compact objects	we present a chandra x-ray survey of the disrupted recycled pulsars (drps),isolated radio pulsars with p &gt; 20 ms and b_s &lt; 3e10 g. these observations weremotivated as a search for the immediate descendants of the approx. 10 centralcompact objects (ccos) in supernova remnants, three of which have similartiming and magnetic properties as the drps, but are bright, thermal x-raysources consistent with minimal neutron star cooling curves. since none of thedprs were detected, there is no evidence that they are "orphaned" ccos, neutronstars whose supernova remnants has dissipated. upper limits on their thermalx-ray luminosities are in the range log lx[erg/s] = 31.8-32.8, which impliescooling ages &gt; 1e4 - 1e5 yr, roughly 10 times the ages of the approximately 10known ccos in a similar volume of the galaxy. the order of a hundred ccodescendants that could be detected by this method are thus either intrinsicallyradio quiet, or occupy a different region of (p,b_s) parameter space from thedrps. this motivates a new x-ray search for orphaned ccos among radio pulsarswith larger b-fields, which could verify the theory that their fields areburied by fall-back of supernova ejecta, but quickly regrow to join the normalpulsar population.

1510.00683	proper motion and timing of two unusual pulsars: calvera and 1e  1207.4-5209	using pairs of images from the chandra high-resolution camera we examine theproper motion of the central compact object (cco) 1e 1207.4-5209 in thesupernova remnant (snr) pks 1209-51/52, and the unusual pulsar calvera that ispossibly a cco descendant. for 1e 1207.4-5209, an insignificant proper motionof 15+/-7 mas/yr is measured, corresponding to a corrected tangential velocityof &lt;180 km/s at the distance of 2 kpc. this proves that the previously notedlarge offset of the pulsar from the apparent geometric center of the snr is notdue to high proper motion; evidently the symmetry of the remnant does notindicate its center of expansion. calvera has a marginally significant propermotion of 69+/-26 mas/yr, corresponding to 86+/-33 km/s for a hypotheticaldistance of 0.3 kpc. notably, its vector is away from the galactic plane,although its high galactic latitude of b = +37 deg may be more a consequence ofits proximity than its velocity. we also provide updated timing solutions foreach pulsar. spanning 14.5 yr, the ephemeris of 1e 1207.4-5209 has a small andsteady frequency derivative that, because of the negligible proper motion,requires no kinematic correction. the derived surface dipole magnetic fieldstrength of 1e 1207.4-5209 thus remains b_s = 9.8e10 g. calvera has b_s =4.4e11 g, intermediate between those of ordinary young pulsars and ccos,suggesting that it may be on a trajectory of field growth that could accountfor the absence of descendants in the neighborhood of ccos in the p-pdotdiagram.

astro-ph;0007076	a possible x-ray and radio counterpart of the high-energy gamma-ray  source 3eg j2227+6122	the identity of the persistent egret sources in the galactic plane is largelya mystery. for one of these, 3eg j2227+6122, our complete census of x-ray andradio sources in its error circle reveals a remarkable superposition of anincomplete radio shell with a flat radio spectrum, and a compact, power-lawx-ray source with photon index gamma = 1.5 and with no obvious opticalcounterpart. the radio shell is polarized at a level of 25%. the anomalousproperties of the radio source prevent us from deriving a completelysatisfactory theory as to its nature. nevertheless, using data from rosat,asca, the vla, and optical imaging and spectroscopy, we argue that the x-raysource may be a young pulsar with an associated wind-blown bubble or bow shocknebula, and an example of the class of radio-quiet pulsars which arehypothesized to comprise the majority of egret sources in the galaxy. thedistance to this source can be estimated from its x-ray absorption as 3 kpc. atthis distance, the x-ray and gamma-ray luminosities would be 1.7x10^{33} and3.7x10^{35} erg s^{-1}, respectively, which would require an energetic pulsarto power them.  if, on the contrary, this x-ray source is not the counterpart of 3egj2227+6122, then by process of elimination the x-ray luminosity of the lattermust be less than 10^{-4} of its gamma-ray luminosity, a condition notsatisfied by any established class of gamma-ray source counterpart. this wouldrequire the existence of at least a quantitatively new type of egret source, ashas been suggested in studies of other egret fields.

astro-ph;0104228	anomalous x-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters in supernova  remnants	important constraints on the properties of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps)and soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) can be provided by their associations withsupernova remnants (snrs). we have made a radio search for snrs towards theaxps rx j170849-400910 and 4u 0142+61 - we find that the former lies near apossible new snr with which it is unlikely to be physically associated, but seeno snr in the vicinity of the latter. we review all claimed pairings betweenaxps and snrs; the three convincing associations imply that axps are young (&lt;10 000 yr) neutron stars with low projected space velocities (&lt; 500 km/s).contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence that the density of theambient medium around axps is higher than that in the vicinity of radiopulsars. furthermore, the non-detection of radio emission from axps does notimply that these sources are radio-silent. we also review claimed associationsbetween sgrs and snrs. we find none of these associations to be convincing,consistent with a scenario in which sgrs and axps are both populations ofhigh-field neutron stars ("magnetars") but in which the sgrs are an older orlonger-lived group of objects than are the axps. if the sgr/snr associationsare shown to be valid, then sgrs must be high-velocity objects and most likelyrepresent a different class of source to the axps.

astro-ph;0105341	detection of an x-ray pulsar wind nebula and tail in snr n157b	we report chandra x-ray observations of the supernova remnant n157b in thelarge magellanic cloud, which are presented together with an archival hstoptical image and a radio continuum map for comparison. this remnant containsthe recently discovered 16 ms x-ray pulsar psr j0537-6910, the most rapidlyrotating young pulsar known.  using phase-resolved chandra imaging, we pinpoint the location of the pulsarto within an uncertainty of less than 1 arcsec. psr j0537-6910 is not detectedin any other wavelength band. the x-ray observations resolve three distinctfeatures: the pulsar itself, a surrounding compact wind nebula which isstrongly elongated and a feature of large-scale diffuse emission trailing fromthe pulsar. this latter comet tail-shaped feature coexists with enhanced radioemission and is oriented nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the pulsarwind nebula. we propose the following scenario to explain these features. thebright, compact nebula is likely powered by a toroidal pulsar wind ofrelativistic particles which is partially confined by the ram-pressure from thesupersonic motion of the pulsar. the particles, after being forced out from thecompact nebula (the head of the ``comet''), are eventually dumped into a bubble(the tail), which is primarily responsible for the extended diffuse x-ray andradio emission. the ram-pressure confinement also allows a natural explanationfor the observed x-ray luminosity of the compact nebula and for the unusuallysmall x-ray to spin-down luminosity ratio, compared to similarly energeticpulsars. we estimate the pulsar wind lorentz factor of n157b as about 4 times10^6 (with an uncertainty of a factor about 2, consistent with that inferredfrom the modeling of the crab nebula.

astro-ph;0107292	chandra observations of g11.2-0.3: implications for pulsar ages	we present chandra x-ray observatory imaging observations of the younggalactic supernova remnant g11.2-0.3. the image shows that the previously knownyoung 65-ms x-ray pulsar is at position (j2000) ra 18h 11m 29.22s, dec -19o 25'27.''6, with 1 sigma error radius 0.''6. this is within 8'' of the geometriccenter of the shell. this provides strong confirming evidence that the systemis younger, by a factor of ~12, than the characteristic age of the pulsar. theage discrepancy suggests that pulsar characteristic ages can be poor ageestimators for young pulsars. assuming conventional spin down with constantmagnetic field and braking index, the most likely explanation for the agediscrepancy in g11.2-0.3 is that the pulsar was born with a spin period of ~62ms. the chandra image also reveals, for the first time, the morphology of thepulsar wind nebula. the elongated hard-x-ray structure can be interpreted aseither a jet or a crab-like torus seen edge on. this adds to the growing listof highly aspherical pulsar wind nebulae and argues that such structures arecommon around young pulsars.

astro-ph;0110188	x-ray detection of pulsar psr b1757-24 and its nebular tail	we report the first x-ray detection of the radio pulsar psr b1757-24 usingthe chandra x-ray observatory. we detect point-source emission at the pulsarposition plus a faint tail extending nearly 20" east of the pulsar, in the samedirection and with comparable morphology to the radio tail. assuming thepoint-source x-ray emission is magnetospheric, the observed x-ray tailrepresents only ~0.01% of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity. this issignificantly lower than the analogous efficiencies of most known x-ray nebulaesurrounding rotation-powered pulsars. assuming a non-thermal spectrum for thetail photons, we show that the tail is unlikely to be emission left behindfollowing the passage of the pulsar, but rather is probably fromsynchrotron-emitting pulsar wind particles having flow velocity ~7000 km/s. wealso show that there must be a significant break in the tail synchrotronspectrum between the radio and x-ray bands that is intrinsic to the particlespectrum. no emission is detected from the shell supernova remnant g5.4-1.2.the upper limits on remnant emission are unconstraining.

astro-ph;0201070	on the nature of the x-ray emission from the galactic center region	the origin of the x-ray emission from the central region of the galaxy hasremained a mystery, despite extensive study over the past two decades. afundamental question is the relative contribution of the point-source anddiffuse components of this emission, which is critical to understanding thehigh-energy phenomena and processes unique to this galactic nuclearenvironment. here, we report on results from a large-scale imaging survey ofthe galactic center with sufficient spatial resolution to allow a cleanseparation of the two components. the highly-ionized fe emission, previouslyattributed to the diffuse emission, is found largely due to the discrete x-raysource population. the number and spectrum of such sources indicate thepresence of numerous accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, and/or black holesin the region. the diffuse x-ray emission dominates over the contribution fromthe faint discrete sources and is shown to be associated with distinctinterstellar structures observed at radio and mid-infrared wavelengths,suggesting that it arises from the recent formation of massive stars. we havealso mapped out the 6.4-kev fluorescence line emission from neutral tomoderately ionized irons. the ubiquitous association of the emission withmolecular gas indicates that either the x-ray radiation from the galacticcenter was substantially more intense in the past than at present ornon-relativistic cosmic-rays are important in producing fe k shell vacancies.

astro-ph;0503424	discovery of a 105 ms x-ray pulsar in kesteven 79: on the nature of  compact central objects in supernova remnants	we report the discovery of 105-ms x-ray pulsations from the compact centralobject (cco) in the supernova remnant kes 79 using data acquired with thenewton x-ray multi-mirror mission. two observations of the pulsar taken 6 daysapart yield an upper limit on its spin-down rate of dp/dt &lt; 7e-14 s/s and noevidence for binary orbital motion. the implied energy loss rate is de/dt &lt;2e36 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength is b_p &lt; 3e12 g, and spin-down ageis t &gt; 24 kyr. the latter exceeds the remnant's estimated age, suggesting thatthe pulsar was born spinning near its current period. the x-ray spectrum of psrj1852+0040 is best characterized by a blackbody model of temperature kt_bb =0.44 +/- 0.03 kev, radius r_bb approx. 0.9 km, and l_bol = 3.7e33 ergs/s at d =7.1 kpc. the sinusoidal light curve is modulated with a pulsed fraction of&gt;45%, suggestive of a small hot spot on the surface of the rotating neutronstar. the lack of a discernible pulsar wind nebula is consistent with aninterpretation of psr j1852+0040 as a rotation-powered pulsar whose spin-downluminosity falls below the empirical threshold for generating bright windnebulae, de/dt_c approx. 4e36 ergs/s. the age discrepancy implies that itsde/dt has always been below de/dt_c, perhaps a distinguishing property of theccos. alternatively, the x-ray spectrum of psr j1852+0040 suggests alow-luminosity axp, but the weak inferred b_p field is incompatible with amagnetar theory of its x-ray luminosity. so far, we cannot exclude accretionfrom a fall-back disk. the ordinary spin parameters discovered from psrj1852+0040 highlight the difficulty that existing theories of isolated neutronstars have in explaining the high luminosities and temperatures of cco thermalx-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0506511	the spectral evolution of transient anomalous x-ray pulsar xte  j1810--197	(abridged) we present a multi-epoch spectral study of the transient anomalousx-ray pulsar xte j1810-197 obtained with the xmm x-ray telescope. fourobservations taken over the course of a year reveal strong spectral evolutionas the source fades from outburst. the origin of this is traced to theindividual decay rates of the pulsar's spectral components. a 2-t fit at eachepoch requires nearly constant temperatures of kt=0.25 &amp; 0.67 kev while thecomponent luminosities decrease exponentially with tau=900 &amp; 300d,respectively. one possible interpretation is that the slowly decaying coolercomponent is the radiation from a deep heating event that affected a largefraction of the crust, while the hotter component is powered by externalsurface heating at the foot-points of twisted magnetic field lines, bymagnetospheric currents that are decaying more rapidly. the energy-dependentpulse profile of xte j1810-197 is well modeled at all epochs by the sum of asine and triangle function. these profiles peak at the same phase, suggesting aconcentric surface emission geometry. the spectral and pulse evolution togetherargue against the presence of a significant ``power-law'' contribution to thex-ray spectrum below 8 kev. the extrapolated flux is projected to return to thehistoric quiescent level, characterized by an even cooler blackbody spectrum,by the year 2007.

astro-ph;0609309	a shell of thermal x-ray emission associated with the young crab-like  remnant 3c58	deep x-ray imaging spectroscopy of the bright pulsar wind nebula 3c58confirms the existence of an embedded thermal x-ray shell surrounding thepulsar psr j0205+6449. radially resolved spectra obtained with the xmm-newtontelescope are well-characterized by a power-law model with the addition of asoft thermal emission component in varying proportions. these fits reproducethe well-studied increase in the spectral index with radius attributed tosynchrotron burn-off of high energy electrons. most interestingly, a radiallyresolved thermal component is shown to map out a shell-like structure ~6' indiameter. the presence of a strong emission line corresponding to the ne ixhe-like transition requires an overabundance of ~3 x [ne/ne(sun)] in theraymond-smith plasma model. the best-fit temperature kt ~ 0.23 kev isessentially independent of radius for the derived column density of n_h = (4.2+/- 0.1)e21 per cm squared. our result suggests that thermal shells can beobscured in the early evolution of a supernova remnant by non-thermal pulsarwind nebulae emission; the luminosity of the 3c58 shell is more than an orderof magnitude below the upper limit on a similar shell in the crab nebula. wefind the shell centroid to be offset from the pulsar location. if this neutronstar has a velocity similar to that of the crab pulsar, we derive an age of3700 yr and a velocity vector aligned with the long axis of the pwn. the shellparameters and pulsar offset add to the accumulating evidence that 3c58 is notthe remnant of the supernova of ce 1181.

astro-ph;9803214	discovery of an ultra-fast x-ray pulsar in the supernova remnant n157b	we present the serendipitous discovery of 16 ms pulsed x-ray emission fromthe crab-like supernova remnant n157b in the large magellanic cloud. this isthe fastest spinning pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (snr).observations with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte), centered on the fieldcontaining sn1987a, reveal an x-ray pulsar with a narrow pulse profile.archival asca x-ray data confirm this detection and locate the pulsar within 1'of the supernova remnant n157b, 14' from sn1987a. the pulsar manifests evidencefor glitch(es) between the rxte and asca observations which span 3.5 years; themean linear spin-down rate is pdot = 5.126 x 10e-14 s/s. the backgroundsubtracted pulsed emission is similar to other crab-like pulsars with a powerlaw of photon index of ~ 1.6. the characteristic spin-down age (~ 5000 years)is consistent with the previous age estimate of the snr. the inferred b-fieldfor a rotationally powered pulsar is ~ 1 x 10e12 gauss. our result confirms thecrab-like nature of n157b; the pulsar is likely associated with a compact x-raysource revealed by rosat hri observations.

astro-ph;9810365	rosat hri detection of the 16 ms pulsar psr j0537-6910 inside snr n157b	based on a deep rosat hri observation, we have detected a pulsed signal inthe 0.1-2 kev band from psr j0537-6910 --- the recently discovered pulsarassociated with the supernova remnant n157b in the large magellanic cloud. themeasured pulse period 0.01611548182 ms (+- 0.02 ns), epoch mjd 50540.5, gives arevised linear spin-down rate of $5.1271 \times 10^{-14} s s^{-1}$, slightlygreater than the previously derived value. the narrow pulse shape (fwhm = 10%duty cycle) in the rosat band resembles those seen in both xte and asca data (&gt;2 kev), but there is also marginal evidence for an interpulse. this rosatdetection enables us to locate the pulsar at r.a., dec (j2000) =$5^h37^m47^s.2, -69^\circ 10' 23''$. with its uncertainty $\sim 3''$, thisposition coincides with the centroid of a compact x-ray source. but the pulsedemission accounts for only about 10% of the source luminosity $\sim 2 \times10^{36} ergs^{-1}$ in the 0.1-2 kev band. these results support our previoussuggestions: (1) the pulsar is moving at a high velocity ($\sim 10^3 km/s$);(2) a bow shock, formed around the pulsar, is responsible for most of the x-rayemission from the source; (3) a collimated outflow from the bow shock regionpowers a pulsar wind nebula that accounts for an elongated non-thermal radioand x-ray feature to the northwest of the pulsar.

astro-ph;9906122	on the spin history of the x-ray pulsar in kes 73: further evidence for  an utramagnetized neutron star	in previous papers, we presented the discovery of a 12-s x-ray pulsar in thesupernova remnant kes 73, providing the first direct evidence for anultramagnetized neutron star, a magnetar, with an equivalent dipole field ofnearly twenty times the quantum critical magnetic field. our conclusions werebased on two epochs of measurement of the spin, along with an age estimate ofthe host supernova remnant. herein, we present a spin chronology of the pulsarusing additional ginga, asca, xte, &amp; sax datasets spanning over a decade.timing and spectral analysis confirms our initial results and severely limit anaccretion origin for the observed flux. over the 10 year baseline, the pulsaris found to undergo a rapid, constant spindown, while maintaining a steady fluxand an invariant pulse profile. within the measurement uncertainties, nosystematic departures from a linear spin-down are found - departures as in thecase of glitches or simply stochastic fluctuations in the pulsetimes-of-arrival (e.g. red timing noise). we suggest that this pulsar is akinto the soft gamma-ray repeaters, however, it is remarkably stable and has yetto display similar outbursts; future gamma-ray activity from this object islikely.

astro-ph;9906374	asca observations of the young rotation-powered pulsars psr b1046-58 and  psr b1610-50	we present x-ray observations of two young energetic radio pulsars, psrsb1046-58 and b1610-50, and their surroundings, using archival data from theadvanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics (asca).  the energetic pulsar psr b1046-58 is detected in x-rays with a significanceof 4.5 sigma. the unabsorbed flux, estimated assuming a power-law spectrum anda neutral hydrogen column density n_h of 5e21 cm^-2 is (2.5 +/- 0.3) x 10e-13ergs/cm^2/s in the 2-10 kev band. pulsed emission is not detected; the pulsedfraction is less than 31% at the 90% confidence level for a 50% duty cycle. weargue that the emission is best explained as originating from a pulsar-poweredsynchrotron nebula. the x-ray counterpart of the pulsar is the only hard sourcewithin the 95% error region of the previously unidentified gamma-ray source 3egj1048-5840. this evidence supports the results of kaspi et al. (1999), who in acompanion paper, suggest that psr b1046-58 is the counterpart to 3egj1048-5840.  x-ray emission from psr b1610-50 is not detected. using similar assumptionsas above, the derived 3 sigma upper limit for the unabsorbed 2-10 kev x-rayflux is 1.5e-13 ergs/cm^2/s. we use the flux limit to estimate the pulsar'svelocity to be less than ~170 km/s, casting doubt on a previously reportedassociation between psr b1610-50 and supernova remnant kes 32. kes 32 isdetected, as is evident from the correlation between x-ray and radio emission.the asca images of psr b1610-50 are dominated by mirror-scattered emission fromthe x-ray-bright supernova remnant rcw 103, located 33' away.  we find no evidence for extended emission around either pulsar, in contrastto previous reports of large nebulae surrounding both pulsars.

astro-ph;9908209	evidence of 10-100 tev electrons in supernova remnants	analyses of the x-ray data of the five young shell-type supernova remnantscas a, kepler, tycho, sn 1006, and rcw 86 suggest that some of the x-rayemission of these sources is non-thermal. this non-thermal emission isqualitatively consistent with models of the broad-band (radio-to-x-ray)synchrotron spectra of remnants and does not seem to be consistent with othernon-thermal x-ray emission processes. if this emission is produced bysynchrotron radiation, the radio-to-x-ray synchrotron spectra imply that theelectron spectra have differential spectral indices of about 2.2 andexponential cut offs at energies ~ 10 tev. if the remnants also acceleratecosmic-ray nuclei, the total energies of the cosmic rays in the remnants areestimated to be ~ 1-5 x 10^49 erg. therefore, the shapes of the cosmic-rayelectron spectra, the maximum energies of the cosmic-ray electrons, and thetotal cosmic-ray energies of the five young remnants seem to be consistent withthe idea that galactic cosmic rays are predominantly accelerated in the shocksof supernova remnants.

astro-ph;9910525	a new pulsar/snr pair: ax j1845-0258 in g29.6+0.1	we present a follow-up x-ray and radio study of the field containing the 7-sx-ray pulsar ax j1845-0258, the serendipitous asca source whose characteristicsare found to be similar to those of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps). newlyacquired asca data confirms a dramatic reduction in flux from the pulsar andreveals instead a faint x-ray point source, ax j184453.3-025642, within thepulsar's error circle. this x-ray source is surrounded by a partial shell ofemission coincident with a newly discovered young shell-type radio supernovaremnant, g29.6+0.1. the central x-ray source is too faint to provide adetection of the expected pulsations which might confirm ax j184453.3-025642 asthe pulsar. we argue that this system is similar to that of rcw 103, anotheraxp-like object whose central source displays low/high flux states (but nopulsations). the alternative interpretation of a binary system, perhapsassociated with a supernova remnant, is still possible. in either case, thisresult may have profound implication on the evolution of young neutron stars.

astro-ph;9911344	a new view on young pulsars in supernova remnants: slow, radio-quiet, &amp;  x-ray bright	we propose a simple explanation for the apparent dearth of radio pulsarsassociated with young supernova remnants (snrs). recent x-ray observations ofyoung remnants have revealed slowly rotating (p ~ 10-s) central pulsars withpulsed emission above 2 kev, lacking in detectable radio emission. some ofthese objects apparently have enormous magnetic fields, evolving in a mannerdistinct from the crab pulsar. we argue that these x-ray pulsars can accountfor a substantial fraction of the long sought after neutron stars in snrs andthat crab-like pulsars are perhaps the rarer, but more highly visible exampleof these stellar embers. magnetic field decay likely accounts for their highx-ray luminosity, which cannot be explained as rotational energy loss, as forthe crab-like pulsars. we suggest that the natal magnetic field strength ofthese objects control their subsequent evolution. there are currently almost adozen slow x-ray pulsars associated with young snrs. remarkably, these objects,taken together, represent at least half of the confirmed pulsars in supernovaremnants. this being the case, these pulsars must be the progenitors of a vastpopulation of previously unrecognized neutron stars.

0810.1605	on the origin of tev gamma-ray emission from hess j1834-087	we present an x-ray study of the field containing the extended tev sourcehess j1834-087 using data obtained with the xmm-newton telescope. previously,the coincidence of this source with both the shell-type supernova remnant (snr)w41 and a giant molecular cloud (gmc) was interpreted as favoring pi^0-decaygamma-rays from interaction of the old snr with the gmc. alternatively, the tevemission has been attributed to inverse compton scattering from leptonsdeposited by psr j1833-0827, a pulsar assumed to have been born in w41 but nowlocated 24' from the center of the snr (and the tev source). instead, we arguefor a third possibility, that the tev emission is powered by a previouslyunknown pulsar wind nebula located near the center of w41. the candidate pulsaris xmmu j183435.3-084443, a hard x-ray point source that lacks an opticalcounterpart to r&gt;21 and is coincident with diffuse x-ray emission. the x-raysfrom both the point source and diffuse feature are evidently non-thermal andhighly absorbed. a best fit power-law model yields photon index gamma ~ 0.2 andgamma ~ 1.9, for the point source and diffuse emission, respectively, and 2-10kev flux ~ 5 x 10^(-13) ergs/cm^(2)/s for each. at the measured 4 kpc distanceof w41, the observed x-ray luminosity implies an energetic pulsar with edot ~10^(36)d_4^2 ergs/s, which is also sufficient to generate the observedgamma-ray luminosity of 2.7 x 10^(34)d_4^2 ergs/s via inverse comptonscattering.

0704.0973	x-ray timing observations of psr j1930+1852 in the crab-like snr  g54.1+0.3	we present new x-ray timing and spectral observations of psr j1930+1852, theyoung energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnantg54.1+0.3. using data obtained with the rossi x-ray timing explorer and chandrax-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 mspulsar spanning 6 years. during this interval, however, the period evolutionshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of$\dot p = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noiseand/or glitch activity. the x-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. the spectrum of the pulsedemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\gamma =1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. thetotal 2-10 kev flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. these results confirm psr j1930+1852 as a typical crab-like pulsar.
