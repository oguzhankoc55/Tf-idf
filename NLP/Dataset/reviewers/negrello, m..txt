0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

1002.3618	the agn fraction of submm-selected galaxies and contributions to the  submm/mm-wave extragalactic background light	we present a comparison of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) at 450, 850 and 1100 microns with deep guaranteed time 15 micronsakari fu-hyu survey data and spitzer guaranteed time data at 3.6-24 microns inthe lockman hole east. the akari data was analysed using bespoke software basedin part on the drizzling and minimum-variance matched filtering developed forshades, and was cross calibrated against infrared space observatory (iso)fluxes. our stacking analyses find akari 15um galaxies with &gt;~200 microjycontribute &gt;10% of the 450 micron background, but only &lt;4% of the 1100 micronbackground, suggesting that different populations contribute at mm-wavelengths.we confirm our earlier result that the ultra-deep 450 micron scuba-2 cosmologysurvey will be dominated by populations already detected by akari and spitzermid-infrared surveys. the superb mid-infrared wavelength coverage afforded bycombining spitzer and akari photometry is an excellent diagnostic of agncontributions, and we find that (23-52)% of submm-selected galaxies have agnbolometric fractions f_agn&gt;0.3.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.3018	a search for debris disks in the herschel atlas	aims: we aim to demonstrate that the herschel atlas (h-atlas) is suitable fora blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debrisdisks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstrationfield of the survey. we show that h-atlas reveals a population offar-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objectson the sdss main-sequence locus. we validate our approach by comparing theproperties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.methods: we use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequencestars in the sdss dr7 catalogue and a bayesian likelihood ratio method toidentify h-atlas catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify themost likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminatinggalaxies using ukidss las k-band images. results: we identify 78 h-atlassources associated with sdss point sources on the main-sequence locus, of whichtwo are the most likely debris disk candidates: h-atlas j090315.8 and h-atlasj090240.2. we show that they are plausible candidates by comparing theirproperties to the known population of debris disks. our initial resultsindicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identifiedin a search sample of 851 stars. we also show that h-atlas can derive usefulupper limits for debris disks associated with hipparcos stars in the field andoutline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1009.5983	measurements of co redshifts with z-spec for lensed submillimeter  galaxies discovered in the h-atlas survey	we present new observations from z-spec, a broadband 185-305 ghzspectrometer, of five sub-millimeter bright lensed sources selected from theherschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) sciencedemonstration phase (sdp) catalog. we construct a redshift finding algorithmusing combinations of the signal-to-noise of all the lines falling in thez-spec bandpass to determine redshifts with high confidence, even in caseswhere the signal-to-noise in individual lines is low. we measure the dustcontinuum in all sources and secure co redshifts for four out of five(z~1.5-3). in one source, sdp.17, we tentatively identify two independentredshifts and a water line, confirmed at z=2.308. our sources have propertiescharacteristic of dusty starburst galaxies, with magnification-corrected starformation rates of 10^(2-3) m_sun/yr. lower limits for the dust masses (~a few10^8 m_sun) and spatial extents (~1 kpc equivalent radius) are derived from thecontinuum spectral energy distributions, corresponding to dust temperaturesbetween 54 and 69k. in the lte approximation, we derive relatively low coexcitation temperatures (&lt; 100 k) and optical depths (tau&lt;1). performing anon-lte excitation analysis using radex, we find that the co lines measured byz-spec (from j=4-&gt;3 to 10-&gt;9, depending on the galaxy) localize the bestsolutions to either a high-temperature / low-density region, or alow-temperature / high-density region near the lte solution, with the opticaldepth varying accordingly. observations of additional co lines, co(1-0) inparticular, are needed to constrain the non-lte models.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1111.4212	clustering of sub-millimeter galaxies in a self-regulated baryon  collapse model	we have investigated the cosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies in theframework of the physical evolutionary model for proto-spheroidal galaxies bygranato et al. (2004). after having re-calibrated the cumulative flux function$ds/dz$ at $\lambda \ge 850\,\mu$m using the available determinations of theshot noise amplitude (the original model already correctly reproduces it atshorter wavelengths) the cib power spectra at wavelengths from $250\,\mu$m to$2\,$mm measured by {\it planck}, {\it herschel}, spt and act experiments havebeen fitted using the halo model with only 2 free parameters, the minimum halomass and the power-law index of the mean occupation function of satellitegalaxies. the best-fit {\it minimum} halo mass is $\log(m_{\rm min}/m_\odot) =12.24 \pm 0.06$, higher than, but consistent within the errors, with theestimate by amblard et al. (2011) and close to the estimate by planckcollaboration (2011). the redshift evolution of the volume emissivity ofgalaxies yielded by the model is found to be consistent with that inferred fromthe data. the derived {\it effective} halo mass, $m_{\rm eff} \simeq 5\times10^{12}\,m_\odot$, of $z\simeq 2$ sub-millimeter galaxies is close to thatestimated for the most efficient star-formers at the same redshift. theeffective bias factor and the comoving clustering radius at $z\simeq 2$ yieldedby the model are substantially lower than those found for a model whereby thestar formation is fueled by steady gas accretion, but substantially higher thanthose found for a merging-driven galaxy evolution with a top-heavy initial massfunction.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1204.4706	blind detections of co j = 1--0 in 11 h-atlas galaxies at z = 2.1--3.5  with the gbt/zpectrometer	we report measurements of the carbon monoxide ground state rotationaltransition (12c16o j = 1--0) with the zpectrometer ultra-wideband spectrometeron the 100-m diameter green bank telescope. the sample comprises 11 galaxieswith redshifts between z = 2.1 and 3.5 from a total sample of 24 targetsidentified by herschel-atlas photometric colors from the spire instrument. nineof the co measurements are new redshift determinations, substantially adding tothe number of detections of galaxies with rest-frame peak submillimeteremission near 100um. the co detections confirm the existence of massive gasreservoirs within these luminous dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs). the coredshift distribution of the 350um-selected galaxies is strikingly similar tothe optical redshifts of 850um-selected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in 2.1 &lt;z &lt; 3.5. spectroscopic redshifts break a temperature-redshift degeneracy;optically thin dust models fit to the far-infrared photometry indicatecharacteristic dust temperatures near 34 k for most of the galaxies we detectin co. detections of two warmer galaxies and statistically significantnondetections hint at warmer or molecule-poor dsfgs with redshifts difficultdetermine from from herschel-spire photometric colors alone. many of thegalaxies identified by h-atlas photometry are expected to be amplified byforeground gravitational lenses. analysis of co linewidths and luminositiesprovides a method for finding approximate gravitational lens magnifications mufrom spectroscopic data alone, yielding mu ~ 3--20. corrected formagnification, most galaxy luminosities are consistent with an ultra-luminousinfrared galaxy (ulirg) classification, but three are candidate hyper-lirgswith luminosities greater than 10^13 l_sun.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.1142	effective models for statistical studies of galaxy-scale gravitational  lensing	we have worked out simple analytical formulae that accurately approximate therelationship between the position of the source with respect to the lens centerand the amplification of the images, hence the lens cross section, forrealistic lens profiles. we find that, for essentially the full range ofparameters either observationally determined or yielded by numericalsimulations, the combination of dark matter and star distribution can be verywell described, for lens radii relevant to strong lensing, by a simplepower-law whose slope is very weakly dependent on the parameters characterizingthe global matter surface density profile and close to isothermal in agreementwith direct estimates for individual lens galaxies. our simple treatment allowsan easy insight into the role of the different ingredients that determine thelens cross section and the distribution of gravitational amplifications. theyalso ease the reconstruction of the lens mass distribution from the observedimages and, vice-versa, allow a fast application of ray-tracing techniques tomodel the effect of lensing on a variety of source structures. the maximumamplification depends primarily on the source size. amplifications larger than~20 are indicative of compact source sizes at high-z, in agreement withexpectations if galaxies formed most of their stars during the dissipativecollapse of cold gas. our formalism has allowed us to reproduce the counts ofstrongly lensed galaxies found in the h-atlas sdp field. while our analysis isfocussed on spherical lenses, we also discuss the effect of ellipticity and thecase of late-type lenses (showing why they are much less common, even thoughlate-type galaxies are more numerous). furthermore we discuss the effect of acluster halo surrounding the early-type lens and of a supermassive black holeat its center.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

0802.0084	a reassessment of the evidence of the integrated sachs-wolfe effect  through the wmap-nvss correlation	we reassess the estimate of the cross-correlation of the spatial distributionof the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) radio sources with that of cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). this re-analysis is motivated by the fact that most previous studiesadopted a redshift distribution of nvss sources inconsistent with recent data.we find that the constraints on the bias-weighted redshift distribution,b(z)xn(z), of nvss sources, set by the observed angular correlation function,w(theta), strongly mitigate the effect of the choice of n(z). if suchconstraints are met, even highly discrepant redshift distributions yieldnvss-wmap cross-correlation functions consistent with each other withinstatistical errors. the models favoured by recent data imply a bias factor,b(z), decreasing with increasing z, rather than constant, as assumed by mostprevious analyses. as a consequence, the function b(z)xn(z) has more weight atz&lt;1, i.e. in the redshift range yielding the maximum contribution to the isw ina standard lambdacdm cosmology. on the whole, the nvss turns out to be bettersuited for isw studies than generally believed, even in the absence of anobservational determination of the redshift distribution. the nvss-wmapcross-correlation function is found to be fully consistent with the predictionof the standard lambdacdm cosmology.

1312.3751	the coevolution of supermassive black holes and massive galaxies at high  redshift	we exploit the recent, wide samples of far-infrared (fir) selected galaxiesfollowed-up in x rays and of x-ray/optically selected active galactic nuclei(agns) followed-up in the fir band, along with the classic data on agn andstellar luminosity functions at high redshift z&gt;1.5, to probe different stagesin the coevolution of supermassive black holes (bhs) and host galaxies. theresults of our analysis indicate the following scenario: (i) the star formationin the host galaxy proceeds within a heavily dust-enshrouded medium at analmost constant rate over a timescale ~0.5-1 gyr, and then abruptly declinesdue to quasar feedback; over the same timescale, (ii) part of the interstellarmedium loses angular momentum, reaches the circum-nuclear regions at a rateproportional to the star formation and is temporarily stored into a massivereservoir/proto-torus wherefrom it can be promptly accreted; (iii) the bh growsby accretion in a self-regulated regime with radiative power that can slightlyexceed the eddington limit l/l_edd&lt; 4, particularly at the highest redshifts;(iv) for massive bhs the ensuing energy feedback at its maximum exceeds thestellar one and removes the interstellar gas, thus stopping the star formationand the fueling of the reservoir; (v) afterwards, if the latter has retainedenough gas, a phase of supply-limited accretion follows exponentially decliningwith a timescale of about 2 e-folding times. we show that the ratio of the firluminosity of the host galaxy to the bolometric luminosity of the agn maps thevarious stages of the above sequence. finally, we discuss how the detailedproperties and the specific evolution of the reservoir can be investigated viacoordinated, high-resolution observations of starforming, strongly-lensedgalaxies in the (sub-)mm band with alma and in the x-ray band with chandra andthe next generation x-ray instruments.

1408.3234	exploring the relationship between black hole accretion and star  formation with blind mid-/far-infrared spectroscopic surveys	we present new estimates of redshift-dependent luminosity functions of irlines detectable by spica/safari and excited both by star formation and by agnactivity. the new estimates improve over previous work by using updatedevolutionary models and dealing in a self consistent way with emission ofgalaxies as a whole, including both the starburst and the agn component. newrelationships between line and agn bolometric luminosity have been derived andthose between line and ir luminosities of the starburst component have beenupdated. these ingredients were used to work out predictions for the sourcecounts in 11 mid/far-ir emission lines partially or entirely excited by agnactivity. we find that the statistics of the emission line detection ofgalaxies as a whole is mainly determined by the star formation rate, because ofthe rarity of bright agns. we also find that the slope of the line integralnumber counts is flatter than 2 implying that the number of detections at fixedobserving time increases more by extending the survey area than by goingdeeper. we thus propose a wide spectroscopic survey of 1 hour integration perfield-of-view over an area of 5 deg$^{2}$ to detect (at 5$\sigma$) $\sim$760agns in [oiv]25.89$\mu$m $-$ the brightest agn mid-infrared line $-$ out to$z\sim2$. pointed observations of strongly lensed or hyper-luminous galaxiespreviously detected by large area surveys such as those by herschel and by thespt can provide key information on the galaxy-agn co-evolution out to higherredshifts.

1410.4502	cross-correlation between the cmb lensing potential measured by planck  and high-z sub-mm galaxies detected by the herschel-atlas survey	we present the first measurement of the correlation between the map of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) lensing potential derived from the\emph{planck} nominal mission data and $z\gtrsim 1.5$ galaxies detected by the\emph{herschel}-atlas (h-atlas) survey covering about $600\,\hbox{deg}^2$, i.e.about 1.4\% of the sky. we reject the hypothesis that there is no correlationbetween cmb lensing and galaxy detection at a $20\,\sigma$ significance,checking the result by performing a number of null tests. the significance ofthe detection of the theoretically expected cross-correlation signal is foundto be $10\,\sigma$. the galaxy bias parameter, $b$, derived from a jointanalysis of the cross-power spectrum and of the auto-power spectrum of thegalaxy density contrast is found to be $b=2.80^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, consistentwith earlier estimates for h-atlas galaxies at similar redshifts. on the otherhand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be a factor $1.62 \pm0.16$ higher than expected from the standard model and also found bycross-correlation analyses with other tracers of the large-scale structure. theenhancement due to lensing magnification can account for only a fraction of theexcess cross-correlation signal. we suggest that part of it may be due to anincomplete removal of the contamination of the cib, that includes the h-atlassources we are cross-correlating with. in any case, the highly significantdetection reported here using a catalog covering only 1.4\% of the skydemonstrates the potential of cmb lensing correlations with submillimetersurveys.

1412.5827	radio observations of star forming galaxies in the ska era	we have combined determinations of the epoch-dependent star formation rate(sfr) function with relationships between sfr and radio (synchrotron andfree-free) emission to work out detailed predictions for the counts and theredshift distributions of star-forming galaxies detected by planned squarekilometer array (ska) surveys. the evolving sfr function comes from recentmodels fitting the far-infrared (fir) to millimeter-wave luminosity functionsand the ultraviolet (uv) luminosity functions up to z=10, extended to take intoaccount additional uv survey data. we used very deep 1.4 ghz number counts fromthe literature to check the relationship between sfr and synchrotron emission,and the 95 ghz south pole telescope (spt) counts of dusty galaxies to test therelationship between sfr and free-free emission. we show that the ska willallow us to investigate the sfrs of galaxies down to few msun/yr up to z=10,thus extending by more than two orders of magnitude the high-z sfr functionsderived from herschel surveys. ska1-mid surveys, down to microjy levels, willdetect hundreds of strongly lensed galaxies per square degree; a substantialfraction of them will show at least two images above the detection limits.

1501.02170	extragalactic sources in cosmic microwave background maps	we discuss the potential of a next generation space-borne cmb experiment forstudies of extragalactic sources with reference to core+, a project submittedto esa in response to the m4 call. we consider three possible options for thetelescope size: 1m, 1.5m and 2m (although the last option is probablyimpractical, given the m4 boundary conditions). the proposed instrument will befar more sensitive than planck and will have a diffraction-limited angularresolution. these properties imply that even the 1m telescope option willperform substantially better than planck for studies of extragalactic sources.the source detection limits as a function of frequency have been estimated bymeans of realistic simulations. the most significant improvements over planckresults are presented for each option. core+ will provide much larger samplesof truly local star-forming galaxies, making possible analyses of theproperties of galaxies (luminosity functions, dust mass functions, starformation rate functions, dust temperature distributions, etc.) across thehubble sequence. even more interestingly, core+ will detect, at |b|&gt; 30 deg,thousands of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies. such large samples areof extraordinary astrophysical and cosmological value in many fields. moreover,core+ high frequency maps will be optimally suited to pick up proto-clusters ofdusty galaxies, i.e. to investigate the evolution of large scale structure atlarger redshifts than can be reached by other means. thanks to its highsensitivity core+ will also yield a spectacular advance in the blind detectionof extragalactic sources in polarization. this will open a new window forstudies of radio source polarization and of the global properties of magneticfields in star forming galaxies and of their relationships with sfrs.

1501.04634	relationship between star formation rate and black hole accretion at  z=2: the different contributions in quiescent, normal and starburst galaxies	we investigate the co-evolution of black-hole-accretion-rate (bhar) andstar-formation-rate (sfr) in $1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ galaxies displaying a greaterdiversity of star-forming properties compared to previous studies. we combinex-ray stacking and far-ir photometry of stellar mass-limited samples of normalstar-forming, starburst and quiescent/quenched galaxies in the cosmos field. wecorroborate the existence of a strong correlation between bhar (i.e. the x-rayluminosity, l_x), and stellar mass (m*) for normal star-forming galaxies,although find a steeper relation than previously reported. we find thatstarbursts show a factor of 3 enhancement in bhar compared to normal sfgalaxies (against a factor of 6 excess in sfr), while quiescents show a deficitof a factor 5.5 at a given mass. one possible interpretation of this is thatthe starburst phase does not coincide with cosmologically relevant bh growth,or that starburst-inducing mergers are more efficient at boosting sfr thanbhar. contrary to studies based on smaller samples, we find the bhar/sfr ratioof main sequence (ms) galaxies is not mass invariant, but scales weakly asm*^(0.43\pm0.09}, implying faster bh growth in more massive galaxies at$z\sim2$. furthermore, bhar/sfr during the starburst is a factor of 2 lowerthan in ms galaxies, at odds with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulationsof merger galaxies that foresee a sudden enhancement of l_x/sfr during themerger. finally, we estimate that the bulk of the accretion density of theuniverse at $z\sim2$ is associated with normal star-forming systems, with only6(+/-1)% and 11(+/-1)% associated with starburst and quiescent galaxies,respectively.

1502.00640	alma constraints on the faint millimetre source number counts and their  contribution to the cosmic infrared background	we have analysed 18 alma continuum maps in bands 6 and 7, with rms down to7.8$\mu$jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$jy and100$\mu$jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. the areacovered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. we improved the source extraction method byrequiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with thebeam size. this method enabled us to remove spurious detections that haveplagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. we detected 50 faintsources with s/n$&gt;$3.5 down to 60$\mu$jy, hence improving the statistics by afactor of four relative to previous studies. the inferred differential numbercounts are $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $s_{\lambda= 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$jy, and $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3mm flux $\rm s_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$jy. at the faintest flux limits,i.e. 30$\mu$jy and 40$\mu$jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential numbercounts of $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s) &lt; 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rmdn/d(log_{10}s)&lt;3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. our results provide a newlower limit to cib intensity of 17.2${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of12.9${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. moreover, the flattening of the integratednumber counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close tothe cib intensity. our data imply that galaxies with sfr$&lt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$certainly contribute less than 50% to the cib while more than 50% of the cibmust be produced by galaxies with $\rm sfr&gt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$. the differentialnumber counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. consequently, this supportsthe galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

1503.08720	revealing the complex nature of the strong gravitationally lensed system  h-atlas j090311.6+003906 using alma	we have modelled atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) longbaseline imaging of the strong gravitational lens system h-atlasj090311.6+003906 (sdp.81). we have reconstructed the distribution of band 6 and7 continuum emission in the z=3.042 source and we have determined its kinematicproperties by reconstructing co(5-4) and co(8-7) line emission in bands 4 and6. the continuum imaging reveals a highly non-uniform distribution of dust withclumps on scales of 200 pc. in contrast, the co line emission shows arelatively smooth, disk-like velocity field which is well fit by a rotatingdisk model with an inclination angle of 40+/-5 degrees and an asymptoticrotation velocity of 320 km/s. the inferred dynamical mass within 1.5kpc is(3.5+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol which is comparable to the total molecular gas massesof (2.7+/-0.5)x10^{10} m_sol and (3.5+/-0.6)x10^{10} m_sol from the dustcontinuum emission and co emission respectively. our new reconstruction of thelensed hst near-infrared emission shows two objects which appear to beinteracting, with the rotating disk of gas and dust revealed by alma distinctlyoffset from the near-infrared emission. the clumpy nature of the dust and a lowvalue of the toomre parameter of q=0.3 suggest that the disk is in a state ofcollapse. we estimate a star formation rate in the disk of 470+/-80 m_sol/yrwith an efficiency 65 times greater than typical low-redshift galaxies. ourfindings add to the growing body of evidence that the most infra-red luminous,dust obscured galaxies in the high redshift universe represent a population ofmerger induced starbursts.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1506.02135	predictions for surveys with the spica mid-infrared instrument	we present predictions for number counts and redshift distributions ofgalaxies detectable in continuum and in emission lines with the mid-infrared(mir) instrument (smi) proposed for the space infrared telescope for cosmologyand astrophysics (spica). we have considered 24 mir fine-structure lines, fourpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands (at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3$\mu$m)and two silicate bands (in emission and in absorption) at 9.7$\mu$m and18.0$\mu$m. six of these lines are primarily associated with active galacticnuclei (agns), the others with star formation. a survey with the smispectrometers of 1 hour integration per field-of-view (fov) over an area of$1\,\hbox{deg}^2$ will yield $5\,\sigma$ detections of $\simeq 140$ agn linesand of $\simeq 5.2\times10^{4}$ star-forming galaxies, $\simeq 1.6\times10^{4}$of which will be detected in at least two lines. the combination of a shallow($20.0\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$, $1.4\times10^{-1}$ h integration per fov) and a deepsurvey ($6.9\times10^{-3}\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$, $635$ h integration time), with thesmi camera, for a total of $\sim$1000 h, will accurately determine the mirnumber counts of galaxies and of agns over five orders of magnitude in fluxdensity, reaching values more than one order of magnitude fainter than thedeepest spitzer $24\,\mu$m surveys. this will allow us to determine the cosmicstar formation rate (sfr) function down to sfrs more than 100 times fainterthan reached by the herschel observatory.

astro-ph;0401199	confusion noise at far-ir to millimeter wavelengths	we present detailed predictions for the confusion noise due to extragalacticsources in the far-ir/(sub)-millimeter channels of esa/iso, nasa/spitzer,esa/herschel and esa/planck satellites, including the contribution fromclustering of unresolved scuba galaxies. clustering is found to increase theconfusion noise, compared to the case of purely poisson fluctuations, by 10-15%for the lowest frequency (i.e. lowest angular resolution) spitzer and herschelchannels, by 25-35% for the 175 micron isophot channel, and to dominate in thecase of planck/hfi channels at nu&gt;143ghz. although our calculations make use ofa specific evolutionary model (granato et al. 2004), the results are stronglyconstrained by the observed counts and by data on the redshift distribution ofscuba sources, and therefore are not expected to be heavily model dependent.the main uncertainty arises from the poor observational definition of thesource clustering properties. two models have been used for the latter: apower-law with constant slope and a redshift-independent comoving correlationlength,r_0, and the standard theoretical model for clustering evolution in alambdacdm universe, with a redshift-dependent bias factor. in both cases, theclustering amplitude has been normalized to yield a unit angular correlationfunction at theta_0=1-2 arcsec for 850 micron sources fainter than 2 mjy,consistent with the results by peacock et al. (2000). this normalizationyields, for the first model, r_0=8.3$ mpc/h, and, for the second model, aneffective mass of dark matter haloes in which these sources reside ofm_halo=1.8*10^{13} m_sun/h. these results are consistent with independentestimates for scuba galaxies and for other, likely related, sources.

astro-ph;0406388	effect of clustering on extragalactic source counts with low-resolution  instruments	in the presence of strong clustering, low-resolution surveys measure thesummed contributions of groups of sources within the beam. the counts of brightintensity peaks are therefore shifted to higher flux levels compared to thecounts of individual sources detected with high-resolution instruments. if thebeam-width corresponds a sizable fraction of the clustering size, as in thecase of planck/hfi, one actually detects the fluxes of clumps of sources. weargue that the distribution of clump luminosities can be modelled in terms ofthe two- and three-point correlation functions, and apply our formalism to theplanck/hfi 850 micron surveys. the effect on counts is found to be large andsensitive also to the evolution of the three-point correlation function; in theextreme case that the latter function is redshift-independent, the sourceconfusion due to clustering keeps being important above the canonical 5*sigmadetection limit. detailed simulations confirm the reliability of our approach.as the ratio of the beam-width to the clustering angular size decreases, theobserved fluxes approach those of the brightest sources in the beam and theclump formalism no longer applies. however, simulations show that also in thecase of the herschel/spire 500 micron survey the enhancement of the brightsource counts due to clustering is important.

astro-ph;0410605	extragalactic source contributions to arcminute-scale cosmic microwave  background anisotropies	the possible contributions of the various classes of extragalactic sources(including, in addition to the canonical radio sources, ghz peaked spectrumsources, advection-dominated sources, starburst galaxies, high-redshiftproto-spheroidal galaxies) to the arcminute scale fluctuations measured by thecbi, bima, and acbar experiments are discussed. at 30 ghz, fluctuations due toradio sources undetected by ancillary low-frequency surveys may be higher thanestimated by the cbi and bima groups. high-redshift dusty galaxies, whosefluctuations may be strongly enhanced by the effect of clustering, couldcontribute to the bima excess signal, and dominate at 150 ghz (the acbarfrequency). moreover, in the present data situation, the dust emission of thesehigh-redshift sources set an unavoidable limit to the detection of primordialcmb anisotropies at high multipoles, even at frequencies as low as $\simeq 30$ghz. it is concluded that the possibility that the excess power at highmultipoles is dominated by unsubtracted extragalactic sources cannot be ruledout. on the other hand, there is room for a contribution from thesunyaev-zeldovich effect within clusters of galaxies, with a densityfluctuation amplitude parameter $\sigma_8$ consistent with the values preferredby current data.

astro-ph;0602283	the large scale clustering of radio sources	the observed two-point angular correlation function, w(theta), of mjy radiosources exhibits the puzzling feature of a power-law behaviour up to very large(almost 10 degrees) angular scales which cannot be accounted for in thestandard hierarchical clustering scenario for any realistic redshiftdistribution of such sources. after having discarded the possibility that thesignal can be explained by a high density local source population, we find noalternatives to assuming that - at variance with all the other extragalacticpopulations studied so far, and in particular with optically selected quasars -radio sources responsible for the large-scale clustering signal wereincreasingly less clustered with increasing look-back time, up to at least z=1.the data are accurately accounted for in terms of a bias function whichdecreases with increasing redshift, mirroring the evolution with cosmic time ofthe characteristic halo mass, m_{star}, entering the non linear regime. in theframework of the `concordance cosmology', the effective halo mass controllingthe bias parameter is found to decrease from about 10^{15} m_{sun}/h at z=0 tothe value appropriate for optically selected quasars, 10^{13} m_{sun}/h, atz=1.5. this suggests that, in the redshift range probed by the data, theclustering evolution of radio sources is ruled by the growth of large-scalestructure, and that they are associated with the densest environmentsvirializing at any cosmic epoch. the data provide only loose constraints onradio source clustering at z&gt;1 so we cannot rule out the possibility that atthese redshifts the clustering evolution of radio sources enters a differentregime, perhaps similar to that found for optically selected quasars. thedependence of w(theta) on cosmological parameters is also discussed.

(2004) for theformation and evolution of spheroidal galaxies with up-to-date phenomenologicalmodels for the evolution of starburst and normal late-type galaxies and ofradio sources. we compute the expected number counts and the redshiftdistributions of these source populations separately and then focus onproto-spheroidal galaxies. for the latter objects we predict the counts andredshift distributions of strongly lensed sources at 250, 350, 500, and 850micron, the angular correlation function of sources detected in the surveysconsidered, the angular power spectra due to clustering of sources below thedetection limit in herschel and planck surveys. an optimal survey for selectingstrongly lensed proto-spheroidal galaxies is described, and it is shown howthey can be easily distinguished from the other source populations. we alsodiscuss the detectability of the imprints of the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes onangular correlation functions and clustering power spectra, as well as theconstraints on cosmological parameters that can be obtained from thedeterminations of these quantities. the novel data relevant to derive the firstsub-millimeter estimates of the local luminosity functions of starburst andlate-type galaxies, and the constraints on the properties of rare sourcepopulations, such as blazars, are also briefly described.

0811.4158	photometric redshift accuracy in akari deep surveys	we investigate the photometric redshift accuracy achievable with the akariinfrared data in deep multi-band surveys, such as in the north ecliptic polefield. we demonstrate that the passage of redshifted policyclic aromatichydrocarbons and silicate features into the mid-infrared wavelength windowcovered by akari is a valuable means to recover the redshifts of starburstgalaxies. to this end we have collected a sample of ~60 galaxies drawn from thegoods-north field with spectroscopic redshift 0.5&lt;~z_spec&lt;~1.5 and photometryfrom 3.6 to 24 micron, provided by the spitzer, iso and akari satellites. theinfrared spectra are fitted using synthetic galaxy spectral energydistributions which account for starburst and active nuclei emission. for ~90%of the sources in our sample the redshift is recovered with an accuracy|z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&lt;~10%. a similar analysis performed on different setsof simulated spectra shows that the akari infrared data alone can providephotometric redshifts accurate to |z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&lt;~10% (1-sigma) atz&lt;~2. at higher redshifts the pah features are shifted outside the wavelengthrange covered by akari and the photo-z estimates rely on the less prominent 1.6micron stellar bump; the accuracy achievable in this case on (1+z) is ~10-15%,provided that the agn contribution to the infrared emission is subdominant. ourtechnique is no more prone to redshift aliasing than optical-uv photo-z, and itmay be possible to reduce this aliasing further with the addition ofsubmillimetre and/or radio data.
