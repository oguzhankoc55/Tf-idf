0901.1309	blue hook stars in globular clusters	blue hook (bhk) stars are a rare class of horizontal branch stars that so farhave been found in only very few galactic globular clusters (gcs). the dominantmechanism for producing these objects is currently still unclear. in order totest if the presence of bhk populations in a given gc is linked to specificphysical or structural cluster properties, we have constructed a parent sampleof gcs for which existing data is sufficient to establish the presence orabsence of bhk populations with confidence. we then compare the properties ofthose clusters in our parent sample that do contain a bhk population to thosethat do not. we find that there is only one compelling difference between bhkand non-bhk clusters: all known bhk clusters are unusually massive. however, wealso find that the bhk clusters are consistent with being uniformly distributedwithin the cumulative mass distribution of the parent sample. thus, while it isattractive to suggest there is is a lower mass cut-off for clusters capable offorming bhk stars, the data do not require this. instead, the apparentpreference for massive clusters could still be a purely statistical effect:intrinsically rare objects can only be found by searching a sufficiently largenumber of stars.

0902.2199	swift x-ray and uv monitoring of the classical nova v458 vul (nova vul  2007)	we describe the highly variable x-ray and uv emission of v458 vul (nova vul2007), observed by swift between 1 and 422 days after outburst. initiallybright only in the uv, v458 vul became a variable hard x-ray source due tooptically thin thermal emission at kt=0.64 kev with an x-ray band unabsorbedluminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. the x-ray spectrum atthis time requires a low fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistentwith a suzaku measurement around the same time. on day 315 we find a new x-rayspectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature ofkt=23^{+9}_{-5} ev, while the previous hard x-ray component has declined by afactor of 3.8. the spectrum of this soft x-ray component resembles thosetypically seen in the class of supersoft sources (sss) which suggests that thenova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the wd photosphere is shrinkingto the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the x-ray band. we finda high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by anorder of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. in the following observations ondays 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day397. the hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelationbetween the hard x-ray emission and the uv emission, yielding a spearman rankprobability of 97%. after day 397, the hard component was still present, wasvariable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not beanalysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright sss component.

0905.0145	an ultracompact x-ray binary in the globular cluster ngc 1851	we present far-ultraviolet photometry obtained with the hubble spacetelescope of the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 0513-40 in the globular cluster ngc1851. our observations reveal a clear, roughly sinusoidal periodic signal with$p \simeq 17$ min and amplitude 3%-10%. the signal appears fully coherent andcan be modelled as a simple reprocessing effect associated with the changingprojected area presented by the irradiated face of a white dwarf donor star inthe system. all of these properties suggest that the signal we have detected isorbital in nature, thus confirming 4u 0513-40 as an ultracompact x-ray binary(ucxb). all four confirmed ucxbs in globular clusters have orbital periodsbelow 30 minutes, whereas almost all ucxbs in the galactic field have orbitalperiods longer than this. this suggests that the dynamical formation processesdominate ucxb production in clusters, producing a different orbital perioddistribution than observed among field ucxbs. based on the likely systemparameters, we show that 4u 0513-40 should be a strong gravitational wavesource and may be detectable by lisa over the course of a multi-year mission.

0905.2507	a relativistic mixing-layer model for jets in low-luminosity radio  galaxies	we present an analytical model for jets in fanaroff &amp; riley class i (fri)radio galaxies, in which an initially laminar, relativistic flow is surroundedby a shear layer. we apply the appropriate conservation laws to constrain thejet parameters, starting the model where the radio emission is observed tobrighten abruptly. we assume that the laminar flow fills the jet there and thatpressure balance with the surroundings is maintained from that point outwards.entrainment continuously injects new material into the jet and forms a shearlayer, which contains material from both the environment and the laminar core.the shear layer expands rapidly with distance until finally the coredisappears, and all of the material is mixed into the shear layer. beyond thispoint, the shear layer expands in a cone and decelerates smoothly. we apply ourmodel to the well-observed fri source 3c31 and show that there is aself-consistent solution. we derive the jet power, together with the variationsof mass flux and and entrainment rate with distance from the nucleus. thepredicted variation of bulk velocity with distance in the outer parts of thejets is in good agreement with model fits to vla observations. our predictionfor the shape of the laminar core can be tested with higher-resolution imaging.

0907.2525	classifying broad absorption line quasars: metrics, issues and a new  catalogue constructed from sdss dr5	we apply a recently developed method for classifying broad absorption linequasars (balqsos) to the latest qso catalogue constructed from data release 5of the sloan digital sky survey. our new hybrid classification scheme combinesthe power of simple metrics, supervised neural networks and visual inspection.in our view the resulting balqso catalogue is both more complete and morerobust than all previous balqso catalogues, containing 3552 sources selectedfrom a parent sample of 28,421 qsos in the redshift range 1.7&lt;z&lt;4.2. thisequates to a raw balqso fraction of 12.5%.  in the process of constructing a robust catalogue, we shed light on the mainproblems encountered when dealing with balqso classification, many of whicharise due to the lack of a proper physical definition of what constitutes abal. this introduces some subjectivity in what is meant by the term balqso, andbecause of this, we also provide all of the meta-data used in constructing ourcatalogue, for every object in the parent qso sample. this makes it easy toquickly isolate and explore sub-samples constructed with different metrics andtechniques. by constructing composite qso spectra from sub-samples classifiedaccording to the meta-data, we show that no single existing metric producesclean and robust balqso classifications. rather, we demonstrate that a varietyof complementary metrics are required at the moment to accomplish this task.along the way, we confirm the finding that balqsos are redder than non-balqsosand that the raw balqso fraction displays an apparent trend withsignal-to-noise, steadily increasing from 9% in low signal-to-noise data, up to15%.

0909.3857	the structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by iphas early a  stars	this study is an investigation of the stellar density profile of the galacticdisc in the anticentre direction. we select over 40,000 early a stars fromiphas photometry in the galactic longitude range 160 &lt; l &lt; 200 close to theequatorial plane (-1 &lt; b &lt; +1). we then compare their observedreddening-corrected apparent magnitude distribution with simulated photometryobtained from parameterised models in order to set constraints on theanticentre stellar density profile. by selecting a stars, we are appraising theproperties of a population only ~100 myrs old. we find the stellar densityprofile of young stars is well fit to an exponential with length scale of (3020\pm 120_{statistical} \pm 180_{systematic}) pc, which is comparable to thatobtained in earlier studies, out to a galactocentric radius of r_t = (13.0 \pm0.5_{statistical} \pm 0.6_{systematic}) kpc. at larger radii the rate ofdecline appears to increase with the scale length dropping to (1200 \pm300_{statistical} \pm 70_{systematic}) pc. this result amounts to a refinementof the conclusions reached in previous studies that the stellar density profileis abruptly truncated. the iphas a star data are not compatible with modelsthat propose a sudden change in metallicity at r_g = 10 kpc.

0910.0954	hard x-ray properties of magnetic cataclysmic variables	hard x-ray surveys have proven remarkably efficient in detecting intermediatepolars and asynchronous polars, two of the rarest type of cataclysmic variable(cv). here we present a global study of hard x-ray selected intermediate polarsand asynchronous polars, focusing particularly on the link between hard x-rayproperties and spin/orbital periods. to this end, we first construct a newsample of these objects by cross-correlating candidate sources detected inintegral/ibis observations against catalogues of known cvs. we find 23cataclysmic variable matches, and also present an additional 9 (of which 3 aredefinite) likely magnetic cataclysmic variables (mcvs) identified by othersthrough optical follow-ups of ibis detections. we also include in our analysishard x-ray observations from swift/bat and suzaku/hxd in order to make ourstudy more complete. we find that most hard x-ray detected mcvs havep_{spin}/p_{orb}&lt;0.1 above the period gap. in this respect we also point outthe very low number of detected systems in any band betweenp_{spin}/p_{orb}=0.3 and p_{spin}/p_{orb}=1 and the apparent peak of thep_{spin}/p_{orb} distribution at about 0.1. the observational features of thep_{spin} - p_{orb} plane are discussed in the context of mcv evolutionscenarios. we also present for the first time evidence for correlations betweenhard x-ray spectral hardness and p_{spin}, p_{orb} and p_{spin}/p_{orb}. anattempt to explain the observed correlations is made in the context of mcvevolution and accretion footprint geometries on the white dwarf surface.

1006.1075	the orbital period of v458 vulpeculae, a post double common-envelope  nova	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of v458 vulpeculae (nova vul2007 no. 1) spread over a period of 15 months starting 301 days after itsdiscovery. our data reveal radial velocity variations in the heii {\lambda}5412and heii {\lambda}4686 emission lines. a period analysis of the radial velocitycurves resulted in a period of 98.09647 \pm 0.00025 min (0.06812255 \pm0.00000017 d) which we identify with the orbital period of the binary system.v458 vul is therefore the planetary nebula central binary star with theshortest period known. we explore the possibility of the system being composedof a relatively massive white dwarf (m1 \gsim 1.0 msun) accreting matter from apost-asymptotic giant branch star which produced the planetary nebula observed.in this scenario, the central binary system therefore underwent twocommon-envelope episodes. a combination of previous photoionisation modellingof the nebular spectra, post-asymptotic giant branch evolutionary tracks andthe orbital period favour a mass of m2 \sim 0.6 msun for the donor star.therefore, the total mass of the system may exceed the chandrasekhar mass,which makes v458 vul a type ia supernova progenitor candidate.

1108.0558	the entrainment-limited evolution of fr ii sources: maximum sizes and a  possible connection to fr is	we construct a simple theoretical model to investigate how entrainmentgradually erodes high-speed fr ii jets. this process is described by embeddinga mixing-layer model developed originally to describe fr i objects in aself-similar model for the lobe structure of classical fr ii sources. followingthe classical fr ii models, we assume that the lobe is dominated by theparticles injected from the central jet. the entrainment produces a boundaryshear layer which acts at the interface between the dense central jet and theless denser surrounding lobe, and the associated erosion of the jet placesinteresting limits on the maximum size of fr ii sources. the model shows thatthis limit depends mainly on the initial bulk velocity of the relativistic jettriggered. the bulk velocities of fr iis suggested by our model are in goodagreement with that obtained from direct pc-scale observations on ordinaryradio galaxies and quasars. finally, we discuss how fr iis may evolve into fris upon reaching their maximum, entrainment-limited sizes.

1202.6333	initial data release of the kepler-int survey	this paper describes the first data release of the kepler-int survey (kis),that covers a 116 deg2 region of the cygnus and lyra constellations. the keplerfield is the target of the most intensive search for transiting planets todate. despite the fact that the kepler mission provides superior time seriesphotometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability, itsfield lacks optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the keplerinstrument necessary for selecting various classes of targets. for this reason,we follow the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the iphasand uvex galactic plane surveys in order to produce a deep optical survey ofthe kepler field. this initial release concerns data taken between may andaugust 2011, using the isaac newton telescope on the island of la palma. fourbroadband filters were used, u, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one, halpha,reaching down to a 10-sigma limit of around 20th mag in the vega system.observations covering around 50 deg2, thus about half of the field, passed ourquality control thresholds and constitute this first data release. we derive aglobal photometric calibration by placing the kis magnitudes as close aspossible to the kepler input catalog (kic) photometry. the initial data releasecatalogue containing around 6 million sources from all the good photometricfields is available for download from the kis webpage, as well as via mast.

1308.5973	a simple disk wind model for broad absorption line quasars	approximately 20% of quasi-stellar objects (qsos) exhibit broad, blue-shiftedabsorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra. such features provide clearevidence for significant outflows from these systems, most likely in the formof accretion disk winds. these winds may represent the "quasar" mode offeedback that is often invoked in galaxy formation/evolution models, and theyare also key to unification scenarios for active galactic nuclei (agn) andqsos. to test these ideas, we construct a simple benchmark model of anequatorial, biconical accretion disk wind in a qso and use a monte carloionization/radiative transfer code to calculate the ultraviolet spectra as afunction of viewing angle. we find that for plausible outflow parameters,sightlines looking directly into the wind cone do produce broad, blue-shiftedabsorption features in the transitions typically seen in broad absorption lineqsos. however, our benchmark model is intrinsically x-ray weak in order toprevent overionization of the outflow, and the wind does not yet producecollisionally excited line emission at the level observed in non-bal qsos. as afirst step towards addressing these shortcomings, we discuss the sensitivity ofour results to changes in the assumed x-ray luminosity and mass-loss rate,mdot(wind). in the context of our adopted geometry, mdot(wind) ~ mdot(acc) isrequired in order to produce significant bal features. the kinetic luminosityand momentum carried by such outflows would be sufficient to providesignificant feedback.

1310.2597	cxogbs~j173620.2--293338: a candidate symbiotic x-ray binary associated  with a bulge carbon star	the galactic bulge survey is a wide but shallow x-ray survey of regions aboveand below the plane in the galactic bulge. it was performed using the chandrax-ray observatory's acis camera. the survey is primarily designed to find andclassify low luminosity x-ray binaries. the combination of the x-ray depth ofthe survey and the accessibility of optical and infrared counterparts makesthis survey ideally suited to identification of new symbiotic x-ray binaries inthe bulge. we consider the specific case of the x-ray source cxogbsj173620.2-293338. it is coincident to within 1 arcsec with a very red star,showing a carbon star spectrum and irregular variability in the opticalgravitational lensing experiment data. we classify the star as a late c-r typecarbon star based on its spectral features, photometric properties, andvariability characteristics, although a low-luminosity c-n type cannot be ruledout. the brightness of the star implies it is located in the bulge, and itsphotometric properties overall are consistent with the bulge carbon starpopulation. given the rarity of carbon stars in the bulge, we estimate theprobability of such a close chance alignment of any galactic bulge surveysource with a carbon star to be &lt;1e-3 suggesting that this is likely to be areal match. if the x-ray source is indeed associated with the carbon star, thenthe x-ray luminosity is around 9e32 erg/s. its characteristics are consistentwith a low luminosity symbiotic x-ray binary, or possibly a low accretion ratewhite dwarf symbiotic.

0803.3548	sdss 1507+02: a halo cataclysmic variable?	we report a photometric and spectroscopic study of the peculiar cataclysmicvariable sdss 1507+52. the star shows very deep eclipses on the 67 minuteorbital period, and those eclipses are easily separable into white-dwarf andhot-spot components. this leads to tight constraints on binary parameters, withm_1=0.83(8) solar masses, m_2=0.057(8) solar masses, r_1=0.0097(9) solar radii,r_2=0.097(4) solar radii, q=0.069(2), and i=83.18(13) degrees. such numberssuggest possible membership among the wz sge stars, a common type of dwarfnova. the spectroscopic behavior (strong and broad h emission, double-peakedand showing a classic rotational disturbance during eclipse) is also typical.but the star's orbital period is shockingly below the "period minimum" ofapproximately 77 min which is characteristic of hydrogen-rich cvs; producingsuch a strange binary will require some tinkering with the theory ofcataclysmic-variable evolution. the proper motion is also remarkably high for astar of its distance, which we estimate from photometry and trigonometricparallax as 230 +- 40 pc. this suggests a transverse velocity of 164 +- 30 km/s- uncomfortably high if the star belongs to a galactic-disk population. thesedifficulties with understanding its evolution and space velocity can be solvedif the star belongs to a galactic-halo population.

1502.01743	the relationship between x-ray luminosity and duty cycle for dwarf novae  and their specific frequency in the inner galaxy	we measure the duty cycles for an existing sample of well observed, nearbydwarf novae using data from aavso, and present a quantitative empiricalrelation between the duty cycle of dwarf novae outbursts and the x-rayluminosity of the system in quiescence. we have found that $\logdc=0.63(\pm0.21)\times(\log l_{x}({\rm erg\,s^{-1}})-31.3)-0.95(\pm0.1)$, wheredc stands for duty cycle. we note that there is intrinsic scatter in thisrelation greater than what is expected from purely statistical errors. usingthe dwarf nova x-ray luminosity functions from \citet{pretorius12} and\citet{byckling10}, we compare this relation to the number of dwarf novae inthe galactic bulge survey which were identified through optical outburstsduring an 8-day long monitoring campaign. we find a specific frequency of x-raybright ($l_{x}&gt;10^{31}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) cataclysmic variables undergoingdwarf novae outbursts in the direction of the galactic bulge of$6.6\pm4.7\times10^{-5}\,m_{\odot}^{-1}$. such a specific frequency would givea solar neighborhood space density of long period cvs of$\rho=5.6\pm3.9\times10^{-6}\,$pc$^{-3}$. we advocate the use of specificfrequency in future work, given that projects like lsst will detect dne welloutside the distance range over which $\rho\approx{\textrm const}$.

1504.05584	calcium-rich gap transients: tidal detonations of white dwarfs?	we hypothesize that at least some of the recently discovered class ofcalcium-rich gap transients are tidal detonation events of white dwarfs (wds)by black holes (bhs) or possibly neutron stars. we show that the properties ofthe calcium-rich gap transients agree well with the predictions of the tidaldetonation model. under the predictions of this model, we use a follow-up x-rayobservation of one of these transients, sn 2012hn, to place weak upper limitson the detonator mass of this system that include all intermediate-mass bhs(imbhs). as these transients are preferentially in the stellar haloes ofgalaxies, we discuss the possibility that these transients are tidaldetonations of wds caused by random flyby encounters with imbhs in dwarfgalaxies or globular clusters. this possibility has been already suggested inthe literature but without connection to the calcium-rich gap transients. inorder for the random flyby cross-section to be high enough, these events wouldhave to be occurring inside these dense stellar associations. however, there isa lack of evidence for imbhs in these systems, and recent observations haveruled out all but the very faintest dwarf galaxies and globular clusters for afew of these transients. another possibility is that these are tidaldetonations caused by three-body interactions, where a wd is perturbed towardthe detonator in isolated multiple star systems. we highlight a number of waysthis could occur, even in lower-mass systems with stellar-mass bhs or neutronstars. finally, we outline several new observational tests of this scenario,which are feasible with current instrumentation.

1505.01158	nuclear star cluster formation in energy-space	in a virialized stellar system, the mean-square velocity is a direct tracerof the energy per unit mass of the system. here, we exploit this to estimateand compare root-mean-square velocities for a large sample of nuclear starclusters and their host (late- or early-type) galaxies. traditionalobservables, such as the radial surface brightness and second-order velocitymoment profiles, are subject to short-term variations due to individualepisodes of matter infall and/or star formation. the total mass, energy andangular momentum, on the other hand, are approximately conserved. thus, thetotal energy and angular momentum more directly probe the formation of galaxiesand their nuclear star clusters, by offering access to more fundamentalproperties of the nuclear cluster-galaxy system than traditional observables.we find that there is a strong correlation, in fact a near equality, betweenthe root-mean-square velocity of a nuclear star cluster and that of its host.thus, the energy per unit mass of a nuclear star cluster is always comparableto that of its host galaxy. we interpret this as evidence that nuclear starclusters do not form independently of their host galaxies, but rather thattheir formation and subsequent evolution are coupled. we discuss how ourresults can potentially be used to offer a clear and observationally testableprediction to distinguish between the different nuclear star cluster formationscenarios, and/or quantify their relative contributions.

1505.06048	searching for nova shells around cataclysmic variables	we present the results of a search for nova shells around 101 cataclysmicvariables (cvs), using halpha images taken with the 4.2-m william herscheltelescope (wht) and the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope photometric halpha surveyof the northern galactic plane (iphas). both telescopes are located on lapalma. we concentrated our wht search on nova-like variables, whilst our iphassearch covered all cvs in the iphas footprint. we found one shell out of the 24nova-like variables we examined. the newly discovered shell is around v1315 aqland has a radius of approx.2.5 arcmin, indicative of a nova eruptionapproximately 120 years ago. this result is consistent with the idea that thehigh mass-transfer rate exhibited by nova-like variables is due to enhancedirradiation of the secondary by the hot white dwarf following a recent novaeruption. the implications of our observations for the lifetime of thenova-like variable phase are discussed. we also examined 4 asynchronous polars,but found no new shells around any of them, so we are unable to confirm that arecent nova eruption is the cause of the asynchronicity in the white dwarfspin. we find tentative evidence of a faint shell around the dwarf nova v1363cyg. in addition, we find evidence for a light echo around the nova v2275 cyg,which erupted in 2001, indicative of an earlier nova eruption approx.300 yearsago, making v2275 cyg a possible recurrent nova.

1506.01400	deep near-ir observations of the globular cluster m4: hunting for brown  dwarfs	we present an analysis of deep hst/wfc3 near-ir (nir) imaging data of theglobular cluster m4. the best-photometry nir colour-magnitude diagram (cmd)clearly shows the main sequence extending towards the expected end of thehydrogen-burning limit and going beyond this point towards fainter sources. thewhite dwarf sequence can be identified. as such, this is the deepest nir cmd ofa globular cluster to date. archival hst optical data were used forproper-motion cleaning of the cmd and for distinguishing the white dwarfs (wds)from brown dwarf (bd) candidates. detection limits in the nir are around f110wapprox 26.5 mag and f160w approx27 mag, and in the optical around f775w approx28 mag. comparing our observed cmds with theoretical models, we conclude thatwe have reached beyond the h-burning limit in our nir cmd and are probably justabove or around this limit in our optical-nir cmds. thus, any faint nir sourcesthat have no optical counterpart are potential bd candidates, since the opticaldata are not deep enough to detect them. we visually inspected the positions ofnir sources which are fainter than the h-burning limit in f110w and for whichthe optical photometry did not return a counterpart. we found in total fivesources for which we did not get an optical measurement. for four of these fivesources, a faint optical counterpart could be visually identified, and an upperoptical magnitude was estimated. based on these upper optical magnitude limits,we conclude that one source is likely a wd, one source could either be a wd orbd candidate, and the remaining two sources agree with being bd candidates. foronly one source no optical counterpart could be detected, which makes thissource a good bd candidate. we conclude that we found in total four good bdcandidates.

1509.02579	deep radio imaging of 47 tuc identifies the peculiar x-ray source x9 as  a new black hole candidate	we report the detection of steady radio emission from the known x-ray sourcex9 in the globular cluster 47 tuc. with a double-peaked c iv emission line inits ultraviolet spectrum providing a clear signature of accretion, this sourcehad been previously classified as a cataclysmic variable. in deep atca imagingfrom 2010 and 2013, we identified a steady radio source at both 5.5 and 9.0ghz, with a radio spectral index (defined as $s_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) of$\alpha=-0.4\pm0.4$. our measured flux density of $42\pm4$ microjy/beam at 5.5ghz implies a radio luminosity ($\nu l_{\nu}$) of 5.8e27 erg/s, significantlyhigher than any previous radio detection of an accreting white dwarf.transitional millisecond pulsars, which have the highest radio-to-x-ray fluxratios among accreting neutron stars (still a factor of a few below accretingblack holes at the same x-ray luminosity), show distinctly different patternsof x-ray and radio variability than x9. when combined with archival x-raymeasurements, our radio detection places 47 tuc x9 very close to theradio/x-ray correlation for accreting black holes, and we explore thepossibility that this source is instead a quiescent stellar-mass black holex-ray binary. the nature of the donor star is uncertain; although theluminosity of the optical counterpart is consistent with a low-mass mainsequence donor star, the mass transfer rate required to produce the highquiescent x-ray luminosity of 1e33 erg/s suggests the system may instead beultracompact, with an orbital period of order 25 minutes. this is the fourthquiescent black hole candidate discovered to date in a galactic globularcluster, and the only one with a confirmed accretion signature from itsoptical/ultraviolet spectrum.

astro-ph;0004329	a self-occulting accretion disk in the sw sex star dw uma	we present the ultraviolet spectrum of the sw sex star and nova-like variabledw uma in an optical low state, as observed with the space telescope imagingspectrograph on board the hubble space telescope (hst). the data are welldescribed by a synthetic white dwarf (wd) spectrum with t_eff = 46,000 +/- 1000k, log g = 7.60 +/- 0.15, v*sin(i) = 370 +/- 100 km/s and z/z_solar = 0.47 +/-0.15. for this combination of t_eff and log g, wd models predict m_wd = 0.48+/- 0.06 m_solar and r_wd = (1.27 +/- 0.18) * 10^9 cm. combining the radiusestimate with the normalization of the spectral fit, we obtain a distanceestimate of d = 830 +/-150 pc.  during our observations, dw uma was approximately 3 magnitudes fainter in vthan in the high state. a comparison of our low-state hst spectrum to ahigh-state spectrum obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer showsthat the former is much bluer and has a higher continuum level shortward of1450 a. since dw uma is an eclipsing system, this suggests that an opticallythick accretion disk rim blocks our view of the wd primary in the high state.if self-occulting accretion disks are common among the sw sex stars, we canaccount for (i) the preference for high-inclination systems within the classand (ii) their v-shaped continuum eclipses. moreover, even though the emissionlines produced by a self-obscured disk are generally still double-peaked, theyare weaker and narrower than those produced by an unobscured disk. this mayallow a secondary line emission mechanism to dominate and produce thesingle-peaked, optical lines that are a distinguishing characteristic of the swsex stars.

astro-ph;0011304	assisted stellar suicide: the wind-driven evolution of the recurrent  nova t pyxidis	we show that the extremely high luminosity of the short-period recurrent novat pyx in quiescence can be understood if this system is a wind-driven supersoftx-ray source (sss). in this scenario, a strong, radiation-induced wind isexcited from the secondary star and accelerates the binary evolution. theaccretion rate is therefore much higher than in an ordinary cataclysmic binaryat the same orbital period, as is the luminosity of the white dwarf primary. inthe steady state, the enhanced luminosity is just sufficient to maintain thewind from the secondary. the accretion rate and luminosity predicted by thewind-driven model for t pyx are in good agreement with the observationalevidence. x-ray observations with chandra or xmm may be able to confirm t pyx'sstatus as a sss.  t pyx's lifetime in the wind-driven state is on the order of a million years.its ultimate fate is not certain, but the system may very well end updestroying itself, either via the complete evaporation of the secondary star,or in a type ia supernova if the white dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar limit.thus either the primary, the secondary, or both may currently be committingassisted stellar suicide.

astro-ph;0209542	the system parameters of dw ursae majoris	we present new constraints on the system parameters of the sw sextantis stardw ursae majoris, based on ultraviolet (uv) eclipse observations with thehubble space telescope. our data were obtained during a low state of thesystem, in which the uv light was dominated by the hot white dwarf (wd)primary. eclipse analysis, using the full roche lobe geometry, allows us to setfirm limits on the masses and radii of the system components and the distancebetween them: 0.67 \leq m_1/m_sun \leq 1.06, 0.008 \leq r_1/r_sun \leq 0.014,m_2/m_sun &gt; 0.16, r_2/r_sun &gt; 0.28 and a/r_sun &gt; 1.05. for q = m_2/m_1 &lt; 1.5the inclination must satisfy i &gt; 71 degrees. using smith &amp; dhillon'smass-period relation for cv secondaries, our estimates for the systemparameters become m_1/m_sun = 0.77 \pm 0.07, r_1/r_sun = 0.012 \pm 0.001,m_2/m_sun = 0.30 \pm 0.10, r_2/r_sun = 0.34 \pm 0.04, q =0.39 \pm 0.12, i = 82\pm 4 degrees and a/r_sun = 1.14 \pm 0.06. we have also estimated the spectraltype of the secondary, m3.5 \pm 1.0, and distance to the system, d =930 \pm 160pc, from time-resolved i- and k-band photometry. finally, we have repeatedknigge et al.'s wd model atmosphere fit to the low-state uv spectrum of dw umain order to account for the higher surface gravity indicated by our eclipseanalysis. in this way we obtained a second estimate for the distance, d = 590\pm 100 pc, which allows us to obtain a second estimate for the spectral typeof the secondary, m7 \pm 2.0. we conclude that the true value for the distanceand spectral type will probably be in between the values obtained by the twomethods.

astro-ph;0510331	detection of a period decrease in nn ser with ultracam: evidence for  strong magnetic braking or an unseen companion?	we present results of high time resolution photometry of the eclipsingpre-cataclysmic variable nn ser. we observed 13 primary eclipses of nn serusing the high-speed ccd camera ultracam and derived times of mid-eclipse, fromfitting of light curve models, with uncertainties as low as 0.06 s. theobserved rates of period change appear difficult to reconcile with any modelsof orbital period change. if the observed period change reflects an angularmomentum loss, the average loss rate is consistent with the loss rates (viamagnetic stellar wind braking) used in standard models of close binaryevolution, which were derived from observations of much more massive coolstars. observations of low-mass stars such as nn ser's secondary predict ratesof ~100 times lower than we observe. we show that magnetic activity-drivenchanges in the quadrupole moment of the secondary star (applegate, 1992) failto explain the period change by an order of magnitude on energetic grounds, butthat a light travel time effect caused by the presence of a third body in along (~ decades) orbit around the binary could account for the observed changesin the timings of nn ser's mid-eclipses. we conclude that we have eitherobserved a genuine angular momentum loss for nn ser, in which case ourobservations pose serious difficulties for the theory of close binaryevolution, or we have detected a previously unseen low-mass companion to thebinary.
