0902.4383	on the origin of the scatter around the fundamental plane: correlations  with stellar population parameters	we present a fundamental plane (fp) analysis of 141 early-type galaxies inthe shapley supercluster at z=0.049 based on spectroscopy from the aaomegaspectrograph at the aat and photometry from the wfi on the eso/mpi 2.2mtelescope. the key feature of the survey is its coverage of low-mass galaxiesdown to sigma_0~50km/s. we obtain a best-fitting fp relation log r_e=1.06 logsigma_0 - 0.82 log &lt; i &gt;_e + cst in the r band. the shallow exponent of sigma_0is a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions. weinvestigate the origin of the intrinsic fp scatter, using estimates of age,metallicity and alpha/fe. we find that the fp residuals anti-correlate(&gt;3sigma) with the mean stellar age in agreement with previous work. however, astronger (&gt;4sigma) correlation with alpha/fe is also found. these correlationsindicate that galaxies with effective radii smaller than those predicted by thefp have stellar populations systematically older and with alpha over-abundanceslarger than average, for their sigma_0. including alpha/fe as a fourthparameter in the fp, the total scatter decreases from 0.088 dex to 0.075 dexand the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 dex to 0.049 dex.thus, variations in alpha/fe account for &gt;&gt; 30% of the total variance aroundthe fp, and &gt;&gt; 50% of the estimated intrinsic variance. this result indicatesthat the distribution of galaxies around the fp are tightly related to theenrichment, and hence to the timescale of star-formation. our results appear tobe consistent with the merger hypothesis for the formation of ellipticals whichpredicts that a significant fraction of the scatter is due to variations in theimportance of dissipation in forming merger remnants of a given mass.

0908.3003	locuss: the mid-infrared butcher-oemler effect	we study the mid-infrared (mir) properties of galaxies in 30 massive galaxyclusters at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.40, using panoramic spitzer/mips 24micron and nir data.this is the largest sample of clusters to date with mir data covering not onlythe cluster cores, but extending into the infall regions. we revisit thebutcher-oemler effect, measuring the fraction of massive infrared-luminousgalaxies (k&lt;k*+1.5, l_ir&gt;5x10^10l_sun) within r_200, finding a steady increasein the fraction with redshift from ~3% at z=0.02 to ~10% by z=0.30, and an rmscluster-to-cluster scatter about this trend of 0.03. the best-fit redshiftevolution model is of the form f_sf ~ (1+z)^5.7, which is stronger redshiftevolution than that of l*_ir in both clusters and the field. we find that,statistically, this excess is associated with galaxies found at largecluster-centric radii, implying that the mir butcher-oemler effect can beexplained by a combination of both the global decline in star-formation in theuniverse since z~1 and enhanced star formation in the infall regions ofclusters at intermediate redshifts. this picture is supported by a simpleinfall model based on the millennium simulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs,whereby star-formation in infalling galaxies is instantaneously quenched upontheir first passage through the cluster, in that the observed radial trends off_sf trace those inferred from the simulations. we also find that f_sf does notdepend on simple indicators of the dynamical state of clusters, including theoffset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the peak of the x-ray emission.this is consistent with the picture described above in that most newstar-formation in clusters occurs in the infall regions, and is thus notsensitive to the details of cluster-cluster mergers in the core regions.

0707.1262	the different physical mechanisms that drive the star-formation  histories of giant and dwarf galaxies	we present an analysis of star-formation and nuclear activity in galaxies asa function of both luminosity and environment in the sdss dr4 dataset. using asample of 27753 galaxies at 0.005&lt;z&lt;0.037 that is &gt;90% complete to mr=-18.0 wefind that the ew(ha) distribution is strongly bimodal, allowing galaxies to berobustly separated into passive and star-forming populations about a valueew(ha)=2a. in high-density regions ~70% of galaxies are passive independent ofluminosity. in the rarefied field however, the fraction of passively-evolvinggalaxies is a strong function of luminosity, dropping from ~50% for mr&lt;-21 tozero by mr~-18. indeed for the lowest luminosity range covered (-18&lt;mr&lt;-16)none of the ~600 galaxies in the lowest density quartile are passive. the fewpassively-evolving dwarf galaxies in field regions appear as satellites tobright (~l*) galaxies. the fraction of galaxies with optical agn signaturesdecreases steadily from ~50% at mr~-21 to ~0% by mr~-18 closely mirroring theluminosity-dependence of the passive galaxy fraction in low-densityenvironments. this result reflects the increasing importance of agn feedbackwith galaxy mass for their evolution, such that the star-formation histories ofmassive galaxies are primarily determined by their past merger history. incontrast, the complete absence of passively-evolving dwarf galaxies more than~2 virial radii from the nearest massive halo (i.e. cluster, group or massivegalaxy) indicates that internal processes, such as merging, agn feedback or gasconsumption through star-formation, are not responsible for terminatingstar-formation in dwarf galaxies. instead the evolution of dwarf galaxies isprimarily driven by the mass of their host halo, probably through the combinedeffects of tidal forces and ram-pressure stripping.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0910.3877	access: nir luminosity function and stellar mass function of galaxies in  the shapley supercluster environment	we present the nir luminosity (lf) and stellar mass functions (smf) ofgalaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster at z=0.048, based on newk-band observations in conjunction with b- and r-band photometry and asubsample of ~650 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed supercluster members,allowing to investigate the galaxies down to m_k^*+6 and m=10^8.75 m_sun. forthe 3 deg^2 field the k-band lf is described by a schechter function withm_k^*=-24.96+-0.10 and \alpha=-1.42+-0.03. we investigate the effect ofenvironment by deriving the lf in three regions selected according to the localgalaxy density, and observe a significant increase in the faint-end slope goingfrom the high- (\alpha=-1.33) to the low-density (\alpha=-1.49) environments.the smf is fitted well by a schechter function with log_10(m^*)=11.16+-0.04 and\alpha=-1.20+-0.02. the smf of supercluster galaxies is also characterised byan excess of massive galaxies that are associated to the cluster bcgs. whilethe value of m* depends on environment the slope of the galaxy smf does notvary with the environment. by comparing our findings with cosmologicalsimulations, we conclude that the environmental dependences of the lf are notprimary due to variations in the merging histories, but to processes which arenot treated in the semi-analytical models, such as tidal stripping orharassment. in field regions the smf shows a sharp upturn below m=10^9 m_sun,close to our mass limit, suggesting that the upturns seen in our k-band lfs,but not in the smf, are due to this dwarf population. the environmentalvariations seen in the faint-end of the k-band lf suggests that dwarf galaxies,which are easier to strip than their more massive counterparts, are affected bytidal/gas stripping upon entering the supercluster.

0707.2361	the sdss-galex viewpoint of the truncated red sequence in field  environments at z~0	we combine galex near-uv photometry with a volume-limited sample of local(0.005&lt;z&lt;0.037) sdss dr4 galaxies to examine the composition and theenvironmental dependencies of the optical and uv-optical colour-magnitude (c-m)diagrams. we find that ~30% of red sequence galaxies in the optical c-m diagramshow signs of ongoing star-formation from their spectra having ew(halpha)&gt;2a.this contamination is greatest at faint magnitudes (mr&gt;-19) and in fieldregions where as many as three-quarters of red sequence galaxies arestar-forming, and as such has important consequences for following the build-upof the red sequence. we find that the nuv-r colour instead allows a much morerobust separation of passively-evolving and star-forming galaxies, which allowsthe build-up of the uv-selected red sequence with redshift and environment tobe directly interpreted in terms of the assembly of stellar mass inpassively-evolving galaxies. we find that in isolated field regions the numberdensity of uv-optical red sequence galaxies declines rapidly at magnitudesfainter than mr~-19 and appears completely truncated at mr~-18. this confirmsthe findings of haines et al. (2007) that no passively-evolving dwarf galaxiesare found more than two virial radii from a massive halo, whether that be agroup, cluster or massive galaxy. these results support the downsizing paradigmwhereby the red sequence is assembled from the top down, being already largelyin place at the bright end by z~1, and the faint end filled in at later epochsin clusters and groups through environment-related processes such asram-pressure stripping or galaxy harassment.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1006.5001	galaxy evolution as a function of environment and luminosity	we present an analysis of star formation and nuclear activity of about 28000galaxies in a volume-limited sample taken from sdss dr4 low-redshift catalogue(lrc) taken from the new york university value added galaxy catalogue(nyu-vagc) of blanton et al. 2005, with 0.005&lt;z&lt;0.037, ~90\% complete tom_r=-18.0. we find that in high-density regions ~70 per cent of galaxies arepassively evolving independent of luminosity. in the rarefied field, however,the fraction of passively evolving galaxies is a strong function of luminosity,dropping from 50 per cent for mr &lt;~ -21 to zero by mr ~ -18. moreover the fewpassively evolving dwarf galaxies in field regions appear as satellites tobright (&gt;~ l*) galaxies. moreover the fraction of galaxies with the opticalsignatures of an active galactic nucleus (agn) decreases steadily from ~50\% atmr~-21 to ~0 per cent by mr~-18 closely mirroring the luminosity dependence ofthe passive galaxy fraction in low-density environments (see fig. 1 continuouslines). this result reflects the increasing importance of agn feedback withgalaxy mass for their evolution, such that the star formation histories ofmassive galaxies are primarily determined by their past merger history.

1012.0449	uv-ir luminosity functions and stellar mass functions of galaxies in the  shapley supercluster core	we present a panchromatic study of luminosity functions (lfs) and stellarmass functions (smfs) of galaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster atz=0.048, in order to investigate how the dense environment affects the galaxyproperties, such as star formation (sf) or stellar masses. we find that whilefaint-end slopes of optical and nir lfs steepen with decreasing density, noenvironment effect is found in the slope of the smfs. this suggests thatmechanisms transforming galaxies in different environments are mainly relatedto the quench of sf rather than to mass-loss. the near-uv (nuv) and far-uv(fuv) lfs obtained have steeper faint-end slopes than the local fieldpopulation, while the 24$\mu$m and 70$\mu$m galaxy lfs for the shapleysupercluster have shapes fully consistent with those obtained for the localfield galaxy population. this apparent lack of environmental dependence for theinfrared (ir) lfs suggests that the bulk of the star-forming galaxies that makeup the observed cluster ir lf have been recently accreted from the field andhave yet to have their sf activity significantly affected by the clusterenvironment.

1107.3577	access iv: the quenching of star formation in a cluster population of  dusty s0s	we present an analysis of the mid-infrared (mir) colours of 165 70um-detectedgalaxies in the shapley supercluster core (ssc) at z=0.048 using panoramicspitzer/mips 24 and 70um imaging. while the bulk of galaxies show f70/f24colours typical of local star-forming galaxies, we identify a significantsub-population of 23 70micron-excess galaxies, whose mir colours (f70/f24&gt;25)are much redder and cannot be reproduced by any of the standard model infraredseds. these galaxies are found to be strongly concentrated towards the cores ofthe five clusters that make up the ssc, and also appear rare among local fieldgalaxies, confirming them as a cluster-specific phenomenon. their opticalspectra and lack of significant uv emission imply little or no ongoing starformation, while fits to their panchromatic seds require the far-ir emission tocome mostly from a diffuse dust component heated by the general interstellarradiation field rather than ongoing star formation. most of these70micron-excess galaxies are identified as ~l* s0s with smooth profiles. wefind that almost every cluster galaxy in the process of star-formationquenching is already either an s0 or sa, while we find no passive galaxies ofclass sb or later. hence the formation of passive early-type galaxies incluster cores must involve the prior morphological transformation of late-typespirals into sa/s0s, perhaps via pre-processing or the impact of cluster tidalfields, before a subsequent quenching of star formation once the lenticularencounters the dense environment of the cluster core. in the cases of manycluster s0s, this phase of star-formation quenching is characterised by anexcess of 70um emission, indicating that the cold dust content is declining ata slower rate than star formation.

1307.1135	locuss: the steady decline and slow quenching of star formation in  cluster galaxies over the last four billion years	we present an analysis of the levels and evolution of star formation activityin a representative sample of 30 massive galaxy clusters at 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.30 fromthe local cluster substructure survey (locuss), combining wide-field spitzer24um data with extensive spectroscopy of cluster members. the specific-sfrs ofmassive (m&gt;10^10 m_sun) star-forming cluster galaxies within r200 are found tobe systematically 28% lower than their counterparts in the field at fixedstellar mass and redshift, a difference significant at the 8.7-sigma level.this is the unambiguous signature of star formation in most (and possibly all)massive star-forming galaxies being slowly quenched upon accretion into massiveclusters, their sfrs declining exponentially on quenching time-scales in therange 0.7-2.0 gyr. we measure the mid-infrared butcher-oemler effect over theredshift range 0.0-0.4, finding rapid evolution in the fraction (f_sf) ofmassive (m_k&lt;-23.1) cluster galaxies within r200 with sfrs&gt;3m_sun/yr, of theform f_sf (1+z)^7.6. we dissect the origins of the butcher-oemler effect,revealing it to be due to the combination of a ~3x decline in the meanspecific-sfrs of star-forming cluster galaxies since z~0.3 with a ~1.5xdecrease in number density. two-thirds of this reduction in the specific-sfrsof star-forming cluster galaxies is due to the steady cosmic decline in thespecific-sfrs among those field galaxies accreted into the clusters. theremaining one-third reflects an accelerated decline in the star formationactivity of galaxies within clusters. the slow quenching of star-formation incluster galaxies is consistent with a gradual shut down of star formation ininfalling spiral galaxies as they interact with the intra-cluster medium viaram-pressure stripping or starvation mechanisms. we find no evidence for thebuild-up of cluster s0 bulges via major nuclear star-burst episodes.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

astro-ph;0112040	optical and near-infrared structural properties of cluster galaxies at  $z \sim 0.3$	structural parameters (half-light radius $r_e$, mean effective surfacebrightness $&lt;\mu&gt;_e$, and sersic index n) are derived for a sample of galaxiesin the rich cluster ac 118 at z=0.31: so far the largest (n=93) sample ofgalaxies at intermediate-redshift with structural parameters measured in thenear-infrared. the parameters are obtained in two optical wavebands (v and r)and in the k-band. the distributions of $r_e$ at z=0.31 match those for thecoma cluster both in the optical and in the nir. the similarity of the twodistributions proves that the galaxies at the bright end of the luminosityfunction did not significantly change their sizes since $z\sim0.3$ to thepresent epoch. the ratio of the optical to the nir half-light radius shows amarked trend with the sersic index n. in galaxies with $n\gtrsim4$ (typicalbright ellipticals) $r_{e,nir}\sim 0.6 r_{e,opt}$, while the average ratio is0.8 for galaxies with lower n (typical disk systems). moreover, the nir sersicindex is systematically larger than in the optical for $n\lesssim4$. theseresults, translated into optical and optical-nir color gradients, imply thatthe optical color gradients at $z\sim$0.3 are similar to those of nearbygalaxies. the optical-nir color gradients are larger, ranging from -0.73mag/dex for $n\lesssim4$ to -0.35 mag/dex for $n\gtrsim4$. we discuss theseresults in terms of 'pure age' and 'pure metallicity' gradient models. the lackof any major change in $r_{e,nir}$ since $z\sim0.3$ suggests that merginginvolving bright galaxies did not play a significant role in the last $\sim$4.4gyr.

astro-ph;0206403	age, metallicity and star formation history of cluster galaxies at z~0.3  f	we investigate the color-magnitude distribution in the rich cluster ac 118 atz=0.31. the sample is selected by the photometric redshift technique, allowingto study a wide range of properties of stellar populations, and is complete inthe k-band, allowing to study these properties up to a given galaxy mass. weuse galaxy templates based on population synthesis models to translate thephysical properties of the stellar populations - formation epoch, time-scale ofstar formation, and metallicity - into observed magnitudes and colors. in thisway we show that a sharp luminosity-metallicity relation is inferred withoutany assumption on the galaxy formation scenario (either monolithic orhierarchical). our data exclude significant differences in star formationhistories along the color-magnitude relation, and therefore confirm a puremetallicity interpretation for its origin, with an early (z~5) formation epochfor the bulk of stellar populations. the dispersion in the color-magnitudediagram implies that fainter galaxies in our sample (k~18) ceased to form starsas late as z~0.5, in agreement with the picture that these galaxies wererecently accreted into the cluster environment. the trend with redshift of thetotal stellar mass shows that half of the luminous mass in ac 118 was alreadyformed at $z~2, but also that 20% of the stars formed at z&lt;1.

astro-ph;0211478	evolution of uv -- nir structural properties of cluster galaxies	we study the structure and the internal colour gradients of cluster galaxiesfrom uv to nir restframe, in the redshift range z=0.21-0.64. structuralparameters (half light radius r_e, mean surface brightness mu_e and sersicindex n) are derived. this data set constitutes the first large (n ~ 270)sample of cluster galaxies whose internal structure in uv, optical (opt) andnir (u-, v- and h-band restframe) can be investigated up to a look-back time of~6 gyr (omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7 and h_0=70 km/s/mpc). galaxies areclassified as spheroids or disks according to the shape of the light profile,and the evolution of the two populations are investigated separately. onaverage, both spheroids and disks are more concentrated at longer wavelengths:the galaxy sizes become smaller from uv to nir, while sersic indices increase.this trend shows an evolution in disks, where the mean ratio of optical to nirsersic indices decreases from z=0.31 to z=0.64. colour gradients are on averagenegative at all redshifts and are stronger in disks than in spheroids.  colour gradients and central colours are compared with models of metallicity,age, and dust extinction gradients. metallicity turns out to be the primarydriver of colour gradients in spheroids, the age gradient being constrained tobe smaller than ~25%. for disks, two kinds of models fit the present data: (i)age gradients (in the range [30,50]%) with significant dust extinction, and(ii) `pure' dust models, in which the gradients of colour excess are a factorof two higher in eis 0048 than in the other clusters. since colour gradients ofdisks seem not to correlate significantly with inclination, we argue that agegradient models could represent a more likely explanation of the present data,in agreement with what expected on the basis of hierarchical merging scenarios.

astro-ph;0212294	on the invariant distribution of galaxies in the re--mie plane out to z  = 0.64	we study the evolution of the relation between half-light (effective) radius,r_e, and mean surface brightness, mi_e, known as kormendy relation, out toredshift z=0.64 in v-band restframe on the basis of a large sample ofspheroidal galaxies (n=228) belonging to three clusters of galaxies. thepresent sample constitutes the largest data set for which the kormendy relationis investigated up to a look-back time of 6 gyr (h_0= 70 km/s/mpc, omega_m=0.3,omega_lambda=0.7). a new fitting procedure, which suitably accounts forselection criteria effects, allows for the first time to study the trend of theslope (beta) and of the intrinsic dispersion (sigma_mi_e) of the kormendyrelation, and the properties of the whole distribution in the r_e -- mi_e,plane as a function of look-back time. the slope beta of the relation does notchange from z=0.64 to the present epoch: beta=2.92+/-0.08, implying a tightconstraint of 18--28% on the variation of the stellar formation epoch along thesequence of spheroidal galaxies per decade of radius. the intrinsic dispersionof the relation, sigma_i_&lt;mi&gt;_e=0.40+/-0.03, does not vary with redshift andthe distribution of galaxy sizes as well as the distribution in the plane ofthe effective parameters do not vary among the clusters, as proven by thekolmogorov--smirnov tests. we conclude that, whatever the mechanism drivinggalaxy evolution is, it does not affect significantly the properties of brightgalaxies in the log(r_e) -- mi_e, plane at least since z=0.64. the evolution ofthe zeropoint of the kormendy relation is fully explained by the cosmologicaldimming in an expanding universe plus the passive luminosity evolution ofstellar populations with high formation redshift (z_f&gt;2).

astro-ph;0307482	probing galaxy evolution through the internal colour gradients, the  kormendy relations and the photometric plane of cluster galaxies at z~0.2	we present a detailed analysis of the photometric properties of galaxies inthe cluster \a2163b at redshift z~0.2. r-, i- and k-band structural parameters,(half light radius r_e, mean surface brightness &lt;mi&gt;_e within r_e and sersicindex n) are derived for n~60 galaxies, and are used to study their internalcolour gradients. for the first time, we use the slopes of optical-nir kormendyrelations to study colour gradients as a function of galaxy size, and we derivethe photometric plane at z~0.2 in the k band. colour gradients are negligibleat optical wavelengths, and are negative in the optical-nir, implying ametallicity gradient in galaxies of ~0.2 dex per radial decade. the analysis ofthe kormendy relation suggests that its slope increases from the optical to thenir, implying that colour gradients do not vary or even do become less steep inmore massive galaxies. such a result is not simply accomodated within amonolithic collapse scenario, while it can be well understood within ahierarchical merging framework. finally, we derive the first nir photometricplane at z~0.2, accounting for both the correlations on the measurementuncertainties and the selection effects. the photometric plane at z~0.2 isconsistent with that at z~0, with an intrinsic scatter significantly smallerthan the kormendy relation but larger than the fundamental plane.

astro-ph;0501508	new insights into the structure of early-type galaxies: the photometric  plane at z~0.3	we study the photometric plane (php), namely the relation between theeffective radius re, the mean surface brightness within that radius &lt;mi&gt;e, andthe sersic index n, in optical (r and i) and near-infrared (k) bands for alarge sample of early-type galaxies (etgs) in the rich cluster ms1008-1224 atz=0.306. the php relation has an intrinsic dispersion of ~32% in re, and turnsout to be independent of waveband. this result is consistent with the fact thatinternal colour gradients of etgs can have only a mild dependence on galaxyluminosity (mass). there is no evidence for a significant curvature in the php.we show that this can be explained if this relation origins from a systematicvariation of the specific entropy of etgs along the galaxy sequence, as wassuggested from previous works. the intrinsic scatter of the php issignificantly smaller than for other purely photometric relations, such as thekormendy relation and the photometric fundamental plane, which is constructedby using colours in place of velocity dispersions. the scatter does not dependon the waveband and the residuals about the plane do not correlate withresiduals of the colour-magnitude relation. finally, we compare thecoefficients of the php at z~0.3 with those of etgs at z~0, showing that thephp is a valuable tool to constrain the luminosity evolution of etgs withredshift. the slopes of the php do not change significantly with redshift,while the zero-point is consistent with cosmological dimming of the surfacebrightness in an expanding universe plus the passive fading of galaxy stellarpopulations with a high formation redshift (z_f &gt;1-2).

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0606060	the vimos vlt deep survey: the faint type-1 agn sample	we present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (agn) sample extracted from thevimos vlt deep survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 squaredegree. this sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphologicalor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line agn (blagn) spectra withredshift up to 5. our data are divided into a wide (iab &lt; 22.5) and a deep (iab&lt; 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. because of its depthand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the populationof faint type-1 agn. our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 blagn per squaredegree with iab &lt; 24) is significantly higher than that of any other opticallyselected sample of blagn with spectroscopic confirmation. by applying amorphological and color analysis to our agn sample we find that: (1)~23% of theagn brighter than iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentageincreases to ~42% for those with z &lt; 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of ourblagn are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versusg'-r' color-color diagram. this leads us to the conclusion that classicaloptical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes(iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can missmiss up to ~35% of the agn population. finally, we present a composite spectrumof our sample of objects. while the continuum shape is very similar to that ofthe sdss composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda &gt;3000 a. we interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission ofthe host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled byour survey.

astro-ph;0606152	shapley optical survey ii: the effect of environment on the  colour-magnitude relation and galaxy colours	we present an analysis of the effects of environment on the photometricproperties of galaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster at z=0.05, oneof the most massive structures in the local universe. the shapley opticalsurvey (sos) comprises archive wfi optical imaging of a 2.0 deg^2 regioncontaining the rich clusters a3556, a3558 and a3562 which demonstrate a highlycomplex dynamical situation including ongoing cluster mergers. the b-r/rcolour-magnitude relation has an intrinsic dispersion of 0.045 mag and is0.015\pm0.005 mag redder in the highest-density regions, indicative of the redsequence galaxy population being 500 myr older in the cluster cores thantowards the virial radius. the b-r colours of galaxies are dependent on theirenvironment, whereas their luminosities are independent of the local density,except for the very brightest galaxies (m_r&lt;-22). the global colours of faint(&gt;m*+2) galaxies change from the cluster cores where ~90% of galaxies lie alongthe cluster red sequence to the virial radius, where the fraction has droppedto just ~20%. this suggests that processes related to the superclusterenvironment are responsible for transforming faint galaxies, rather than galaxymerging, which should be infrequent in any of the regions studied here. thelargest concentrations of faint blue galaxies are found between the clusters,coincident with regions containing high fractions of ~l* galaxies with radioemission indicating starbursts. their location suggests star-formationtriggered by cluster mergers, in particular the merger of a3562 and the poorcluster sc1329-313, although they may also represent recent arrivals in thesupercluster core complex.

astro-ph;0606521	the different environmental dependencies of star-formation for giant and  dwarf galaxies	we examine the origins of the bimodality observed in the global properties ofgalaxies around a stellar mass of 3x10^10 m_sun by comparing the environmentaldependencies of star-formation for the giant and dwarf galaxy populations. thesloan digital sky survey dr4 spectroscopic dataset is used to produce a sampleof galaxies in the vicinity of the supercluster centered on the cluster a2199at z=0.03 that is ~90% complete to a magnitude limit of m*+3.3. from these wemeasure global trends with environment for both giant (m_r&lt;-20 mag) and dwarf(-19&lt;m_r&lt;-17.8 mag) subsamples using the luminosity-weighted mean stellar ageand h_alpha emission as independent measures of star-formation history. thefraction of giant galaxies classed as old (t&gt;7 gyr) or passive (ew[h_alpha]&lt;4a) falls gradually from ~80% in the cluster cores to ~40% in field regionsbeyond 3-4 r_virial, as found in previous studies. in contrast, we find thatthe dwarf galaxy population shows a sharp transition at ~1 r_virial, from beingpredominantly old/passive within the cluster, to outside where virtually allgalaxies are forming stars and old/passive galaxies are only found assatellites to more massive galaxies. these results imply fundamentaldifferences in the evolution of giant and dwarf galaxies: whereas thestar-formation histories of giant galaxies are determined primarily by theirmerger history, star-formation in dwarf galaxies is much more resilient to theeffects of major mergers. instead dwarf galaxies become passive only once theybecome satellites within a more massive halo, by losing their halo gasreservoir to the host halo, or through other environment-related processes suchas galaxy harassment and/or ram-pressure stripping.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0611264	the environmental dependencies of star-formation and the origin of the  bimodality in galaxy properties	we examine the origins of the bimodality observed in the global properties ofgalaxies by comparing the environmental dependencies of star-formation forgiant and dwarf galaxy populations. using sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr4spectroscopic data to create a volume-limited sample complete to m*+3, we findthat the environmental dependences of giant and dwarf galaxies are quitedifferent, implying fundamental differences in their evolution. whereas thestar-formation histories of giant galaxies are determined primarily by theirmerger history, resulting in passively-evolving giant galaxies being found inall environments, we show that this is not the case for dwarf galaxies. inparticular, we find that old or passive dwarf galaxies are only found assatellites within massive halos (clusters, groups or giant galaxies), with nonein the lowest density regions. this implies that star-formation in dwarfgalaxies must be much more resilient to the effects of mergers, and that theevolution of dwarf galaxies is primarily driven by the mass of their host halo,through effects such as suffocation, ram-pressure stripping or galaxyharassment.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.
