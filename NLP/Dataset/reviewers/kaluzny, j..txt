0707.0207	variable stars in the field of the old open cluster melotte 66	we report the results of photometric monitoring of the melotte 66 field inbvi filters. ten variables were identified with nine being new discoveries. thesample includes eight eclipsing binaries of which four are w uma type stars,one star is a candidate blue straggler. all four contact binaries are likelymembers of the cluster based on their estimated distances. ten blue stars withu-b&lt;-0.3 were detected inside a 14.8 x 22.8 arcmin^2 field centred on thecluster. time series photometry for 7 of them showed no evidence for anyvariability. the brightest object in the sample of blue stars is a promisingcandidate for a hot subdwarf belonging to the cluster. we show that theanomalously wide main sequence of the cluster, reported in some earlierstudies, results from a combination of two effects: variable reddening occuringacross the cluster field and the presence of a rich population of binary starsin the cluster itself. the density profile of the cluster field is derived andthe total number of member stars with 16&lt;v&lt;21 or 2.8&lt;m_{v}&lt;7.8 is estimatedconservatively at about 1100.

0910.2543	a new lower main sequence eclipsing binary with detached components	we present an analysis of ngc2204-s892 -- a new detached eclipsing binarycomposed of two late k dwarfs. based on three photometric campaigns launched in2008 we obtained 5 light curves (3 in v, 1 in b and 1 in i), and derived anorbital period of 0.451780+-0.000001 d. we also obtained 20 vlt/uves spectra,enabling accurate radial velocity measurements. the derived masses and radii ofthe components (m1 = 0.733 +-0.005 msun and r1 = 0.72 +-0.01 rsun; m2 = 0.662+-0.005 msun and r2 = 0.68 \+-0.02 rsun) are consistent with the empiricalmass-radius relationship established recently for lower main sequence stars inbinary systems; in particular we find that both stars are oversized compared totheoretical models. ngc2204-s892 is very active: both components show variableemission in halpha and hbeta and are heavily spotted, causing the light curveto show appreciable changes on a timescale of weeks. our results add to theincreasing evidence that the observed inflation of the radii of k and m starsis related to high levels of magnetic activity.

1206.2862	orbital and physical parameters of eclipsing binaries from the asas  catalogue - iv. a 0.61 + 0.45 m_sun binary in a multiple system	we present the orbital and physical parameters of a newly discovered low-massdetached eclipsing binary from the all-sky automated survey (asas) database:asas j011328-3821.1 a - a member of a visual binary system with the secondarycomponent separated by about 1.4 seconds of arc. the radial velocities werecalculated from the high-resolution spectra obtained with the 1.9-mradcliffe/giraffe, 3.9-m aat/ucles and 3.0-m shane/hamspectelescopes/spectrographs on the basis of the todcor technique and positions ofh_alpha emission lines. for the analysis we used v and i band photometryobtained with the 1.0-m elizabeth and robotic 0.41-m prompt telescopes,supplemented with the publicly available asas light curve of the system.  we found that asas j011328-3821.1 a is composed of two late-type dwarfshaving masses of m_1 = 0.612 +/- 0.030 m_sun, m_2 = 0.445 +/- 0.019 m_sun andradii of r_1 = 0.596 +/- 0.020 r_sun, r_2 = 0.445 +/- 0.024 r_sun, both show asubstantial level of activity, which manifests in strong h_alpha and h_betaemission and the presence of cool spots. the influence of the third light onthe eclipsing pair properties was also evaluated and the photometric propertiesof the component b were derived. comparison with several popular stellarevolution models shows that the system is on its main sequence evolution stageand probably is more metal rich than the sun. we also found several clues whichsuggest that the component b itself is a binary composed of two nearlyidentical ~0.5 m_sun stars.

0704.3507	the clusters ages experiment (case). i. v209 omega cen - an eclipsing  post-common envelope binary in the globular cluster omega cen	we use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsingbinary v209 omega cen to derive the masses, radii, and luminosities of thecomponent stars. the system exhibits total eclipses and, based on the measuredsystemic velocity and the derived distance, is a member of the globular clusteromega cen. we obtain 0.945 +/- 0.043 msun, 0.983 +/- 0.015 rsun and 6.68 +/-0.88 lsun for the cooler, but larger and more luminous primary component. thesecondary component has 0.144 +/- 0.008 msun, 0.425 +/- 0.008 rsun and 2.26 +/-0.28 lsun. the effective temperatures are estimated at 9370 k for the primaryand at 10866 k for the secondary. on the color-magnitude diagram of thecluster, the primary component occupies a position between the tip of the bluestraggler region and the extended horizontal branch while the secondarycomponent is located close to the red border of the area occupied by hotsubdwarfs. however, its radius is too large and its effective temperature istoo low for it to be an sdb star. we propose a scenario leading to theformation of a system with such unusual properties with the primary component``re-born'' from a former white dwarf which accreted a new envelope throughmass transfer from its companion. the secondary star has lost most of itsenvelope while starting its ascent onto the sub-giant branch. it failed toignite helium in its core and is currently powered by a hydrogen burning shell.

1301.2946	the cluster ages experiment (case). v. analysis of three eclipsing  binaries in the globular cluster m4	we use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing binariesv65, v66 and v69 in the field of the globular cluster m4 to derive masses,radii, and luminosities of their components. the orbital periods of thesesystems are 2.29, 8.11 and 48.19 d, respectively. the measured masses of theprimary and secondary components (mp and ms) are 0.8035+-0.0086 and0.6050+-0.0044 msun for v65, 0.7842+-0.0045 and 0.7443+-0.0042 msun for v66,and 0.7665+-0.0053 and 0.7278+-0.0048 msun for v69. the measured radii (rp andrs) are 1.147+_0.010 and 0.6110+-0.0092 rsun for v66, 0.9347+_0.0048 and0.8298+-0.0053 rsun for v66, and 0.8655+-0.0097 and 0.8074+-0.0080 rsun forv69. the orbits of v65 and v66 are circular, whereas that of v69 has aneccentricity of 0.38. based on systemic velocities and relative proper motions,we show that all the three systems are members of the cluster. we find that thedistance to m4 is 1.82+-0.04 kpc - in good agreement with recent estimatesbased on entirely different methods. we compare the absolute parameters of v66and v69 with two sets of theoretical isochrones in mass-radius andmass-luminosity diagrams, and for an assumed [fe/h] = -1.20, [alpha/fe] = 0.4,and y = 0.25 we find the most probable age of m4 to be between 11.2 and 11.3gyr. cmd-fitting with the same parameters yields an age close to, or slightlyin excess of, 12 gyr. however, considering the sources of uncertainty involvedin cmd fitting, these two methods of age determination are not discrepant. ageand distance determinations can be further improved when infrared eclipsephotometry is obtained.

1308.3980	salt long-slit spectroscopy of lbqs 2113-4538: variability of the mg ii  and fe ii component	the mg ii line is of extreme importance in intermediate redshift quasarssince it allows us to measure the black hole mass in these sources and to usethese sources as probes of the distribution of dark energy in the universe, asa complementary tool to sn ia. reliable use of mg ii requires a goodunderstanding of all the systematic effects involved in the measurement of theline properties, including the contamination by fe ii uv emission. we performedthree spectroscopic observations of a quasar lbqs 2113-4538 (z = 0.956) withthe salt telescope separated in time by several months and we analyze in detailthe mean spectrum and the variability in the spectral shape. we show that evenin our good-quality spectra the mg ii doublet is well fit by a singlelorentzian shape. we tested several models of the fe ii pseudo-continuum andshowed that one of them well represents all the data. the amplitudes of bothcomponents vary in time, but the shapes do not change significantly. themeasured line width of lbqs 2113-4538 identifies this object as a class aquasar. the upper limit of $3\%$ for the contribution of the narrow line region(nlr) to mg ii may suggest that the separation of the broad line region (blr)and nlr disappears in this class of objects.

(2005), respectively. in theremaining 14 gcs we found no certain new dne. our result raises the totalnumber of known dne in the galactic globular clusters to 12 dne, distributedamong 7 clusters. our survey recovered all three already known eruptingcataclysmic variables (cvs) located in our fields, namely m5-v101, m22-cv1, andv4 in the foreground of m30. to assess the efficiency of the survey, weanalyzed images with inserted artificial stars mimicking outbursts of theprototype dwarf novae ss cyg and u gem. depending on the conditions, werecovered between 16-100 percent of these artificial stars. the efficiencyseems to be predominantly affected by duty cycle/time sampling and much less bydistance/magnitude. except for saturated tiny collapsed cores of m30, ngc 362and ngc 6752 (and also the dense core of ngc 2808) crowding effects in the vband were avoided by our image subtraction technique augmented with auxiliaryunsaturated b-band images. our results clearly demonstrate that in gcs commontypes of dne are very rare indeed. however, great care must be taken beforethese conclusions can be extended to the cv population in gcs.

0804.4351	the clusters ages experiment (case). iii. analysis of the eccentric  eclipsing binary v32 in the globular cluster ngc 6397	we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the eclipsing binaryv32 located in the central field of the globular cluster ngc 6397. the variableis a single-line spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 9.8783d and alarge eccentricity of e=0.32. its systemic velocity (gamma=20.7 km/s) andmetallicity ([fe/h] -1.9) are both consistent with cluster membership. theprimary component of the binary is located at the top of the main-sequenceturn-off on the cluster color-magnitude diagram. only a shallow primary eclipseis observed in the light curve. based on stellar models for an age of 12gyr andthe mass-function derived from the radial velocity curve, we estimate themasses to be m_p=0.79 msun and m_s=0.23 msun. the light curve of v32 can bereproduced by adopting r_p=1.569 rsun and r_s=0.236 rsun for the radii andi=85.44 deg for the system inclination. the system geometry precludesobservations of the secondary eclipse. the large eccentricity of the orbit ispuzzling given that for metal poor, halo binaries the transition from circularto eccentric orbit occurs at an orbital period of about 20 days. we supposethat the orbit of v32 was modified relatively recently by dynamical interactionwith other cluster star(s).an alternative explanation of the observedeccentricity calls for the presence of a third body in the system.

astro-ph;9402025	the distribution of galactic disk stars in baade's window	the color-magnitude diagram of $ \sim 3 \times 10^5 $ stars obtained forbaade's window towards the galactic bulge with the ogle project reveals asurprisingly narrow main sequence due to galactic disk stars at a distance of$d \sim 2 $ kpc, i.e. at the location of the sagittarius spiral arm. a morecareful analysis indicates there is an excess in the number of disk stars by afactor $\sim 2$ between us and $d \sim 2.5$ kpc and a rapid drop by a factor$\sim 10$ beyond that distance. it is unlikely that the observed structure isan artifact of the interstellar extinction, but careful determination of theextinction is needed before the structure is firmly established. the narrowmain sequence extends down to stars as faint as $m_{_v} \approx 7$, i.e. it iscomposed of old stars. this is not expected in a conventional disk model, or ina conventional model of a spiral structure. however, a strong concentration ofold stars towards spiral arms has been noticed in some other galaxies, like m51(rix \&amp; rieke 1993), with the near infrared surface photometry. we have alsofound that the relative distribution of red clump and red giant stars in thegalactic bulge implies that there is a relatively young stellar populationpresent there.

astro-ph;9806343	bvi ccd photometry of the globular cluster 47 tuc	we present $bvi$ photometry for about 16000 stars from a 220 arcmin$^{2}$field centered 8 arcmin east of the center of 47 tuc. we have identified eightlikely blue stragglers located in the outer parts of the cluster. four of theseobjects are easy targets for spectroscopic studies with ground-basedtelescopes. six candidates for blue horizontal branch stars were identified.however, it is possible that all or most of them belong in fact to the smchalo. one faint blue star being candidate for a cataclysmic variable was foundclose to the cluster center.  the average $i$-band magnitude for stars forming the red giant branch clumpis determined at $i_{0}=13.09\pm 0.005 $mag. this in turn implies distancemodulus of the cluster $(m-m)_{0,47tuc}=13.32\pm 0.03\pm 0.036 $mag(statistical plus systematic error), if we adopt $m_{i,m}=-0.23 \pm 0.03 $magfor the average absolute luminosity of {\em hipparcos}-calibrated clump giants,following paczy\'nski &amp; stanek and stanek &amp; garnavich. this distance modulus of47 tuc is lower by $0.2-0.25 $mag than its recent estimates based on hipparcosparallaxes for subdwarfs. we discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. thephotometric data are available through the anonymous ftp service.

astro-ph;9812302	rr lyrae variables in the globular cluster m55. the first evidence for  non radial pulsations in rr lyr stars	we present the results of a photometric study of rr lyrae variables in thefield of the globular cluster m55. we have discovered nine new rr lyrae stars,increasing the number of known variables in this cluster to 15 objects. five ofthe newly discovered variables belong to bailey type rrc and two to type rrab.two background rrab stars are probable members of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy.fourier decomposition of the light curves was used to derive basic propertiesof the present sample of rr lyrae variables. from an analysis of the rrcvariables we obtain a mean mass of $m=0.53\pm0.03 m_\odot$, luminosity $\logl=1.75\pm0.01$, effective temperature $t_{eff}=7193\pm27$ k, and heliumabundance $y=0.27\pm0.01$. based on the $b-v$ colors, periods and metallicitiesof the rrab stars we estimate the value of the color excess for m55 to be equalto $e(b-v)=0.11\pm0.03$. using this value we derive the colors of the blue andred edges of the instability strip in m55. the blue edge lies at $(b-v)_0=0.20$mag and the red edge lies at $(b-v)_0=0.38$ mag. we estimate the values of thevisual apparent and dereddened distance moduli to be $13.65\pm0.11$ and$13.31\pm0.11$, respectively. the light curves of three of the rrc variablesexhibit changes in amplitude of over 0.1 mag on the time scale of less than aweek, rather short for the blazhko effect, but with no evidence for anotherradial pulsational frequency. however we do detect other periodicities whichare clearly visible in the light curve after removing variations with the firstovertone radial frequency. this is strong evidence for the presence ofnon-radial pulsations, a behavior common for $\delta$ scuti stars but not yetobserved among rr lyr variables.

astro-ph;9905304	bvri observations of the optical afterglow of grb 990510	we present $bvri$ observations of the optical counterpart to the gamma-rayburst (grb) 990510 obtained with the las campanas 1.0-m telescope between 15and 48 hours after the burst. the temporal analysis of the data indicatessteepening decay, independent of wavelength, approaching asymptotically$t^{-0.76\pm 0.01}$ at early times ($t\ll 1 day)$ and $t^{-2.40\pm 0.02}$ atlate times, with the break time at $t_0=1.57\pm 0.03 days$. grb 990510 is themost rapidly fading of the well-documented grb afterglows. it is also the firstobserved example of broad-band break for a grb optical counterpart. the opticalspectral energy distribution, corrected for significant galactic reddening, iswell fitted by a single power-law with $\nu^{-0.61\pm 0.12}$. however, when the$b$-band point is dropped from the fit, the power-law becomes $\nu^{-0.46\pm0.08}$, indicating a possible deviation from the power-law in the spectrum,either intrinsic or due to additional extinction near the source or from anintervening galaxy at $z=1.62$. broad-band break behavior broadly similar tothat observed in grb 990510 has been predicted in some jet models of grbafterglows, thus supporting the idea that the grb energy is beamed, at least insome cases.

astro-ph;9907272	variable stars in the field of the open cluster ngc 7789	we present the results of our search for variable stars in theintermediate-age open cluster ngc 7789. we have found 45 variable stars: 35eclipsing binaries, five pulsating variables and five miscellaneous variables.most of the eclipsing binaries show w uma type of variability, with periodsshorter than one day. four systems exhibit unusual behavior: two, v4276 andv6698, are probably rs cvn stars, another, v3283, is a possible cataclysmicbinary. the nature of the fourth binary, v2130, is unclear: the system exhibitsassymetric maxima. among the pulsating variables two, v3407c and v4805 arebackground rr lyrae stars and one, v6736, is a delta scuti variable which is ablue straggler belonging to the cluster. some of the miscellaneous variablesmay have periods longer than the five day timespan of our observations. we alsopresent a color-magnitude diagram for the ngc 7789 open cluster, fairlycomplete down to v ~ 20. the relatively large number of variables found in thecomparison field (14 compared to 31 in the cluster field) implies that objectsnot associated physically with the cluster can account for a significant numberof variables identified in the cluster field, as well as in other globular andopen clusters observed on a dense background/foreground of disk stars.

astro-ph;9908041	ubvi color-magnitude diagrams in baade's window: metallicity range,  implications for the red clump method, color ``anomaly'' and the distances to  the galactic center and the large magellanic cloud	(abridged) we analyze the ubvi color-magnitude diagrams towards the galacticbulge in a relatively low-reddening region of baade's window. the dereddenedred giant branch is very wide [~1.0 mag in (u-b)_0 and ~0.4 mag in (b-v)_0 and(v-i)_0], indicating a significant dispersion of stellar metallicities, whichby comparison with the theoretical isochrones and data for galactic clusters weestimate to lie between approximately -0.7&lt; [fe/h] &lt; +0.3. we also discuss themetallicity dependence of the red clump i-band brightness and we show that itis between 0.1-0.2 mag dex^{-1}. this agrees well with the previous empiricaldeterminations and the models of stellar evolution.  the de-reddened (v-i)_0 color of the red clump in the observed bulge field is&lt;(v-i)_0&gt; = 1.066, sigma_{(v-i)_0} = 0.14, i.e. 0.056 mag redder than the localstars with good parallaxes measured by hipparcos. when we use our data tore-derive the red clump distance to the galactic center, we obtain thegalactocentric distance modulus \mu_{0,gc}=14.69 +- 0.1 mag (r_0=8.67 +- 0.4kpc), with error dominated by the systematics of photometric calibration. wethen discuss the systematics of the red clump method and how they affect thered clump distance to the large magellanic cloud. we argue that the value ofdistance modulus \mu_{0,lmc}=18.24 +- 0.08 (44.5 +- 1.7 kpc), recently refinedby udalski, is currently the most secure and robust of all lmc distanceestimates. this has the effect of increasing any lmc-tied hubble constant byabout 12%, including the recent determinations by the hst key project andsandage et al.  the ubvi photometry is available through the anonymous ftp service.
