0912.3032	moircs deep survey v: a universal relation for stellar mass and surface  brightness of galaxies	we present a universal linear correlation between the stellar mass andsurface brightness (sb) of galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;3, using a deep k-band selectedcatalog in the goods-north region. the correlation has a nearly constant slope,independent of redshift and color of galaxies in the rest-z frame. consideringunresolved compact galaxies, the tight correlation gives a lower boundary of sbfor a given stellar mass; lower sb galaxies are prohibited over the boundary.the universal slope suggests that the stellar mass in galaxies was build upover their cosmic histories in a similar manner irrelevant to galaxy mass, asoppose to the scenario that massive galaxies mainly accumulated their stellarmass by major merging. in contrast, sb shows a strong dependence on redshiftfor a given stellar mass. it evolves as (1+z)^(-2.0~-0.8), in addition todimming as (1+z)^4 by the cosmological expansion effect. the brighteningdepends on galaxy color and stellar mass. the blue population (rest-frameu-v&lt;0), which is dominated by young and star-forming galaxies, evolves as~(1+z)^(-0.8 +-0.3) in the rest-v band. on the other hand, the red population(u-v&gt;0) and the massive galaxies (m_*&gt;10^(10)m_sun) shows stronger brightening,(1+z)^(-1.5+-0.1). based on the comparison with galaxy evolution models, wefind that the phenomena are well explained by the pure luminosity evolution ofgalaxies out to z~3.

0707.3161	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). iv. evolution of lya emitters  from z=3.1 to 5.7 in the 1 deg^2 field: luminosity functions and agn	we present luminosity functions (lfs) and various properties of lya emitters(laes) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) field. we obtain a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates basedon deep subaru/suprime-cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84confirmed laes from subaru/focas and vlt/vimos spectroscopy in a survey volumeof ~10^6 mpc^3 with a limiting lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. we derive thelfs of lya and uv-continuum (~1500 \aa) for each redshift, taking into accountthe statistical error and the field-to-field variation. we find that theapparent lya lf shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 withinfactors of 1.8 and 2.7 in l* and phi*, respectively. on the other hand, the uvlf of laes increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with lyaemission are more common at earlier epochs. we identify six laes with agnactivities from our spectra combined with vla, spitzer, and xmm-newton data.among the photometrically selected laes at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show agnactivities, while the brightest laes with logl(lya) &gt;~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appearto always host agns. our laes are bluer in uv-continuum color than dropoutgalaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. ourstacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and thef(heii)/f(lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation(+low-luminosity agn) and the primordial population in laes.

1005.4727	moircs deep survey. vi. near-infrared spectroscopy of k-selected  star-forming galaxies at z~2	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy for 37 bzk-color-selectedstar-forming galaxies with moircs on subaru. the sample is drawn from theks-band selected catalog of the moircs deep survey (mods) in the goods-nregion. about half of our samples are selected from the mips 24um-sourcecatalog. ha emission lines are detected from 23 galaxies, of which the medianredshift is 2.12. we derived the star formation rates (sfrs) fromextinction-corrected ha luminosities. the extinction correction is estimatedfrom the sed fitting of multi-band photometric data covering uv to nirwavelengths. the balmer decrement of the stacked emission lines shows that theamount of extinction for the ionized gas is larger than that for the stellarcontinuum. from a comparison of the extinction corrected ha luminosity andother sfr indicators we found that the relation between the dust properties ofstellar continuum and ionized gas is different depending on the intrinsic sfr.the comparison between the ha sfr and stellar mass estimated from sed fittingshows no correlation between them. some galaxies with stellar mass smaller than~10^10 msun show sfrs higher than ~100 msun/yr. the specific sfrs (ssfrs) ofthese galaxies are remarkably high. the average stellar-population age of thesehigh-ssfr galaxies is younger than 100 myr, which is consistent with theimplied high ssfr. the large sfr implies the possibility that the high ssfrgalaxies significantly contribute to the cosmic sfr density of the universe atz~2. the total sfr density estimated from the ha emission line galaxies is0.089-0.136 msun/yr/mpc^3, which is consistent with the total sfr densities inthe literature. the metallicity of the high-ssfr galaxies is larger than thatexpected from the mass-metallicity relation of uv-selected galaxies at z~2 byerb et al. (2006a). [abridged]

1006.5492	a comparison of spectroscopic methods for detecting starlight scattered  by transiting hot jupiters, with application to subaru data for hd 209458b  and hd 189733b	the measurement of the light scattered from extrasolar planets informsatmospheric and formation models. with the discovery of many hot jupiterplanets orbiting nearby stars, this motivates the development of robust methodsof characterisation from follow up observations. in this paper we discuss twomethods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems. first, themost widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot jupiters(collier cameron et al.) is investigated for application for typical echellespectra of a transiting planet system, showing that detection requires highsignal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets. secondly a new fourier analysismethod is also presented, which is model-independent and utilises the benefitsof the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems. thisapproach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in fourier spaceby least-squares. the sensitivities of the methods are determined via montecarlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes. we find the fourieranalysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observationsof a well constrained transiting system than the collier cameron et al. method.we apply the fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered bytransiting hot jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of hd209458 and hd 189733. unfortunately we are unable to improve on the previousupper limit of the planet-to-star flux for hd 209458b set by space-basedobservations. a 1{\sigma}upper limit on the planet-to-star flux of hd 189733bis measured in the wavelength range of 558.83-599.56 nm yielding {\epsilon} &lt;4.5 \times 10-4. improvement in the measurement of the upper limit of theplanet-to-star flux of this system, with ground-based capabilities, requiresdata with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and increased stability of thetelescope.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1009.3377	moircs deep survey. vii: nir morphologies of star-forming galaxies at  redshift z~1	we investigate rest-frame near-infrared (nir) morphologies of a sample of 139galaxies with m_{s} &gt;= 1 x 10^{10} m_{sun} at z=0.8-1.2 in the goods-northfield using our deep nir imaging data (moircs deep survey, mods). we focus onluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs), which dominate high star formation rate(sfr) density at z~1, in the sample identified by cross-correlating with thespitzer/mips 24um source catalog. we perform two-dimensional light profilefitting of the z~1 galaxies in the ks-band (rest-frame j-band) with a singlecomponent sersic model. we find that at z~1, ~90% of lirgs have low sersicindices (n&lt;2.5, similar to disk-like galaxies) in the ks-band, and thosedisk-like lirgs consist of ~60% of the whole disk-like sample above m_{s} &gt;= 3x 10^{10} m_{sun}. the z~1 disk-like lirgs are comparable or ~20% small at amaximum in size compared to local disk-like galaxies in the same stellar massrange. if we examine rest-frame uv-optical morphologies using the hst/acsimages, the rest-frame b-band sizes of the z~1 disk-like galaxies arecomparable to those of the local disk-like galaxies as reported by previousstudies on size evolution of disk-like galaxies in the rest-frame optical band.measuring color gradients (galaxy sizes as a function of wavelength) of the z~1and local disk-like galaxies, we find that the z~1 disk-like galaxies have 3-5times steeper color gradient than the local ones. our results indicate that (i)more than a half of relatively massive disk-like galaxies at z~1 are in violentstar formation epochs observed as lirgs, and also (ii) most of those lirgs areconstructing their fundamental disk structure vigorously. the high sfr densityin the universe at z~1 may be dominated by such star formation in disk regionin massive galaxies.

0711.2304	a technique for detecting starlight scattered from transiting extrasolar  planets with application to hd 209458b	we present a new technique for detecting scattered starlight from transiting,close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (cegps) that has the virtues ofsimplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. given a series ofstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goalis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative tothe component coming directly from the star. we use two complementarystrategies, both of which rely on the predictable doppler shifts of bothcomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and manyexposures. in the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrumthat are free of direct absorption lines and add them after doppler-shiftinginto the planetary frame. in the second strategy, we compare the distributionof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. bothstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled dopplershifts are applied to the spectral segments. as an illustrative test case, weapply our technique to spectra of hd 209458 taken when the planet was nearopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. thiscorresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase functionof a lambert sphere. although the result is not statistically significant, theachieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is basedare very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scatteredlight from transiting cegp systems.

1306.0581	the seeds direct imaging survey for planets and scattered dust emission  in debris disk systems	debris disks around young main-sequence stars often have gaps and cavitieswhich for a long time have been interpreted as possibly being caused byplanets. in recent years, several giant planet discoveries have been made insystems hosting disks of precisely this nature, further implying thatinteractions with planets could be a common cause of such disk structures. aspart of the seeds high-contrast imaging survey, we are surveying a populationof debris disk-hosting stars with gaps and cavities implied by their spectralenergy distributions, in order to attempt to spatially resolve the disk as wellas to detect any planets that may be responsible for the disk structure. herewe report on intermediate results from this survey. five debris disks have beenspatially resolved, and a number of faint point sources have been discovered,most of which have been tested for common proper motion, which in each case hasexcluded physical companionship with the target stars. from the detectionlimits of the 50 targets that have been observed, we find that beta pic b-likeplanets (~10 mjup planets around g--a-type stars) near the gap edges are lessfrequent than 15--30%, implying that if giant planets are the dominant cause ofthese wide (27 au on average) gaps, they are generally less massive than betapic b.

1306.1887	high-contrast near-infrared imaging polarimetry of the protoplanetary  disk around ry tau	we present near-infrared coronagraphic imaging polarimetry of ry tau. thescattered light in the circumstellar environment was imaged at h-band at a highresolution (~0".05) for the first time, using subaru-hiciao. the observedpolarized intensity (pi) distribution shows a butterfly-like distribution ofbright emission with an angular scale similar to the disk observed atmillimeter wavelengths. this distribution is offset toward the blueshifted jet,indicating the presence of a geometrically thick disk or a remnant envelope,and therefore the earliest stage of the class ii evolutionary phase. we performcomparisons between the observed pi distribution and disk models with: (1) fullradiative transfer code, using the spectral energy distribution (sed) toconstrain the disk parameters; and (2) monochromatic simulations of scatteredlight which explore a wide range of parameters space to constrain the disk anddust parameters. we show that these models cannot consistently explain theobserved pi distribution, sed, and the viewing angle inferred by millimeterinterferometry. we suggest that the scattered light in the near-infrared isassociated with an optically thin and geometrically thick layer above the disksurface, with the surface responsible for the infrared sed. half of thescattered light and thermal radiation in this layer illuminates the disksurface, and this process may significantly affect the thermal structure of thedisk.

1309.2559	a discovery of a candidate companion to a transiting system koi-94: a  direct imaging study for a possibility of a false positive	we report a discovery of a companion candidate around one of {\it kepler}objects of interest (kois), koi-94, and results of our quantitativeinvestigation of the possibility that planetary candidates around koi-94 arefalse positives. koi-94 has a planetary system in which four planetarydetections have been reported by {\it kepler}, suggesting that this system isintriguing to study the dynamical evolutions of planets. however, while two ofthose detections (koi-94.01 and 03) have been made robust by previousobservations, the others (koi-94.02 and 04) are marginal detections, for whichfuture confirmations with various techniques are required. we have conductedhigh-contrast direct imaging observations with subaru/hiciao in $h$ band anddetected a faint object located at a separation of $\sim0.6''$ from koi-94. theobject has a contrast of $\sim 1\times 10^{-3}$ in $h$ band, and corresponds toan m type star on the assumption that the object is at the same distance ofkoi-94. based on our analysis, koi-94.02 is likely to be a real planet becauseof its transit depth, while koi-94.04 can be a false positive due to thecompanion candidate. the success in detecting the companion candidate suggeststhat high-contrast direct imaging observations are important keys to examinefalse positives of kois. on the other hand, our transit light curve reanalyseslead to a better period estimate of koi-94.04 than that on the koi catalogueand show that the planetary candidate has the same limb darkening parametervalue as the other planetary candidates in the koi-94 system, suggesting thatkoi-94.04 is also a real planet in the system.

1311.4624	clustering of extremely red objects in elais-n1 from the ukidss dxs with  optical photometry from pan-starrs1 and subaru	we measure the angular clustering of 33 415 extremely red objects (eros) inthe elais-n1 field covering 5.33 deg$^{2}$, which cover the redshift range$z=0.8$ to $2$. this sample was made by merging the ukidss deep extragalacticsurvey (dxs) with the optical subaru and pan-starrs ps1 datasets. we confirmthe existence of a clear break in the angular correlation function at $\sim0.02^{\circ}$ corresponding to $1 h^{-1}$ mpc at $z\sim1$. we find that redderor brighter eros are more clustered than bluer or fainter ones. halo occupationdistribution (hod) model fits imply that the average mass of dark matter haloeswhich host eros is over $10^{13} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ and that eros have a biasranging from 2.7 to 3.5. compared to eros at $z\sim1.1$, at $z\sim1.5$ eroshave a higher bias and fewer are expected to be satellite galaxies.furthermore, eros reside in similar dark matter haloes to those that host$10^{11.0} m_{\odot}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$ galaxies. we compare our newmeasurement and hod fits with the predictions of the galform semi-analyticalgalaxy formation model. overall, the clustering predicted by galform gives anencouraging match to our results. however, compared to our deductions from themeasurements, galform puts eros into lower mass haloes and predicts that alarger fraction of eros are satellite galaxies. this suggests that thetreatment of gas cooling may need to be revised in the model. our analysisillustrates the potential of clustering analyses to provide observationalconstraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation.

1312.3934	probing intergalactic neutral hydrogen by the lyman alpha red damping  wing of gamma-ray burst 130606a afterglow spectrum at z = 5.913	the unprecedentedly bright optical afterglow of grb 130606a located by swiftat a redshift close to the reionization era (z = 5.913) provides a newopportunity to probe the ionization status of intergalactic medium (igm). herewe present an analysis of the red ly alpha damping wing of the afterglowspectrum taken by subaru/focas during 10.4-13.2 hr after the burst. we findthat the minimal model including only the baseline power-law and hi absorptionin the host galaxy does not give a good fit, leaving residuals showing concavecurvature in 8400-8900 a with an amplitude of about 0.6% of the flux. such acurvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either byextinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature ofafterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observedspectrum. the red damping wing by intervening hi gas outside the host canreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance. we find that adamped ly alpha system is not favored as the origin of this intervening hiabsorption, from the observed ly beta and metal absorption features. thereforeabsorption by diffuse igm remains as a plausible explanation. a fit by a simpleuniform igm model requires hi neutral fraction of f_hi ~ 0.1-0.5 depending onthe distance to the grb host, implying high f_hi igm associated with theobserved dark gunn-peterson (gp) troughs. this gives a new evidence that thereionization is not yet complete at z ~ 6.

1407.2944	a deep narrowband imaging search for civ and he ii emission from  ly$\alpha$ blobs	we conduct a deep narrow-band imaging survey of 13 ly$\alpha$ blobs (labs)located in the ssa22 proto-cluster at z~3.1 in the civ and heii emission linesin an effort to constrain the physical process powering the ly$\alpha$ emissionin labs. our observations probe down to unprecedented surface brightness limitsof 2.1 $-$ 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ per 1arcsec$^2$ aperture (5$\sigma$) for the heii$\lambda$1640 and civ$\lambda$1549lines, respectively. we do not detect extended heii and civ emission in any ofthe labs, placing strong upper limits on the heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$line ratios, of 0.11 and 0.16, for the brightest two labs in the field. weconduct detailed photoionization modeling of the expected line ratios and findthat, although our data constitute the deepest ever observations of theselines, they are still not deep enough to rule out a scenario where thely$\alpha$ emission is powered by the ionizing luminosity of an obscured agn.our models can accommodate heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$ ratios as low as$\simeq$0.05 and $\simeq$0.07 respectively, implying that one needs to reachsurface brightness as low as 1 $-$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ (at 5$\sigma$) in order to rule out a photoionizationscenario. these depths will be achievable with the new generation ofimage-slicing integral field units such as vlt/muse or keck/kcwi. we also modelthe expected heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$ in a different scenario, wherely$\alpha$ emission is powered by shocks generated in a large-scale superwind,but find that our observational constraints can only be met for shockvelocities $v_{\rm s} \gtrsim$ 250 km s$^{-1}$, which appear to be in conflictwith recent observations of quiescent kinematics in labs.

1409.1390	surface geometry of protoplanetary disks inferred from near-infrared  imaging polarimetry	we present a new method of analysis for determining the surface geometry offive protoplanetary disks observed with near-infrared imaging polarimetry usingsubaru-hiciao. using as inputs the observed distribution of polarized intensity(pi), disk inclination, assumed properties for dust scattering, and otherreasonable approximations, we calculate a differential equation to derive thesurface geometry. this equation is numerically integrated along the distancefrom the star at a given position angle. we show that, using theseapproximations, the local maxima in the pi distribution of spiral arms (sao206462, mwc 758) and rings (2mass j16042165-2130284, pds 70) are associatedwith local concave-up structures on the disk surface. we also show that theobserved presence of an inner gap in scattered light still allows thepossibility of a disk surface that is parallel to the light path from the star,or a disk that is shadowed by structures in the inner radii. our analysis forrings does not show the presence of a vertical inner wall as often assumed instudies of disks with an inner gap. finally, we summarize the implications ofspiral and ring structures as potential signatures of ongoing planet formation.

1409.8386	indications of m-dwarf deficits in the halo and thick disk of the galaxy	we compared the number of faint stars detected in deep survey fields with thecurrent stellar distribution model of the galaxy and found that the detectednumber in the h band is significantly smaller than the predicted number. thisindicates that m-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and thethick disk. we used archived data of several surveys in both the north andsouth field of goods (great observatories origins deep survey), mods ingoods-n, and ers and candels in goods-s. the number density of m-dwarfs in thehalo has to be 20+/-13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order forthe detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the h band to match withthe predicted value from the model. in the thick disk, the number density ofm-dwarfs must be reduced (52+/-13%) or the scale height must be decreased (~600pc). alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can besignificantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainlyconsists of faint m-dwarfs. our results imply that the m-dwarf population inregions distant from the galactic plane is significantly smaller thanpreviously thought. we then discussed the implications this has on thesuitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faintstars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fit numberdensities.

"standard" sed models cannot explain the observed lyc laescolors, instead requiring more exotic models like a top-heavy imf with anaverage stellar mass of $\sim100m_{sun}$ and the "lyman limit bump" model withan escape of nebular recombination lyc. the lyc lbgs colors are consistent witha salpeter imf with no nebular emission. both types of galaxies seem to requireextremely metal-poor or metal-free young (zero age) stellar populations. wehave obtained estimates of lyc escape fraction of $\sim20\%$ for lyc lbgs and$\sim30\%$ for lyc laes, assuming an smc dust law. we cannot simultaneouslyexplain the observed $f_{lyc}/f_{uv}$ flux density ratios and the uv slopes ifwe assume a calzetti attenuation curve. the lyc emission seems to be bimodal -stacking non-detections reveals no significant lyc signal strength. the$3\sigma$ median upper limits on the flux density ratios from non-detectionsare [...]

astro-ph;0002344	color-magnitude sequence in the clusters at z$\sim$1.2 near the radio  galaxy 3c 324	we have investigated the optical and near-infrared colors of k'-selectedgalaxies in clusters at z ~ 1.2 near to the radio galaxy 3c 324 using imagesobtained with the subaru telescope and archival hst data. the distribution ofcolors of the galaxies in the cluster region is found to be fairly broad, andit may imply significant scatter in their star-formation histories, althoughthe effect of contamination of field galaxies is uncertain. the red sequence ofgalaxies whose r-k colors are consistent with passive evolution models for oldgalaxies is found to be truncated at k' ~ 20 mag, and there are few faintergalaxies with similar red colors in the cluster region. we find that thebulge-dominated galaxies selected by quantitative morphological classificationform a broad sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, whose slope is muchsteeper than that expected from metallicity variations within a passivelyevolving coeval galaxy population. we argue that the observed color-magnitudesequence can be explained by metallicity and age variations, and the faintergalaxies with k' &gt; 20 mag may be 1-2 gyr younger than the brighter galaxies.some spatial segregation of the color and k'-band luminosity is seen in the skydistribution; the redder and the brighter objects tend to be located near 3c324.

astro-ph;0002390	high-resolution near-infrared imaging of the powerful radio galaxy 3c  324 at z = 1.21 with the subaru telescope	we have obtained high-resolution k'-band images of the powerful z=1.206 radiogalaxy 3c 324 with the subaru telescope under seeing conditions of 0.3--0.4arcsec. we clearly resolved the galaxy and directly compared it to the opticalimages obtained with the hubble space telescope. the host galaxy of 3c 324 isrevealed to be a moderately luminous elliptical galaxy with a smooth lightprofile. the effective radius of the galaxy, as determined by profile fitting,is 1.3+-0.1 arcsec (1.2 kpc), which is significantly smaller than the value of2.2 arcsec, published in best et al. (1998, mnras, 292, 758). the peak of thek'-band light coincides with the position of the radio core, which implies thatthe powerful agn lies at the nucleus of the host galaxy. the peak alsocoincides with the gap in the optical knotty structures which may be a dustlane hiding the uv-optical emission of the agn from our line of sight; it isvery likely that we are seeing the obscuring structure almost edge-on. weclearly detected the `aligned component' in the k'-band image by subtracting amodel elliptical galaxy from the observed image. the red r_f702w-k color of theouter region of the galaxy avoiding the aligned component indicates that thenear infrared light of the host galaxy is dominated by an old stellarpopulation.

astro-ph;0211441	subaru high resolution spectroscopy of complex metal absorption lines of  qso hs1603+3820	we present a high resolution spectrum of the quasar, hs1603+3820(z_em=2.542), observed with the high dispersion spectrograph (hds) on subarutelescope. this quasar, first discovered in the hamburg/cfa quasar survey, has11 c iv lines at 1.96 &lt; z_abs &lt; 2.55. our spectrum covers 8 of the 11 c ivlines at z_abs &gt; 2.29 and resolves some of them into multiple narrow componentswith b &lt; 25 km/s because of the high spectral resolution r=45000, while otherlines show broad profiles (b &gt; 65 km/s). we use three properties of c iv lines,specifically, time variability, covering factor, and absorption line profile,to classify them into quasar intrinsic absorption lines (qials) and spatiallyintervening absorption lines (sials). the c iv lines at 2.42 &lt; z_abs &lt; 2.45 areclassified as qials in spite of their large velocity shifts from the quasar.perhaps they are produced by gas clouds ejected from the quasar with thevelocity of v_ej = 8000 km/s -- 10000 km/s. on the other hand, three c iv linesat 2.48 &lt; z_abs &lt; 2.55 are classified as sials, which suggests there existintervening absorbers near the quasar. we, however, cannot rule out qials forthe two lines at z_abs ~ 2.54 and 2.55, because their velocity shifts, 430 km/sblueward and 950 km/s redward of the quasar, are very small. the c iv line atz_abs ~ 2.48 consists of many narrow components, and has also correspondinglow-ionization metal lines (al ii, si ii, and fe ii). the velocity distributionof these low-ionization ions is concentrated at the center of the systemcompared to that of high-ionization c iv ion. therefore we ascribe this systemof absorption lines to an intervening galaxy.

astro-ph;0506713	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation as a function of  environment	we discuss the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution based on deeppanoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with suprime-cam as part of thepisces project. by combining with the sdss data as a local counterpart forcomparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges inenvironment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). we find that colours ofgalaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($m_v&gt;m_v^*+1$), change from blueto red at a break density as we go to denser regions. based on local and globaldensities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, andclusters. we show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already builtat $z=0.83$. in contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnituderelation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and thebuild-up at the faint-end has not started yet. a possible interpretation ofthese results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. that is,massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of starformation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. this trend islikely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation is delayed in lower-density environments. therefore, we may suggestthat the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and inhigh density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lowerdensity regions.

astro-ph;0508536	masses of high-z galaxy hosting haloes from angular clustering and their  evolution in the cdm model	we examine masses of hosting haloes of two photometrically-selected high-zgalaxy samples: the old passively-evolving galaxies (opegs) and lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) both taken from the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). thelarge survey area of the sxds (1sq deg) allows us to measure the angulartwo-point correlation functions to a wide separation of &gt;10 arcmin with a goodstatistical quality. we utilize the halo model prescription for estimatingcharacteristic masses of hosting haloes from the measured large-scaleclustering amplitudes. it is found that the hosting halo mass positivelycorrelates with the luminosity of galaxies. then, adopting the extendedpress-schechter model (eps), we compute the predictions for the mass evolutionof the hosting haloes in the framework of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologyin order to make an evolutionary link between the two galaxy samples atdifferent redshifts and to identify their present-day descendants by lettingtheir haloes evolve forward in time. it is found that, in the view of the massevolution of hosting haloes in the cdm model, bright lbgs are consistent withbeing the progenitor of the opegs, whereas it is less likely that the lbgpopulation, as a whole, have evolved into the opeg population. it is also foundthat the present-day descendants of both the bright lbgs and opegs are likelyto be located in massive systems such as groups of galaxies or clusters ofgalaxies. finally, we estimate the hosting halo mass of local early-type galaxysamples from the 2df and sdss based on the halo model and it turns out thattheir expected characteristic mass of hosting haloes is in good agreement withthe eps predictions for the descendant's mass of both the bright lbgs andopegs.

astro-ph;0606067	mass-dependent color evolution of field galaxies back to z~3 over the  wide range of stellar mass	we use deep multi-band optical and near-infrared data for four generalfields, goods-south, hdf north/south, and irac udf in goods-north toinvestigate the evolution of the observed rest-frame u-v color of fieldgalaxies as a function of the stellar mass. in these four fields, the u-v colordistributions of the galaxies at each mass and redshift interval are verysimilar. at 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.7, we found that more massive galaxies always tend to havea redder u-v color. high- and low-mass galaxies exhibit quite different colorevolutions. as seen in our previous study in hdf-n, the color distribution oflow-mass (m_stellar &lt; 3x10^9m_solar) galaxies becomes significantly bluer withan increase in the redshift. this evolution of the average color can beexplained by a constant star formation rate model with z_form~4. on the otherhand, the average color of high-mass galaxies (m_stellar &gt; 3x10^10m_solar)evolves more strongly at a high redshift. such mass-dependent colordistribution and its evolution indicate that galaxies with a larger stellarmass appear to have shorter star-formation timescales, and on an average, theyform the larger fraction of their stars in the earlier epoch.

astro-ph;0701820	moircs deep survey. ii. clustering properties of k-band selected  galaxies in goods-north region	we present the first measurement of clustering properties of low massgalaxies with a stellar mass down to m_*~10^9 msun at 1&lt;z&lt;4 in 24.4 arcmin^2 ofthe goods-north region with a depth of k_{ab}~25, based on the near infraredobservations performed with moircs at the subaru telescope. the correlationamplitude strongly depends on the k-band flux, color, and stellar mass of thegalaxies. we find that k-band luminous galaxies have a larger correlationlength than k-band faint galaxies. for color selected samples at 2&lt;z&lt;4, distantred galaxies with j-k&gt;1.3 show a large bias of b~7.2+-1.3 on scales up to\theta~100" or 3.1 comoving mpc, while blue galaxies with 0.5&lt;j-k&lt;1.3, in whichmost lyman break galaxies are populated, have a weak clustering signal on largescales, but a possible strong small scale excess at \theta&lt;10". for massivegalaxies with m_*&gt;~10^{10} msun, we estimate a correlation length and bias tobe r_0~4.5 h^{-1} mpc and b=1.9-3.5, which are much larger than those of lowmass (m_*~10^9-10^{10} msun) galaxies. the comparison of our measurements withanalytic cdm models constrains the properties of hosting dark halos, andindicates that the low mass galaxies would be progenitors of galaxies with atypical luminosity of l&lt;~l_* in the local universe. the blue galaxies in lowmass samples are more strongly clustered in more massive halos with higheroccupation numbers than low mass red galaxies. this fact suggests anenvironment effect due to the halo mass on star formation activity at high-z.

astro-ph;9903299	expected sub-mm emission and dust properties of lyman break galaxies at  high redshift	we investigate expected sub-mm emission and dust properties of the lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) in the hubble deep field (hdf). the scuba deep survey(hughes et al., 1998) provides an upper limit of the 850 micron flux densitiesof the lbgs. with this constraint, we argue that a typical ultra-violet tofar-infrared spectral shape of the high-redshift lbgs is rather close to atemplate spectrum of low-reddening starburst galaxies in the local universe butdifferent from that of heavily dust-enshrouded ultra-luminous far-infraredgalaxies like arp220. we also evaluate the lower-limit temperature of dust inlbgs assuming single- and two-component modified black-body spectrum. toestimate the total amount of energy re-emitted in fir wavelength, we take twodifferent approaches; model fitting of the uv spectra of lbgs and an empiricalmethod using the relationship between uv spectral shape and uv/fir flux ratioobserved for local starburst galaxies. both methods give lower-limittemperature of the lbgs as around 40 k, which is higher than the typical dusttemperature of local optical- and infrared-selected galaxies. this result isalso supported by the comparison of the expected sub-mm flux of the lbgs withthe cosmic fir background radiation. the high dust temperature may indicate theeffective massive-star formation or different dust properties in thehigh-redshift lbgs.

astro-ph;9907437	a rich cluster of galaxies near the quasar b2 1335+28 at z=1.1: color  distribution and star-formation properties	we previously reported a significant clustering of red galaxies (r-k=3.5--6)around the radio-loud quasar b2 1335+28 at z=1.086. in this paper, we establishthe existence of a rich cluster at the quasar redshift, and study theproperties of the cluster galaxies through further detailed analysis of thephotometric data. the color distribution of the galaxies in the cluster isquite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\sim 70%) is much larger than inintermediate-redshift clusters. using evolutionary synthesis models, we showthat this color distribution can be explained by galaxies with various amountsof star-formation activity mixed with the old stellar populations. notably,there are about a dozen galaxies which show very red optical-nir colors butalso show significant uv excess with respect to passive-evolution models. theycan be interpreted as old early-type galaxies with a small amount of starformation. the fact that the uv-excess red galaxies are more abundant than thequiescent red ones suggests that a large fraction of old galaxies in thiscluster are still forming stars to some extent. however, a sequence ofquiescent red galaxies is clearly identified on the r-k versus kcolor-magnitude (c-m) diagram. the slope and zero point of their c-m relationappear to be consistent with those expected for the precursors of the c-mrelation of present-day cluster ellipticals when observed at z=1.1. we estimatethe abell richness class of the cluster to be r \sim 1. new x-ray datapresented here place an upper limit of l_x &lt; 2 10^{44} erg s^{-1} for thecluster luminosity. inspections of the wider optical images reveal some lumpystructure, suggesting that the whole system is still dynamically young.
