1108.2855	discovery of the source hess j1356-645 associated with the young and  energetic psr j1357-6429	several newly discovered very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-raysources in the galaxy are thought to be associated with energetic pulsars.among them, middle-aged (&gt; 1e+4 yr) systems exhibit large centre-filled vhenebulae, offset from the pulsar position, which result from the complexrelationship between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium, and reflectthe past evolution of the pulsar. imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(iacts) have been successful in revealing extended emission from these sourcesin the vhe regime. together with radio and x-ray observations, thisobservational window allows one to probe the energetics and magnetic fieldinside these large-scale nebulae. h.e.s.s., with its large field of view,angular resolution of &lt; 0.1deg and unprecedented sensitivity, has been used todiscover a large population of such vhe sources. in this paper, the h.e.s.s.data from the continuation of the galactic plane survey (-80deg &lt; l &lt; 60deg,|b| &lt; 3deg), together with the existing multi-wavelength observations, areused. a new vhe gamma-ray source was discovered at r.a. (j2000) = 13h56m00s,dec. (j2000) = -64d30m00s with a 2' statistical error in each coordinate,namely hess j1356-645. the source is extended, with an intrinsic gaussian widthof (0.20 +/- 0.02)deg. its integrated energy flux between 1 and 10 tev of 8e-12erg cm-2 s-1 represents ~ 11% of the crab nebula flux in the same energy band.the energy spectrum between 1 and 20 tev is well described by a power law dn/de~ e-gamma with photon index gamma = 2.2 +/- 0.2stat +/- 0.2sys. the inspectionof archival radio images at three frequencies and the analysis of x-ray datafrom rosat/pspc and xmm-newton/mos reveal the presence of faint non-thermaldiffuse emission coincident with hess j1356-645. hess j1356-645 is most likelyassociated with the young and energetic pulsar psr j1357-6429 (abridged)

1202.1455	predicting the x-ray flux of evolved pulsar wind nebulae based on vhe  gamma-ray observations	energetic pulsars power winds of relativistic leptons which produce photonnebulae (so- called pulsar wind nebulae, pwne). their spectral energydistribution has a double-humped structure: the first hump lies in the x-rayregime, the second in the gamma-ray range. the x-ray emission is generallyunderstood as synchrotron radiation by highly energetic leptons, the gamma-rayemission as inverse compton scattering of energetic leptons with ambient photonfields. the spectral evolution is influenced by the time-dependent spin-down ofthe pulsar and the decrease of the magnetic field strength with time. thus, thepresent spectral appearance of a pwn depends on the age of the pulsar: whileyoung pwne are bright in x-rays and gamma-rays, the x-ray emission of evolvedpwne is suppressed. hence, evolved pulsar wind nebulae may offer an explanationof the nature of some of the unidentified vhe (very high-energy, e &gt; 100gev)gamma-ray sources not yet associated with a counterpart at other wavelengths.the purpose of this work is to develop a model which allows to calculate theexpected x-ray fluxes of unidentified vhe gamma-ray sources considered to bepwn candidates. such an estimate may help to evaluate the prospects ofdetecting the x-ray signal in deep observations with current x-rayobservatories in future studies. we present a time-dependent leptonic modelwhich predicts the broad-band emission of a pwn according to thecharacteristics of its pulsar. for a sample of representative pwne, theresulting model predictions in the x-ray and gamma-ray range are compared toobservations. the comparison shows that the energy flux of the x-ray emissionof identified pwne from different states of evolution can be roughly predictedby the model. this implies the possibility of an estimate of the non-thermalx-ray emission of unidentified vhe gamma-ray sources in case of an evolved pwnscenario.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1303.1628	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from pks 0447-439 and derivation of  an upper limit on its redshift	very high-energy gamma-ray emission from pks 0447-439 was detected with theh.e.s.s. cherenkov telescope array in december 2009. this blazar is one of thebrightest extragalactic objects in the fermi bright source list and has a hardspectrum in the mev to gev range. in the tev range, a photon index of 3.89 +-0.37 (stat) +- 0.22 (sys) and a flux normalisation at 1 tev, phi(1 tev) = (3.5+- 1.1 (stat) +- 0.9 (sys)) x 10^{-13} cm^{-2} s^{-1} tev^{-1}, were found. thedetection with h.e.s.s. triggered observations in the x-ray band with the swiftand rxte telescopes. simultaneous uv and optical data from swift uvot and datafrom the optical telescopes atom and rotse are also available. the spectrum andlight curve measured with h.e.s.s. are presented and compared to themulti-wavelength data at lower energies. a rapid flare is seen in the swift xrtand rxte data, together with a flux variation in the uv band, at a time scaleof the order of one day. a firm upper limit of z &lt; 0.59 on the redshift of pks0447-439 is derived from the combined fermi-lat and h.e.s.s. data, given theassumptions that there is no upturn in the intrinsic spectrum above thefermi-lat energy range and that absorption on the extragalactic backgroundlight (ebl) is not weaker than the lower limit provided by current models. thespectral energy distribution is well described by a simple one-zone synchrotronself-compton (ssc) scenario, if the redshift of the source is less than z &lt;~0.4.

1306.2286	demonstration of a novel technique to measure two-photon exchange  effects in elastic $e^\pm p$ scattering	the discrepancy between proton electromagnetic form factors extracted usingunpolarized and polarized scattering data is believed to be a consequence oftwo-photon exchange (tpe) effects. however, the calculations of tpe correctionshave significant model dependence, and there is limited direct experimentalevidence for such corrections. we present the results of a new experimentaltechnique for making direct $e^\pm p$ comparisons, which has the potential tomake precise measurements over a broad range in $q^2$ and scattering angles. weuse the jefferson lab electron beam and the hall b photon tagger to generate aclean but untagged photon beam. the photon beam impinges on a converter foil togenerate a mixed beam of electrons, positrons, and photons. a chicane is usedto separate and recombine the electron and positron beams while the photon beamis stopped by a photon blocker. this provides a combined electron and positronbeam, with energies from 0.5 to 3.2 gev, which impinges on a liquid hydrogentarget. the large acceptance clas detector is used to identify and reconstructelastic scattering events, determining both the initial lepton energy and thesign of the scattered lepton. the data were collected in two days with aprimary electron beam energy of only 3.3 gev, limiting the data from this runto smaller values of $q^2$ and scattering angle. nonetheless, this measurementyields a data sample for $e^\pm p$ with statistics comparable to those of thebest previous measurements. we have shown that we can cleanly identify elasticscattering events and correct for the difference in acceptance for electron andpositron scattering. the final ratio of positron to electron scattering:$r=1.027\pm0.005\pm0.05$ for $&lt;q^2&gt;=0.206$ gev$^2$ and $0.830\leq \epsilon\leq0.943$.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1508.00779	psr j1906+0722: an elusive gamma-ray pulsar	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0722, a gamma-ray pulsar detected aspart of a blind survey of unidentified fermi large area telescope (lat) sourcesbeing carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, einstein@home.this newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significantremaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in thesecond fermi-lat source catalog (2fgl) and was among the top ten mostsignificant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3fgl). psrj1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of$8.9$ hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. in 2009 august it suffered one of the largest glitchesdetected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar islikely radio-quiet. an off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from thelocation of psr j1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearbysource, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboringsupernova remnant and a molecular cloud. we discuss possible effects which mayhave hindered the detection of psr j1906+0722 in previous searches and describethe methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. we alsodemonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.

1509.01164	status and plans for the array control and data acquisition system of  the cherenkov telescope array	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is the next-generation atmosphericcherenkov gamma-ray observatory. cta will consist of two installations, one inthe northern, and the other in the southern hemisphere, containing tens oftelescopes of different sizes. the cta performance requirements and theinherent complexity associated with the operation, control and monitoring ofsuch a large distributed multi-telescope array leads to new challenges in thefield of the gamma-ray astronomy. the actl (array control and data acquisition)system will consist of the hardware and software that is necessary to controland monitor the cta arrays, as well as to time-stamp, read-out, filter andstore -at aggregated rates of few gb/s- the scientific data. the actl systemmust be flexible enough to permit the simultaneous automatic operation ofmultiple sub-arrays of telescopes with a minimum personnel effort on site. oneof the challenges of the system is to provide a reliable integration of thecontrol of a large and heterogeneous set of devices. moreover, the system isrequired to be ready to adapt the observation schedule, on timescales of a fewtens of seconds, to account for changing environmental conditions or toprioritize incoming scientific alerts from time-critical transient phenomenasuch as gamma ray bursts. this contribution provides a summary of the maindesign choices and plans for building the actl system.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0601663	variability of black hole accretion discs: the cool, thermal disc  component	we extend the model of king et al. (2004) for variability in black holeaccretion discs, by taking proper account of the thermal properties of thedisc. because the degree of variability in the king et al. (2004) model dependssensitively on the ratio of disc thickness to radius, h/r, it is important tofollow the time-dependence of the local disc structure as the variabilityproceeds. in common with previous authors, we develop a one-zone model for thelocal disc structure. we agree that radial heat advection plays an importantrole in determining the inner disc structure, and also find limit-cyclebehaviour. when the stochastic magnetic dynamo model of king et al. (2004) isadded to these models, we find similar variability behaviour to before.  we are now better placed to put physical constraints on model parameters. inparticular, we find that in order to be consistent with the low degree ofvariability seen in the thermal disc component of black hole binaries, we needto limit the energy density of the poloidal field that can be produced by localdynamo cells in the disc to less than a few percent of the energy density ofthe dynamo field within the disc itself.

astro-ph;0609605	new electron-proton bremsstrahlung rates for a hot plasma where the  electron temperature is much smaller than the proton temperature	context: observations of x-ray sources harbouring a black hole and anaccretion disc show the presence of at least two spectral components. onecomponent is black-body radiation from an optically thick standard accretiondisc. the other is produced in a optically thin corona and usually shows apowerlaw behaviour. electron-proton (ep) bremsstrahlung is one of thecontributing radiation mechanisms in the corona. soft photons from theoptically thick disc can compton cool the electrons in the corona and thereforelead to a two-temperature plasma, where electrons and ions have differenttemperatures. aims: we qualitatively discuss effects on ep-bremsstrahlung inthe presence of such a two-temperature plasma. methods: we use the classicaldipole approximation allowing for non-relativistic electrons and protons andapply quantum corrections through high-precision gaunt factors. results: in thetwo-temperature case (t_e&lt; t_p) the protons cause a significant fraction of theep-bremsstrahlung if their speed is high compared to the electrons. we giveaccurate values for ep-bremsstrahlung including quantum-mechanical correctionsin the non-relativistic limit and give some approximations in the relativisticlimit. conclusions: the formulae presented in this paper can be used in modelsof black hole accretion discs where an optically thin corona can comprise atwo-temperature plasma. this work could be extended to include the fullyrelativistic case if required.
