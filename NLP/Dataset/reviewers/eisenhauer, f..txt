0902.4701	the sins survey: modeling the dynamics of z~2 galaxies and the high-z  tully-fisher relation	we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forminggalaxies at z ~ 2 from halpha line emission. the galaxies are selected from thelarger sample of the sins survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotationalmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. the quality ofthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated byrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitableexponential disk models. we obtain a good correlation between the dynamicalmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions mgas~m*) arerequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. we use thederived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity vmax from the modeling toconstruct for the first time the stellar mass tully-fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lowerredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. we find that at z ~ 2.2there is an offset in log(m*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11with respect to the local universe. this result is consistent with thepredictions of the latest n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formationand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filamentsand cooling flows. this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidencefrom sins, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce theobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

0903.1872	the sins survey: sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z ~ 2  star-forming galaxies	we present the sins survey with sinfoni of high redshift galaxies. with 80objects observed and 63 detected, sins is the largest survey of spatiallyresolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forminggalaxies at z~1-3. we describe the selection of the targets, the observations,and the data reduction. we then focus on the "sins halpha sample" of 62rest-uv/optically-selected sources at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.6 for which we targeted primarilythe halpha and [nii] emission lines. only 30% of this sample had previousnear-ir spectroscopic observations. as a whole, the sins halpha sample covers areasonable representation of massive log(m*/msun)&gt;~10 star-forming galaxies atz~1.5-2.5, with some bias towards bluer systems compared to pure k-selectedsamples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. the sample spans twoorders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formationrates, with median values of approximately log(m*/msun) = 10.5, 70 msun/yr, and3/gyr. the ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved onscales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations totypically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. the halpha morphologies tend to beirregular and/or clumpy. about one-third are rotation-dominated yet turbulentdisks, another third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominatedobjects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; thefraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part ofthe sample. the halpha luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on averageroughly twice higher dust attenuation towards the hii regions relative to thebulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formationrates.

0706.2656	dynamical properties of z~2 star forming galaxies and a universal star  formation relation	we present the first comparison of the dynamical properties of differentsamples of z~1.4-3.4 star forming galaxies from spatially resolved imagingspectroscopy from sinfoni/vlt integral field spectroscopy and iram comillimeter interferometry. our samples include 16 rest-frame uv-selected, 16rest-frame optically-selected and 13 submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we findthat restframe uv- and optically bright (k&lt;20) z~2 star forming galaxies aredynamically similar, and follow the same velocity-size relation as diskgalaxies at z~0. in the theoretical framework of rotating disks forming fromdissipative collapse in dark matter halos, the two samples require a spinparameter ranging from 0.06 to 0.2. in contrast bright smgs have largervelocity widths and are much more compact. hence, smgs have lower angularmomenta and higher matter densities than either of the uv- or opticallyselected populations. this indicates that dissipative major mergers maydominate the smgs population, resulting in early spheroids, and that themajority of uv/optically bright galaxies have evolved less violently [...].these early disks may later evolve into spheroids via disk instabilities ormergers. because of their small sizes and large densities, smgs lie at the highsurface density end of a universal (out to z=2.5) "schmidt-kennicutt" relationbetween gas surface density and star formation rate surface density with aslope of ~1.7.

0903.3416	evidence for x-ray synchrotron emission from simultaneous mid-ir to  x-ray observations of a strong sgr a* flare	this paper reports measurements of sgr a* made with naco in l' -band (3.80um), ks-band (2.12 um) and h-band (1.66 um) and with visir in n-band (11.88 um)at the eso vlt, as well as with xmm-newton at x-ray (2-10 kev) wavelengths. on4 april, 2007, a very bright flare was observed from sgr a* simultaneously atl'-band and x-ray wavelengths. no emission was detected using visir. theresulting sed has a blue slope (beta &gt; 0 for nul_nu ~ nu^beta, consistent withnul_nu ~ nu^0.4) between 12 micron and 3.8 micron.  for the first time our high quality data allow a detailed comparison ofinfrared and x-ray light curves with a resolution of a few minutes. the ir andx-ray flares are simultaneous to within 3 minutes. however the ir flare lastssignificantly longer than the x-ray flare (both before and after the x-raypeak) and prominent substructures in the 3.8 micron light curve are clearly notseen in the x-ray data. from the shortest timescale variations in the l'-bandlightcurve we find that the flaring region must be no more than 1.2 r_s insize.  the high x-ray to infrared flux ratio, blue nul_nu slope mir to l' -band, andthe soft nul_nu spectral index of the x-ray flare together place strongconstraints on possible flare emission mechanisms. we find that it isquantitatively difficult to explain this bright x-ray flare with inversecompton processes. a synchrotron emission scenario from an electrondistribution with a cooling break is a more viable scenario.

0908.2177	an extremely top-heavy imf in the galactic center stellar disks	we present new observations of the nuclear star cluster in the central parsecof the galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field spectrographsinfoni on the eso/vlt. our work allows the spectroscopic detection of earlyand late type stars to m_k &gt;= 16, more than 2 magnitudes deeper than ourprevious data sets. our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fideearly-type stars. we find that most of these wolf rayet (wr), o- and b- starsreside in two strongly warped disks between 0.8" and 12" from sgra*, as well asa central compact concentration (the s-star cluster) centered on sgra*. thelater type b stars (m_k&gt;15) in the radial interval between 0.8" and 12" seem tobe in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. the observed dearth oflate type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowingfor stellar collisions. the stellar mass function of the disk stars isextremely top heavy with a best fit power law of dn/dm ~ m^(-0.45+/-0.3). sinceat least the wr/o-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6myrs ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (imf).the mass functions of the s-stars inside 0.8" and of the early-type stars atdistances beyond 12" are compatible with a standard salpeter/kroupa imf (bestfit power law of dn/dm ~ m^(-2.15+/-0.3)).

1002.1224	the power of monitoring stellar orbits	the center of the milky way hosts a massive black hole. the observationalevidence for its existence is overwhelming. the compact radio source sgr a* hasbeen associated with a black hole since its discovery. in the last decade,high-resolution, near-infrared measurements of individual stellar orbits in theinnermost region of the galactic center have shown that at the position of sgra* a highly concentrated mass of 4 x 10^6 m_sun is located. assuming thatgeneral relativity is correct, the conclusion that sgr a* is a massive blackhole is inevitable. without doubt this is the most important application ofstellar orbits in the galactic center. here, we discuss the possibilities goingbeyond the mass measurement offered by monitoring these orbits. they are anextremely useful tool for many scientific questions, such as a geometricdistance estimate to the galactic center or the puzzle, how these stars reachedtheir current orbits. future improvements in the instrumentation will open upthe route to testing relativistic effects in the gravitational potential of theblack hole, allowing to take full advantage of this unique laboratory forcelestial mechanics.

1007.1765	the fringe detection laser metrology for the gravity interferometer at  the vlti	interferometric measurements of optical path length differences of stars overlarge baselines can deliver extremely accurate astrometric data. theinterferometer gravity will simultaneously measure two objects in the field ofview of the very large telescope interferometer (vlti) of the european southernobservatory (eso) and determine their angular separation to a precision of 10micro arcseconds in only 5 minutes. to perform the astrometric measurement withsuch a high accuracy, the differential path length through the vlti and theinstrument has to be measured (and tracked since earth's rotation willpermanently change it) by a laser metrology to an even higher level of accuracy(corresponding to 1 nm in 3 minutes). usually, heterodyne differential pathtechniques are used for nanometer precision measurements, but with thesemethods it is difficult to track the full beam size and to follow the lightpath up to the primary mirror of the telescope. here, we present thepreliminary design of a differential path metrology system, developed withinthe gravity project. it measures the instrumental differential path over thefull pupil size and up to the entrance pupil location. the differential phaseis measured by detecting the laser fringe pattern both on the telescopes'secondary mirrors as well as after reflection at the primary mirror. based onour proposed design we evaluate the phase measurement accuracy based on a fullbudget of possible statistical and systematic errors. we show that thismetrology design fulfills the high precision requirement of gravity.

1008.1984	the two states of sgr a* in the near-infrared: bright episodic flares on  top of low-level continuous variability	in this paper we examine properties of the variable source sgr a* in thenear-infrared (nir) using a very extensive ks-band data set from naco/vltobservations taken 2004 to 2009. we investigate the variability of sgr a* withtwo different photometric methods and analyze its flux distribution. we findsgr a* is continuously emitting and continuously variable in the near-infrared,with some variability occurring on timescales as long as weeks. the fluxdistribution can be described by a lognormal distribution at low intrinsicfluxes (&lt;~5 mjy, dereddened with a_{ks}=2.5). the lognormal distribution has amedian flux of approximately 1.1 mjy, but above 5 mjy the flux distribution issignificantly flatter (high flux events are more common) than expected for theextrapolation of the lognormal distribution to high fluxes. we make a generalidentification of the low level emission above 5 mjy as flaring emission and ofthe low level emission as the quiescent state. we also report here thebrightest ks-band flare ever observed (from august 5th, 2008) which reached anintrinsic ks-band flux of 27.5 mjy (m_{ks}=13.5). this flare was a factor 27increase over the median flux of sgr a*, close to double the brightness of thestar s2, and 40% brighter than the next brightest flare ever observed fromsgr~a*.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1011.5439	performance of astrometric detection of a hotspot orbiting on the  innermost stable circular orbit of the galactic centre black hole	the galactic central black hole sgr a* exhibits outbursts of radiation in thenear infrared (so-called ir flares). one model of these events consists in ahotspot orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbit (isco) of the hole.these outbursts can be used as a probe of the central gravitational potential.one main scientific goal of the second generation vlti instrument gravity is toobserve these flares astrometrically. here, the astrometric precision ofgravity is investigated in imaging mode, which consists in analysing the imagecomputed from the interferometric data. the capability of the instrument to putin light the motion of a hotspot orbiting on the isco of our central black holeis then discussed.  we find that gravity's astrometric precision for a single star in imagingmode is smaller than the schwarzschild radius of sgr a*. the instrument canalso demonstrate that a body orbiting on the last stable orbit of the blackhole is indeed moving. it yields a typical size of the orbit, if the source isas bright as m_k=14.  these results show that gravity allows one to study the close environment ofsgr a*. having access to the isco of the central massive black hole probablyallows constraining general relativity in its strong regime. moreover, if thehotspot model is appropriate, the black hole spin can be constrained.

1107.4618	enriched haloes at redshift $z=2$ with no star-formation: implications  for accretion and wind scenarios	[abridged] in order to understand which process (e.g. galactic winds, coldaccretion) is responsible for the cool (t~10^4 k) halo gas around galaxies, weembarked on a program to study the star-formation properties of galaxiesselected by their mgii absorption signature in quasar spectra. specifically, wesearched for the h-alpha line emission from galaxies near very strong z=2 mgiiabsorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width ew&gt;2 \aa) because these could bethe sign-posts of outflows or inflows. surprisingly, we detect h-alpha fromonly 4 hosts out of 20 sight-lines (and 2 out of the 19 hi-selectedsight-lines), despite reaching a star-formation rate (sfr) sensitivity limit of2.9 m/yr (5-sigma) for a chabrier initial mass function. this low success rateis in contrast with our z=1 survey where we detected 66%\ (14/21) of the mgiihosts. taking into account the difference in sensitivity between the twosurveys, we should have been able to detect &gt;11.4 of the 20 z=2 hosts whereaswe found only 4 galaxies. interestingly, all the z=2 detected hosts haveobserved sfr greater than 9 m/yr, well above our sensitivity limit, while atz=1 they all have sfr less than 9 m/yr, an evolution that is in good agreementwith the evolution of the sfr main sequence. moreover, we show that the z=2undetected hosts are not hidden under the quasar continuum after stacking ourdata and that they also cannot be outside our surveyed area. hence, strong mgiiabsorbers could trace star-formation driven winds in low-mass halos (mhalo &lt;10^{10.6} msun). alternatively, our results imply that z=2 galaxies traced bystrong mgii absorbers do not form stars at a rate expected (3--10 m/yr) fortheir (halo or stellar) masses, supporting the existence of a transition inaccretion efficiency at mhalo ~ 10^{11} msun. this scenario can explain boththe detections and the non-detections.

0710.2882	the initial mass function of the massive star-forming region ngc 3603  from near-infrared adaptive optics observations	we study the initial mass function (imf) of one of the most massive galacticstar-forming regions ngc 3603 to answer a fundamental question in currentastrophysics: is the imf universal, or does it vary? using our very deep, highangular resolution jhksl' images obtained with naos-conica at the vlt at eso,we have successfully revealed the stellar population down to the subsolar massrange in the core of the starburst cluster. the derived imf of ngc 3603 isreasonably fitted by a single power law with index gamma ~ -0.74 within a massrange of 0.4 - 20 msun, substantially flatter than the salpeter-like imf. astrong radial steepening of the imf is observed mainly in the inner r &lt; 30''field, indicating mass segregation in the cluster center. we estimate the totalmass of ngc 3603 to be about 1.0 - 1.6 x 10^4 msun. the derived core density is&gt; 6 x 10^4 msun pc^-3, an order of magnitude larger than e.g., the orion nebulacluster. the estimate of the half-mass relaxation time for solar-mass stars isabout 10 - 40 myr, suggesting that the intermediate- and low-mass stars havenot yet been affected significantly by the dynamical relaxation in the cluster.the relaxation time for the high-mass stars can be comparable to the age of thecluster. we estimate that the stars residing outside the observed field cannotsteepen the imf significantly, indicating our imf adequately describes thewhole cluster. analyzing thoroughly the systematic uncertainties in our imfdetermination, we conclude that the power law index of the imf of ngc 3603 isgamma = -0.74^{+0.62}_{-0.47}. our result thus supports the hypothesis of apotential top-heavy imf in massive star-forming clusters and starbursts.

1112.3264	a gas cloud on its way towards the super-massive black hole in the  galactic centre	measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the compactradio source sagittarius a* at the galactic centre is a black hole four milliontimes the mass of the sun. with the exception of modest x-ray and infraredflares, sgr a* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate andradiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. here wereport the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass ofearth that is falling into the accretion zone of sgr a*. our observationstightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermostradius of approach of only ~3,100 times the event horizon that will be reachedin 2013. over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probablymainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitationalforce. the cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years willprobe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of thesuper-massive black hole. the kilo-electronvolt x-ray emission of sgr a* maybrighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. there may also be agiant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and itsfragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.

1203.6356	simulations of the origin and fate of the galactic center cloud g2	we investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud g2close to the galactic center. our hydrodynamical simulations focussing on thedynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently availableobservations favor two scenarios: a compact cloud which started around the year1995 and a spherical shell of gas, with an apocenter distance within thedisk(s) of young stars and a radius of a few times the size of the compactcloud. the former is able to explain the detected signal of g2 in theposition-velocity diagram of the br gamma emission of the year 2008.5 and2011.5 data. the latter can account for both, g2's signal as well as thefainter extended tail-like structure g2t seen at larger distances from theblack hole and smaller velocities. in contrast, gas stripped from a compactcloud by hydrodynamical interactions is not able to explain the location of thedetected g2t emission in the observed position-velocity diagrams. this favorsthe spherical shell scenario and might be a severe problem for the compactcloud as well as the so-called compact source scenario. from these firstidealized simulations we expect a roughly constant feeding of the supermassiveblack hole through a nozzle-like structure over a long period, starting shortlyafter the closest approach in 2013.51 for the compact cloud. if the matteraccretes in the hot accretion mode, we do not expect a significant boost of thecurrent activity of sgr a* for the compact cloud model, but a boost of theaverage infrared and x-ray luminosity by roughly a factor of 80 for thespherical shell scenario with order of magnitude variations on a timescale of afew months. the near-future evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe ofthe conditions of the gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of themassive black hole in the galactic center.

1302.0124	simulations of the origin and fate of the galactic center cloud g2	we investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud g2close to the galactic center. our hydrodynamical simulations focussing on thedynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently availableobservations favour two scenarios: a compact cloud which started around theyear 1995 and an extended spherical shell of gas, with an apocenter distancewithin the disk(s) of young stars. the former is able to explain the detectedsignal of g2 in the position-velocity-diagram of the year 2008.5 and 2011.5data. the latter can account for both, g2's signal as well as the fainterextended tail-like structure g2t seen at larger distances to the black hole andsmaller velocities. from these first idealised simulations we expect a rise ofthe current activity of sgr a* shortly after the closest approach and aconstant feeding through a nozzle-like structure over a long period. the nearfuture evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe of the conditions ofthe gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of the massive black holein the galactic center and will also give us invaluable information of thefeeding of black holes and the activation of the central source.

1305.7238	hydrodynamical simulations of a compact source scenario for the galactic  center cloud g2	the origin of the dense gas cloud g2 discovered in the galactic center(gillessen et al. 2012) is still a debated puzzle. g2 might be a diffuse cloudor the result of an outflow from an invisible star embedded in it. we presenthydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of different spherically symmetricwinds of a stellar object embedded in g2. we find that the interaction with theambient medium and with the extreme gravitational field of the supermassiveblack hole in the galactic center must be taken into account for such a sourcescenario. the thermal pressure of the hot and dense atmosphere confines thewind, while its ram pressure shapes it via stripping along the orbit, with thedetails depending on the wind parameters. tidal forces squeeze the wind nearpericenter, reducing it to a thin and elongated filament. we also find that inthis scenario most of the br\gamma\ luminosity is expected to come from thedensest part of the wind, which has a highly filamentary structure with lowfilling factor. the observations can be best matched by a mass outflow rate ofmdot,w=8.8 x 10^{-8} msun/yr and a wind velocity of vw = 50 km/s. these valuesare compatible with those of a young t tauri star wind, as already suggested by(scoville &amp; burkert 2013).

0802.0879	kinemetry of sins high-redshift star-forming galaxies: distinguishing  rotating disks from major mergers	we present a simple set of kinematic criteria that can distinguish betweengalaxies dominated by ordered rotational motion and those involved in majormerger events. our criteria are based on the dynamics of the warm ionized gas(as traced by h-alpha) within galaxies, making this analysis accessible tohigh-redshift systems, whose kinematics are primarily traceable throughemission features. using the method of kinemetry (developed by krajnovic andco-workers), we quantify asymmetries in both the velocity and velocitydispersion maps of the warm gas, and the resulting criteria enable us toempirically differentiate between non-merging and merging systems at highredshift. we apply these criteria to 11 of our best-studied rest-frameuv/optical-selected z~2 galaxies for which we have near infrared integral fieldspectroscopic data from sinfoni on the vlt. of these 11 systems, we find that&gt;50% have kinematics consistent with a single rotating disk interpretation,while the remaining systems are more likely undergoing major mergers. thisresult, combined with the short formation timescales of these systems, providesevidence that rapid, smooth accretion of gas plays a significant role in galaxyformation at high redshift.

1404.1014	reaching micro-arcsecond astrometry with long baseline optical  interferometry; application to the gravity instrument	a basic principle of long baseline interferometry is that an optical pathdifference (opd) directly translates into an astrometric measurement. in thesimplest case, the opd is equal to the scalar product between the vectorlinking the two telescopes and the normalized vector pointing toward the star.however, a too simple interpretation of this scalar product leads to seeminglyconflicting results, called here "the baseline paradox". for micro-arcsecondaccuracy astrometry, we have to model in full the metrology measurement. itinvolves a complex system subject to many optical effects: from pure baselineerrors to static, quasi-static and high order optical aberrations. the goal ofthis paper is to present the strategy used by the "general relativity analysisvia vlt interferometry" instrument (gravity) to minimize the biases introducedby these defects. it is possible to give an analytical formula on how thebaselines and tip-tilt errors affect the astrometric measurement. this formuladepends on the limit-points of three type of baselines: the wide-anglebaseline, the narrow-angle baseline, and the imaging baseline. we also,numerically, include non-common path higher-order aberrations, whose amplitudewere measured during technical time at the very large telescope interferometer.we end by simulating the influence of high-order common-path aberrations due toatmospheric residuals calculated from a monte-carlo simulation tool foradaptive optics systems. the result of this work is an error budget of thebiases caused by the multiple optical imperfections, including opticaldispersion. we show that the beam stabilization through both focal and pupiltracking is crucial to the gravity system. assuming the instrument pupil isstabilized at a 4 cm level on m1, and a field tracking below 0.2$\lambda/d$, weshow that gravity will be able to reach its objective of 10$\mu$as accuracy.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

1501.04738	the gravity metrology system: narrow-angle astrometry via phase-shifting  interferometry	the vlti instrument gravity will provide very powerful astrometry bycombining the light from four telescopes for two objects simultaneously. itwill measure the angular separation between the two astronomical objects to aprecision of 10 microarcseconds. this corresponds to a differential opticalpath difference (dopd) between the targets of few nanometers and the pathswithin the interferometer have to be maintained stable to that level. for thispurpose, the novel metrology system of gravity will monitor the internal dopdsby means of phase-shifting interferometry. we present the four-stepphase-shifting concept of the metrology with emphasis on the method used forcalibrating the phase shifts. the latter is based on a phase-step insensitivealgorithm which unambiguously extracts phases in contrast to other methods thatare strongly limited by non-linearities of the phase-shifting device. the mainconstraint of this algorithm is to introduce a robust ellipse fitting routine.via this approach we are able to measure phase shifts in the laboratory with atypical accuracy of lambda/2000 or 1 nanometer of the metrology wavelength.

0807.1184	from rings to bulges: evidence for rapid secular galaxy evolution at z~2  from integral field spectroscopy in the sins survey	we present ha integral field spectroscopy of well resolved, uv/opticallyselected z~2 star-forming galaxies as part of the sins survey with sinfoni onthe eso vlt. our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show thepresence of turbulent rotating star forming rings/disks, plus centralbulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to total dynamicalmass appears to scale with [nii]/ha flux ratio and star formation age. wepropose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies atz~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. highredshift disks exhibit large random motions. this turbulence may in part bestirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretionflows along the filaments of the cosmic web. as a result dynamical friction andviscous processes proceed on a time scale of &lt;1 gyr, at least an order ofmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. early secular evolution thus drivesgas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks andmassive bulges, even without major mergers. secular evolution along withincreased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also helpto account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massivegalaxies at z~2.

astro-ph;0101100	adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of the young stellar objects  in lkh_alpha 225	progress in understanding the embedded stars in lkha225 has been hampered bytheir variability, making it hard to compare data taken at different times, andby the limited resolution of the available data, which cannot probe the smallscales between the two stars. in an attempt to overcome these difficulties, wepresent new near-infrared data on this object taken using the alfa adaptiveoptics system with the mpe 3d integral field spectrometer and the near-infraredcamera omega-cass. the stars themselves have k-band spectra which are dominatedby warm dust emission, analagous to class i-ii for low mass ysos, suggestingthat the stars are in a phase where they are still accreting matter. on theother hand, the ridge of continuum emission between them is rather bluer,suggestive of extincted and/or scattered stellar light rather than direct dustemission. the compactness of the co emission seen toward each star argues foraccretion disks (which can also account for much of the k-band veiling) ratherthan a neutral wind. in contrast to other ysos with co emission, lkha225 has nodetectable br_gamma emission. additionally there is no h_2 detected on thenorthern star, although we do confirm that the strongest h_2 emission is on thesouthern star, where we find it is excited primarily by thermal mechanisms. asecond knot of h_2 is observed to its northeast, with a velocity shift of-75kms and a higher fraction of non-thermal emission. this is discussed withreference to the h2o maser, the molecular outflow, and [s ii] emission observedbetween the stars.

astro-ph;0601492	atmospheric turbulence compensation with laser phase shifting  interferometry	laser guide stars with adaptive optics allow astronomical image correction inthe absence of a natural guide star. single guide star systems with a starcreated in the earth's sodium layer can be used to correct the wavefront in thenear infrared spectral regime for 8-m class telescopes. for possible futuretelescopes of larger sizes, or for correction at shorter wavelengths, the useof a single guide star is ultimately limited by focal anisoplanatism thatarises from the finite height of the guide star. to overcome this limitation wepropose to overlap coherently pulsed laser beams that are expanded over thefull aperture of the telescope, traveling upwards along the same path whichlight from the astronomical object travels downwards. imaging the scatteredlight from the resultant interference pattern with a camera gated to a certainheight above the telescope, and using phase shifting interferometry we havefound a method to retrieve the local wavefront gradients. by sensing thebackscattered light from two different heights, one can fully remove the coneeffect, which can otherwise be a serious handicap to the use of laser guidestars at shorter wavelengths or on larger telescopes. using two laser beamsmulticonjugate correction is possible, resulting in larger corrected fields.with a proper choice of laser, wavefront correction could be expanded to thevisible regime and, due to the lack of a cone effect, the method is applicableto any size of telescope. finally the position of the laser spot could beimaged from the side of the main telescope against a bright background star toretrieve tip-tilt information, which would greatly improve the sky coverage ofthe system.

astro-ph;0603559	sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z~2 uv-selected galaxies:  rotation curves and dynamical evolution	we present 0.5" resolution near-ir integral field spectroscopy of the ha lineemission of 14 z~2 uv-selected bm/bx galaxies obtained with sinfoni at eso/vlt.the mean ha half-light radius r_1/2 is about 4kpc and line emission is detectedover &gt; ~20kpc in several sources. in 9 sources, we detect spatially-resolvedvelocity gradients, from 40 to 410 km/s over ~10kpc. the observed kinematics ofthe larger systems are consistent with orbital motions. four galaxies are welldescribed by rotating disks with clumpy morphologies and we extract rotationcurves out to radii &gt; ~10kpc. one or two galaxies exhibit signatures moreconsistent with mergers. analyzing all 14 galaxies in the framework of rotatingdisks, we infer mean inclination- and beam-corrected maximum circularvelocities v_c of 180+-90 km/s and dynamical masses of (0.5-25)x10^10 msunwithin r_1/2. on average, the dynamical masses are consistent with photometricstellar masses assuming a chabrier/kroupa imf but too small for a 0.1-100 msunsalpeter imf. the specific angular momenta of our bm/bx galaxies are similar tothose of local late-type galaxies. the specific angular momenta of theirbaryons are comparable to those of their dark matter halos. extrapolating fromthe average v_c at 10kpc, the virial mass of the typical halo of a galaxy inour sample is 10^(11.7+-0.5) msun. kinematic modeling of the 3 best casesimplies a ratio of v_c to local velocity dispersion of order 2-4 andaccordingly a large geometric thickness. we argue that this suggests a massaccretion (alternatively, gas exhaustion) timescale of ~500myr. we also arguethat if our bm/bx galaxies were initially gas rich, their clumpy disks willsubsequently lose their angular momentum and form compact bulges on a timescaleof ~1 gyr.

astro-ph;0606527	lyman break galaxies under a microscope: the small scale dynamics and  mass of an arc in the cluster 1e0657-56	using the near-infrared integral-field spectrograph spiffi on the vlt, wehave studied the spatially-resolved dynamics in the z=3.2 strongly lensedgalaxy 1e0657-56 ``arc+core''. the lensing configuration suggests that the highsurface brightness ``core'' is the m=20 magnified central 1 kpc of the galaxy(seen at a spatial resolution of about 200 pc in the source plane), whereas thefainter ``arc'' is a more strongly magnified peripheral region of the samegalaxy at about a half-light radius, which otherwise appears to be a typicalz=3 lyman break galaxy.  the overall shape of the position-velocity diagram resembles the ``rotationcurves'' of the inner few kpcs of nearby l* spiral galaxies. the projectedvelocities rise rapidly to 75 km/s within the core. this implies a dynamicalmass of m_dyn = 10^9.3 m_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in thissystem the equivalent of the mass of a present-day l* bulge at the same radiuswas already in place by z&gt;=3. approximating the circular velocity of the haloby the measured asymptotic velocity of the rotation curve, we estimate a darkmatter halo mass of m_halo = 10^11.7 +/- 0.3, in good agreement withlarge-scale clustering studies of lyman break galaxies. the baryonic collapsefraction is low compared to actively star-forming ``bx'' and low-redshiftgalaxies around z=2, perhaps implying comparatively less gas infall to smallradii or efficient feedback. even more speculatively, the high central massdensity might indicate highly dissipative gas collapse in very early stages ofgalaxy evolution, in approximate agreement with what is expected for``inside-out'' galaxy formation models.

astro-ph;0606530	extreme gas kinematics in the z=2.2 powerful radio galaxy mrc1138-262:  evidence for efficient agn feedback in the early universe?	to explain the properties of the most massive low-redshift galaxies and theshape of their mass function, recent models of galaxy evolution include strongagn feedback to complement starburst-driven feedback in massive galaxies. usingthe near-infrared integral-field spectrograph spiffi on the vlt, we searchedfor direct evidence for such a feedback in the optical emission line gas aroundthe z=2.16 powerful radio galaxy mrc1138-262, likely a massive galaxy information. the kpc-scale kinematics, with fwhms and relative velocities &lt;= 2400km/s and nearly spherical spatial distribution, do not resemble large-scalegravitational motion or starburst-driven winds. order-of-magnitude timescaleand energy arguments favor the agn as the only plausible candidate toaccelerate the gas, with a total energy injection of a few x 10^60 ergs ormore, necessary to power the outflow, and relatively efficient coupling betweenradio jet and ism. observed outflow properties are in gross agreement with themodels, and suggest that agn winds might have a similar, or perhaps larger,cosmological significance than starburst-driven winds, if mrc1138-262 is indeedarchetypal. moreover, the outflow has the potential to remove significant gasfractions (&lt;= 50%) from a &gt;l* galaxy within a few 10 to 100 myrs, fast enoughto preserve the observed [alpha/fe] overabundance in massive galaxies at lowredshift. using simple arguments, it appears that feedback like that observedin mrc1138-262 may have sufficient energy to inhibit material from infallinginto the dark matter halo and thus regulate galaxy growth as required in somerecent models of hierarchical structure formation.

astro-ph;0611737	a polarised infrared flare from sagittarius a* and the signatures of  orbiting plasma hotspots	in this article we summarise and discuss the infrared, radio, and x-rayemission from the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre, sgra*. weinclude new results from near-infrared polarimetric imaging observationsobtained on may 31st, 2006. in that night, a strong flare in ks band (2.08microns) reaching top fluxes of ~16 mjy could be observed. this flare washighly polarised (up to ~40%) and showed clear sub-structure on a time scale of15 minutes, including a swing in the polarisation angle of about 70 degrees.for the first time we were able to observe both polarised flux and short-timevariability, with high significance in the same flare event. this result addsdecisive information to the puzzle of the sgra* activity. the observedpolarisation angle during the flare peak is the same as observed in two eventsin 2004 and 2005. our observations strongly support the dynamical emissionmodel of a decaying plasma hotspot orbiting sgra* on a relativistic orbit. theobserved polarisation parameters and their variability with time might allow toconstrain the orientation of accretion disc and spin axis with respect to thegalaxy.

astro-ph;0611769	intense star-formation and feedback at high redshift: spatially-resolved  properties of the z=2.6 submillimeter galaxy smmj14011+0252	we present a detailed analysis of the spatially-resolved properties of thelensed submillimeter galaxy smmj14011+0252 at z=2.56, combining deepnear-infrared integral-field data obtained with spiffi on the vlt with othermulti-wavelength data sets. the broad characteristics of smmj14011+0252 are inagreement with what is expected for the early evolution of local massivespheroidal galaxies. from continuum and line flux, velocity, and dispersionmaps, we measure the kinematics, star-formation rates, gas densities, andextinction for individual subcomponents. the star formation intensity issimilar to low-redshift ``maximal starbursts'', while the line fluxes and thedynamics of the emission line gas provide direct evidence for astarburst-driven wind with physical properties very similar to localsuperwinds. we also find circumstantial evidence for "self-regulated" starformation within j1. the relative velocity of the bluer companion j2 yields adynamical mass estimate for j1 within about 20 kpc, m_dyn \sim 1\times 10^{11}m_sun. the relative metallicity of j2 is 0.4 dex lower than in j1n/s,suggesting different star formation histories. sed fitting of the continuumpeak j1c confirms and substantiates previous suggestions that this component isa z=0.25 interloper. when removing j1c, the stellar continuum and h-alpha lineemission appear well aligned spatially in two individual components j1n andj1s, and coincide with two kinematically distinct regions in the velocity map,which might well indicate a merging system. this highlights the closesimilarity between smgs and ulirgs, which are often merger-driven maximalstarbursts, and suggests that the intrinsic mechanisms of star-formation andrelated feedback are similar to low-redshift strongly star-forming systems.
