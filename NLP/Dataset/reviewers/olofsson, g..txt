0908.4341	odin observations of water in molecular outflows and shocks	aims. we investigate the ortho-water abundance in outflows and shocks inorder to improve our knowledge of shock chemistry and of the physics behindmolecular outflows. methods. we have used the odin space observatory to observethe h2o(110-101) line. we obtain strip maps and single pointings of 13 outflowsand two supernova remnants where we report detections for eight sources. wehave used radex to compute the beam averaged abundances of o-h2o relative toh2. in the case of non-detection, we derive upper limits on the abundance.results. observations of co emission from the literature show that the volumedensity of h2 can vary to a large extent, a parameter that puts severeuncertainties on the derived abundances. our analysis shows a wide range ofabundances reflecting the degree to which shock chemistry is affecting theformation and destruction of water. we also compare our results with recentresults from the swas team. conclusions. elevated abundances of ortho-water arefound in several sources. the abundance reaches values as high as what would beexpected from a theoretical c-type shock where all oxygen, not in the form ofco, is converted to water. however, the high abundances we derive could also bedue to the low densities (derived from co observations) that we assume. thewater emission may in reality stem from high density regions much smaller thanthe odin beam. we do not find any relationship between the abundance and themass loss rate. on the other hand, there is a relation between the derivedwater abundance and the observed maximum outflow velocity.

0910.2738	a submillimetre search for cold extended debris disks in the beta  pictoris moving group	the beta pictoris moving group is a nearby stellar association of young(12myr) co-moving stars including the classical debris disk star beta pictoris.due to their proximity and youth they are excellent targets when searching forsubmillimetre emission from cold, extended, dust components produced bycollisions in kuiper-belt-like disks. they also allow an age independent studyof debris disk properties as a function of other stellar parameters. weobserved 7 infrared-excess stars in the beta pictoris moving group with thelaboca bolometer array, operating at a central wavelength of 870 micron at the12-m submillimetre telescope apex. the main emission at these wavelengths comesfrom large, cold dust grains, which constitute the main part of the total dustmass, and hence, for an optically thin case, make better estimates on the totaldust mass than earlier infrared observations. fitting the spectral energydistribution with combined optical and infrared photometry gives information onthe temperature and radial extent of the disk. from our sample, beta pic,hd181327, and hd172555 were detected with at least 3-sigma certainty, while allothers are below 2-sigma and considered non-detections. the image of beta picshows an offset flux density peak located near the south-west extension of thedisk, similar to the one previously found by scuba at the jcmt. we present sedfits for detected sources and give an upper limit on the dust mass forundetected ones. we find a mean fractional dust luminosity f_dust=11x10^{-4} att=12myr, which together with recent data at 100myr suggests an f_dust proptot^{-alpha} decline of the emitting dust, with alpha &gt; 0.8.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

1005.1502	herschel images of ngc 6720: h2 formation on dust grains	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained of ngc 6720 (the ringnebula). this is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that iscurrently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula arerecombining. from the pacs and spire images we conclude that there is astriking resemblance between the dust distribution and the h2 emission, whichappears to be observational evidence that h2 forms on grain surfaces. we havedeveloped a photoionization model of the nebula with the cloudy code which weused to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possibleformation scenarios for the h2. we conclude that the most plausible scenario isthat the h2 resides in high density knots which were formed after therecombination of the gas started when the central star entered the coolingtrack. hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of therecombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. h2 formationin the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent astrong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still beongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and theproperties of the grains in the knots.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.4675	silicon in the dust formation zone of irc +10216 as observed with pacs  and spire on board herschel	the interstellar medium is enriched primarily by matter ejected from evolvedlow and intermediate mass stars. the outflows from these stars create acircumstellar envelope in which a rich gas-phase and dust-nucleation chemistrytakes place. we observed the nearest carbon-rich evolved star, irc+10216, usingthe pacs (55-210 {\mu}m) and spire (194-672 {\mu}m) spectrometers on boardherschel. we find several tens of lines from sis and sio, including lines fromthe v=1 vibrational level. for sis these transitions range up to j=124-123,corresponding to energies around 6700k, while the highest detectable transitionis j=90-89 for sio, which corresponds to an energy around 8400k. both speciestrace the dust formation zone of irc+10216, and the broad energy rangesinvolved in their detected transitions permit us to derive the physicalproperties of the gas and the particular zone in which each species has beenformed. this allows us to check the accuracy of chemical thermodynamicalequilibrium models and the suggested depletion of sis and sio due to accretiononto dust grains.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1011.2070	imaging the circumstellar dust distribution around agb stars	stellar light from an agb star is scattered by the circumstellar dust andpolarized in the direction perpendicular to the source. therefore, images ofcircumstellar envelopes around agb stars in polarized light traces the dustdistribution and can be used to search for asymmetries, and to achieve a betterunderstanding of the mechanisms at play when agb stars are transformed intoplanetary nebulae. the polcor instrument is a combined imager, polarimeter, andcoronograph providing images with an angular resolution down to 0.2". we haveused it to map the dust distribution around three agb stars: w aql, and thedetached shell sources dr ser, and u cam. w aql is a binary and we findindications of a bi-polar dust distribution around the star. the observationsof the latter two sources clearly reveal the detached shells, likely the resultof a brief, strongly enhanced mass-loss rate during the late evolution of thesestars. mapping the detached shells gives us clues to the symmetry of the massloss and important evolutionary processes.

1104.2316	warm water vapour in the sooty outflow from a luminous carbon star	in 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbonstar irc+10216 was announced. this detection challenged the currentunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to beabsent in carbon-rich stars. several explanations for the occurrence of watervapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets ordwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, andphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. however, the only waterline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, byitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. here we report on thedetection by the herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in thefar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of irc+10216, including somehigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 k. the emission ofthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour ispresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. a plausible explanation forthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet(uv) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. this mechanism triggersalso the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observedabundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

1202.5637	multi-line detection of o2 toward rho oph a	models of pure gas-phase chemistry in well-shielded regions of molecularclouds predict relatively high levels of molecular oxygen, o2, and water, h2o.contrary to expectation, the space missions swas and odin found only very smallamounts of water vapour and essentially no o2 in the dense star-forminginterstellar medium. only toward rho oph a did odin detect a weak line of o2 at119 ghz in a beam size of 10 arcmin. a larger telescope aperture such as thatof the herschel space observatory is required to resolve the o2 emission and topinpoint its origin. we use the heterodyne instrument for the far infraredaboard herschel to obtain high resolution o2 spectra toward selected positionsin rho oph a. these data are analysed using standard techniques for o2excitation and compared to recent pdr-like chemical cloud models. the 487.2ghzline was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho oph a. inaddition, an oversampled map of the 773.8ghz transition revealed the detectionof the line in only half of the observed area. based on their ratios, thetemperature of the o2 emitting gas appears to vary quite substantially, withwarm gas (&gt; 50 k) adjacent to a much colder region, where temperatures arebelow 30 k. the exploited models predict o2 column densities to be sensitive tothe prevailing dust temperatures, but rather insensitive to the temperatures ofthe gas. in agreement with these model, the observationally determined o2column densities seem not to depend strongly on the derived gas temperatures,but fall into the range n(o2) = (3 to &gt;6)e15/cm^2. beam averaged o2 abundancesare about 5e-8 relative to h2. combining the hifi data with earlier odinobservations yields a source size at 119 ghz of about 4 - 5 arcmin,encompassing the entire rho oph a core.

1204.5037	herschel images of fomalhaut. an extrasolar kuiper belt at the height of  its dynamical activity	fomalhaut is a young, nearby star that is suspected to harbor an infantplanetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris. wepresent far-infrared images obtained with the herschel space observatory withan angular resolution between 5.7 and 36.7 arcsec at wavelengths between 70 and500 micrometer. the images show the main debris belt in great detail. even athigh spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. the region in between thebelt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission isobserved here as well. also at the location of the star, excess emission isdetected.  we use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive theparameters of the debris disk. we include detailed models of the interaction ofthe dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and thetemperature determination. comparing these models to the spatially resolvedtemperature information contained in the images allows us to place strongconstraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system byradiation pressure. we use this to derive the dynamical parameters of thesystem.  the appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in whichdust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in anarrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. dust particleswith sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. the equivalent of2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoiramounting to 110 earth masses. from comparison of their scattering and thermalproperties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, whichindicates a cometary origin. the excess emission at the location of the starmay be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be dueto gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind.

1206.5982	an independent distance estimate to cw leo	cw leo has been observed six times between october 2009 and june 2012 withthe spire instrument on board the herschel satellite. variability has beendetected in the flux emitted by the central star with a period of 639 \pm 4days, in good agreement with determinations in the literature. variability isalso detected in the bow shock around cw leo that had previously been detectedin the ultraviolet and herschel pacs/spire data. although difficult to provedirectly, our working hypothesis is that this variability is directly relatedto that of the central star. in this case, fitting a sine curve with the periodfixed to 639 days results in a time-lag in the variability between bow shockand the central star of 402 \pm 37 days. the orientation of the bow shockrelative to the plane of the sky is unknown (but see below). for an inclinationangle of zero degrees, the observed time-lag translates into a distance to cwleo of 130 \pm 13 pc, and for non-zero inclination angles the distance issmaller. fitting the shape of the bow shock with an analytical model (wilkin1996), the effect of the inclination angle on the distance may be estimated.making the additional assumption that the relative peculiar velocity betweenthe interstellar medium (ism) and cw leo is determined entirely by the starspace velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (i.e. a stationaryism), the inclination angle is found to be (-33.3 \pm 0.8) degrees based on theobserved proper motion and radial velocity. using the wilkin model, our currentbest estimate of the distance to cw leo is 123 \pm 14 pc. for a distance of 123pc, we derive a mean luminosity of 7790 \pm 150 lsol (internal error).

1207.4427	vlt imaging of the {\beta} pictoris gas disk	circumstellar debris disks older than a few myr should be largely devoid ofprimordial gas remaining from the protoplanetary disk phase. tracing the originof observed atomic gas in keplerian rotation in the edge-on debris disksurrounding the ~12 myr old star {\beta} pictoris requires more detailedinformation about its spatial distribution than has previously been acquired bylimited slit spectroscopy. especially indications of asymmetries and presenceof ca ii gas at high disk latitudes call for additional investigation. we setout to recover a complete image of the fe i and ca ii gas emission around{\beta} pic by spatially resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observationsto better understand the morphology and origin of the gaseous disk component.the multiple fiber facility flames/giraffe at the vlt, with the large ifuargus, was used to obtain spatially resolved optical spectra in four regionscovering the northeast and southwest side of the disk. emission lines from fe iand ca ii were mapped and could be used to fit a parametric function for thedisk gas distribution, using a gas-ionisation code for gas-poor debris disks.both fe i and ca ii emission are clearly detected, with the former dominatingalong the disk midplane, and the latter revealing vertically more extended gas.the surface intensity of the fe i emission is lower but more extended in thenortheast (reaching the 210 au limit of our observations) than in thesouthwest, while ca ii shows the opposite asymmetry. the modelled fe gas diskprofile shows a linear increase in scale height with radius, and a verticalprofile that suggests dynamical interaction with the dust. we alsoqualitatively demonstrate that the ca ii emission profile can be explained byoptical thickness in the disk midplane, and does not require ca to be spatiallyseparated from fe.

1211.2626	comet-like mineralogy of olivine crystals in an extrasolar proto-kuiper  belt	some planetary systems harbour debris disks containing planetesimals such asasteroids and comets. collisions between such bodies produce small dustparticles, the spectral features of which reveal their composition and, hence,that of their parent bodies. a measurement of the composition of olivinecrystals has been done for the protoplanetary disk hd100546 and for olivinecrystals in the warm inner parts of planetary systems. the latter compares wellwith the iron-rich olivine in asteroids (x&lt;0.29). in the cold outskirts of thebeta pictoris system, an analogue to the young solar system, olivine crystalswere detected but their composition remained undetermined, leaving unknown howthe composition of the bulk of solar system cometary olivine grains compareswith that of extrasolar comets. here we report the detection of the69-micrometre-wavelength band of olivine crystals in the spectrum of betapictoris. because the disk is optically thin, we can associate the crystalswith an extrasolar proto-kuiper belt a distance of 15-45 astronomical unitsfrom the star (one astronomical unit is the sun-earth distance), determinetheir magnesium-rich composition (x=0.01+/-0.001) and show that they make up3.6+/-1.0 per cent of the total dust mass. these values are strikingly similarto those for the dust emitted by the most primitive comets in the solar system,even though beta pictoris is more massive and more luminous and has a differentplanetary system architecture.

1312.0924	herschel hifi observations of ionised carbon in the {\beta} pictoris  debris disk	context: the dusty debris disk around the $\sim$20 myr old main-sequencea-star {\beta} pictoris is known to contain gas. evidence points towards asecondary origin of the gas as opposed to being a direct remnant form theinitial protoplanetary disk, although the dominant gas production mechanism isso far not identified. the origin of the observed overabundance of c and ocompared to solar abundances of metallic elements, e.g. na and fe, is alsounclear. aims: our goal is to constrain the spatial distribution of c in thedisk, and thereby the gas origin and its abundance pattern. methods: we usedthe hifi instrument onboard herschel to observe and spectrally resolve ciiemission at 158 $\mu$m from the {\beta} pic debris disk. assuming keplerianrotation, we use the spectrally resolved line profile to constrain the spatialdistribution of the gas. results: we show that most of the gas is locatedaround $\sim$100 au or beyond. we estimate a total c gas mass of$1.3\times10^{-2}$ m$_\oplus$. the data suggest that more gas is located on thesouthwest side of the disk than on the northeast side. the data are consistentwith the hypothesis of a well-mixed gas (constant c/fe ratio throughout thedisk). assuming instead a spatial profile expected from a simplified accretiondisk model, we found it to give a significantly worse fit to the observations.conclusions: since the bulk of the gas is found outside 30 au, we argue thatthe cometary objects known as "falling evaporating bodies" are unlikely to bethe dominant source of gas; production from grain-grain collisions orphotodesorption seems more likely. the incompatibility of the observations witha simplified accretion disk model could favour a preferential depletionexplanation for the overabundance of c and o. more stringent constraints on thespatial distribution will be available from alma observations of ci at 609$\mu$m.

1401.6896	how dusty is alpha centauri? excess or non-excess over the infrared  photospheres of main-sequence stars	[abridged] debris discs around main-sequence stars indicate the presence oflarger rocky bodies. the components of the nearby binary acentauri have higherthan solar metallicities, which is thought to promote giant planet formation.we aim to determine the level of emission from debris in the acen system.having already detected the temperature minimum, tmin, of acena, we hereattempt to do so also for the companion acenb. using the acen stars astemplates, we study possible effects tmin may have on the detectability ofunresolved dust discs around other stars. we use herschel and apex photometryto determine the stellar spectral energy distributions. in addition, we useapex for spectral line mapping to study the complex background around acen seenin the photometric images. models of stellar atmospheres and discs are used toestimate the amount of debris around these stars. for solar-type stars, afractional dust luminosity fd 2e-7 could account for seds that do not exhibitthe tmin-effect. slight excesses at the 2.5 sigma level are observed at 24 mufor both stars, which, if interpreted to be due to dust, would correspond to fd(1-3)e-5. dynamical disc modelling leads to rough mass estimates of theputative zodi belts around the acen stars, viz. &lt;~4e-6 mmoon of 4 to 1000 musize grains, distributed according to n a^-3.5. similarly, for filled-in tminemission, corresponding ekbs could account for ~1e-3 mmoon of dust. lightscattered and/or thermally emitted by exo-zodi discs will have profoundimplications for future spectroscopic missions designed to search forbiomarkers in the atmospheres of earth-like planets. the f-ir sed of acenb ismarginally consistent with the presence of a minimum temperature region in theupper atmosphere. we also show that an acena-like temperature minimum mayresult in an erroneous apprehension about the presence of dust around otherstars.

0803.1294	q1 eri: a solar-type star with a planet and a dust belt	only very few solar-type stars exhibiting an infrared excess and harbouringplanets are known to date. indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disksystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.consequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poorstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or thephysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias andselection effects. finding more examples would be very significant. theselected target, q1 eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess aplanet, q1 eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at iras wavelengths, but hadremained undetected in the millimeter regime. therefore, submm flux densitieswould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of theplanetary disk. consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1eri. the detected dust toward q1 eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable factthat the entire sed, from the ir to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a singletemperature blackbody function (60 k). this would imply that the emittingregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much largerthan the orbital distance of q1 eri b, and that the emitting particles areconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. however, the 870 micron source isextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 au. therefore, aphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 k),located at 300 au from the star and about 60 au wide. the minimum mass of 0.04mearth (3 mmoon) of 1 mm-size icy ring-particles is considerable, given thestellar age of about 1 gyr. these big grains form an inner edge at about 25 au,which may suggest the presence of an unseen outer planet (q1 eri c).

1412.3923	alma observations of alpha centauri: first detection of main-sequence  stars at 3mm wavelength	the precise mechanisms that provide the non-radiative energy for heating thechromosphere and the corona of the sun and those of other stars constitute anactive field of research. by studying stellar chromospheres one aims atidentifying the relevant physical processes. defining the permittable extent ofthe parameter space can also serve as a template for the sun-as-a-star. earlierobservations with herschel and apex have revealed the temperature minimum ofalpha cen, but these were unable to spatially resolve the binary intoindividual components. with the data reported here, we aim at remedying thisshortcoming. furthermore, these earlier data were limited to the wavelengthregion between 100 and 870mu. in the present context, we intend to extend thespectral mapping to longer wavelengths, where the contrast between stellarphotospheric and chromospheric emission becomes increasingly evident. alma isparticularly suited to point sources, such as unresolved stars. alma providesthe means to achieve our objectives with both its high sensitivity of thecollecting area for the detection of weak signals and the high spatialresolving power of its adaptable interferometer for imaging close multiplestars. this is the first detection of main-sequence stars at a wavelength of3mm. furthermore, the individual components of the binary alpha cenab areclearly detected and spatially well resolved at all alma wavelengths. the highs/n of these data permit accurate determination of their relative flux ratios.the previously obtained flux ratio of 0.44, which was based on measurements inthe optical and at 70mu, is consistent with the present alma results, albeitwith a large error bar. given the distinct difference in their cyclic activity,the similarity of their submm seds appears surprising.

1412.5785	constraints on the gas content of the fomalhaut debris belt. can  gas-dust interactions explain the belt's morphology?	context: the 440 myr old main-sequence a-star fomalhaut is surrounded by aneccentric debris belt with sharp edges. this sort of a morphology is usuallyattributed to planetary perturbations, but the orbit of the only planetarycandidate detected so far, fomalhaut b, is too eccentric to efficiently shapethe belt. alternative models that could account for the morphology withoutinvoking a planet are stellar encounters and gas-dust interactions.  aims: we aim to test the possibility of gas-dust interactions as the originof the observed morphology by putting upper limits on the total gas content ofthe fomalhaut belt.  methods: we derive upper limits on the cii 158 $\mu$m and oi 63 $\mu$memission by using non-detections from the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory. line fluxes areconverted into total gas mass using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium(non-lte) code radex. we consider two different cases for the elementalabundances of the gas: solar abundances and abundances similar to thoseobserved for the gas in the $\beta$ pictoris debris disc.  results: the gas mass is shown to be below the millimetre dust mass by afactor of at least $\sim$3 (for solar abundances) respectively $\sim$300 (for$\beta$ pic-like abundances).  conclusions: the lack of gas co-spatial with the dust implies that gas-dustinteractions cannot efficiently shape the fomalhaut debris belt. the morphologyis therefore more likely due to a yet unseen planet (fomalhaut c) or stellarencounters.

1501.00863	classifying the secondary component of the binary star w aquilae	aims: the object w aql is an asymptotic giant branch (agb) star with a faintcompanion. by determining more carefully the properties of the companion, wehope to better constrain the properties of the agb star. methods: we presentnew spectral observations of the binary star w aql at minimum and maximumbrightness and new photometric observations of w aql at minimum brightness.results: the composite spectrum near minimum light is predominantly from thecompanion at wavelengths $\lambda$ &lt; 6000 $\aa$. this spectrum can beclassified as f8 to g0, and the brightness of the companion is that of a dwarfstar. therefore, it can be concluded that the companion is a main sequencestar. from this, we are able to constrain the mass of the agb component to 1.04- 3 $m_\odot$ and the mass of the w aql system to 2.1 - 4.1 $m_\odot$ . ourphotometric results are broadly consistent with this classification and suggestthat the main sequence component suffers from approximately 2 mag of extinctionin the v band primarily due to the dust surrounding the agb component.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

1504.06277	gas and dust in the star-forming region rho oph a: the dust opacity  exponent beta and the gas-to-dust mass ratio g2d	we aim at determining the spatial distribution of the gas and dust instar-forming regions and address their relative abundances in quantitativeterms. we also examine the dust opacity exponent beta for spatial and/ortemporal variations. using mapping observations of the very dense rho oph acore, we examined standard 1d and non-standard 3d methods to analyse data offar-infrared and submillimeter (submm) continuum radiation. the resulting dustsurface density distribution can be compared to that of the gas. the latter wasderived from the analysis of accompanying molecular line emission, observedwith herschel from space and with apex from the ground. as a gas tracer we usedn2h+, which is believed to be much less sensitive to freeze-out than co and itsisotopologues. radiative transfer modelling of the n2h+(j=3-2) and (j=6-5)lines with their hyperfine structure explicitly taken into account providessolutions for the spatial distribution of the column density n(h2), hence thesurface density distribution of the gas. the gas-to-dust mass ratio is varyingacross the map, with very low values in the central regions around the core sm1. the global average, =88, is not far from the canonical value of 100,however. in rho oph a, the exponent beta of the power-law description for thedust opacity exhibits a clear dependence on time, with high values of 2 for theenvelope-dominated emission in starless class -1 sources to low values close to0 for the disk-dominated emission in class iii objects. beta assumesintermediate values for evolutionary classes in between. since beta isprimarily controlled by grain size, grain growth mostly occurs in circumstellardisks. the spatial segregation of gas and dust, seen in projection toward thecore centre, probably implies that, like c18o, also n2h+ is frozen onto thegrains.

0805.3077	a detailed study of the l1641n star formation region	we search for young stellar objects (ysos) in the l1641n cluster andcharacterize the star formation activity through determination of the agedistribution, mass function, spatial distribution, and the star formationhistory.  we detect a total of 216 (spitzer or $i$ band) sources in l1641n, 89 of whichare yso candidates. most of the spectra are of m-type with h$\alpha$ stronglyin emission, and many have li 6707 in absorption. the four brightest $i$ bandsources (f and g stars) are suggested as foreground stars, and the l1641n irassource is shown to be the combined flux of at least four sources. we find thatthe interstellar extinction is well-fit in the optical and near-ir by a powerlaw with an exponent of 1.58, although in the mid-ir the spitzer observationsshow a higher extinction than expected from theory. the median age of the ysosample is $\sim$1 myr and the resulting mf has a flat distribution for lowmasses down to the completeness limit. there is evidence of a constant starformation rate of one star in 3.7 $\times$ 10$^4$ yr during the past few myr.we find 11 sources older than 10 myr and a spatial separation between youngerand older ysos, suggesting that many of the older stars formed in l1641n couldhave left the cluster, giving the appearance of an increased star formationrate with time.

1508.03345	the design and flight performance of the pogolite pathfinder  balloon-borne hard x-ray polarimeter	in the 50 years since the advent of x-ray astronomy there have been manyscientific advances due to the development of new experimental techniques fordetecting and characterising x-rays. observations of x-ray polarisation have,however, not undergone a similar development. this is a shortcoming since aplethora of open questions related to the nature of x-ray sources could beresolved through measurements of the linear polarisation of emitted x-rays. thepogolite pathfinder is a balloon-borne hard x-ray polarimeter operating in the25 - 240 kev energy band from a stabilised observation platform. polarisationis determined using coincident energy deposits in a segmented array of plasticscintillators surrounded by a bgo anticoincidence system and a polyethyleneneutron shield. the pogolite pathfinder was launched from the ssc esrange spacecentre in july 2013. a near-circumpolar flight was achieved with a duration ofapproximately two weeks. the flight performance of the pathfinder design isdiscussed for the three crab observations conducted. the signal-to-backgroundratio for the observations is shown to be 0.25$\pm$0.03 and the minimumdetectable polarisation (99% c.l.) is (28.4$\pm$2.2)%. a strategy for thecontinuation of the pogolite programme is outlined based on experience gainedduring the 2013 maiden flight.

astro-ph;0007319	the iso-lws map of the serpens cloud core: i. the seds of the ir/smm  sources	iso-lws mapping observations of the serpens molecular cloud core arepresented. the spectral range is 50 - 200 micron and the map size is 8' x 8'.these observations suffer from severe source confusion at fir wavelengths andwe employ a maximum likelihood method for the spectro-spatial deconvolution.the strong and fairly isolated source smm1 firs1 presented a test case, whosemodelled spectral energy distribution (sed), within observational errors, isidentical to the observed one. the model results for the other infrared andsubmillimetre sources are therefore likely to represent their correct seds.simulations demonstrating the reliability and potential of the developed methodsupport this view. for the majority of sources the peak of the seds is foundwithin the spectral range of the lws and derived temperatures are generallyhigher (&gt;30k) than have been found by earlier deconvolution attempts using irasdata. smm sizes are found to be only a few arcsec in diameter. in addition, thesmms are generally optically thick even at lws wavelengths. self-consistentradiative transfer calculations indicates that the smms are optically thick outto even longer wavelengths. models were calculated for five sources, for whichsufficient data were available, viz. smm 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. these models areoptically thick out to millimetre wavelengths (wavelength of unit optical depth900 to 1400 micron). envelope masses for these smms are in the range 2-6 msun,which is of course considerably more massive than estimates based on theoptically thin assumption. the luminosities are in the range 10-70 lsun,suggesting the formation of low-mass to intermediate mass stars, so that theexistence of such massive envelopes argues for extreme youth of the smms in theserpens cloud core.

astro-ph;0103373	isocam observations of the rho ophiuchi cloud: luminosity and mass  functions of the pre-main sequence embedded cluster	we present the results of the first extensive mid-infrared (ir) imagingsurvey of the rho ophiuchi embedded cluster, performed with the isocam cameraon board the iso satellite. the main molecular cloud l1688, as well as l1689nand l1689s, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 and 14.3micron. a total of 425 sources are detected including 16 class i, 123 class ii,and 77 class iii young stellar objects (ysos). essentially all of the mid-irsources coincide with near-ir sources, but a large proportion of them arerecognized for the first time as ysos. our dual-wavelength survey allows us toidentify essentially all the ysos with ir excess in the embedded cluster downto fnu ~ 10 - 15 mjy. it more than doubles the known population of class iiysos and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars inthe rho ophiuchi central region. the stellar luminosity function of thecomplete sample of class ii ysos is derived with a good accuracy down to l=0.03 lsun. a modeling of this lumino- sity function, using available pre-mainsequence tracks and plausible star for- mation histories, allows us to derivethe mass distribution of the class ii ysos which arguably reflects the imf ofthe embedded cluster. we estimate that the imf in rho ophiuchi is welldescribed by a two-component power law with a low- mass index of -0.35+/-0.25,a high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the salpeter value of -1.35),and a break occurring at m = 0.55+/-0.25 msun. this imf is flat with noevidence for a low-mass cutoff down to at least 0.06 msun.

astro-ph;0303139	submillimeter emission from water in the w3 region	we have mapped the submillimeter emission from the 1(10)-1(01) transition ofortho-water in the w3 star-forming region. a 5'x5' map of the w3 irs4 and w3irs5 region reveals strong water lines at half the positions in the map. therelative strength of the odin lines compared to previous observations by swassuggests that we are seeing water emission from an extended region. across muchof the map the lines are double-peaked, with an absorption feature at -39 km/s;however, some positions in the map show a single strong line at -43 km/s. weinterpret the double-peaked lines as arising from optically thick,self-absorbed water emission near the w3 irs5, while the narrower blue-shiftedlines originate in emission near w3 irs4. in this model, the unusual appearanceof the spectral lines across the map results from a coincidental agreement invelocity between the emission near w3 irs4 and the blue peak of the morecomplex lines near w3 irs5. the strength of the water lines near w3 irs4suggests we may be seeing water emission enhanced in a photon-dominated region.

astro-ph;0404439	the young stellar population in the serpens cloud core: an isocam survey	we present results from an isocam survey in the two broad band filters lw2(5-8.5 mu) and lw3 (12-18 mu) of a 0.13 square degree coverage of the serpensmain cloud core. a total of 392 sources were detected in the 6.7 mu band and139 in the 14.3 mu band to a limiting sensitivity of ~ 2 mjy. only about 50% ofthe mid-ir excess sources show excesses in the near-ir j-h/h-k diagram. in thecentral cloud core the class i/class ii number ratio is 19/18, i.e. about 10times larger than in other young embedded clusters such as rho ophiuchi orchamaeleon. the mid-ir fluxes of the class i and flat-spectrum sources arefound to be on the average larger than those of class ii sources. stellarluminosities are estimated for the class ii sample, and its luminosity functionis compatible with a coeval population of about 2 myr which follows a threesegment power-law imf. for this age about 20% of the class iis are found to beyoung brown dwarf candidates. the ysos are in general strongly clustered, theclass i sources more than the class ii sources, and there is an indication ofsub-clustering. the sub-clustering of the protostar candidates has a spatialscale of 0.12 pc. these sub-clusters are found along the nw-se oriented ridgeand in very good agreement with the location of dense cores traced bymillimeter data. the smallest clustering scale for the class ii sources isabout 0.25 pc, similar to what was found for rho ophiuchi. our data showevidence that star formation in serpens has proceeded in several phases, andthat a ``microburst'' of star formation has taken place very recently, probablywithin the last 10^5 yrs.

astro-ph;0405075	isocam observations of the l1551 star formation region	the results of a deep mid-ir isocam survey of the l1551 dark molecular cloudare presented. the aim of this survey is a search for new yso (young stellarobject) candidates, using two broad-band filters centred at 6.7 and 14.3micron. although two regions close to the centre of l1551 had to be avoided dueto saturation problems, 96 sources were detected in total (76 sources at 6.7micron and 44 sources at 14.3 micron). using the 24 sources detected in bothfilters, 14 were found to have intrinsic mid-ir excess at 14.3 micron and weretherefore classified as yso candidates. using additional observations in b, v,i, j, h and k obtained from the ground, most candidates detected at thesewavelengths were confirmed to have mid-ir excess at 6.7 micron as well, andthree additional yso candidates were found. prior to this survey only threeysos were known in the observed region (avoiding l1551 irs5/ne and hl/xz tau).this survey reveals 15 new yso candidates, although several of these areuncertain due to their extended nature either in the mid-ir or in theoptical/near-ir observations. two of the sources with mid-ir excess arepreviously known ysos, one is a brown dwarf mho 5 and the other is the wellknown t tauri star hh30, consisting of an outflow and an optically thick diskseen edge on.

astro-ph;0702474	molecular oxygen in the rho ophiuchi cloud	molecular oxygen, o2 has been expected historically to be an abundantcomponent of the chemical species in molecular clouds and, as such, animportant coolant of the dense interstellar medium. however, a number ofattempts from both ground and from space have failed to detect o2 emission. thework described here uses heterodyne spectroscopy from space to search formolecular oxygen in the interstellar medium. the odin satellite carries a 1.1 msub-millimeter dish and a dedicated 119 ghz receiver for the ground state lineof o2. starting in 2002, the star forming molecular cloud core rho oph a wasobserved with odin for 34 days during several observing runs. we detect aspectral line at v(lsr) = 3.5 km/s with dv(fwhm) = 1.5 km/s, parameters whichare also common to other species associated with rho ohp a. this feature isidentified as the o2 (n_j = 1_1 - 1_0) transition at 118 750.343 mhz. theabundance of molecular oxygen, relative to h2,, is 5e-8 averaged over the odinbeam. this abundance is consistently lower than previously reported upperlimits.

astro-ph;0703086	herbig-haro flows in l1641n	we have used the 2.56m nordic optical telescope (not) to observe two deepfields in l1641n, selected on the basis of previous shock studies, using the2.12 micron transition of h2 (and a ks filter to sample the continuum) for atotal exposure time of 4.6 h (72 min ks) in the overlapping region. theresulting high-resolution mosaic shows numerous new shocks and resolves manyknown shocks into multiple components. using previous observations taken 9years earlier we calculate a proper motion map and combine this with spitzer 24micron observations of the embedded young stars. the combined h2 mosaic showsmany new shocks and faint structures in the hh flows. from the proper motionmap we find that most hh objects belong to two major bi-polar hh flows, thelarge-scale roughly north-south oriented flow from central l1641n and apreviously unseen hh flow in eastern l1641n. combining the tangential velocitymap with the mid-ir spitzer images, two very likely outflow sources are found.the outflow source of the eastern flow, l1641n-172, is found to be thecurrently brightest mid-ir source in l1641n and seem to have brightenedconsiderably during the past 20 years. we make the first detection of thissource in the near-ir (ks) and also find a near-ir reflection nebula pointingat the source, probably the illuminated walls of a cone-shaped cavity clearedout by the eastern lobe of the outflow. extending a line from the easternoutflow source along the proper motion vector we find that hh 301 and hh 302(almost 1 pc away) belong to this new hh flow.
