0910.4398	evolution of supermassive stars as a pathway to black hole formation	supermassive stars, with masses greater than a million solar masses, arepossible progenitors of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. because oftheir short nuclear burning timescales, such objects can be formed only whenmatter is able to accumulate at a rate exceeding ~ 1 solar mass/yr. here werevisit the structure and evolution of rotationally-stabilized supermassivestars, taking into account their continuous accumulation of mass and theirthermal relaxation. we show that the outer layers of supermassive stars are notthermally relaxed during much of the star's main sequence lifetime. as aresult, they do not resemble n=3 polytropes, as assumed in previous literature,but rather consist of convective (polytropic) cores surrounded by convectivelystable envelopes that contain most of the mass. we compute the structures ofthese envelopes, in which the specific entropy is proportional to the enclosedmass m(r) to the 2/3-power. by matching the envelope solutions to convectivecores, we calculate the core mass as a function of time. we estimate theinitial black hole masses formed as a result of core-collapse, and theirsubsequent growth via accretion from the bloated envelopes ("quasistars") thatresult. the seed black holes formed in this way could have typical masses inthe range ~ 10^4-10^5 solar masses, considerably larger than the remnantsthought to be left by the demise of population iii stars. supermassive blackholes therefore could have been seeded during an epoch of rapid infallconsiderably later than the era of pop iii star formation.

1002.0361	the origin and propagation of variability in the outflows of long  duration gamma-ray bursts	we present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of gamma-ray burst jetspropagating through their stellar progenitor material and subsequently throughthe surrounding circumstellar medium. we consider both jets that are injectedwith constant properties in the center of the star and jets injected with avariable luminosity. we show that the variability properties of the jet outsidethe star are a combination of the variability injected by the engine and thevariability caused by the jet propagation through the star. comparing powerspectra for the two cases shows that the variability injected by the engine ispreserved even if the jet is heavily shocked inside the star. such shockingproduces additional variability at long time scales, of order several seconds.our findings suggest that the broad pulses of several seconds durationtypically observed in gamma-ray bursts are due to the interaction of the jetwith the progenitor, while the short-timescale variability, characterized byfluctuations on time scales of milliseconds, has to be injected at the base ofthe jet. studying the properties of the fast variability in grbs may thereforeprovide clues to the nature of the inner engine and the mechanisms of energyextraction from it.

1003.5220	quasistars and the cosmic evolution of massive black holes	we explore the cosmic evolution of massive black hole (mbh) seeds formingwithin 'quasistars' (qss), accreting black holes embedded within massivehydrostatic gaseous envelopes. these structures could form if the infall of gasinto the center of a halo exceeds about 1 solar mass per year. we use amerger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which qss might form as a functionof redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting qs and seed blackhole populations. we relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergersof gas-rich galaxies, and to a threshold for global gravitational instability,which we link to the angular momentum of the host. this is the main parameterof our models. once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halopotential; the properties of the resulting qs and seed black hole depend onthis rate. after the epoch of qss, we model the growth of mbhs within theirhosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. we compare mbh seeds grown insidequasistars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the firstmetal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of mbhformation operate simultaneously. we find that a limited range of qs/mbhformation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observationalconstraints. our models match the density of z = 6 quasars, the cumulative massdensity accreted onto mbhs (according to soltan's argument), and the currentmass density of mbhs. the mass function of qss peaks at mass ~ 1e6 solarmasses, and we calculate the number counts for the jwst in the 2-10 micronband. we find that jwst could detect up to several qss per field at z ~ 5 - 10.

1007.3994	radiative properties of reconnection-powered minijets in blazars	we construct a numerical model of emission from minijets, localized flowsdriven by magnetic reconnection inside poynting-flux-dominated jets proposed toexplain the ultrafast variability of blazars. the geometrical structure of themodel consists of two wedge-like regions of relativistically flowing gas,separated by a stationary shock. the dynamics is based on solutions ofrelativistic magnetic reconnection with a guide field from lyubarsky (2005).electron distributions in each region are chosen to the match the pressure anddensity of the local plasma. synchrotron emission from both regions is used tocalculate compton scattering, compton drag and photon-photon opacity effects,with exact treatment of anisotropy and the klein-nishina regime. radiativeeffects on plasma are taken into account, including the dependence of pressureon electron radiative losses and adiabatic heating of the flow deceleratingunder compton drag. the results are applied to the july 2006 flare in the bllac object pks 2155-304, with the aim of matching tev flux measurements byh.e.s.s. with models that satisfy the variability constraints, while keepingx-ray emission below simultaneous chandra observations. we find that models ofisolated minijets with a significant guide field overproduce x-ray emission,and that we must take into account the radiative interaction ofoppositely-oriented minijets in order to achieve a high enough dominance bycomptonized tev radiation. we argue that such interactions are likely to occurin a jet where there is substantial internal reconnection, producing a largenumber of misaligned minijets. finally, we show that large jet magnetizationsare indeed required to satisfy all observational constraints and that theeffective lorentz factor of the minijet plasma has to be larger than 50, inagreement with earlier one-zone estimates.

1105.0942	reconnection-powered linear accelerator and gamma-ray flares in the crab  nebula	the recent discovery of day-long gamma-ray flares in the crab nebula,presumed to be synchrotron emission by pev (10^{15} ev) electrons in milligaussmagnetic fields, presents a strong challenge to particle acceleration models.the observed photon energies exceed the upper limit (~100 mev) obtained bybalancing the acceleration rate and synchrotron radiation losses under standardconditions where the electric field is smaller than the magnetic field. weargue that a linear electric accelerator, operating at magnetic reconnectionsites, is able to circumvent this difficulty. sufficiently energetic electronshave gyroradii so large that their motion is insensitive to small-scaleturbulent structures in the reconnection layer and is controlled only bylarge-scale fields. we show that such particles are guided into thereconnection layer by the reversing magnetic field as they are accelerated bythe reconnection electric field. as these electrons become confined within thecurrent sheet, they experience a decreasing perpendicular magnetic field thatmay drop below the accelerating electric field. this enables them to reachhigher energies before suffering radiation losses and hence to emit synchrotronradiation in excess of the 100 mev limit, providing a natural resolution to thecrab gamma-ray flare paradox.

1110.0557	extreme particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection layers.  application to the gamma-ray flares in the crab nebula	the gamma-ray space telescopes agile and fermi detected short and brightsynchrotron gamma-ray flares at photon energies above 100 mev in the crabnebula. this discovery suggests that electron-positron pairs in the nebula areaccelerated to pev energies in a milligauss magnetic field, which is difficultto explain with classical models of particle acceleration and pulsar windnebulae. we investigate whether particle acceleration in a magneticreconnection layer can account for the puzzling properties of the flares. wenumerically integrate relativistic test-particle orbits in the vicinity of thelayer, including the radiation reaction force, and using analytical expressionsfor the large-scale electromagnetic fields. as they get accelerated by thereconnection electric field, the particles are focused deep inside the currentlayer where the magnetic field is small. the electrons suffer less fromsynchrotron losses and are accelerated to extremely high energies. populationstudies show that, at the end of the layer, the particle distribution piles upat the maximum energy given by the electric potential drop and is focused intoa thin fan beam. applying this model to the crab nebula, we find that theemerging synchrotron emission spectrum peaks above 100 mev and is close to thespectral shape of a single electron. the flare inverse compton emission isnegligible and no detectable emission is expected at other wavelengths. thismechanism provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray flares in the crabnebula and could be at work in other astrophysical objects such as relativisticjets in active galactic nuclei.

1110.5356	radiatively inefficient accretion: breezes, winds and hyperaccretion	we reformulate the adiabatic inflow-outflow (adios) model for radiativelyinefficient accretion flows, treating the inflow and outflow zones on an equalfooting. for purely adiabatic flows (i.e., with no radiative losses), we showthat the mass flux in each zone must satisfy mdot ~ r^n with n=1, in contrastto previous work in which 0&lt;n&lt; 1 is a free parameter but in rough agreementwith numerical simulations. we also demonstrate that the resulting two-zoneadios models are not dynamically self-consistent without the introduction of anenergy source close in to the central regions of the flow; we identify thiswith the energy liberated by accretion. we explore the parameter space ofnon-radiative models and show that both powerful winds and gentle breezes arepossible. when small radiative losses (with fixed efficiency) are included, anycentrally injected energy flux is radiated away and the system reverts to apower-law behavior with n &lt; 1, where n falls in a small range determined by thefractional level of radiative losses. we also present an adios model forhypercritical (super-eddington) disk accretion, in which the radiative lossesare closely related to the flow geometry. we suggest that hyperaccretion canlead to either winds or breezes.

1112.4843	recollimation boundary layers in relativistic jets	we study the collimation of relativistic hydrodynamic jets by the pressure ofan ambient medium in the limit where the jet interior has lost causal contactwith its surroundings. for a jet with an ultrarelativistic equation of stateand external pressure that decreases as a power of spherical radius, p \proptor^(-eta), the jet interior will lose causal contact when eta &gt; 2. however, theouter layers of the jet gradually collimate toward the jet axis as long as eta&lt; 4, leading to the formation of a shocked boundary layer. assuming thatpressure-matching across the shock front determines the shape of the shock, westudy the resulting structure of the jet in two ways: first by assuming thatthe pressure remains constant across the shocked boundary layer and looking forsolutions to the shock jump equations, and then by constructing self-similarboundary-layer solutions that allow for a pressure gradient across the shockedlayer. we demonstrate that the constant-pressure solutions can be characterizedby four initial parameters that determine the jet shape and whether the shockcloses to the axis. we show that self-similar solutions for the boundary layercan be constructed that exhibit a monotonic decrease in pressure across theboundary layer from the contact discontinuity to the shock front, and that theaddition of this pressure gradient in our initial model generally causes theshock front to move outwards, creating a thinner boundary layer and decreasingthe tendency of the shock to close. we discuss trends based on the value of thepressure power-law index eta.

1201.2681	local simulations of instabilities in relativistic jets i: morphology  and energetics of the current-driven instability	we present the results of a numerical investigation of current-driveninstability in magnetized jets. utilizing the well-tested, relativisticmagnetohydrodynamic code athena, we construct an ensemble of local, co-movingplasma columns in which initial radial force balance is achieved throughvarious combinations of magnetic, pressure, and rotational forces. we thenexamine the resulting flow morphologies and energetics to determine the degreeto which these systems become disrupted, the amount of kinetic energyamplification attained, and the non-linear saturation behaviors. our mostsignificant finding is that the details of initial force balance have apronounced effect on the resulting flow morphology. models in which the initialmagnetic field is force-free deform, but do not become disrupted. systems thatachieve initial equilibrium by balancing pressure gradients and/or rotationagainst magnetic forces, however, tend to shred, mix, and develop turbulence.in all cases, the linear growth of current-driven instabilities iswell-represented by analytic models. cdi-driven kinetic energy amplification isslower and saturates at a lower value in force-free models than in those thatfeature pressure gradients and/or rotation. in rotating columns, we find thatmagnetized regions undergoing rotational shear are driven toward equipartitionbetween kinetic and magnetic energies. we show that these results areapplicable for a large variety of physical parameters, but we caution thatalgorithmic decisions (such as choice of riemann solver) can affect theevolution of these systems more than physically motivated parameters.

1202.2123	energetic constraints on a rapid gamma-ray flare in pks 1222+216	we study theoretical implications of a rapid very-high-energy (vhe) flaredetected by magic in the flat-spectrum radio quasar pks 1222+216. the minimumdistance from the jet origin at which this flare could be produced is 0.5 pc. amoderate doppler factor of the vhe source, d_{vhe} ~ 20, is allowed by allopacity constraints. the concurrent high-energy (he) emission observed by fermiprovides estimates of the total jet power and the jet magnetic field strength.energetic constraints for the vhe flare are extremely tight: for an isotropicparticle distribution they require a huge co-moving energy density in theemitting region and a very efficient radiative process. we disfavor hadronicprocesses due to their low radiative efficiency, as well as the synchrotronscenario recently proposed for the case of he flares in the crab nebula, sincethe parameters needed to overcome the radiative losses are quite extreme. thevhe emission can be explained by the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) mechanismfor d_{vhe} ~ 20 or by the external radiation compton (erc) mechanism involvingthe infrared radiation of the dusty torus for d_{vhe} ~ 50. after discussingseveral alternative scenarios, we propose that the extreme energy densityconstraint can be satisfied when the emission comes from highly anisotropicshort-lived bunches of particles formed by the kinetic beaming mechanism inmagnetic reconnection sites. by focusing the emitting particles into verynarrow beams, this mechanism allows one to relax the causality constraint onthe source size, decreasing the required energy density by 4 orders ofmagnitude.

1203.1628	force-feeding black holes	we propose that the growth of supermassive black holes is associated mainlywith brief episodes of highly super-eddington infall of gas ("hyperaccretion").this gas is not swallowed in real time, but forms an envelope of matter aroundthe black hole that can be swallowed gradually, over a much longer timescale.however, only a small fraction of the black hole mass can be stored in theenvelope at any one time. we argue that any infalling matter above a few percent of the hole's mass is ejected as a result of the plunge in opacity attemperatures below a few thousand degrees k, corresponding to the hayashitrack. the speed of ejection of this matter, compared to the velocitydispersion (sigma) of the host galaxy's core, determines whether the ejectedmatter is lost forever or returns eventually to rejoin the envelope, from whichit can be ultimately accreted. the threshold between matter recycling andpermanent loss defines a relationship between the maximum black hole mass andsigma that resembles the empirical m_bh-sigma relation.

1205.3210	beaming and rapid variability of high-energy radiation from relativistic  pair plasma reconnection	we report on the first study of the angular distribution of energeticparticles and radiation generated in relativistic collisionlesselectron-positron pair plasma reconnection, using two-dimensionalparticle-in-cell simulations. we discover a strong anisotropy of the particlesaccelerated by reconnection and the associated strong beaming of theirradiation. the focusing of particles and radiation increases with their energy;in this sense, this "kinetic beaming" effect differs fundamentally from therelativistic doppler beaming usually invoked in high-energy astrophysics, inwhich all photons are focused and boosted achromatically. we also present, forthe first time, the modeling of the synchrotron emission as seen by an externalobserver during the reconnection process. the expected lightcurves compriseseveral bright symmetric sub-flares emitted by the energetic beam of particlessweeping across the line of sight intermittently, and exhibit super-fast timevariability as short as about one tenth of the system light-crossing time. theconcentration of the energetic particles into compact regions inside magneticislands and particle anisotropy explain the rapid variability. this radiativesignature of reconnection can account for the brightness and variability of thegamma-ray flares in the crab nebula and in blazars.

1208.1261	magnetic domination of recollimation boundary layers in relativistic  jets	we study the collimation of relativistic magnetohydrodynamic jets by thepressure of an ambient medium, in the limit where the jet interior loses causalcontact with its surroundings. this follows up a hydrodynamic study in aprevious paper, adding the effects of a toroidal magnetic field threading thejet. as the ultrarelativistic jet encounters an ambient medium with a pressureprofile with a radial scaling of p ~ r^-eta where 2&lt;eta&lt;4, it loses causalcontact with its surroundings and forms a boundary layer with a large pressuregradient. by constructing self-similar solutions to the fluid equations withinthis boundary layer, we examine the structure of this layer as a function ofthe external pressure profile. we show that the boundary layer always becomesmagnetically dominated far from the source, and that in the magnetic limit,physical self-similar solutions are admitted in which the total pressure withinthe layer decreases linearly with distance from the contact discontinuityinward. these solutions suggest a `hollow cone' behavior of the jet, with theboundary layer thickness prescribed by the value of eta. in contrast to thehydrodynamical case, however, the boundary layer contains an asymptoticallyvanishing fraction of the jet energy flux.

0711.4078	quasistars: accreting black holes inside massive envelopes	we study the structure and evolution of "quasistars", accreting black holesembedded within massive hydrostatic gaseous envelopes. these configurations maymodel the early growth of supermassive black hole seeds. the accretion rateonto the black hole adjusts so that the luminosity carried by the convectiveenvelope equals the eddington limit for the total mass. this greatly exceedsthe eddington limit for the black hole mass alone, leading to rapid growth ofthe black hole. we use analytic models and numerical stellar structurecalculations to study the structure and evolution of quasistars. we deriveanalytically the scaling of the photospheric temperature with the black holemass and envelope mass, and show that it decreases with time as the black holemass increases. once the photospheric temperature becomes lower than 10,000 k,the photospheric opacity drops precipitously and the photospheric temperaturehits a limiting value, analogous to the hayashi track for red giants andprotostars, below which no hydrostatic solution for the convective envelopeexists. for metal-free (population iii) opacities this limiting temperature isapproximately 4000 k. after a quasistar reaches this limiting temperature, theenvelope is rapidly dispersed by radiation pressure. we find that black holeseeds with masses between 1000 and 10000 solar masses could form via thismechanism in less than a few myr.

1209.5261	collimation and confinement of magnetic jets by external media	we study the collimation of a highly magnetized jet by a surrounding cocoonthat forms as a result of the interaction of the jet with the external medium.we show that in regions where the jet is well confined by the cocoon,current-driven instabilities should develop over timescales shorter than theexpansion time of the jet's head. we speculate that these instabilities wouldgive rise to complete magnetic field destruction, whereby the jet undergoes atransition from high-to-low sigma above the collimation zone. using thisassumption, we construct a self-consistent model for the evolution of thejet-cocoon system in an ambient medium of arbitrary density profile. we applythe model to jet breakout in long grbs, and show that the jet is highlycollimated inside the envelope of the progenitor star, and is likely to remainconfined well after breakout. we speculate that this strong confinement mayprovide a channel for magnetic field conversion in grb outflows, whereby thehot, low-sigma jet section thereby produced is the source of the photosphericemission observed in many bursts.

1301.5638	magnetic flux paradigm for radio-loudness of agn	we argue that the magnetic flux threading the black hole, rather than blackhole spin or eddington ratio, is the dominant factor in launching powerful jetsand thus determining the radio loudness of active galactic nuclei (agn). mostagn are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them areinefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the black hole. fluxaccumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk)phase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radiogalaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode ofhot accretion. such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giantelliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy.  this picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to theformation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow (mcaf). the largeobserved range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the fluxpressed against the black hole, but also the decrease in uv flux from the disk,due to its disruption by the "magnetosphere" associated with the accumulatedflux. while the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux,moderate jet activity can also be triggered by fluctuations in the magneticflux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretiondisks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae.these processes could be responsible for jet production in seyferts andlow-luminosity agn, as well as jets associated with x-ray binaries.

1302.6247	simulations of particle acceleration beyond the classical synchrotron  burnoff limit in magnetic reconnection: an explanation of the crab flares	it is generally accepted that astrophysical sources cannot emit synchrotronradiation above 160 mev in their rest frame. this limit is given by the balancebetween the accelerating electric force and the radiation reaction force actingon the electrons. the discovery of synchrotron gamma-ray flares in the crabnebula, well above this limit, challenges this classical picture of particleacceleration. to overcome this limit, particles must accelerate in a region ofhigh electric field and low magnetic field. this is possible only with anon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic process, like magnetic reconnection. we presentthe first numerical evidence of particle acceleration beyond the synchrotronburnoff limit, using a set of 2d particle-in-cell simulations ofultra-relativistic pair plasma reconnection. we use a new code, zeltron, thatincludes self-consistently the radiation reaction force in the equation ofmotion of the particles. we demonstrate that the most energetic particles moveback and forth across the reconnection layer, following relativistic speiserorbits. these particles then radiate &gt;160 mev synchrotron radiation rapidly,within a fraction of a full gyration, after they exit the layer. our analysisshows that the high-energy synchrotron flux is highly variable in time becauseof the strong anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the energetic particles. wediscover a robust positive correlation between the flux and the cut-off energyof the emitted radiation, mimicking the effect of relativistic doppleramplification. a strong guide field quenches the emission of &gt;160 mevsynchrotron radiation. our results are consistent with the observed propertiesof the crab flares, supporting the reconnection scenario.

1303.2116	spectral hardening as a viable alternative to disc truncation in black  hole state transitions	constraining the accretion flow geometry of black hole binaries in outburstis complicated by the inability of simplified multi-colour disc models todistinguish between changes in the inner disc radius and alterations to theemergent spectrum, parameterised by the phenomenological colour correctionfactor, f_col. we analyse rossi x-ray timing explorer observations of the lowmass galactic black hole x-ray binary, gx 339-4, taken over seven epochs whenthe source was experiencing a state transition. the accretion disc component isisolated using a pipeline resulting in robust detections for disc luminosities,0.001 &lt; l_disc / l_edd &lt; 0.5. assuming that the inner disc remains situated atthe innermost stable circular orbit over the course of a state transition, wemeasure the relative degree of change in f_col required to explain the spectralevolution of the disc component. a variable f_col that increases by a factor of~ 2.0 - 3.5 as the source transitions from the high/soft state to the low/hardstate can adequately explain the observed disc spectral evolution. for theobservations dominated by a disc component, the familiar scaling between thedisc luminosity and effective temperature, l_disc ~ t_eff^4, is observed;however, significant deviations from this relation appear when gx 339-4 is inthe hard intermediate and low/hard states. allowing for an evolving f_colbetween spectral states, the l_disc-t_eff^4 law is recovered over the fullrange of disc luminosities, although this depends heavily on the physicallyconceivable range of f_col. we demonstrate that physically reasonable changesin f_col provide a viable description for multiple state transitions of a blackhole binary without invoking radial motion of the inner accretion disc.

1304.1369	supermassive black hole formation at high redshifts via direct collapse:  physical processes in the early stage	we use numerical simulations to explore whether direct collapse can lead tothe formation of smbh seeds at high-z. we follow the evolution of gas within dmhalos of 2 x 10^8 mo and 1 kpc. we adopt cosmological density profiles andj-distributions. our goal is to understand how the collapsing flow overcomesthe centrifugal barrier and whether it is subject to fragmentation. we findthat the collapse leads either to a central runaway or to off-centerfragmentation. a disk-like configuration is formed inside the centrifugalbarrier. for more cuspy dm distribution, the gas collapses more and experiencesa bar-like perturbation and a central runaway. we have followed this inflowdown to ~10^{-4} pc. the flow remains isothermal and the specific angularmomentum is efficiently transferred by gravitational torques in a cascade ofnested bars. this cascade supports a self-similar, disk-like collapse. in thecollapsing phase, virial supersonic turbulence develops and fragmentation isdamped. for larger initial dm cores the timescales become longer. in modelswith more organized initial rotation, a torus forms and appears to be supportedby turbulent motions. the evolution depends on the competition between twotimescales, corresponding to the onset of the central runaway and off-centerfragmentation. for less organized rotation, the torus is greatly weakened, thecentral accretion timescale is shortened, and off-center fragmentation issuppressed --- triggering the central runaway even in previously `stable'models. the resulting smbh masses lie in the range 2 x 10^4 mo - 2 x 10^6 mo,much higher than for population iii remnants. we argue that the above upperlimit appears to be more realistic mass. corollaries of this model include apossible correlation between smbh and dm halo masses, and similarity betweenthe smbh and halo mass functions, at time of formation.

1305.2535	polarimetry and the high-energy emission mechanisms in quasar jets. the  case of pks 1136-135	since the discovery of kiloparsec-scale x-ray emission from quasar jets, thephysical processes responsible for their high-energy emission have been poorlydefined. a number of mechanisms are under active debate, including synchrotronradiation, inverse-comptonized cmb (ic/cmb) emission, and other comptonizationprocesses. in a number of cases, the optical and x-ray emission of jet regionsare inked by a single spectral component, and in those, high- resolutionmulti-band imaging and polarimetry can be combined to yield a powerfuldiagnostic of jet emission processes. here we report on deep imaging photometryof the jet of pks 1136$-$135 obtained with the {\it hubble space telescope.} wefind that several knots are highly polarized in the optical, with fractionalpolarization $\pi&gt;30%$. when combined with the broadband spectral shapeobserved in these regions, this is very difficult to explain via ic/cmb models,unless the scattering particles are at the lowest-energy tip of the electronenergy distribution, with lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1$, and the jet is alsovery highly beamed ($\delta \geq 20$) and viewed within a few degrees of theline of sight. we discuss both the ic/cmb and synchrotron interpretation of thex-ray emission in the light of this new evidence, presenting new models of thespectral energy distribution and also the matter content of this jet. the highpolarizations do not completely rule out the possibility of ic/cmboptical-to-x-ray emission in this jet, but they do strongly disfavor the model.we discuss the implications of this finding, and also the prospects for futurework.

0801.1120	hot self-similar relativistic mhd flows	we consider axisymmetric relativistic jets with a toroidal magnetic field andan ultrarelativistic equation of state, with the goal of studying the lateralstructure of jets whose pressure is matched to the pressure of the mediumthrough which they propagate. we find all self-similar steady-state solutionsof the relativistic mhd equations for this setup. one of the solutions is thecase of a parabolic jet being accelerated by the pressure gradient as itpropagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z)\propto z^{-2}. asthe jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into theambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, whilethe magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet.such jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle\theta_j at distance z is smaller than about 1/\gamma, where \gamma is thecharacteristic bulk lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different partsof the jet cannot maintain causal contact. we construct maps of optically thinsynchrotron emission from our self-similar models. we suggest that the boundarypile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet ofm87. we find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance fromthe jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3c273and mkn501. projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have astrong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of thepolarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is ratheruncertain. for example, jets with toroidal magnetic fields display the`spine-sheath' polarization angle pattern seen in some bl lac objects.

1311.2605	three-dimensional relativistic pair plasma reconnection with radiative  feedback in the crab nebula	the discovery of rapid synchrotron gamma-ray flares above 100 mev from thecrab nebula has attracted new interest in alternative particle accelerationmechanisms in pulsar wind nebulae. diffuse shock-acceleration fails to explainthe flares because particle acceleration and emission occur during a single oreven sub-larmor timescale. in this regime, the synchrotron energy losses inducea drag force on the particle motion that balances the electric acceleration andprevents the emission of synchrotron radiation above 160 mev. previousanalytical studies and 2d particle-in-cell (pic) simulations indicate thatrelativistic reconnection is a viable mechanism to circumvent the abovedifficulties. the reconnection electric field localized at x-points linearlyaccelerates particles with little radiative energy losses. in this paper, wecheck whether this mechanism survives in 3d, using a set of large picsimulations with radiation reaction force and with a guide field. in agreementwith earlier works, we find that the relativistic drift kink instabilitydeforms and then disrupts the layer, resulting in significant plasma heatingbut few non-thermal particles. a moderate guide field stabilizes the layer andenables particle acceleration. we report that 3d magnetic reconnection canaccelerate particles above the standard radiation reaction limit, although theeffect is less pronounced than in 2d with no guide field. we confirm that thehighest energy particles form compact bunches within magnetic flux ropes, and abeam tightly confined within the reconnection layer, which could result in theobserved crab flares when, by chance, the beam crosses our line of sight.

1311.7647	jet emission in young radio sources: a fermi-lat gamma-ray view	we investigate the contribution of the beamed jet component to the highenergy emission in young and compact extragalactic radio sources, focusing forthe first time on the gamma-ray band. we derive predictions on the gamma-rayluminosities associated with the relativistic jet assuming a leptonic radiativemodel. the high energy emission is produced via compton scattering by therelativistic electrons in a spherical region at the considered scales($\lesssim$10 kpc). simulations show a wide range of gamma-ray luminosities,with intensities up to $\sim10^{46}-10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ depending on theassumed jet parameters. we find a highly linear relation between the simulatedx-ray and gamma-ray luminosities that can be used to select candidates for agamma-ray detection. we compare the simulated luminosity distributions in theradio, x-ray and gamma-ray regimes with observations for the largest sample ofx-ray detected young radio quasars. our analysis of $\sim$4-year fermi largearea telescope (lat) data does not give any statistically significantdetection. however, the majority of the model-predicted gamma-ray fluxes forthe sample are near or below the current fermi-lat flux threshold andcompatible with the derived upper limits. our study gives constraints on theminimum jet power ($l_{jet,kin}/l_{disk}&gt;0.01$), on a potential jetcontribution to the x-ray emission in the most compact sources ($\lesssim1$kpc) and on the particles to magnetic field energy density ratio in broadagreement with equipartition assumption.

1401.5475	a mechanism for hysteresis in black hole binary state transitions	we suggest that the hysteretic cycle of black hole state transitions arisesfrom two established properties of accretion disks: the increase in turbulentstress in disks threaded by a net magnetic field and the ability of thick (butnot thin) disks to advect such a field radially. during quiescence, magneticfield loops are generated by the magnetorotational instability at the interfacebetween the inner hot flow and outer thin disk. vertical flux is advected intoand accumulates stochastically within the inner flow, where it stimulates theturbulence so that $\alpha \sim 1$. the transition to a geometrically thininner disk occurs when $l \sim \alpha^2 l_{\rm edd} \sim l_{\rm edd}$, and thefirst "thin" disk to form is itself moderately thick, strongly magnetized, andable to advect field inward. these properties favor episodic jet production. asthe accretion rate declines magnetic flux escapes, $\alpha$ decreases to$\alpha \sim 0.01 - 0.1$, and a hot inner flow is not re-established until $l\ll l_{\rm edd}$. we discuss possible observational consequences of ourscenario.

1403.2305	thermal stability of thin disk with magnetically driven winds	the absence of thermal instability in the high/soft state of black hole x-raybinaries, in disagreement with the standard thin disk theory, is along-standing riddle for theoretical astronomers. we have tried to resolve thisquestion by studying the thermal stability of a thin disk with magneticallydriven winds in the $\dot{m}- \sigma$ plane. it is found that disk winds cangreatly decrease the disk temperature and thus help the disk become more stableat a given accretion rate. the critical accretion rate $\dot{m}_{\rm crit}$corresponding to the thermal instability threshold is increased significantlyin the presence of disk winds. for $\alpha=0.01$ and $b_{\rm \phi}=10b_{\rm_p}$, the disk is quite stable even for a very weak initial poloidal magneticfield [$\beta_{\rm p,0}\sim 2000, \beta_{\rm p}=(p_{\rm {gas}}+p_{\rmrad})/(b_{\rm p}^2/8\pi)$]. but when $b_{\rm \phi}=b_{\rm _p}$ or $b_{\rm\phi}=0.1b_{\rm _p}$, a somewhat stronger (but still weak) field ($\beta_{\rmp,0}\sim 200$ or $\beta_{\rm p,0}\sim 20$) is required to make the disk stable.nevertheless, despite the great increase of $\dot{m}_{\rm crit}$, theluminosity threshold corresponding to instability remains almost constant oreven decreases slowly with increasing $\dot{m}_{\rm crit}$ due to the decreaseof gas temperature. the advection and diffusion timescales of the large-scalemagnetic field threading the disk are also investigated in this work. we findthat the advection timescale can be smaller than the diffusion timescale in adisk with winds, because the disk winds take away most of the gravitationalenergy released in the disk, resulting in the decrease of the magneticdiffusivity $\eta$ and the increase of the diffusion timescale.

1405.7694	constraining the location of gamma-ray flares in luminous blazars	locating the gamma-ray emission sites in blazar jets is a long-standing andhighly controversial issue. we investigate jointly several constraints on thedistance scale r and lorentz factor gamma of the gamma-ray emitting regions inluminous blazars (primarily flat spectrum radio quasars, fsrqs). working in theframework of one-zone external radiation comptonization (erc) models, weperform a parameter space study for several representative cases of actualgamma-ray flares in their multiwavelength context. we find a particularlyuseful combination of three constraints: from an upper limit on the collimationparameter gamma*theta &lt;~ 1, from an upper limit on the synchrotron self-compton(ssc) luminosity l_ssc &lt;~ l_x, and from an upper limit on the efficient coolingphoton energy e_cool,obs &lt;~ 100 mev. these three constraints are particularlystrong for sources with low accretion disk luminosity l_d. the commonly usedintrinsic pair-production opacity constraint on gamma is usually much weakerthan the ssc constraint. the ssc and cooling constraints provide a robust lowerlimit on the collimation parameter gamma*theta &gt;~ 0.1 - 0.7. typical values ofr corresponding to moderate values of gamma ~ 20 are in the range 0.1 - 1 pc,and are determined primarily by the observed variability time scale t_var,obs.alternative scenarios motivated by the observed gamma-ray/mm connection, inwhich gamma-ray flares of t_var,obs ~ a few days are located at r ~ 10 pc, arein conflict with both the ssc and cooling constraints. moreover, we use asimple light travel time argument to point out that the gamma-ray/mm connectiondoes not provide a significant constraint on the location of gamma-ray flares.we argue that spine-sheath models of the jet structure do not offer a plausiblealternative to external radiation fields at large distances, however, anextended broad-line region is an idea worth exploring.

1410.2892	the general relativistic equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the  viscous limit	we present an analysis of the general relativistic boltzmann equation forradiation, appropriate to the case where particles and photons interact throughthomson scattering, and derive the radiation energy-momentum tensor in thediffusion limit, with viscous terms included. contrary to relativisticgeneralizations of the viscous stress tensor that appear in the literature, wefind that the stress tensor should contain a correction to the comoving energydensity proportional to the divergence of the four-velocity, as well as afinite bulk viscosity. these modifications are consistent with the framework ofradiation hydrodynamics in the limit of large optical depth, and do not dependon thermodynamic arguments such as the assignment of a temperature to thezeroth-order photon distribution. we perform a perturbation analysis on ourequations and demonstrate that, as long as the wave numbers do not probe scalessmaller than the mean free path of the radiation, the viscosity contributesonly decaying, i.e., stable, corrections to the dispersion relations. theastrophysical applications of our equations, including jets launched fromsuper-eddington tidal disruption events and those from collapsars, arediscussed and will be considered further in future papers.

1412.2761	supermassive black hole formation at high redshifts via direct collapse  in a cosmological context	we study the early stage of the formation of seed supermassive black holesvia direct collapse in dark matter (dm) halos, in the cosmological context. weperform high-resolution zoom-in simulations of such collapse at high-$z$. usingthe adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, we resolve the formation and growth ofa dm halo, until its virial temperature reaches $\sim 10^4$k, atomic coolingturns on, and collapse ensues. we demonstrate that direct collapse proceeds intwo stages, although they are not well separated. the first stage is triggeredby the onset of atomic cooling, and leads to rapidly increasing accretion ratewith radius, from $\dot m\sim 0.1\,m_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$ at the halo virialradius to few $m_\odot \,{\rm yr^{-1}}$, around the scale radius $r_{\rm s}\sim30$pc of the nfw dm density profile. the second stage of the collapse commenceswhen the gas density takes precedence over the dm density. this is associatedwith the gas decoupling from the dm gravitational potential. the ensuingcollapse approximates that of an isothermal sphere with $\dot m ( r )\sim$const. we confirm that the gas loses its angular momentum throughnon-axisymmetric perturbations and gravitational torques, to overcome thecentrifugal barrier. during the course of the collapse, this angular momentumtransfer process happens on nearly all spatial scales, and the angular momentumvector of the gas varies with position and time. collapsing gas also exhibitssupersonic turbulent motions which suppress gas fragmentation, and arecharacterized by density pdf consisting of a lognormal part and a high-densitypower law tail.

0805.0138	x-ray flares, neutrino cooled disks, and the dynamics of late accretion  in grb engines	we compute the average luminosity of x-ray flares as a function of time, fora sample of 10 long-duration gamma-ray burst afterglows. the mean luminosity,averaged over a timescale longer than the duration of the individual flares,declines as a power-law in time with index ~-1.5. we elaborate on theproperties of the central engine that can produce such a decline. assuming thatthe engine is an accreting compact object, and for a standard conversion factorbetween accretion rate and jet luminosity, the switch between a neutrino-cooledthin disk and a non-cooled thick disk takes place at the transition from theprompt to the flaring phase. we discuss the implications of this coincidenceunder different scenarios for the powering of the grb outflow. we also showthat the interaction of the outflow with the envelope of the progenitor starcannot produce flares out of a continuous relativistic flow, and conclude thatit is the dynamics of the disk or the jet-launching mechanism that generates anintrinsically unsteady outflow on timescales much longer than the dynamicaltimescale of the system. this is consistent with the fact that x-ray flares areobserved in short-duration grbs as well as in long-duration ones.

1507.03996	accretion disk dynamo as the trigger for x-ray binary state transitions	magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations suggest that much of theenergy liberated by the magnetorotational instability (mri) can be channeledinto large-scale toroidal magnetic fields through dynamo action. under certainconditions, this field can dominate over gas and radiation pressure inproviding vertical support against gravity, even close to the midplane. using asimple model for the creation of this field, its buoyant rise, and its couplingto the gas, we show how disks could be driven into this magnetically dominatedstate and deduce the resulting vertical pressure and density profiles. applyingan established criterion for mri to operate in the presence of a toroidalfield, we show that magnetically supported disks can have two distinctmri-active regions, separated by a "dead zone" where local mri is suppressed,but where magnetic energy continues to flow upward from the dynamo regionbelow. we suggest that the relative strengths of the mri zones, and the localpoloidal flux, determine the spectral states of x-ray binaries. specifically,"intermediate" and "hard" accretion states occur when mri is triggered in thehot, upper zone of the corona, while disks in "soft" states do not develop theupper mri zone. we discuss the conditions under which various transitionsshould take place and speculate on the relationship of dynamo activity to thevarious types of quasi-periodic oscillations that sometimes appear in the hardspectral components. the model also explains why luminous accretion disks inthe "soft" state show no signs of the thermal/viscous instability predicted bystandard alpha models.

1508.02392	on the distribution of particle acceleration sites in plasmoid-dominated  relativistic magnetic reconnection	we investigate the distribution of particle acceleration sites, independentlyof the actual acceleration mechanism, during plasmoid-dominated, relativisticcollisionless magnetic reconnection by analyzing the results of aparticle-in-cell numerical simulation. the simulation is initiated withharris-type current layers in pair plasma with no guide magnetic field,negligible radiative losses, no initial perturbation, and using periodicboundary conditions. we find that the plasmoids develop a robust internalstructure, with colder dense cores and hotter outer shells, that is recoveredafter each plasmoid merger on a dynamical time scale. we use spacetime diagramsof the reconnection layers to probe the evolution of plasmoids, and in thiscontext we investigate the individual particle histories for a representativesample of energetic electrons. we distinguish three classes of particleacceleration sites associated with (1) magnetic x-points, (2) regions betweenmerging plasmoids, and (3) the trailing edges of accelerating plasmoids. weevaluate the contribution of each class of acceleration sites to the finalenergy distribution of energetic electrons -- magnetic x-points dominate atmoderate energies, and the regions between merging plasmoids dominate at higherenergies. we also identify the dominant acceleration scenarios, in order ofdecreasing importance -- (1) single acceleration between merging plasmoids, (2)single acceleration at a magnetic x-point, and (3) acceleration at a magneticx-point followed by acceleration in a plasmoid. particle acceleration is absentonly in the vicinity of stationary plasmoids. the effect of magnetic mirrorsdue to plasmoid contraction does not appear to be significant in relativisticreconnection.

astro-ph;0012360	super-eddington atmospheres that don't blow away	we show that magnetized, radiation dominated atmospheres can support steadystate patterns of density inhomogeneity that enable them to radiate at farabove the eddington limit, without suffering mass loss. the inhomogeneitiesconsist of periodic shock fronts bounding narrow, high-density regions,interspersed with much broader regions of low density. the radiation fluxavoids the regions of high density, which are therefore weighed down bygravity, while gas in the low-density regions is slammed upward into the shockfronts by radiation force. as the wave pattern moves through the atmosphere,each parcel of matter alternately experiences upward and downward forces, whichbalance on average. magnetic tension shares the competing forces betweenregions of different densities, preventing the atmosphere from blowing apart.we calculate the density structure and phase speed of the wave pattern, andrelate these to the wavelength, the density contrast, and the factor by whichthe net radiation flux exceeds the eddington limit. in principle, this factorcan be as large as the ratio of magnetic pressure to mean gas pressure, or theratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure, whichever is smaller. although themagnetic pressure must be large compared to the mean gas pressure in order tosupport a large density contrast, it need not be large compared to theradiation pressure. these highly inhomogeneous flows could represent thenonlinear development of the "photon bubble" instability discovered by gammie.we briefly discuss the applicability of these solutions to astrophysicalsystems.

0808.1284	delayed x-ray emission from fallback in compact-object mergers	when double neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries merge, the finalremnant may comprise a central solar-mass black hole surrounded by a 0.01-0.1solar masses torus. the subsequent evolution of this disc may be responsiblefor short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs). a comparable amount of mass is ejected intoeccentric orbits and will eventually fall back to the merger site afterapproximately 0.01 seconds. in this paper, we investigate analytically the fateof the fallback matter, which may provide a luminous signal long after the discis exhausted. we find that matter in the eccentric tail returns at asuper-eddington rate and is eventually (0.1 sec) unable to cool via neutrinoemission and accrete all the way to the black hole. therefore, contrary toprevious claims, our analysis suggests that fallback matter is not an efficientsource of late time accretion power and is unlikely to cause the late flaringactivity observed in sgrb afterglows. the fallback matter rather forms aradiation-driven wind or a bound atmosphere. in both cases, the emitting plasmais very opaque and photons are released with a degraded energy in the x-rayband. we therefore suggest that compact binary mergers could be followed by an"x-ray renaissance", as late as several days to weeks after the merger. thismight be observed by the next generation of x-ray detectors.

astro-ph;0112090	circular polarization from stochastic synchrotron sources	the transfer of polarized radiation in stochastic synchrotron sources isexplored by means of analytic treatment and monte carlo simulations. we arguethat the main mechanism responsible for the circular polarization properties ofcompact synchrotron sources is likely to be faraday conversion and that,contrary to common expectation, a significant rate of faraday rotation does notnecessarily imply strong depolarization. the long-term persistence of the signof circular polarization, observed in many sources, is most likely due to asmall net magnetic flux generated in the central engine, carried along the jetaxis and superimposed on a highly turbulent magnetic field. we show that themean levels of circular and linear polarizations depend on the number of fieldreversals along the line of sight and that the gradient in faraday rotationacross turbulent regions can lead to ``correlation depolarization''. our modelis potentially applicable to a wide range of synchrotron sources. inparticular, we demonstrate how our model can naturally explain the excess ofcircular over linear polarization in the galactic center and the nearby spiralgalaxy m81 and discuss its application to the quasar 3c 279, the intradayvariable blazar pks 1519-273 and the x-ray binary ss 433.

astro-ph;0203030	super-eddington fluxes from thin accretion disks?	radiation pressure-dominated accretion disks are predicted to exhibit strongdensity inhomogeneities on scales much smaller than the disk scale height, dueto the nonlinear development of photon bubble instability. radiation wouldescape from such a "leaky" disk at a rate higher than that predicted bystandard accretion disk theory. the disk scale height is then smaller than thatof a similar disk without small-scale inhomogeneities, and the disk can remaingeometrically thin even as the flux approaches and exceeds the eddington limit.an idealized one-zone model for disks with radiation-driven inhomogeneitiessuggests that the escaping flux could exceed l_e by a factor of up to ~10-100,depending on the mass of the central object. such luminous disks would developstrong mass loss, but the resulting decrease in accretion rate would notnecessarily prevent the luminosity from exceeding l_e. we suggest that theobserved "ultraluminous x-ray sources" are actually thin, super-eddingtonaccretion disks orbiting stellar-mass black holes, and need not indicate theexistence of a class of intermediate-mass black holes.

astro-ph;0204256	eddington limit and radiative transfer in highly inhomogeneous  atmospheres	radiation dominated accretion disks are likely to be subject to the ``photonbubble'' instability, which may lead to strong density inhomogeneities onscales much shorter than the disk scale height. such disks -- and magnetized,radiation-dominated atmospheres in general -- could radiate well above theeddington limit without being disrupted. when density contrasts become largeover distances of order the photon mean free path, radiative transfer cannot bedescribed adequately using either the standard diffusion approximation orexisting prescriptions for flux-limited diffusion. using analytical and montecarlo techniques, we consider the effects of strong density gradients deepwithin radiation- and scattering-dominated atmospheres. we find that radiationviscosity -- i.e., the off-diagonal elements of the radiation stress tensor --has an important effect on radiative transfer under such conditions. we compareanalytical and numerical results in the specific case of a plane-paralleldensity wave structure and calculate eddington enhancement factors due to theporosity of the atmosphere. our results can be applied to the study ofdynamical coupling between radiation forces and density inhomogeneities inradiation dominated accretion disks in two or three dimensions.

astro-ph;0207471	heating, conduction and minimum temperatures in cooling flows	there is mounting observational evidence from chandra for strong interactionbetween kev gas and agn in cooling flows. it is now widely accepted that thetemperatures of cluster cores are maintained at a level of 1 kev and that themass deposition rates are lower than earlier rosat/einstein values. recenttheoretical results suggest that thermal conduction can be very efficient evenin magnetized plasmas. motivated by these discoveries, we consider a ``doubleheating model'' which incorporates the effects of simultaneous heating by boththe central agn and thermal conduction from the hot outer layers of clusters.using hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that there exists a family ofsolutions that does not suffer from the cooling catastrophe. in these cases,clusters relax to a stable final state, which is characterized by minimumtemperatures of order 1 kev and density and temperature profiles consistentwith observations. moreover, the accretion rates are much reduced, therebyreducing the need for excessive mass deposition rates required by the standardcooling flow models.

astro-ph;0306184	two dimensional adiabatic flows onto a black hole: i. fluid accretion	when gas accretes onto a black hole, at a rate either much less than or muchgreater than the eddington rate, it is likely to do so in an "adiabatic" orradiatively inefficient manner. under fluid (as opposed to mhd) conditions, thedisk should become convective and evolve toward a state of marginalinstability. the resulting disk structure is "gyrentropic," with convectionproceeding along common surfaces of constant angular momentum, bernoullifunction and entropy, called "gyrentropes." we present a family oftwo-dimensional, self-similar models which describes the time-averaged diskstructure. we then suppose that there is a self-similar, newtonian torque andthat the prandtl number is large. this torque drives inflow and meridionalcirculation and the resulting flow is computed. convective transport willbecome ineffectual near the disk surface. it is conjectured that this will leadto a large increase of entropy across a "thermal front" which we identify asthe effective disk surface and the base of an outflow. the conservation ofmass, momentum and energy across this thermal front permits a matching of thedisk models to self-similar outflow solutions. we then demonstrate thatself-similar disk solutions can be matched smoothly onto relativistic flows atsmall radius and thin disks at large radius. this model of adiabatic accretionis contrasted with some alternative models that have been discussed recently.the disk models developed in this paper should be useful for interpretingnumerical, fluid dynamical simulations. related principles to those describedhere may govern the behaviour of astrophysically relevant, magnetohydrodynamicdisk models.

astro-ph;0310760	cluster heating by viscous dissipation of sound waves	we simulate the effects of viscous dissipation of waves that are generated byagn activity in clusters of galaxies. we demonstrate that the amount of viscousheating associated with the dissipation of these waves can offset radiativecooling rates in cooling flow clusters of galaxies. this heating mechanismleads to spatially distributed and approximately symmetrical dissipation. theheating waves reach a given distance from the cluster center on a timescaleshorter than the cooling time. this means that this heating mechanism has thepotential of quenching cooling flows in a quasi-stable fashion. moreover, theheating is gentle as no strong shocks are present in the simulations. we firstinvestigated whether a single continuous episode of agn activity can lead toadequate dissipation to balance cooling rates. these simulations demonstratedthat, whereas secondary waves generated by the interaction of the rising bubblewith the intracluster medium are clearly present, viscous heating associatedwith the dissipation of these waves is insufficient to balance radiativecooling. it is only when the central source is intermittent that the viscousdissipation of waves associated with subsequent episodes of activity can offsetcooling. this suggests that the ripples observed in the perseus cluster can beinterpreted as being due to the agn duty cycle, i.e., they trace agn activityhistory. the simulations were performed using the ppm adaptive mesh refinementcode flash in two dimensions.

astro-ph;0401161	entropy "floor" and effervescent heating of intracluster gas	recent x-ray observations of clusters of galaxies have shown that the entropyof the intracluster medium (icm), even at radii as large as half the virialradius, is higher than that expected from gravitational processes alone. thisis thought to be the result of nongravitational processes influencing thephysical state of the icm. in this paper, we investigate whether heating by acentral agn can explain the distribution of excess entropy as a function ofradius. the agn is assumed to inject buoyant bubbles into the icm, which heatthe ambient medium by doing pdv work as they rise and expand. several authorshave suggested that this "effervescent heating" mechanism could allow thecentral regions of clusters to avoid the ``cooling catastrophe''. here we studythe effect of effervescent heating at large radii. our calculations show thatsuch a heating mechanism is able to solve the entropy problem. the only freeparameters of the model are the time-averaged luminosity and the agn lifetime.the results are mainly sensitive to the total energy injected into the cluster.our model predicts that the total energy injected by agn should be roughlyproportional to the cluster mass. the expected correlation is consistent with alinear relation between the mass of the central black hole(s) and the mass ofthe cluster, which is reminiscent of the magorrian relation between the blackhole and bulge mass.

astro-ph;0403690	3d simulations of viscous dissipation in the intracluster medium	we present three-dimensional simulations of viscous dissipation of agninduced gas motions and waves in clusters of galaxies. these simulations aremotivated by recent detections of ripples in the perseus and virgo clusters.although the sound waves generated by buoyant bubbles decay with distance fromthe cluster center, we show that these waves can contribute substantially tooffsetting the radiative cooling at distances significantly exceeding thebubble size. the energy flux of the waves declines more steeply with radiusthan the inverse-square law predicted by energy conservation, implying thatdissipation plays an important role in tapping the wave energy. we show thatsuch dispersing sound waves/weak shocks are detectable as ripples onunsharp-masked x-ray cluster maps, and point out that the interfaces betweenthe intracluster medium and old bubbles are also clearly detectable inunsharp-masked x-ray maps. this opens up the possibility of detecting fossilbubbles that are difficult to detect in radio emission. this mode of heating isconsistent with other observational constraints, such as the presence of coolrims around the bubbles and the absence of strong shocks. thus, the mechanismoffers a way of heating clusters in a spatially distributed and gentle fashion.we also discuss the energy transfer between the central agn and the surroundingmedium. in our numerical experiments, we find that roughly 65 per cent of theenergy injected by the agn is transferred to the intracluster medium andapproximately 25 percent of the injected energy is dissipated by viscouseffects and contributes to heating of the gas. the overall transfer of heatfrom the agn to the gas is comparable to the radiative cooling losses. thesimulations were performed with the flash adaptive mesh refinement code.

astro-ph;0406607	disk outflows and the accretion rate gap	we argue that the observed `accretion rate gap' - between black holes inradio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) accreting at close to the eddingtonlimit and those accreting at considerably lower rates - can be explained interms of the adiabatic inflow-outflow (adios) scenario for radiativelyinefficient accretion. whenever the accretion rate falls below a thresholdvalue (corresponding to a luminosity l_crit) that depends on the viscosityparameter, alpha, the inner region of the accretion disk - extending from themarginally stable orbit to ~ 1000 schwarzschild radii - is susceptible tobecoming hot and radiatively inefficient. if this happens, the disk luminositydecreases by a factor of ~100, as most of the matter originally destined to beswallowed is instead expelled in a wind. according to our conjecture, accretionflows onto black holes never radiate steadily in the range ~ 0.01 l_crit &lt; l &lt;l_crit, hence the inferred accretion rate gap. we expect the gap to exist alsofor black holes in x-ray binaries, where it may be responsible for statetransitions and the luminosity fluctuations associated with x-ray novaoutbursts.

astro-ph;0407063	constraining the structure of grb jets through the log(n)-log(s)  distribution	a general formalism is developed for calculating the luminosity function andthe expected number $n$ of observed grbs above a peak photon flux $s$ for anygrb jet structure. this new formalism directly provides the true grb ratewithout the need for a `correction factor'. we apply it to the uniform jet (uj)and universal structured jet (usj) models for the structure of grb jets andperform fits to the observed log(n)-log(s) distribution from the gusbad catalogwhich contains 2204 batse bursts. a core angle $\theta_c$ and an outer edge at$\theta_{max}$ are introduced for the structured jet, and a finite range ofhalf-opening angles $\theta_{min}\leq\theta_j\leq\theta_{max}$ is assumed forthe uniform jets. the efficiency $\epsilon_\gamma$ for producing gamma-rays,and the energy per solid angle $\epsilon$ in the jet are allowed to vary with$\theta_j$ (the viewing angle $\theta_{obs}$) in the uj (usj) model,$\epsilon_\gamma\propto\theta^{-b}$ and $\epsilon\propto\theta^{-a}$. we findthat a single power-law luminosity function provides a good fit to the data.such a luminosity function arises naturally in the usj model, while in the ujmodel it implies a power-law probability distribution for $\theta_j$,$p(\theta_j)\propto\theta_j^{-q}$. the value of $q$ cannot be directlydetermined from the fit to the observed log(n)-log(s) distribution, and anadditional assumption on the value of $a$ or $b$ is required. alternatively, anindependent estimate of the true grb rate would enable one to determine $a$,$b$ and $q$. the implied values of $\theta_c$ (or $\theta_{min}$) and$\theta_{max}$ are close to the current observational limits. the true grb ratefor the usj model is found to be $r_{grb}(z=0)=0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.05} gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0502115	are quasar jets dominated by poynting flux?	the formation of relativistic astrophysical jets is presumably mediated bymagnetic fields threading accretion disks and central, rapidly rotatingobjects. as it is accelerated by magnetic stresses, the jet's kinetic energyflux grows at the expense of its poynting flux. however, it is unclear howefficient is the conversion from magnetic to kinetic energy and whether thereare any observational signatures of this process. we address this issue in thecontext of jets in quasars. using data from all spatial scales, we demonstratethat in these objects the conversion from poynting-flux-dominated tomatter-dominated jets is very likely to take place closer to the black holethan the region where most of the doppler boosted radiation observed in blazarsis produced. we briefly discuss the possibility that blazar activity can beinduced by global mhd instabilities, e.g., via the production of localizedvelocity gradients that lead to dissipative events such as shocks or magneticreconnection, where acceleration of relativistic particles and production ofnon-thermal flares is taking place.

astro-ph;0502151	cyclotron maser emission from blazar jets?	we consider the production of electron cyclotron maser emission bylow-density, highly magnetized plasmas in relativistic jets. the populationinversion required to drive cyclotron maser instability could occur inlocalized, transient sites where hydromagnetic instabilities, shocks, and/orturbulence lead to magnetic mirroring along current-carrying flux tubes. themaser is pumped as electrons are accelerated by the parallel electric fieldthat develops as a result of the mirror. we estimate the maximum brightnesstemperatures that can be obtained in a single maser site and in an array ofmany masers operating simultaneously, under conditions likely to apply inblazar jets. synchrotron absorption, by relativistic electrons within the jet,presents the largest obstacle to the escape of the maser radiation, and mayrender most of it invisible. however, we argue that a high brightnesstemperature could be produced in a thin boundary layer outside the synchrotronphotosphere, perhaps in the shear layer along the wall of the jet. inducedcompton scattering provides additional constraints on the maximum brightnesstemperature of a masing jet. we suggest that recent observations of diffractivescintillation in the blazar j1819+3845, indicating intrinsic brightnesstemperatures greater than 10^{14} k at 5 ghz, may be explained in terms ofcyclotron maser emission. high brightness temperature maser emission fromblazar jets may extend to frequencies as high as ~100 ghz, with the maximumpossible t_b scaling roughly as 1/frequency. less massive relativistic jetsources, such as microquasars, are even better candidates for producingcyclotron maser emission, primarily in the infrared and optical bands.

astro-ph;0504400	self-regulated black hole accretion, the m-sigma relation, and the  growth of bulges in galaxies	we argue that the velocity dispersions and masses of galactic bulges andspheroids are byproducts of the feedback that regulates rapid black hole growthin protogalaxies. we suggest that the feedback energy liberated by accretionmust pass through the accreting material, in an energy-conserving flux close-inand a momentum-conserving flux further out. if the inflowing gas dominates thegravitational potential outside the bondi radius, feedback fromeddington-limited accretion drives the density profile of the gas to that of asingular isothermal sphere. we find that the velocity dispersion associatedwith the isothermal potential, sigma, increases with time as the black holemass m grows, in such a way that m is proportional to sigma^4. the coefficientof this proportionality depends on the radius at which the flow switches fromenergy conserving to momentum conserving, and gives the observed m-sigmarelation if the transition occurs at ~100 schwarzschild radii. we associatethis transition with radiative cooling and show that bremsstrahlung, stronglyboosted by inverse compton scattering in a two-temperature (t_p &gt;&gt; t_e) plasma,leads to a transition at the desired radius.  according to this picture, bulge masses m_b are insensitive to the virialmasses of their dark matter haloes, but correlate linearly with black holemass. our analytic model also explains the m_b-sigma (faber-jackson) relationas a relic of black hole accretion. the model naturally explains why them-sigma relation has less scatter than either the m-m_b (magorrian) or thefaber-jackson relation. it suggests that the m-sigma relation could extend downto very low velocity dispersions, and predicts that the relation should notevolve with redshift.

astro-ph;0509357	nonlinear photon bubbles driven by buoyancy	we derive an analytic model for nonlinear "photon bubble" wave trains drivenby buoyancy forces in magnetized, radiation pressure-dominated atmospheres.continuous, periodic wave solutions exist when radiative diffusion is slowcompared to the dynamical timescale of the atmosphere. we identify these waveswith the saturation of a linear instability discovered by arons - therefore,these wave trains should develop spontaneously. the buoyancy-driven waves arephysically distinct from photon bubbles in the presence of rapid diffusion,which evolve into trains of gas pressure-dominated shocks as they becomenonlinear.  like the gas pressure-driven shock trains, buoyancy-driven photon bubbles canexhibit very large density contrasts, which greatly enhance the flow ofradiation through the atmosphere. however, steady-state solutions forbuoyancy-driven photon bubbles exist only when an extra source of radiation isadded to the energy equation, in the form of a flux divergence. we argue thatthis term is required to compensate for the radiation flux lost via thebubbles, which increases with height. we speculate that an atmosphere subjectto buoyancy-driven photon bubbles, but lacking this compensating energy source,would lose pressure support and collapse on a timescale much shorter than theradiative diffusion time in the equivalent homogeneous atmosphere.

astro-ph;0511658	thick fireballs and the steep decay in the early x-ray afterglow of  gamma-ray bursts	we study the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts produced by geometricallythick fireballs, following the development of the external shock as energy iscontinually supplied to the shocked material. we study the dependence of theearly afterglow slope on the luminosity history of the central engine. theresulting light curves are modeled with power-law functions and the importanceof a correct choice of the reference time t_0 is investigated. we find thatdeviations from a simple power-law are observed only if a large majority of theenergy is released at late times. the light curve in this case can be describedas a simple power-law if the reference time is set to be close to the end ofthe burst. we applied our analysis to the cases of grb 050219a and grb 050315.we show that the early steep decay of the afterglow cannot result from theinteraction of the fireball with the ambient medium. we conclude that the earlyx-ray afterglow emission is associated with the prompt phase and we derivelimits on the radius at which the prompt radiation is produced.

astro-ph;0602022	photon bubbles and the vertical structure of accretion disks	we consider the effects of "photon bubble" shock trains on the verticalstructure of radiation pressure-dominated accretion disks. these densityinhomogeneities are expected to develop spontaneously in radiation-dominatedaccretion disks where magnetic pressure exceeds gas pressure, even in thepresence of magnetorotational instability. they increase the rate at whichradiation escapes from the disk, and may allow disks to exceed the eddingtonlimit by a substantial factor. we first generalize the theory of photon bubblesto include the effects of finite optical depths and radiation damping.modifications to the diffusion law at low optical depth tend to fill in thelow-density regions of photon bubbles, while radiation damping inhibits theformation of photon bubbles at large radii, small accretion rates, and smallheights above the equatorial plane. accretion disks dominated by photon bubbletransport may reach luminosities of 10 to &gt;100 times the eddington limit (l_e),depending on the mass of the central object, while remaining geometricallythin. however, photon bubble-dominated disks with alpha-viscosity are subjectto the same thermal and viscous instabilities that plague standard radiationpressure-dominated disks, suggesting that they may be intrinsically unsteady.photon bubbles can lead to a "core-halo" vertical disk structure. insuper-eddington disks the halo forms the base of a wind, which carries awaysubstantial energy and mass, but not enough to prevent the luminosity fromexceeding l_e. photon bubble-dominated disks may have smaller color correctionsthan standard accretion disks of the same luminosity. they remain viablecontenders for some ultraluminous x-ray sources and may play a role in therapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift.

astro-ph;0602363	formation of supermassive black holes by direct collapse in pregalactic  halos	we describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can form directlyin the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for seed black holes left overfrom early star formation. self-gravitating gas in dark matter halos can loseangular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, theso-called "bars within bars" mechanism. this leads to the rapid buildup of adense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by aradiation pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and iscompressed further by subsequent infall. these conditions lead to such hightemperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically bythermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of acentral black hole.  we estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typicalconditions in metal-free halos with t_vir ~ 10^4 k, which are the most likelyto be susceptible to runaway infall. the initial black hole should have a massof &lt;~20 solar masses, but in principle could grow at a super-eddington rateuntil it reaches ~ 10^4-10^6 solar masses. rapid growth may be limited byfeedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply bystar formation or halo mergers. even if super-eddington growth stops at\~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this process would give black holes ample time toattain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seedsfor all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.

astro-ph;0607381	trapping of magnetic flux by the plunge region of a black hole accretion  disk	the existence of the radius of marginal stability means that accretion flowsaround black holes invariably undergo a transition from a mhd turbulentdisk-like flow to an inward plunging flow. we argue that the plunging inflowcan greatly enhance the trapping of large scale magnetic field on the blackhole, and therefore may increase the importance of the blandford-znajek (bz)effect relative to previous estimates that ignore the plunge region. we supportthis hypothesis by constructing and analyzing a toy-model of the dragging andtrapping of a large scale field by a black hole disk, revealing a strongdependence of this effect on the effective magnetic prandtl number of the mhdturbulent disk. furthermore, we show that the enhancement of the bz effectdepends on the geometric thickness of the accretion disk. this may be, at leastin part, the physical underpinnings of the empirical relation between theinferred geometric thickness of a black hole disk and the presence of a radiojet.

astro-ph;9705108	self-consistent thermal accretion disk corona models for compact  objects: i. properties of the corona and the spectrum of escaping radiation	we present the properties of accretion disk corona (adc) models, where theradiation field, the temperature, and the total opacity of the corona aredetermined self-consistently. we use a non-linear monte carlo code to performthe calculations. as an example, we discuss models where the corona is situatedabove and below a cold accretion disk with a plane-parallel (slab) geometry,similar to the model of haardt and maraschi. by comptonizing the soft radiationemitted by the accretion disk, the corona is responsible for producing thehigh-energy component of the escaping radiation. our models include thereprocessing of radiation in the accretion disk. here, the photons either arecompton reflected or photo-absorbed, giving rise to fluorescent line emissionand thermal emission. the self-consistent coronal temperature is determined bybalancing heating (due to viscous energy dissipation) with compton cooling,determined using the fully relativistic, angle-dependent cross-sections. thetotal opacity is found by balancing pair productions with annihilations. wefind that, for a disk temperature kt_bb \lta 200 ev, these coronae are unableto have a self-consistent temperature higher than \sim 120 kev if the totaloptical depth is \gta 0.2, regardless of the compactness parameter of thecorona and the seed opacity. this limitation corresponds to the angle-averagedspectrum of escaping radiation having a photon index \gta 1.8 within the 5 kev- 30 kev band. finally, all models that have reprocessing features also predicta large thermal excess at lower energies. these constraints make explaining thex-ray spectra of persistent black hole candidates with adc models veryproblematic.

astro-ph;9705136	iron fluorescence from within the innermost stable orbit of black hole  accretion disks	the fluorescent iron ka line is a powerful observational probe of the innerregions of black holes accretion disks. previous studies have assumed that onlymaterial outside the radius of marginal stability can contribute to theobserved line emission. here, we show that fluorescence by material inside theradius of marginal stability, which is in the process of spiralling towards theevent horizon, can have a observable influence on the iron line profile andequivalent width. for concreteness, we consider the case of a geometricallythin accretion disk, around a schwarzschild black hole, in which fluorescenceis excited by an x-ray source placed at some height above the disk and on theaxis of the disk. fully relativistic line profiles are presented for varioussource heights and efficiencies. it is found that the extra line flux generallyemerges in the extreme red wing of the iron line, due to the largegravitational redshift experienced by photons from the region within the radiusof marginal stability. we apply our models to the variable iron line seen inthe asca spectrum of the seyfert nucleus mcg-6-30-15. it is found that thechange in the line profile, equivalent width, and continuum normalization, canbe well explained as being due to a change in the height of the source abovethe disk. we discuss the implications of these results for distinguishingrapidly-rotating black holes from slowly rotating holes using iron linediagnostics.

astro-ph;9707322	rxte observation of cygnus x-1: spectral analysis	we present the results of the analysis of the broad-band spectrum of cygnusx-1 from 3.0 to 200 kev, using data from a 10 ksec observation by the rossix-ray timing explorer. the spectrum can be well described phenomenologically byan exponentially cut-off power law with a photon index gamma = 1.45 +/- 0.02 (avalue considerably harder than typically found), e-folding energy e_fold = 162+/- 9 kev, plus a deviation from a power law that formally can be modeled as athermal blackbody with temperature kt_bb = 1.2 +/1 0.2 kev. although the 3 - 30kev portion of the spectrum can be fit with a reflected power law with gamma =1.81 +/- 0.01 and covering fraction f = 0.35 +/- 0.02, the quality of the fitis significantly reduced when the hexte data in the 30 - 100 kev range isincluded, as there is no observed hardening in the power law within this energyrange. as a physical description of this system, we apply the accretion disccorona models of dove, wilms &amp; begelman (1997) --- where the temperature of thecorona is determined self-consistently. a spherical corona with a total opticaldepth tau = 1.6 +/- 0.1 and an average temperature kt_c = 87 +/- 5 kev,surrounded by an exterior cold disc, does provide a good description of thedata (reduced chi-squared = 1.55). these models deviate from the data by up to7% in the 5 - 10 kev range, and we discuss possible reasons for thesediscrepancies. however, considering how successfully the spherical coronareproduces the 10 - 200 kev data, such ``photon-starved'' coronal geometriesseem very promising for explaining the accretion processes of cygnus x-1.

astro-ph;9708142	instability of toroidal magnetic field in jets and plerions	jets and pulsar-fed supernova remnants (plerions) tend to develop highlyorganized toroidal magnetic field. such a field structure could explain thepolarization properties of some jets, and contribute to their lateralconfinement. a toroidal field geometry is also central to models for the crabnebula - the archetypal plerion - and leads to the deduction that the crabpulsar's wind must have a weak magnetic field. yet this `z-pinch' fieldconfiguration is well known to be locally unstable, even when the magneticfield is weak and/or boundary conditions slow or suppress global modes. thus,the magnetic field structures imputed to the interiors of jets and plerions areunlikely to persist.  to demonstrate this, i present a local analysis of z-pinch instabilities forrelativistic fluids in the ideal mhd limit. kink instabilities dominate,destroying the concentric field structure and probably driving the systemtoward a more chaotic state in which the mean field strength is independent ofradius (and in which resistive dissipation of the field may be enhanced). iestimate the timescales over which the field structure is likely to berearranged and relate these to distances along relativistic jets and radii fromthe central pulsar in a plerion.  i conclude that a concentric toroidal field is unlikely to exist well outsidethe crab pulsar's wind termination shock. there is thus no dynamical reason toconclude that the magnetic energy flux carried by the pulsar wind is muchweaker than the kinetic energy flux. abandoning this inference would resolve along-standing puzzle in pulsar wind theory.

astro-ph;9712107	young radio galaxies and their environments	many of the powerful radio galaxies observed at high redshift are very small,presumably because they are very young. a simple model, which treats the radiosource as a bubble expanding into a radially stratified medium, is capable ofexplaining the main features of their size and luminosity evolution. inparticular, the model predicts strong negative luminosity evolution withincreasing size, thus accounting for the large number of short-lived smallsources in flux-limited samples.  a variety of observational characteristics can be understood within theframework of the bubble model. i address three of these: 1) the number versussize statistics, which may provide a clue that jets in radio galaxies areintermittent, with "on-off" cycles lasting only ten to one hundred thousand yr;2) the rarity of spectral steepening due to synchrotron cooling at frequenciesof a few ghz, and its implications for source geometry and assumptions aboutequipartition; and 3) the prevalence of gigahertz-peaked spectra among smallsources.  i argue that all of these phenomena are primarily the consequence of theyouth and compactness of the radio source, and depend only weakly onenvironment. there is no need to postulate an ism with properties any differentfrom that of an ordinary nearby galaxy.

astro-ph;9803238	radiation-driven warping. ii. non-isothermal disks	recent work by pringle and by maloney, begelman &amp; pringle has shown thatgeometrically thin, optically thick, accretion disks are unstable to warpingdriven by radiation torque from the central source. in this paper we generalizethe study of radiation-driven warping to include general power-law surfacedensity distributions, $\sigma\propto r^{-\delta}$. we consider the range$\delta=3/2$ (isothermal disks) to $\delta=-3/2$, which corresponds to aradiation-pressure-supported disk; this spans the range of surface densitydistributions likely to be found in real astrophysical disks. there is acritical minimum size for unstable disks. the critical radius and thesteady-state precession rate depend only weakly on $\delta$. the case$\delta=1$ divides the solutions into two qualitatively different regimes.nonlinear effects must be important if the warp extends to the disk inner edgefor $\delta \ge 1$, but for $\delta &lt; 1$ nonlinearity will be important only ifthe warp amplitude is large at the origin. the effects of shadowing of thecentral source by the warp will thus be very different in the two regimes of$\delta.$ in real accretion disks the outer boundary condition is likely to bedifferent from the zero-crossing condition that we have assumed. in accretiondisks around massive black holes in active galactic nuclei, the disk willprobably become optically thin before the outer disk boundary is reached, whilein x-ray binaries, there will be an outer disk region (outside thecircularization radius) in which the inflow velocity is zero but angularmomentum is still transported. we show that in both these cases the solutionsare similar to the zero-crossing eigenfunctions.

astro-ph;9908185	hydrodynamical non-radiative accretion flows in two-dimensions	two-dimensional (axially symmetric) numerical hydrodynamical calculations ofaccretion flows which cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented.the calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thicktorus with constant specific angular momentum. accretion is induced by theaddition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized bya function \nu. we study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of \nuare varied. a spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders ofmagnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatialscales. we find that convection in the inner regions produces significantoutward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by, and a largefraction of the mass participating in, the accretion flow. although theinstantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convectiveeddies, long time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkablecorrespondence to certain steady-state solutions. near the equatorial plane,the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power-laws with an indexthat depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. we find that regardlessof the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shearstress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, andis everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. the net mass accretionrate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is suppliedto the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rateassociated with the flow properties near the central object.
