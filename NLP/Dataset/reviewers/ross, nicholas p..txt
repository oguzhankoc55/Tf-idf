0901.4733	the two-point correlation of 2qz quasars and 2slaq lrgs: from a quasar  fueling perspective	public data from the 2df quasar survey (2qz) and 2df/sdss lrg &amp; qso (2slaq),with their vast reservoirs of spectroscopically located and identified sources,afford us the chance to more accurately study their real space correlations inthe hopes of identifying the physical processes that trigger quasar activity.we have used these two public databases to measure the projected crosscorrelation, $\omega_p$, between quasars and luminous red galaxies. we find theprojected two-point correlation to have a fitted clustering radius of $r_0, =5.3 \pm 0.6 $ and a slope, $\gamma =1.83 \pm 0.42 $ on scales from0.7-27$h^{-1}$mpc.  we attempt to understand this strong correlation by separating the lrg sampleinto 2 populations of blue and red galaxies. we measure at the crosscorrelation with each population. we find that these quasars have a strongercorrelation amplitude with the bluer, more recently starforming population inour sample than the redder passively evolving population, which has acorrelation that is much more noisy and seems to flatten on scales $&lt;5h^{-1}$mpc. we compare this result to published work on hierarchical models.the stronger correlation of bright quasars with lrgs that have undergone arecent burst of starformation suggests that the physical mechanisms thatproduce both activities are related and that minor mergers or tidal effects maybe important triggers of bright quasar activity and/or that bright quasars areless highly biased than faint quasars.

0902.1098	photometric selection of emission line galaxies, clustering analysis and  a search for the isw effect	we investigate the use of simple colour cuts applied to the sdss opticalimaging to perform photometric selections of emission line galaxies out to z&lt;1.  from colour-cuts using the sdss g, r and i bands, we obtain mean photometricredshifts of z=0.32+-0.08, z=0.44+-0.12 and z=0.65+-0.21. we further calibrateour high redshift selection using spectroscopic observations with the aaomegaspectrograph on the 4m anglo-australian telescope (aat), observing ~50-200galaxy candidates in 4 separate fields. with just 1-hour of integration timeand with seeing of ~1.6", we successfully determined redshifts for ~65% of thetargeted candidates. we calculate the angular correlation functions of thesamples and find correlation lengths of r0=2.64 h-1 mpc, r0=3.62 h-1 mpc andr0=5.88 h-1 mpc for the low, mid and high redshift samples respectively.comparing these results with predicted dark matter clustering, we estimate thebias parameter for each sample to be b=0.70, b=0.92 and b=1.46. we calculatethe 2-point redshift-space correlation function at z~0.6 and find a clusteringamplitude of s0=6.4 h-1 mpc. finally, we use our photometric sample to searchfor the integrated sachs-wolfe signal in the wmap 5yr data. we cross-correlateour three redshift samples with the wmap w, v, q and k bands and find anoverall trend for a positive signal similar to that expected from models.however, the signal in each is relatively weak. combining all three galaxysamples we find a signal of wtg(&lt;100')=0.20+-0.12 microk in the wmap w-band, asignificance of 1.7sigma.

0903.3230	clustering of low-redshift (z &lt;= 2.2) quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we present measurements of the quasar two-point correlation function,\xi_{q}, over the redshift range z=0.3-2.2 based upon data from the sdss. usinga homogeneous sample of 30,239 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts from thedr5 quasar catalogue, our study represents the largest sample used for thistype of investigation to date. with this redshift range and an areal coverageof approx 4,000 deg^2, we sample over 25 h^-3 gpc^3 (comoving) assuming thecurrent lcdm cosmology. over this redshift range, we find that theredshift-space correlation function, xi(s), is adequately fit by a singlepower-law, with s_{0}=5.95+/-0.45 h^-1 mpc and \gamma_{s}=1.16+0.11-0.16 whenfit over s=1-25 h^-1 mpc. using the projected correlation function we calculatethe real-space correlation length, r_{0}=5.45+0.35-0.45 h^-1 mpc and\gamma=1.90+0.04-0.03, over scales of rp=1-130 h^-1 mpc. dividing the sampleinto redshift slices, we find very little, if any, evidence for the evolutionof quasar clustering, with the redshift-space correlation length stayingroughly constant at s_{0} ~ 6-7 h^-1 mpc at z&lt;2.2 (and only increasing atredshifts greater than this). comparing our clustering measurements to thosereported for x-ray selected agn at z=0.5-1, we find reasonable agreement insome cases but significantly lower correlation lengths in others. we find thatthe linear bias evolves from b~1.4 at z=0.5 to b~3 at z=2.2, withb(z=1.27)=2.06+/-0.03 for the full sample. we compare our data to analyticalmodels and infer that quasars inhabit dark matter haloes of constant mass m ~2x 10^12 h^-1 m_sol from redshifts z~2.5 (the peak of quasar activity) to z~0.[abridged]

0907.2727	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the qso luminosity function at  0.4&lt;z&lt;2.6	we present the qso luminosity function of the completed 2df-sdss lrg and qso(2slaq) survey, based on qsos photometrically selected from sloan digital skysurvey imaging data and then observed spectroscopically using the 2dfinstrument on the anglo-australian telescope. we analyse 10637 qsos in theredshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.6 to a g-band flux limit of 21.85 (extinction corrected)and an absolute continuum magnitude of mg(z=2)&lt;-21.5. this sample covers anarea of 191.9 deg^2.  the binned qso luminosity function agrees with that of the brighter sdss mainqso sample, but extends ~2.5 mags fainter, clearly showing the flattening ofthe luminosity function towards faint absolute magnitudes. 2slaq finds anexcess of qsos compared to the 2df qso redshift survey at g&gt;20.0, as foundpreviously by richards et al. (2005). the luminosity function is consistentwith other previous, much smaller, samples produced to the depth of 2slaq.  by combining the 2slaq and sdss qso samples we produce a qso luminosityfunction with an unprecedented combination of precision and dynamic range. withthis we are able to accurately constrain both the bright and faint ends of theqso lf. while the overall trends seen in the evolution of the qso lf appearsimilar to pure luminosity evolution, the data show very significant departuresfrom such a model. most notably we see clear evidence that the number densityof faint qsos peaks at lower redshift than bright qsos: qsos with mg&gt;-23 havespace densities which peak at z&lt;1, while qsos at mg&lt;-26 peak at z&gt;2. by fittingsimple luminosity function models in narrow mg intervals we find that thisdownsizing is significant at the 99.98 per cent level (abridged).

0911.1352	cross-correlating wmap5 with 1.5 million lrgs: a new test for the isw  effect	we present the cross-correlation of the density map of lrgs and thetemperature fluctuation in the cmb as measured by the wmap5 observations. thelrg samples were extracted from imaging data of the sdss based on two previousspectroscopic redshift surveys, the sdss-lrg and the 2slaq surveys at averageredshifts z~0.35 and z~0.55. in addition we have added a higher-redshiftphotometric lrg sample based on the selection of the aaomega lrg redshiftsurvey at z~0.7. the total lrg sample thus comprises 1.5 million galaxies,sampling a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 over ~7600 square degrees of thesky, probing a total cosmic volume of ~5.5 h^{-3} gpc^3. we find that the newlrg sample at z~0.7 shows very little positive evidence for the isw effect.indeed, the cross-correlation is negative out to ~1 deg. the standard lcdmmodel is rejected at ~2-3% significance by the new lrg data. we then performeda new test on the robustness of the lrg isw detections at z~0.35 and 0.55. wemade 8 rotations through 360deg of the cmb maps with respect to the lrg samplesaround the galactic pole. we find that in both cases there are stronger effectsat angles other than zero. this implies that the z~0.35 and 0.55 isw detectionsmay still be subject to systematic errors which combined with the knownsizeable statistical errors may leave these isw detections looking unreliable.we have further made the rotation test on several other samples where iswdetections have been claimed and find that they also show peaks when rotated.we conclude that in the samples we have tested the isw effect may be absent andwe argue that this result may not be in contradiction with previous results.

0912.0511	angular correlation function of 1.5 million lrgs: clustering evolution  and a search for bao	we present the angular correlation function measured from photometric samplescomprising 1,562,800 luminous red galaxies (lrgs). three lrg samples wereextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data, based oncolour-cut selections at redshifts, z ~ 0.35, 0.55 and 0.7 as calibrated by thespectroscopic surveys, sdss-lrg, 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq), and the aaomegalrg survey. the galaxy samples cover ~7600 s.q.deg of the sky, probing a totalcosmic volume of ~5.5 h^-3} gpc^3.  the small and intermediate scale correlation functions generally showsignificant deviations from a single power-law fit with a well-detected breakat ~1 h^-1 mpc, consistent with the transition scale between the 1- and 2-haloterms in halo occupation models. for galaxy separations 1-20 h^-1 mpc and atfixed luminosity, we see virtually no evolution of the clustering with redshiftand the data is consistent with a simple high peaks biasing model where thecomoving lrg space density is constant with z. at fixed z, the lrg clusteringamplitude increases with luminosity in accordance with the simple high peaksmodel, with a typical lrg dark matter halo mass 10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_sol. for r &lt;1 h^-1 mpc, the evolution is slightly faster and the clustering decreasestowards high redshift consistent with a virialised clustering model. however,assuming the hod and lcdm halo merger frameworks, ~2-3 per cent per gyr of thelrgs is required to merge in order to explain the small scales clusteringevolution, consistent with previous results [abridge].

1001.3141	galaxy zoo: the fundamentally different co-evolution of supermassive  black holes and their early- and late-type host galaxies	we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications ofmorphology from the galaxy zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearbyuniverse (z &lt; 0.05) and to break down the agn host galaxy population by color,stellar mass and morphology. we find that black hole growth at luminositiesl_oiii &gt;1e40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.agn host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses(1e10-1e11 msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram andtheir central black holes have median masses around 1e6.5 msun. however, bycomparing early- and late-type agn host galaxies to their non-activecounterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it ispreferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that aregrowing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}blackholes that are growing. the duty cycle of agn in early-type galaxies isstrongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1e10 msun) of thered sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloudprogenitors. the duty cycle of agn in late-type galaxies on the other handpeaks in massive (1e11 msun) green and red late-types which generally do nothave a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. at high eddingtonratios (l/l_edd &gt; 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of agnare the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. finally, the milky waylikely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the agn dutycycle of late-type galaxies is highest. we discuss the implications of theseresults for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies

1011.6392	think outside the color box: probabilistic target selection and the  sdss-xdqso quasar targeting catalog	we present the sdss-xdqso quasar targeting catalog for efficient flux-basedquasar target selection down to the faint limit of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) catalog, even at medium redshifts (2.5 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 3) where the stellarcontamination is significant. we build models of the distributions of stars andquasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying theextreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. we convolvethis density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability thatan object is a quasar. this approach results in a targeting algorithm that ismore principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. weapply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z &lt; 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 &lt;= z&lt;= 3.5), and high-redshift (z &gt; 3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag inthe 14,555 deg^2 of imaging from sdss data release 8. the catalog can be usedto define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasarsurvey, such as that needed for the sdss-iii's baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey project. we show that the xdqso technique performs as well as thecurrent best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, andoutperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshiftquasars of our primary interest. we make code to reproduce the xdqso quasartarget selection publicly available.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1201.1909	new neutrino mass bounds from sloan digital sky survey iii data release  8 photometric luminous galaxies	we present neutrino mass bounds using 900,000 luminous galaxies withphotometric redshifts measured from sloan digital sky survey iii data releaseeight (sdss dr8). the galaxies have photometric redshifts between $z = 0.45$and $z = 0.65$, and cover 10,000 square degrees and thus probe a volume of3$h^{-3}$gpc$^3$, enabling tight constraints to be derived on the amount ofdark matter in the form of massive neutrinos. a new bound on the sum ofneutrino masses $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.26$ ev, at 95% confidence level (cl), isobtained after combining our sample of galaxies, which we call "cmass", withwmap 7 year cosmic microwave background (cmb) data and the most recentmeasurement of the hubble parameter from the hubble space telescope (hst). thisconstraint is obtained with a conservative multipole range choice of $30 &lt; \ell&lt; 200$ in order to minimize non-linearities, and a free bias parameter in eachof the four redshift bins. we study the impact of assuming this linear galaxybias model using mock catalogs, and find that this model causes a small ($\sim1-1.5 \sigma$) bias in $\omega_{\rm dm} h^2$. for this reason, we also quoteneutrino bounds based on a conservative galaxy bias model containingadditional, shot noise-like free parameters. in this conservative case, thebounds are significantly weakened, e.g. $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.36$ ev (95% confidencelevel) for wmap+hst+cmass ($\ell_{\rm max}=200$). we also study the dependenceof the neutrino bound on multipole range ($\ell_{\rm max}=150$ vs $\ell_{\rmmax}=200$) and on which combination of data sets is included as a prior. theaddition of supernova and/or baryon acoustic oscillation data does notsignificantly improve the neutrino mass bound once the hst prior is included.[abridged]

1203.6641	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: measurements of the growth of structure and expansion  rate at z=0.57 from anisotropic clustering	we analyze the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) datarelease 9 (dr9) sample, which consists of 264,283 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 spanning 3,275 square degrees. both peculiar velocitiesand errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ("alcock-paczynskieffect") generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientationwith respect to the line-of-sight. together with the sharp baryon acousticoscillation (bao) standard ruler, our measurements of the broadband shape ofthe monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain thecomoving angular diameter distance (2190 +/- 61 mpc) to z=0.57, the hubbleexpansion rate at z=0.57 (92.4 +/- 4.5 km/s/mpc), and the growth rate ofstructure at that same redshift (d sigma8/d ln a = 0.43 +/- 0.069). ouranalysis provides the best current direct determination of both da and h ingalaxy clustering data using this technique. if we further assume a lcdmexpansion history, our growth constraint tightens to d sigma8/d ln a = 0.415+/- 0.034. in combination with the cosmic microwave background, ourmeasurements of da, h, and growth all separately require dark energy at z &gt;0.57, and when combined imply \omega_{\lambda} = 0.74 +/- 0.016, independent ofthe universe's evolution at z&lt;0.57. in our companion paper (samushia et al.prep), we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.

1207.2175	first-2mass red quasars: transitional objects emerging from the dust	we present a sample of 120 dust-reddened quasars identified by matching radiosources detected at 1.4 ghz in the first survey with the near-infrared 2masscatalog and color-selecting red sources. optical and/or near-infraredspectroscopy provide broad wavelength sampling of their spectral energydistributions that we use to determine their reddening, characterized bye(b-v). we demonstrate that the reddening in these quasars is best-described bysmc-like dust. this sample spans a wide range in redshift and reddening (0.1 &lt;z &lt; 3, 0.1 &lt; e(b-v) &lt; 1.5), which we use to investigate the possiblecorrelation of luminosity with reddening. at every redshift, dust-reddenedquasars are intrinsically the most luminous quasars. we interpret this resultin the context of merger-driven quasar/galaxy co-evolution where these reddenedquasars are revealing an emergent phase during which the heavily obscuredquasar is shedding its cocoon of dust prior to becoming a "normal" blue quasar.when correcting for extinction, we find that, depending on how the parentpopulation is defined, these red quasars make up &lt; 15-20% of the luminousquasar population. we estimate, based on the fraction of objects in this phase,that its duration is 15-20% as long as the unobscured, blue quasar phase.

1207.4321	investigating emission line galaxy surveys with the sloan digital sky  survey telescope	the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in the power spectrum ofgalaxies provides a standard ruler to probe the accelerated expansion of theuniverse. the current surveys covering a comoving volume sufficient to unveilthe bao scale are limited to redshift $z \lesssim 0.7$. in this paper, we studyseveral galaxy selection schemes aiming at building an emission-line-galaxy(elg) sample in the redshift range $0.6&lt;z&lt;1.7$, that would be suitable forfuture bao studies using the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)spectrograph on the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) telescope. we explore twodifferent colour selections using both the sdss and the canada france hawaitelescope legacy survey (cfht-ls) photometry in the u, g, r, and i bands andevaluate their performance selecting luminous elg. from about 2,000 elg, weidentified a selection scheme that has a 75 percent redshift measurementefficiency. this result confirms the feasibility of massive elg surveys usingthe boss spectrograph on the sdss telescope for a bao detection at redshift$z\sim1$, in particular the proposed eboss experiment, which plans to use thesdss telescope to combine the use of the bao ruler with redshift spacedistortions using emission line galaxies and quasars in the redshift$0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2$.

1207.7326	spectral classification and redshift measurement for the sdss-iii baryon  oscillation spectroscopic survey	(abridged) we describe the automated spectral classification, redshiftdetermination, and parameter measurement pipeline in use for the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii) as of data release 9, encompassing 831,000 moderate-resolutionoptical spectra. we give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe thechanges to the pipeline that have been implemented for boss relative toprevious sdss-i/ii versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasarredshift templates. for the color-selected cmass sample of massive galaxies atredshift 0.4 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 0.8 targeted by boss for the purposes of large-scalecosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classificationsuccess rate of 98.7% and confirms 95.4% of unique cmass targets as galaxies(with the balance being mostly m stars). based on visual inspections of asubset of boss galaxies, we find that ~0.2% of confidently reported cmasssample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and ~0.4% of all cmassspectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentiallyrecoverable. the boss pipeline confirms that ~51.5% of the quasar targets havequasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars. statistical (asopposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise aretypically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significanttail to a few hundreds of km/s for quasars. we test the accuracy of thesestatistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding themunderestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2for quasars. we assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, s/n, and otherfactors on galaxy redshift success. finally, we document known issues, anddescribe directions of ongoing development.

1208.0022	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sdss-iii	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) is designed to measure thescale of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the clustering of matter over alarger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveysof large scale structure. boss uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint asi=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure bao to redshifts z&lt;0.7.observations of neutral hydrogen in the lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g&lt;22) will constrain bao over the redshift range 2.15&lt;z&lt;3.5.early results from boss include the first detection of the large-scalethree-dimensional clustering of the lyman alpha forest and a strong detectionfrom the data release 9 data set of the bao in the clustering of massivegalaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. we project that boss will yieldmeasurements of the angular diameter distance d_a to an accuracy of 1.0% atredshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of h(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at thesame redshifts. forecasts for lyman alpha forest constraints predict ameasurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerated_a(z) and h^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the surveyis complete. here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopictargets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality ofboss.

1208.0836	broad absorption line disappearance on multi-year timescales in a large  quasar sample	we present 21 examples of c iv broad absorption line (bal) troughdisappearance in 19 quasars selected from systematic multi-epoch observationsof 582 bright bal quasars (1.9 &lt; z &lt; 4.5) by the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii(sdss-i/ii) and sdss-iii. the observations span 1.1-3.9 yr rest-frametimescales, longer than have been sampled in many previous bal variabilitystudies. on these timescales, ~2.3% of c iv bal troughs disappear and ~3.3% ofbal quasars show a disappearing trough. these observed frequencies suggest thatmany c iv bal absorbers spend on average at most a century along our line ofsight to their quasar. ten of the 19 bal quasars showing c iv bal disappearancehave apparently transformed from bal to non-bal quasars; these are the firstreported examples of such transformations. the bal troughs that disappear tendto be those with small-to-moderate equivalent widths, relatively shallowdepths, and high outflow velocities. other non-disappearing c iv bals in thosenine objects having multiple troughs tend to weaken when one of themdisappears, indicating a connection between the disappearing andnon-disappearing troughs, even for velocity separations as large as 10000-15000km/s. we discuss possible origins of this connection including disk-windrotation and changes in shielding gas.

0711.3486	radio galaxies in the 2slaq luminous red galaxy survey: ii. the stellar  populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet lrgs	we present an analysis of the optical spectra of a volume-limited sample of375 radio galaxies at redshift 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the 2df-sdss luminous red galaxyand qso (2slaq) redshift survey. we investigate the evolution of the stellarpopulations and emission-line properties of these galaxies. by constructingcomposite spectra and comparing with a matched sample of radio-quiet sourcesfrom the same survey, we also investigate the effect on the galaxy of thepresence of an active nucleus.  the composite spectra, binned by redshift and radio luminosity, all requiretwo components to describe them, which we interpret as an old and a youngerpopulation. we found no evolution with redshift of the age of the youngerpopulation in radio galaxies, nor were they different from the radio-quietcomparison sample. similarly, there is no correlation with radio power, withthe exception that the most powerful radio sources (p(1.4) &gt; 10^26 w/hz) haveyounger stars and stronger emission lines than the less powerful sources. thissuggests that we have located the threshold in radio power where strongemission lines "switch on", at radio powers of around 10^26 w/hz. except forthe very powerful radio galaxies, the presence of a currently-active radio agndoes not appear to be correlated with any change in the observed stellarpopulation of a luminous red galaxy at z~0.5.

0704.3739	luminous red galaxy clustering at z~0.7 - first results using aaomega	we report on the aat-aaomega lrg pilot observing run to establish thefeasibility of a large spectroscopic survey using the new aaomega instrument.we have selected luminous red galaxies (lrgs) using single epoch sdssriz-photometry to i&lt;20.5 and z&lt;20.2. we have observed in 3 fields including thecosmos field and the combo-17 s11 field, obtaining a sample of ~600 redshiftz&gt;=0.5 lrgs. exposure times varied from 1 - 4 hours to determine the minimumexposure for aaomega to make an essentially complete lrg redshift survey inaverage conditions. we show that lrg redshifts to i&lt;20.5 can measured inapproximately 1.5hr exposures and present comparisons with 2slaq and combo-17(photo-)redshifts. crucially, the riz selection coupled with the 3-4 timesimproved aaomega throughput is shown to extend the lrg mean redshift fromz=0.55 for 2slaq to z=0.681+/- 0.005 for riz-selected lrgs. this extended rangeis vital for maximising the s/n for the detection of the baryon acousticoscillations (baos). furthermore, we show that the amplitude of lrg clusteringis s_0 = 9.9+/-0.7 h^-1 mpc, as high as that seen in the 2slaq lrg survey.consistent results for the real-space amplitude are found from projected andsemi-projected correlation functions. this high clustering amplitude isconsistent with a long-lived population whose bias evolves as predicted by asimple ``high-peaks'' model. we conclude that a redshift survey of 360 000 lrgsover 3000deg^2, with an effective volume some 4 times bigger than previouslyused to detect bao with lrgs, is possible with aaomega in 170 nights.

1209.4596	the large-scale cross-correlation of damped lyman alpha systems with the  lyman alpha forest: first measurements from boss	we present the first measurement of the large-scale cross-correlation oflyman alpha forest absorption and damped lyman alpha systems (dla), using the9th data release of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). thecross-correlation is clearly detected on scales up to 40 mpc/h and is wellfitted by the linear theory prediction of the standard cold dark matter modelof structure formation with the expected redshift distortions, confirming itsorigin in the gravitational evolution of structure. the amplitude of thedla-lyman alpha cross-correlation depends on only one free parameter, the biasfactor of the dla systems, once the lyman alpha forest bias factors are knownfrom independent lyman alpha forest correlation measurements. we measure thedla bias factor to be b_d = (2.17 +/- 0.20) beta_f^{0.22}, where the lymanalpha forest redshift distortion parameter beta_f is expected to be aboveunity. this bias factor implies a typical host halo mass for dlas that is muchlarger than expected in present dla models, and is reproduced if the dla crosssection scales with halo mass as m_h^alpha, with alpha= 1.1 +/- 0.1 forbeta_f=1. matching the observed dla bias factor and rate of incidence requiresthat atomic gas remains extended in massive halos over larger areas thanpredicted in present simulations of galaxy formation, with typical dla propersizes larger than 20 kpc in host halos of masses ~ 10^12 solar masses. we inferthat typical galaxies at z ~ 2 to 3 are surrounded by systems of atomic cloudsthat are much more extended than the luminous parts of galaxies and contain ~10% of the baryons in the host halo.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

1303.1937	the large-scale quasar-lyman \alpha\ forest cross-correlation from boss	we measure the large-scale cross-correlation of quasars with the lyman\alpha\ forest absorption in redshift space, using ~ 60000 quasar spectra fromdata release 9 (dr9) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). thecross-correlation is detected over a wide range of scales, up to comovingseparations r of 80 mpc/h. for r &gt; 15 mpc/h, we show that the cross-correlationis well fitted by the linear theory prediction for the mean overdensity arounda quasar host halo in the standard \lambda cdm model, with the redshiftdistortions indicative of gravitational evolution detected at high confidence.using previous determinations of the lyman \alpha\ forest bias factor obtainedfrom the lyman \alpha\ autocorrelation, we infer the quasar bias factor to beb_q = 3.64^+0.13_-0.15 at a mean redshift z=2.38, in agreement with previousmeasurements from the quasar auto-correlation. we also obtain a new estimate ofthe lyman \alpha\ forest redshift distortion factor, \beta_f = 1.1 +/- 0.15,slightly larger than but consistent with the previous measurement from thelyman \alpha\ forest autocorrelation. the simple linear model we use fails atseparations r &lt; 15 mpc/h, and we show that this may reasonably be due to theenhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars. we also provide theexpected correction that the mass overdensity around the quasar implies formeasurements of the ionizing radiation background from the line-of-sightproximity effect.

1304.5573	mean spectral energy distributions and bolometric corrections for  luminous quasars	we explore the mid-infrared (mid-ir) through ultraviolet (uv) spectral energydistributions (seds) of 119,652 luminous broad-lined quasars with 0.064&lt;z&lt;5.46using mid-ir data from spitzer and wise, near-infrared data from two micron allsky survey and ukidss, optical data from sloan digital sky survey, and uv datafrom galaxy evolution explorer. the mean sed requires a bolometric correction(relative to 2500a) of bc=2.75+-0.40 using the integrated light from 1um-2kev,and we further explore the range of bolometric corrections exhibited byindividual objects. in addition, we investigate the dependence of the mean sedon various parameters, particularly the uv luminosity for quasars with 0.5&lt;z&lt;3and the properties of the uv emission lines for quasars with z&gt;1.6; the latteris a possible indicator of the strength of the accretion disk wind, which isexpected to be sed dependent. luminosity-dependent mean seds show that,relative to the high-luminosity sed, low-luminosity seds exhibit a harder(bluer) far-uv spectral slope, a redder optical continuum, and less hot dust.mean seds constructed instead as a function of uv emission line propertiesreveal changes that are consistent with known principal component analysis(pca) trends. a potentially important contribution to the bolometric correctionis the unseen extream-uv (euv) continuum. our work suggests thatlower-luminosity quasars and/or quasars with disk-dominated broad emissionlines may require an extra continuum component in the euv that is not present(or much weaker) in high-luminosity quasars with strong accretion disk winds.as such, we consider four possible models and explore the resulting bolometriccorrections. understanding these various sed-dependent effects will beimportant for accurate determination of quasar accretion rates.

1306.5896	the one-dimensional ly-alpha forest power spectrum from boss	we have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensionalpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. the firstmethod is based on a fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihoodestimator. the two methods are independent and have different systematicuncertainties. the determination of the noise level in the data spectra wassubject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derivedpower spectrum.  we applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from sdss-iii/boss dr9selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their highquality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. the powerspectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelveredshift bins from $&lt;z&gt; = 2.2$ to $&lt;z&gt; = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. we determine the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.  we provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurementsusing available hydrodynamical simulations. the improvement in precision overpreviously published results from sdss is a factor 2--3 for constraints onrelevant cosmological parameters. for a $\lambda$cdm model and using aconstraint on $h_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distanceladder and on cmb anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{h}{i} absorption in the range $2.1&lt;z&lt;3.7$.

1307.7289	candidate type ii quasars at 2 &lt; z &lt; 4.3 in the sloan digital sky survey  iii	at low redshifts, dust-obscured quasars often have strong yet narrowpermitted lines in the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet, excited by thecentral active nucleus, earning the designation type ii quasars. we present asample of 145 candidate type ii quasars at redshifts between 2 and 4.3,encompassing the epoch at which quasar activity peaked in the universe. theseobjects, selected from the quasar sample of the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey of the sloan digital sky survey iii, are characterized byweak continuum in the rest-frame ultraviolet (typical continuum magnitude of i\approx 22) and strong lines of civ and ly \alpha, with full width at halfmaximum less than 2000 kms-1. the continuum magnitudes correspond to anabsolute magnitude of -23 or brighter at redshift 3, too bright to be dueexclusively to the host galaxies of these objects. roughly one third of theobjects are detected in the shorter-wavelength bands of the wise survey; thespectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects appear to be intermediatebetween classic type i and type ii quasars seen at lower redshift. five objectsare detected at rest frame 6\mu m by spitzer, implying bolometric luminositiesof several times 10^46 erg s-1. we have obtained polarization measurements fortwo objects; they are roughly 3% polarized. we suggest that these objects areluminous quasars, with modest dust extinction (a_v ~ 0.5 mag), whoseultraviolet continuum also includes a substantial scattering contribution.alternatively, the line of sight to the central engines of these objects may bepartially obscured by optically thick material.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1308.2685	a glance at the host galaxy of high-redshift quasars using strong damped  lyman-alpha systems as coronagraphs	we searched quasar spectra from the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) for the rare occurrences where a strong damped lyman-alphaabsorber (dla) blocks the broad line region emission from the quasar and actsas a natural coronagraph to reveal narrow ly\alpha\ emission from the hostgalaxy. we define a statistical sample of 31 dlas in data release 9 (dr9) withlog n(hi) &gt; 21.3 cm^-2 located at less than 1500 km s^-1 from the quasarredshift. in 25% (8) of these dlas, a strong narrow ly\alpha\ emission line isobserved with flux ~25 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 on average. for dlas withoutthis feature in their troughs, the average 3-\sigma\ upper limit is &lt; 0.8 x10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. our statistical sample is nearly 2.5 times larger thanthe anticipated number of intervening dlas in dr9 within 1500 km s^-1 of thequasar redshift. we also define a sample of 26 dlas from dr9 and dr10 withnarrow ly\alpha\ emission detected and no limit on the hi column density tobetter characterize properties of the host galaxy emission. analyzing thestatistical sample, we do not find substantial differences in the kinematics,metals, or reddening for the two populations with and without emissiondetected. the highly symmetric narrow ly\alpha\ emission line profile centeredin the hi trough indicates that the emitting region is separate from theabsorber. the luminosity of the narrow ly\alpha\ emission peaks is intermediatebetween that of lyman-alpha emitters and radio galaxies, implying that thely\alpha\ emission is predominantly due to ionizing radiation from the agn.galaxies neighboring the quasar host are likely responsible for the majority (&gt;75%) of these dlas, with only a minority (&lt; 25%) arising from hi clouds locatedin the agn host galaxy.

1309.5364	broad absorption line variability on multi-year timescales in a large  quasar sample	we present a detailed investigation of the variability of 428 c iv and 235 siiv broad absorption line (bal) troughs identified in multi-epoch observationsof 291 quasars by the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii/iii. these observationsprimarily sample rest-frame timescales of 1-3 yr over which significantrearrangement of the bal wind is expected. we derive a number of observationalresults on, e.g., the frequency of bal variability, the velocity range overwhich bal variability occurs, the primary observed form of bal-troughvariability, the dependence of bal variability upon timescale, the frequency ofbal strengthening vs. weakening, correlations between bal variability andbal-trough profiles, relations between c iv and si iv bal variability,coordinated multi-trough variability, and bal variations as a function ofquasar properties. we assess implications of these observational results forquasar winds. our results support models where most bal absorption is formedwithin an order-of-magnitude of the wind-launching radius, although asignificant minority of bal troughs may arise on larger scales. we estimate anaverage lifetime for a bal trough along our line-of-sight of a few thousandyears. bal disappearance and emergence events appear to be extremes of generalbal variability, rather than being qualitatively distinct phenomena. we derivethe parameters of a random-walk model for bal ew variability, finding that thismodel can acceptably describe some key aspects of ew variability. thecoordinated trough variability of bal quasars with multiple troughs suggeststhat changes in "shielding gas" may play a significant role in driving generalbal variability.

1309.6768	probing the circumgalactic medium at high-redshift using composite boss  spectra of strong lyman-alpha forest absorbers	we present composite spectra constructed from a sample of 242,150 lyman-alpha(lya) forest absorbers at redshifts 2.4&lt;z&lt;3.1 identified in quasar spectra fromthe baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) as part of data release 9 ofthe sloan digital sky survey iii. we select forest absorbers by their flux inbins 138 km/s wide (approximately the size of the boss resolution element). wesplit these absorbers into five samples spanning the range of flux -0.05 &lt;f&lt;0.45. tests on a smaller sample of high-resolution spectra show that ourthree strongest absorption bins would probe circumgalactic regions (projectedseparation &lt; 300 proper kpc and |delta v| &lt; 300km/s) in about 60% of cases forvery high signal-to-noise ratio. within this subset, weakening lya absorptionis associated with decreasing purity of circumgalactic selection once bossnoise is included. our weaker two lya absorption samples are dominated by theintergalactic medium.  we present composite spectra of these samples and a catalogue of measuredabsorption features from hi and 13 metal ionization species, all of which wemake available to the community. we compare measurements of seven lyman seriestransitions in our composite spectra to single line models and obtain furtherconstraints from their associated excess lyman limit opacity. this analysisprovides results consistent with column densities over the range 14.4 &lt;~ log(n_hi) &lt;~ 16.45. we compare our measurements of metal absorption to a varietyof simple single-line, single-phase models for a preliminary interpretation.our results imply clumping on scales down to ~30 pc and near-solarmetallicities in the circumgalactic samples, while high-ionization metalabsorption consistent with typical igm densities and metallicities is visiblein all samples.

1310.6716	search for primordial non-gaussianity in the quasars of sdss-iii boss  dr9	we analyse the clustering of 22,361 quasars between redshift 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.9observed with the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss), which are included in the ninth data release(dr9). we fit the clustering results with a {\lambda}cdm model to calculate thelinear bias of the quasar sample, b=3.74\pm 0.12. the measured value of bias isconsistent with the findings of white et al. (2012), where they analyse almostthe same quasar sample, although only in the range, s&lt;40 mpc/h. at large scaleswe observe an excess or plateau in the clustering correlation function. byfitting a model that incorporates a scale dependent additional term in the biasintroduced by primordial non-gaussianity of the local type, we calculate theamplitude of the deviation from the gaussian initial conditions as 70&lt;f_nl&lt; 190at the 95% confidence level. we correct the sample from systematics accordingto the methods of ross et al. (2011); ho et al. (2012) and ross et al.(2011,2012b), with the f_nl measurements after the application of the twomethods being consistent with each other. finally we use cross-correlationsacross redshift slices to test the corrected sample for any remaining unknownsources of systematics, but the results give no indication of any such furthererrors. we consider as our final results on non-gaussianity of the local type,46&lt;f_nl&lt; 158 at 95% confidence, after correcting the sample with the weightsmethod of ross et al. (2011, 2012b). these results are consistent with previoustight constraints on non-gaussianity from other lss surveys, but are in tensionwith the latest results from the cmb.

1311.2597	sloan digital sky survey iii photometric quasar clustering: probing the  initial conditions of the universe using the largest volume	the sloan digital sky survey has surveyed 14,555 square degrees of the sky,and delivered over a trillion pixels of imaging data. we present thelarge-scale clustering of 1.6 million quasars between z = 0.5 and z = 2.5 thathave been classified from this imaging, representing the highest density ofquasars ever studied for clustering measurements. this data set spans ~11,000square degrees and probes a volume of 80(gpc/h)^3. in principle, such a largevolume and medium density of tracers should facilitate high-precisioncosmological constraints. we measure the angular clustering of photometricallyclassified quasars using an optimal quadratic estimator in four redshift sliceswith an accuracy of ~25% over a bin width of l ~10 - 15 on scales correspondingto matter-radiation equality and larger (l ~ 2 - 30). observational systematicscan strongly bias clustering measurements on large scales, which can mimiccosmologically relevant signals such as deviations from gaussianity in thespectrum of primordial perturbations. we account for systematics by employing anew method recently proposed by agarwal et al. (2014) to the clustering ofphotometrically classified quasars. we carefully apply our methodology tomitigate known observational systematics and further remove angular bins thatare contaminated by unknown systematics. combining quasar data with thephotometric luminous red galaxy (lrg) sample of ross et al. (2011) and ho etal. (2012), and marginalizing over all bias and shot noise-like parameters, weobtain a constraint on local primordial non-gaussianity of fnl = -113+/-154(1\sigma error). [abridged]

1311.4870	the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalog: tenth data release	we present the data release 10 quasar (dr10q) catalog from the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii.the catalog includes all boss objects that were targeted as quasar candidatesduring the first 2.5 years of the survey and that are confirmed as quasars viavisual inspection of the spectra. the catalog also includes known quasars(mostly from sdss-i and ii) that were reobserved by boss. the catalog contains166,583 quasars (74,454 are new discoveries since sdss-dr9) detected over 6,373deg$^{2}$ with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination ofprincipal component eigenspectra. the number of quasars with $z&gt;2.15$ (117,668)is $\sim$5 times greater than the number of $z&gt;2.15$ quasars known prior toboss. redshifts and fwhms are provided for the strongest emission lines (civ,ciii, mgii). the catalog identifies 16,461 broad absorption line quasars andgives their characteristics. for each object, the catalog presents five-band(u, g, r, i, z) ccd-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag andinformation on the optical morphology and selection method. the catalog alsocontains x-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties ofthe quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. the calibrateddigital spectra cover the wavelength region 3,600-10,500\aa\ at a spectralresolution in the range 1,300$&lt;$r$&lt;$2,500; the spectra can be retrieved fromthe sdss catalog archive server. we also provide a supplemental list of anadditional 2,376 quasars that have been identified among the galaxy targets ofthe sdss-iii/boss.

1312.4611	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: testing gravity with redshift-space distortions using  the power spectrum multipoles	we analyse the anisotropic clustering of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) cmass data release 11 (dr11) sample, which consists of $690\,827$galaxies in the redshift range $0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ and has a sky coverage of$8\,498\,\text{deg}^2$. we perform our analysis in fourier space using a powerspectrum estimator suggested by yamamoto et al. (2006). we measure themultipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in thesense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and theintegral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic powerspectrum and without the need to split the survey into sub-regions. the maincosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acousticoscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which aredistorted by the alcock-paczynski effect. together, these signals allow us toconstrain the distance ratio $d_v(z_{\rm eff})/r_s(z_d) = 13.89\pm 0.18$, thealcock-paczynski parameter $f_{\rm ap}(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.679\pm0.031$ and thegrowth rate of structure $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.419\pm0.044$at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. we did not find significantsystematic uncertainties for $d_v/r_s$ or $f_{\rm ap}$ but include a systematicerror for $f\sigma_8$ of $3.1\%$. combining our dataset with planck to testgeneral relativity (gr) through the simple $\gamma$-parameterisation, reveals a$\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the data and the prediction by gr. the tensionbetween our result and gr can be traced back to a tension in the clusteringamplitude $\sigma_8$ between cmass and planck.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1403.4599	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: signs of neutrino mass in current cosmological datasets	we investigate the cosmological implications of the latest growth ofstructure measurement from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)cmass data release 11 with particular focus on the sum of the neutrino masses,$\sum m_{\nu}$. we examine the robustness of the cosmological constraints fromthe baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale, the alcock-paczynski effect andredshift-space distortions ($d_v/r_s$, $f_{\rm ap}$, $f\sigma_8$) of\citet{beutler:2013b}, when introducing a neutrino mass in the power spectrumtemplate. we then discuss how the neutrino mass relaxes discrepancies betweenthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) and other low-redshift measurementswithin $\lambda$cdm. combining our cosmological constraints with wmap9 yields$\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), which represents a $2.6\sigma$preference for non-zero neutrino mass. the significance can be increased to$3.3\sigma$ when including weak lensing results and other bao constraints,yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.35\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.). however, combiningcmass with planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to $\sim2\sigma$. when removing the cmb lensing effect in the planck temperature powerspectrum (by marginalising over $a_{\rm l}$), we see shifts of $\sim 1\sigma$in $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_m$, which have a significant effect on the neutrinomass constraints. in case of cmass plus planck without the $a_{\rm l}$-lensingsignal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.34\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), in excellent agreement with the wmap9+cmass value. theconstraint can be tightened to $3.4\sigma$ yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.) when weak lensing data and other bao constraints areincluded.

1404.1801	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly{\alpha} forest of boss dr11  quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in theflux-correlation function of the ly{\alpha} forest of high-redshift quasarswith a statistical significance of five standard deviations. the study uses137,562 quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the data release11 (dr11) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of sdss-iii.this sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previousstudies. the measured position of the bao peak determines the angular distance,$d_a(z=2.34)$ and expansion rate, $h(z=2.34)$, both on a scale set by the soundhorizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$. we find$d_a/r_d=11.28\pm0.65(1\sigma)^{+2.8}_{-1.2}(2\sigma)$ and$d_h/r_d=9.18\pm0.28(1\sigma)\pm0.6(2\sigma)$ where $d_h=c/h$. the optimalcombination, $\sim d_h^{0.7}d_a^{0.3}/r_d$ is determined with a precision of$\sim2\%$. for the value $r_d=147.4~{\rm mpc}$, consistent with the cmb powerspectrum measured by planck, we find $d_a(z=2.34)=1662\pm96(1\sigma)~{\rm mpc}$and $h(z=2.34)=222\pm7(1\sigma)~{\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$. tests with mockcatalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematicuncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. our results agree with thepreviously reported bao measurement at the same redshift using thequasar-ly{\alpha} forest cross-correlation. the auto-correlation andcross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite differentimpact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. the combinedconstraints from the two correlation functions imply values of $d_a/r_d$ and$d_h/r_d$ that are, respectively, 7% low and 7% high compared to thepredictions of a flat $\lambda$cdm cosmological model with the best-fit planckparameters. with our estimated statistical errors, the significance of thisdiscrepancy is $\approx 2.5\sigma$.

0802.4288	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the clustering of luminous  red galaxies since z = 0.6	we present an analysis of the small-to-intermediate scale clustering ofsamples of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey andthe 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey carefully matched to have the samerest-frame colours and luminosity. we study the spatial two-pointauto-correlation function in both redshift-space and real-space of a combinedsample of over 10,000 lrgs, which represent the most massive galaxies in theuniverse with stellar masses &gt; 10^11 h^-1 m_sun and space densities 10^-4 h^-3mpc^-3. we find no significant evolution in the amplitude r_0 of thecorrelation function with redshift, but do see a slight decrease in the slopewith increasing redshift over 0.19 &lt; z &lt; 0.55 and scales of 0.32 &lt; r &lt; 32 h^-1mpc. we compare our measurements with the predicted evolution of dark matterclustering and use the halo model to interpret our results. we find that ourclustering measurements are inconsistent (&gt;99.9% significance) with a passivemodel whereby the lrgs do not merge with one another; a model with a mergerrate of 7.5 +/- 2.3% from z = 0.55 to z = 0.19 (i.e. an average rate of 2.4%gyr^-1) provides a better fit to our observations. our clustering and numberdensity measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the merged lrgswere originally central galaxies in different haloes which, following themerger of these haloes, merged to create a single brightest cluster galaxy. inaddition, we show that the small-scale clustering signal constrains the scatterin halo merger histories. when combined with measurements of the luminosityfunction, our results suggest that this scatter is sub-poisson. while this is ageneric prediction of hierarchical models, it has not been tested before.

1406.7181	the co-evolution of black hole growth and star formation from a  cross-correlation analysis between quasars and the cosmic infrared background	we present the first cross-correlation measurement between sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) type 1 quasars and the cosmic infrared background (cib) measuredby herschel. the distribution of the quasars at 0.15&lt;z&lt;3.5 covers the redshiftrange where we expect most of the cib to originate. we detect the sub-mmemission of the quasars, which dominates on small scales, as well as correlatedemission from dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) dominant on larger scales.the mean sub-mm flux densities of the dr7 quasars (median redshift &lt;z&gt;=1.4) is$11.1^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$, $7.1^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$ and $3.6^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$ mjy at 250,350 and 500 microns, respectively, while the mean sub-mm flux densities of thedr9 quasars (&lt;z&gt;=2.5) is $5.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$, $5.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and$1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mjy. we find that the correlated sub-mm emission includesboth the emission from satellite dsfgs in the same halo as the central quasarand the emission from dsfgs in separate halos (correlated with thequasar-hosting halo). the amplitude of the one-halo term is ~10 times smallerthan the sub-mm emission of the quasars, implying the the satellites have alower star-formation rate than the quasars. the satellite fraction for the dr7quasars is $0.008^{+0.008}_{-0.005}$ and the host halo mass scale for thecentral and satellite quasars is $10^{12.36\pm0.87}$ m$_{\odot}$ and$10^{13.60\pm0.38}$ m$_{\odot}$, respectively. the satellite fraction of thedr9 quasars is $0.065^{+0.021}_{-0.031}$ and the host halo mass scale for thecentral and satellite quasars is $10^{12.29\pm0.62}$ m$_{\odot}$ and$10^{12.82\pm0.39}$ m$_{\odot}$, respectively. thus, the typical haloenvironment of the sdss type 1 quasars is found to be similar to that of dsfgs,which supports the generally accepted view that dusty starburst and quasaractivity are evolutionarily linked.

1407.2250	the dependence of c iv broad absorption line properties on accompanying  si iv and al iii absorption: relating quasar-wind ionization levels,  kinematics, and column densities	we consider how the profile and multi-year variability properties of a largesample of c iv broad absorption line (bal) troughs change when bals from si ivand/or al iii are present at corresponding velocities, indicating that theline-of-sight intercepts at least some lower ionization gas. we derive a numberof observational results for c iv bals separated according to the presence orabsence of accompanying lower ionization transitions, including measurements ofcomposite profile shapes, equivalent width (ew), characteristic velocities,composite variation profiles, and ew variability. we also measure thecorrelations between ew and fractional-ew variability for c iv, si iv, and aliii. our measurements reveal the basic correlated changes between ionizationlevel, kinematics, and column density expected in accretion-disk wind models;e.g., lines-of-sight including lower ionization material generally show deeperand broader c iv troughs that have smaller minimum velocities and that are lessvariable. many c iv bals with no accompanying si iv or al iii bals may haveonly mild or no saturation.

1408.1523	the 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.65 evolution of the bright end of the [oii] luminosity  function	we present the [oii] luminosity function measured in the redshift range0.1&lt;z&lt;1.65 with unprecedented depth and accuracy. our measurements are based onmedium resolution flux-calibrated spectra of emission line galaxies with thefors2 instrument at vlt and with the sdss-iii/boss spectrograph. the fors2spectra and the corresponding catalog containing redshifts and line fluxes arereleased along with this paper.  in this work we use a novel method to combine the aforementioned surveys withgama, zcosmos and vvds, which have different target selection, producing aconsistent weighting scheme to derive the [oii] luminosity function.  the measured luminosity function is in good agreement with previousindependent estimates. the comparison with two state-of-the-art semi-analyticalmodels is good, which is encouraging for the production of mock catalogs of[oii] flux limited surveys. we observe the bright end evolution over 8.5 gyr:we measure the decrease of log l* from 42.4 erg/s at redshift 1.44 to 41.2 atredshift 0.165 and we find that the faint end slope flattens when redshiftdecreases.  this measurement confirms the feasibility of the target selection of futurebaryonic acoustic oscillation surveys aiming at observing [oii] flux limitedsamples.

1410.7244	constraint on neutrino masses from sdss-iii/boss ly$\alpha$ forest and  other cosmological probes	we present constraints on the parameters of the $\lambda$cdm cosmologicalmodel in the presence of massive neutrinos, using the one-dimensionally$\alpha$ forest power spectrum obtained with the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) bypalanque-delabrouille et al. (2013), complemented by additional cosmologicalprobes. the interpretation of the measured ly$\alpha$ spectrum is done using asecond-order taylor expansion of the simulated power spectrum. boss  ly$\alpha$ data alone provide better bounds than previous ly$\alpha$ results,but are still poorly constraining, especially for the sum of neutrino masses$\sum m_\nu$, for which we obtain an upper bound of 1.1~ev (95\% cl), includingsystematics for both data and simulations. ly$\alpha$ constraints on$\lambda$cdm parameters and neutrino masses are compatible with cmb bounds fromthe planck collaboration. interestingly, the combination of ly$\alpha$ with cmbdata reduces the uncertainties significantly, due to very different directionsof degeneracy in parameter space, leading to the strongest cosmological boundto date on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.15$~ev at 95\% cl (with abest-fit in zero). adding recent bao results further tightens this constraintto $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.14$~ev at 95\% cl. this bound is nearly independent of thestatistical approach used, and of the different combinations of cmb and baodata sets considered in this paper in addition to ly$\alpha$. given themeasured values of the two squared mass differences $\delta m^2$, this resulttends to favor the normal hierarchy scenario against the inverted hierarchyscenario for the masses of the active neutrino species.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1504.04088	large-scale clustering of lyman-alpha emission intensity from sdss/boss	(abridged) we detect the large-scale structure of lya emission in theuniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of lya surfacebrightness with quasars in sdss/boss. we use a million spectra targetingluminous red galaxies at z&lt;0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxyspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift lya surfacebrightness. the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shapeconsistent with a lambdacdm model with omega_m =0.30^+0.10-0.07. the predictedamplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the meanlya surface brightness, &lt;mu_alpha&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and thequasar and lya emission bias factors. using known values, we infer&lt;mu_alpha&gt;(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 a^-1 arcsec^-2,where b_alpha is the lya emission bias factor. if the dominant sources of lyaemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_sfr = (0.28 +/- 0.07)(3/b_alpha) /yr/mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. for b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected lya emitters,although consistent with the total rho_sfr derived from dust-corrected,continuum uv surveys. 97% of the lya emission in the universe at theseredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of lya emitters. ourmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halossurrounding previously detected lya emitters, but we speculate that it arisesfrom similar lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. we alsodetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation,finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (zheng et al.(2011)). our measurements represent the first application of the intensitymapping technique to optical observations.

1507.08380	clustering of intermediate redshift quasars using the final sdss  iii-boss sample	we measure the two-point clustering of spectroscopically confirmed quasarsfrom the final sample of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) oncomoving scales of 4 &lt; s &lt; 22 mpc/h. the sample covers 6950 deg^2 (~ 19(gpc/h)^3) and, over the redshift range 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.8, contains 55,826homogeneously selected quasars, which is twice as many as in any similar work.we deduce b_q = 3.54 +/- 0.10 ; the most precise measurement of quasar bias todate at these redshifts. this corresponds to a host halo mass of ~ 2 x 10^12 ~m_sun/h with an implied quasar duty cycle of ~1 percent. the real-spaceprojected correlation function is well-fit by a power law of index -2 andcorrelation length r0 = (8.12 +/- 0.22), mpc/h over scales of 4 &lt; rp &lt; 25 ~mpc/h. to better study the evolution of quasar clustering at moderate redshift,we extend the redshift range of our study to z ~ 3.4 and measure the bias andcorrelation length of three subsamples over 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. we find nosignificant evolution of r0 or bias over this range, implying that the hosthalo mass of quasars decreases somewhat with increasing redshift. we findquasar clustering remains similar over a decade in luminosity, contradicting ascenario in which quasar luminosity is monotonically related to halo mass at z~ 2.5. our results are broadly consistent with previous boss measurements, butthey yield more precise constraints based upon a larger and more uniform dataset.

1508.04121	quasar classification using color and variability	we conduct a pilot investigation to determine the optimal combination ofcolor and variability information to identify quasars in current and futuremulti-epoch optical surveys. we use a bayesian quasar selection algorithm(richards et al. 2004) to identify 35,820 type 1 quasar candidates in a 239square degree field of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82, using acombination of optical photometry and variability. color analysis is performedon 5-band single- and multi-epoch sdss optical photometry to a depth of r~22.4. from these data, variability parameters are calculated by fitting thestructure function of each object in each band with a power law model using 10to &gt;100 observations over timescales from ~1 day to ~8 years. selection wasbased on a training sample of 13,221 spectroscopically-confirmed type-1quasars, largely from the sdss. using variability alone, colors alone, andcombining variability and colors we achieve 91%, 93%, and 97% quasarcompleteness and 98%, 98%, and 97% efficiency respectively, with particularimprovement in the selection of quasars at 2.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 where quasars and starshave similar optical colors. the 22,867 quasar candidates that are notspectroscopically confirmed reach a depth of i ~22.0; 21,876 (95.7%) are dimmerthan coadded i-band magnitude of 19.9, the cut off for spectroscopic follow-upfor sdss on stripe 82. brighter than 19.9, we find 5.7% more quasar candidateswithout confirming spectra in sky regions otherwise considered complete. theresulting quasar sample has sufficient purity (and statistically correctableincompleteness) to produce a luminosity function comparable to those determinedby spectroscopic investigations. we discuss improvements that can be made tothe process in preparation for performing similar photometric selection andscience on data from post-sdss sky surveys.

0810.4144	quasar clustering from sdss dr5: dependences on physical properties	using a homogenous sample of 38,208 quasars with a sky coverage of $4000 {\rmdeg^2}$ drawn from the sdss data release five quasar catalog, we study thedependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole mass, quasarcolor, and radio loudness. at $z&lt;2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly onluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\sim10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. these weak dependences areconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,virial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted anyclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantitythat best correlates with clustering strength. however, the most luminous andmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\sim 2\sigma$ level)than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase ofthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. we do not observe a strongdependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. on theother hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quietquasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial black hole mass),consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 agn.thus radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in thebiased halo clustering picture. using the sheth et al.(2001) formula for thelinear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is $\sim10^{13} h^{-1}m_\odot$, compared to $\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}m_\odot$ forradio-quiet quasar hosts at $z\sim 1.5$.
