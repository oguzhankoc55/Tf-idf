0902.2424	optical and supersoft x-ray light curve models of classical nova v2491  cygni: a new clue to the secondary maximum	v2491 cygni (nova cygni 2008 no.2) was detected as a transient supersoftx-ray source with the swift xrt as early as 40 days after the outburst,suggesting a very massive white dwarf (wd) close to the chandrasekhar limit. wepresent a unified model of near infrared, optical, and x-ray light curves forv2491 cyg, and have estimated, from our best-fit model, the wd mass to be 1.3\pm 0.02 m_\sun with an assumed chemical composition of the envelope, x=0.20,y= 0.48, x_{cno} =0.20, x_{ne} =0.10, and z = 0.02 by mass weight. we stronglyrecommend detailed composition analysis of the ejecta because some enrichmentof the wd matter suggests that the wd mass does not increase like in rs oph,which is a candidate of type ia supernova progenitors. v2491 cyg shows apeculiar secondary maximum in the optical light curve as well as v1493 aql andv2362 cyg. introducing magnetic activity as an adding energy source to nuclearburning, we propose a physical mechanism of the secondary maxima.

0912.1136	a prediction formula of supersoft x-ray phase of classical novae	on the basis of the recently developed universal decline law of classicalnovae, we propose prediction formulae for supersoft x-ray on and off times,i.e., t_{x-on} = (10 \pm 1.8) t_3 days and t_{x-off} = (5.3 \pm 1.4)(t_3)^{1.5} days for 8 &lt; t_3 &lt; 80 days. we have determined the absolutemagnitude of our free-free emission model light curves and derived maximummagnitude vs. rate of decline (mmrd) relations. our theoretical mmrd relationsare governed by two parameters, one is the white dwarf (wd) mass and the otheris the initial envelope mass at a nova outburst; this second parameter explainsthe scatter of mmrd points of individual novae. our theoretical mmrd relationsare also in good agreement with the well-known empirical formulae. we also showanother empirical relation of m_v(15) ~ -5.7 \pm 0.3 based on the absolutemagnitude of our model light curves, i.e., the absolute magnitude at 15 daysafter optical maximum is almost common among various novae. we analyzed tennova light curves, in which a supersoft x-ray phase was detected, and estimatedtheir wd masses. the models best reproducing simultaneously the optical andsupersoft x-ray observations are onemg wds with 1.28 \pm 0.04 m_\sun (v598pup), 1.23 \pm 0.05 m_\sun (v382 vel), 1.15 \pm 0.06 m_\sun (v4743 sgr), 1.13\pm 0.06 m_\sun (v1281 sco), 1.2 \pm 0.05 m_\sun (v597 pup), 1.06 \pm 0.07m_\sun (v1494 aql), 1.04 \pm 0.07 m_\sun (v2467 cyg), 1.07 \pm 0.07 m_\sun(v5116 sgr), 1.05 \pm 0.05 m_\sun (v574 pup), and a co wd with 0.93 \pm 0.08m_\sun (v458 vul). the newly proposed relationships are consistent with theemergence or decay epoch of the supersoft x-ray phase of these ten novae.finally, we discuss the mechanism of shock-origin hard x-ray component inrelation to the emergence of companion star from the wd envelope.

0912.5056	a prediction of supersoft x-ray phase of classical nova v5583 sagittarii	we have observed the fast nova v5583 sagittarii with five b, v, y, r_c, andi_c bands, and found that these multi-band light curves are almost identicalwith those of v382 vel 1999 until at least 100 days after outburst. a supersoftx-ray phase of v382 vel was detected with bepposax about six months afteroutburst. v5583 sgr outbursted a few days ago the discovery on 2009 august 6.5ut near its optical peak. from a complete resemblance between these two novalight curves, we expect a supersoft x-ray phase of v5583 sgr six months afteroutburst. detection of supersoft x-ray turn-on/turnoff dates strongly constrainthe evolution of a nova and, as a result, mass range of the wd. for a timelyobservation of a supersoft x-ray phase of v5583 sgr, we have calculated novaoutburst evolution based on the optically thick wind theory, which predicts thesupersoft x-ray phase: it will most probably start between days 100 and 140 andcontinue until days 200-240 after outburst. we strongly recommend multipleobservations during 2009 december, and 2010 january, february, and march todetect the turn-on and turnoff times of the supersoft x-ray phase of v5583 sgr.

1010.5860	supersoft x-ray phase of single degenerate type ia supernova progenitors  in early type galaxies	in the single degenerate (sd) scenario for type ia supernova (sn ia)progenitors, an accreting white dwarf (wd) is expected to undergo a supersoftx-ray source (sss) phase. recently, gilfanov &amp; bogdan (2010, hereafter gb10)claimed that observed x-ray fluxes of early type galaxies would be too low tobe consistent with the prediction of the sd scenario based on rather simpleassumptions. we present realistic evolutionary models of sd systems andcalculate durations of sss phases. in most cases, accreting wds spend a largefraction of time in the optically thick wind phase and the recurrent nova phaserather than the sss phase. thus the sss phase lasts only for a few hundredthousand years. this is by a factor of ~10 shorter than those adopted by gb10where the sn~ia progenitor wd was assumed to spend most of its life as a sss.the theoretical x-ray luminosity of the sss has a large uncertainty because ofthe uncertain atmospheric model of mass-accreting wds and absorption of softx-rays by the companion star's cool wind material. we thus adopt an average ofthe observed fluxes of existing symbiotic ssss, i.e., ~0.4 x 10^{36} erg s^{-1}for 0.3--0.7 kev. using these sss duration and soft x-ray luminosity, we showthat the observed x-ray flux obtained by gb10 is rather consistent with ourestimated flux in early type galaxies based on the sd scenario. this is astrong support for the sd scenario as a main-contributor of sne ia in earlytype galaxies.

1106.3510	a single degenerate progenitor model for type ia supernovae highly  exceeding the chandrasekhar mass limit	recent observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia) suggest that some of theprogenitor white dwarfs (wds) had masses up to 2.4-2.8 m_sun, highly exceedingthe chandrasekhar mass limit. we present a new single degenerate (sd) model forsn ia progenitors, in which the wd mass possibly reaches 2.3-2.7 m_sun. threebinary evolution processes are incorporated; optically thick winds frommass-accreting wds, mass-stripping from the binary companion star by the wdwinds, and wds being supported by differential rotation. the wd mass canincrease by accretion up to 2.3 (2.7) m_sun from the initial value of 1.1 (1.2)m_sun, being consistent with high luminosity sne ia such as sn 2003fg, sn2006gz, sn 2007if, and sn 2009dc. there are three characteristic mass ranges ofexploding wds. in an extreme massive case, differentially rotating wds explodeas an sn ia soon after the wd mass exceeds 2.4 m_sun because of a secularinstability at t/|w|\sim 0.14. for a mid mass range of m_wd=1.5-2.4 m_sun, ittakes some time (spinning-down time) until carbon is ignited to induce an sn iaexplosion after the wd mass has reached maximum, because it needs a loss orredistribution of angular momentum. for a lower mass case of rigidly rotatingwds, m_wd=1.38-1.5 m_sun, the spinning-down time depends on the timescale ofangular momentum loss from the wd. the difference in the spinning-down time mayproduce the "prompt" and "tardy" components. we also suggest the very brightsuper-chandrasekhar mass sne ia are born in a low metallicity environment.

0710.0319	young and massive binary progenitors of type ia supernovae and their  circumstellar matter	we present new evolutionary models for type ia supernova (sn ia) progenitors,introducing mass-stripping effect on a main-sequence (ms) or slightly evolvedcompanion star by winds from a mass-accreting white dwarf (wd). themass-stripping attenuates the rate of mass transfer from the companion to thewd. as a result, quite a massive ms companion can avoid forming a commonenvelope and increase the wd mass up to the sn ia explosion. including themass-stripping effect, we follow binary evolutions of various wd + ms systemsand obtain the parameter region in the initial donor mass - orbital periodplane where sne ia occur. the newly obtained sn ia region extends to donormasses of 6-7 m_\sun, although its extension depends on the efficiency ofmass-stripping effect. the stripped matter would mainly be distributed on theorbital plane and form very massive circumstellar matter (csm) around the sn iaprogenitor. it can explain massive csm around sne ia/iin(iia) 2002ic and 2005gjas well as tenuous csm around normal sn ia 2006x. our new model suggests thepresence of very young (\lesssim 10^8 yr) populations of sne ia, beingconsistent with recent observational indications of young population sne ia.

1109.1499	effects of a companion star on slow nova outbursts -- transition from  static to wind evolutions	two types of nova evolutions can be realized in low mass white dwarfs of~0.5-0.7 m_sun, i.e., an evolution with optically thick winds like in usualclassical novae, or an another type of evolution without them like in thesymbiotic nova pu vul. the latter type is characterized by spectra of noindication of strong winds as well as a long-lasted flat optical peak in itslight curve. we propose a transition from no-optically-thick-wind evolution tousual evolution with optically thick winds as a new outburst model for slownovae that show a relatively long-lasted multipeak phase followed by a windphase like in the slow novae v723 cas, hr del, and v5558 sgr. we calculatednova envelopes with one-dimensional approximation of the companion's effectsand found that when the companion star is deeply embedded in the extended novaenvelope, the structure of static envelope approaches that of the opticallythick wind solution. thus, the transition from static to wind solution istriggered by the effect of the companion. the transition occurs in a closebinary nova like v723 cas, but is not triggered in a long period binary like puvul. we reconfirm our previous results that the frictional energy deposition isnegligibly small in almost all of hydrogen/helium novae because of the lowenvelope density at the orbit.

1202.6171	evolution of the symbiotic nova pu vul -- outbursting white dwarf,  nebulae, and pulsating red giant companion	we present a composite light-curve model of the symbiotic nova pu vul (novavulpeculae 1979) that shows a long-lasted flat optical peak followed by a slowdecline. our model light-curve consists of three components of emission, i.e.,an outbursting white dwarf (wd), its m-giant companion, and nebulae. the wdcomponent dominates in the flat peak while the nebulae dominate after thephotospheric temperature of the wd rises to log t (k) &gt;~ 4.5, suggesting its wdorigin. we analyze the 1980 and 1994 eclipses to be total eclipses of the wdocculted by the pulsating m-giant companion with two sources of the nebularemission; one is an unocculted nebula of the m-giant's cool-wind origin and theother is a partially occulted nebula associated to the wd. we confirmed ourtheoretical outburst model of pu vul by new observational estimates, thatspanned 32 yr, of the temperature and radius. also our eclipse analysisconfirmed that the wd photosphere decreased by two orders of magnitude betweenthe 1980 and 1994 eclipses. we obtain the reddening e(b-v) ~ 0.3 and distanceto pu vul d ~ 4.7 kpc. we interpret the recent recovery of brightness in termsof eclipse of the hot nebula surrounding the wd, suggesting that hydrogenburning is still going on. to detect supersoft x-rays, we recommend x-rayobservations around june 2014 when absorption by neutral hydrogen is minimum.

1207.2261	final fates of rotating white dwarfs and their companions in the single  degenerate model of type ia supernovae	taking into account the rotation of mass-accreting white dwarfs (wds) whosemasses exceed the chandrasekhar mass, we extend our new single degenerate modelfor the progenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia), accounting for two types ofbinary systems, those with a main sequence companion and those with a red-giant(rg) companion. we present a mass distribution of wds exploding as sne ia,where the wd mass ranges from 1.38 to 2.3 msun. these progenitor models areassigned to various types of sne ia. a lower mass range of wds (1.38 msun &lt;m_wd &lt;~ 1.5 msun), which are supported by rigid rotation, correspond to normalsne ia. a variety of spin-down time may lead to a variation of brightness. ahigher mass range of wds (m_wd &gt;~ 1.5 msun), which are supported bydifferential rotation, correspond to brighter sne ia such as sn 1991t. in thiscase, a variety of the wd mass may lead to a variation of brightness. we alsoshow the evolutionary states of the companion stars at sn ia explosions andpose constraints on the unseen companions. in the wd+rg systems, in particular,most of the rg companions have evolved to helium/carbon-oxygen wds in thespin-down phase before the sn ia explosions. in such a case, we do not expectany prominent signature of the companion immediately before and after theexplosion. we also compare our new models with the recent stringent constraintson the unseen progenitors of sne ia such as sn 2011fe.

1211.5728	an x-ray and optical light curv model of the eclipsing symbiotic binary  smc3	some binary evolution scenarios to type ia supernovae include long-periodbinaries that evolve to symbiotic supersoft x-ray sources in their late stageof evolution. however, symbiotic stars with steady hydrogen burning on thewhite dwarf's (wd) surface are very rare, and the x-ray characteristics are notwell known. smc3 is one such rare example and a key object for understandingthe evolution of symbiotic stars to type ia supernovae. smc3 is an eclipsingsymbiotic binary, consisting of a massive wd and red giant (rg), with anorbital period of 4.5 years in the small magellanic cloud. the long-term vlight curve variations are reproduced as orbital variations in the irradiatedrg, whose atmosphere fills its roche lobe, thus supporting the idea that the rgsupplies matter to the wd at rates high enough to maintain steady hydrogenburning on the wd. we also present an eclipse model in which an x-ray emittingregion around the wd is almost totally occulted by the rg swelling over theroche lobe on the trailing side, although it is always partly obscured by along spiral tail of neutral hydrogen surrounding the binary in the orbitalplane.

1212.2295	recurrent novae as progenitors of type ia supernovae	recurrent novae are binaries harboring a very massive white dwarf (wd), asmassive as the chandrasekhar mass, because of their short recurrence periods ofnova outbursts of 10-100 years. thus, recurrent novae are considered ascandidates of progenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia). in fact, the sn iaptf11kx showed evidence that its progenitor is a symbiotic recurrent nova. thebinary parameters of recurrent novae have been well determined, especially forthe ones with frequent outbursts, u sco and rs oph, which provide usefulinformation on the elementary processes in binary evolution toward sne ia.therefore we use them as testbeds for binary evolution models. for example, theoriginal double degenerate (dd) scenario cannot reproduce rs oph type recurrentnovae, whereas the new single degenerate (sd) scenario proposed by hachisu etal. (1999) naturally can. we review main differences between the sd and ddscenarios, especially for their basic processes of binary evolution. we alsodiscuss observational support for each physical process. the original ddscenario is based on the physics in 1980s, whereas the sd scenario on morerecent physics including the new opacity, mass-growth efficiency of wds, andoptically thick winds developed in nova outbursts.

1310.6579	novae in globular clusters	we present the first light curve analysis of population ii novae thatappeared in m31 globular clusters. our light curve models, based on theoptically thick wind theory, reproduce well both the x-ray turn-on and turnofftimes with the white dwarf (wd) mass of about 1.2 mo for m31n 2007-06b in bol111 and about 1.37 mo for m31n 2010-10f in bol 126. the transient supersoftx-ray source cxo j004345 in bol 194 is highly likely a nova remnant of 1.2 --1.3 mo wd. these wd masses are quite consistent with the temperatures deducedfrom x-ray spectra. we also present the dependence of nova light curves on themetallicity in the range from [fe/h]=0.4 to -2.7. whereas strong opticallythick winds are accelerated in galactic disk novae owing to a large fe opacitypeak, only weak winds occur in population ii novae with low fe abundance. thus,nova light curves are systematically slow in low fe environment. for anextremely low fe abundance normal nova outbursts may not occur unless the wd isvery massive. we encourage v or y filter observation rather than r as well ashigh cadence x-ray monitorings to open quantitative studies of extragalacticnovae.

1401.7113	the ubv color evolution of classical novae. i. nova-giant sequence in  the color-color diagram	we identified a general course of classical nova outbursts in the b-v versusu-b color-color diagram. it is reported that novae show spectra similar tothose of a--f supergiants near optical light maximum. however, they do notfollow the supergiant sequence in the color-color diagram, neither theblackbody nor the main-sequence sequence. instead, we found that novae evolvealong a new sequence in the pre-maximum and near-maximum phases, which we call"the nova-giant sequence." this sequence is parallel to but \delta (u-b)\approx -0.2 mag bluer than the supergiant sequence. this is because the massof a nova envelope is much (\sim10^{-4} times) less than that of a normalsupergiant. after optical maximum, its color quickly evolves back bluewardalong the same nova-giant sequence and reaches the point of free-free emission(b-v=-0.03, u-b=-0.97), which coincides with the intersection of the blackbodysequence and the nova-giant sequence, and remains there for a while. then thecolor evolves leftward (blueward in b-v but almost constant in u-b), owingmainly to the development of strong emission lines. this is the general courseof nova outbursts in the color-color diagram, which was deduced from eightwell-observed novae in various speed classes. for a nova with unknownextinction, we can determine a reliable value of the color excess by matchingthe observed track of the target nova with this general course. this is a newand convenient method for obtaining the color excesses of classical novae.using this method, we redetermined the color excesses of twenty well-observednovae. the obtained color excesses are in reasonable agreement with theprevious results, which in turn supports the idea of our general track of novaoutbursts.

1410.7888	a light curve analysis of classical novae: free-free emission vs.  photospheric emission	we analyzed light curves of seven relatively slower novae, pw vul, v705 cas,gq mus, rr pic, v5558 sgr, hr del, and v723 cas, based on an optically thickwind theory of nova outbursts. for fast novae, free-free emission dominates thespectrum in optical bands rather than photospheric emission and nova opticallight curves follow the universal decline law. faster novae blow stronger windswith larger mass loss rates. since the brightness of free-free emission dependsdirectly on the wind mass loss rate, faster novae show brighter optical maxima.in slower novae, however, we must take into account photospheric emissionbecause of their lower wind mass loss rates. we calculated three model lightcurves of free-free emission, photospheric emission, and the sum of them forvarious wd masses with various chemical compositions of their envelopes, andfitted reasonably with observational data of optical, near-ir (nir), and uvbands. from light curve fittings of the seven novae, we estimated theirabsolute magnitudes, distances, and wd masses. in pw vul and v705 cas,free-free emission still dominates the spectrum in the optical and nir bands.in the very slow novae, rr pic, v5558 sgr, hr del, and v723 cas, photosphericemission dominates the spectrum rather than free-free emission, which makes adeviation from the universal decline law. we have confirmed that the absolutebrightnesses of our model light curves are consistent with the distance moduliof four classical novae with known distances (gk per, v603 aql, rr pic, and dqher). we also discussed the reason why the very slow novae are about 1 magbrighter than the proposed maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline relation.

1503.06739	subclasses of type ia supernovae as the origin of [\alpha/fe] ratios in  dwarf spheroidal galaxies	recent extensive observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia) have revealedthe existence of a diversity of sne ia, including sne iax. we introduce twopossible channels in the single degenerate scenario: 1) double detonations insub-chandrasekhar (ch) mass co white dwarfs (wds), where a thin he envelope isdeveloped with relatively low accretion rates after he novae even at lowmetallicities, and 2) carbon deflagrations in ch-mass possibly hybrid c+o+newds, where wd winds occur at [fe/h] ~ -2.5 at high accretion rates. thesesubclasses of sne ia are rarer than `normal' sne ia and do not affect thechemical evolution in the solar neighborhood, but can be very important inmetal-poor systems with stochastic star formation. in dwarf spheroidal galaxiesin the local group, the decrease of [\alpha/fe] ratios at [fe/h] ~ -2 to -1.5can be produced depending on the star formation history. sne iax give high[mn/fe], while sub-ch-mass sne ia give low [mn/fe], and thus a model includinga mix of the two is favoured by the available observations.

1504.06035	hydrodynamical evolution of merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs: their  pre-supernova structure and observational counterparts	we perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations for mergingbinary carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) with masses of $1.1$ and $1.0$$m_\odot$, until the merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state. usingthese results, we assess whether the binary could induce a thermonuclearexplosion, and whether the explosion could be observed as a type ia supernova(sn ia). we investigate three explosion mechanisms: a helium-ignition followingthe dynamical merger (`helium-ignited violent merger model'), a carbon-ignition(`carbon-ignited violent merger model'), and an explosion following theformation of the chandrasekhar mass wd (`chandrasekhar mass model'). anexplosion of the helium-ignited violent merger model is possible, while wepredict that the resulting sn ejecta are highly asymmetric since its companionstar is fully intact at the time of the explosion. the carbon-ignited violentmerger model can also lead to an explosion. however, the envelope of theexploding wd spreads out to $\sim 0.1r_\odot$; it is much larger than thatinferred for sn 2011fe ($&lt; 0.1r_\odot $) while much smaller than that for sn2014j ($\sim 1r_\odot$). for the particular combination of the wd massesstudied in this work, the chandrasekhar mass model is not successful to lead toan sn ia explosion. besides these assessments, we investigate the evolution ofunbound materials ejected through the merging process (`merger ejecta'),assuming a case where the sn ia explosion is not triggered by the helium- orcarbon-ignition during the merger. the merger ejecta interact with thesurrounding interstellar medium, and form a shell. the shell has a bolometricluminosity of more than $2 \times 10^{35}$ ergs$^{-1}$ lasting for $\sim 2\times 10^4$ yr. if this is the case, milky way should harbor about $10$ suchshells at any given time.

1505.01646	a systematic study of carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers: mass  combinations for type ia supernovae	mergers of two carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) have been considered asprogenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia). based on smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) simulations, previous studies claimed that mergers of cowds lead to an sn ia explosion either in the dynamical merger phase orstationary rotating merger remnant phase. however, the mass range of co wdsthat lead to an sn ia has not been clearly identified yet. in the present work,we perform systematic sph merger simulations for the wd masses ranging from$0.5~m_{\odot}$ to $1.1~m_{\odot}$ with higher resolutions than the previoussystematic surveys and examine whether or not carbon burning occurs dynamicallyor quiescently in each phase. we further study the possibility of sn iaexplosion and estimate the mass range of co wds that lead to an sn ia. we foundthat when the both wds are massive, i.e., in the mass range of $0.9~m_{\odot}{\le} m_{1,2} {\le} 1.1~m_{\odot}$, they can explode as an sn ia in the mergerphase. on the other hand, when the more massive wd is in the range of$0.7~m_{\odot} {\le} m_{1} {\le} 0.9~m_{\odot}$ and the total mass exceeds$1.38~m_{\odot}$, they can finally explode in the stationary rotating mergerremnant phase. we estimate the contribution of co wd mergers to the entire snia rate in our galaxy to be of ${\lt} 9\%$. so, it might be difficult toexplain all galactic sne ia by co wd mergers.

0805.2102	the delay time distribution of type ia supernovae and the single  degenerate model	we present a theoretical delay time distribution (dtd) of type ia supernovaeon the basis of our new evolutionary models of single degenerate (sd)progenitor systems. our model dtd has almost a featureless power law shape(\propto t^{-n} with n \approx 1) for the delay time from t \sim 0.1 to 10 gyr.this is in good agreement with the recent direct measurement of dtd. theobserved featureless property of the dtd has been suggested to be favorable forthe double degenerate (dd) scenario but not for the sd scenario. if the massrange of the companion star to the white dwarf (wd) were too narrow in the sdmodel, its dtd would be too limited around the companion's main-sequencelifetime to be consistent with the observed dtd. however, this is not the casein our sd model that consists of the two channels of wd + rg (red giant) and wd+ ms (main-sequence star). in these channels, the companion stars have a massrange of \sim 0.9-3 m_\sun (wd+rg) and \sim 2- 6 m_\sun (wd+ms). the combinedmass range is wide enough to yield the featureless dtd. we emphasize that thesd scenario should include two important processes: the optically thick windsfrom the mass-accreting wd and the mass-stripping from the companion star bythe wd wind.

1506.05364	multi-wavelength light curve model of the one-year recurrence period  nova m31n 2008-12a	we present a theoretical light curve model of the recurrent nova m31n2008-12a, the current record holder for the shortest recurrence period (1 yr).we combined interior structures calculated using a henyey-type evolution codewith optically thick wind solutions of hydrogen-rich envelopes, which give theproper mass-loss rates, photospheric temperatures, and luminosities. the lightcurve model is calculated for a 1.38 m_sun white dwarf (wd) with an accretionrate of 1.6 \times 10^{-7} m_sun yr^{-1}. this model shows a very higheffective temperature (log t_ph (k) \geq 4.97) and a very small wind mass-lossrate (\dot m_wind \leq 9.3 \times 10^{-6} m_sun yr^{-1}) even at the maximumexpansion of the photosphere. these properties are consistent with the faintoptical peak of m31n 2008-12a because the brightness of the free-free emissionis proportional to the square of the mass-loss rate. the model well reproducesthe short supersoft x-ray turn-on time of 6 days and turnoff time of 18 daysafter the outburst. the ejecta mass of our model is calculated to be 6.3 \times10^{-8} m_sun, corresponding to 37% of the accreted mass. the growth rate ofthe wd is 0.63 times the mass accretion rate, making it a progenitor for a typeia supernova. our light curve model predicts a bright supersoft x-ray phase oneor two days before the optical peak. we encourage detection of this x-ray flashin future outbursts.

1508.01921	final evolution and delayed explosions of spinning white dwarfs in  single degenerate models for type ia supernovae	we study the occurrence of delayed sne~ia in the single degenerate (sd)scenario. we assume that a massive carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarf (wd) accretesmatter coming from a companion star, making it to spin at the critical rate. weassume uniform rotation due to magnetic field coupling. the carbon ignitionmass for non-rotating wds is m_{ig}^{nr} \approx 1.38 m_{\odot}; while for thecase of uniformly rotating wds it is a few percent larger (m_{ig}^{r} \approx1.43 m_{\odot}). when accretion rate decreases, the wd begins to lose angularmomentum, shrinks, and spins up; however, it does not overflow its criticalrotation rate, avoiding mass shedding. thus, angular momentum losses can leadthe co wd interior to compression and carbon ignition, which would induce ansn~ia. the delay, largely due to the angular momentum losses timescale, may belarge enough to allow the companion star to evolve to a he wd, becomingundetectable at the moment of explosion. this scenario supports the occurrenceof delayed sne~ia if the final co wd mass is 1.38 m_{\odot} &lt; m &lt; 1.43m_{\odot}. we also find that if the delay is longer than ~3 gyr, the wd wouldbecome too cold to explode, rather undergoing collapse.

1511.06819	light curve analysis of neon novae	we analyzed light curves of five neon novae, qu vul, v351 pup, v382 vel, v693cra, and v1974 cyg, and determined their white dwarf (wd) masses and distancemoduli on the basis of theoretical light curves composed of free-free andphotospheric emission. for qu vul, we obtained a distance of d~2.4 kpc,reddening of e(b-v)~0.55, and wd mass of m_wd=0.82-0.96 m_sun. this suggeststhat an oxygen-neon wd lost a mass of more than ~0.1 m_sun since its birth. forv351 pup, we obtained d~5.5 kpc, e(b-v)~0.45, and m_wd=0.98-1.1 m_sun. for v382vel, we obtained d~1.6 kpc, e(b-v)~0.15, and m_wd=1.13-1.28 m_sun. for v693cra, we obtained d~7.1 kpc, e(b-v)~0.05, and m_wd=1.15-1.25 m_sun. for v1974cyg, we obtained d~1.8 kpc, e(b-v)~0.30, and m_wd=0.95-1.1 m_sun. forcomparison, we added the carbon-oxygen nova v1668 cyg to our analysis andobtained d~5.4 kpc, e(b-v)~0.30, and m_wd=0.98-1.1 m_sun. in qu vul,photospheric emission contributes 0.4-0.8 mag at most to the optical lightcurve compared with free-free emission only. in v351 pup and v1974 cyg,photospheric emission contributes very little (0.2-0.4 mag at most) to theoptical light curve. in v382 vel and v693 cra, free-free emission dominates thecontinuum spectra, and photospheric emission does not contribute to the opticalmagnitudes. we also discuss the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline (mmrd)relation for these novae based on the universal decline law.

astro-ph;0003134	type ia supernovae: progenitors and evolution with redshift	relatively uniform light curves and spectral evolution of type ia supernovae(sne ia) have led to the use of sne ia as a ``standard candle'' to determinecosmological parameters. whether a statistically significant value of thecosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminositiesof sne ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galacticevolutions.  here we first review the single degenerate scenario for the chandrasekharmass white dwarf (wd) models of sne ia. we identify the progenitor's evolutionand population with two channels: (1) the wd+rg (red-giant) and (2) the wd+ms(near main-sequence he-rich star) channels. in these channels, the strong windfrom accreting wds plays a key role, which yields important age and metallicityeffects on the evolution.  we then address the questions whether the nature of sne ia dependssystematically on environmental properties such as metallicity and age of theprogenitor system and whether significant evolutionary effects exist. wesuggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $x$(c) in the c+o wd (orthe variation of the initial wd mass) causes the diversity of the brightness ofsne ia. this model can explain the observed dependences of sne ia brightness onthe galaxy types and the distance from the galactic center.  finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of sn iaprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as acomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.

astro-ph;0003471	a theoretical light-curve model for the recurrent nova v394 coronae  austrinae	a theoretical light curve for the 1987 outburst of v394 coronae austrinae(v394 cra) is modeled to obtain various physical parameters of this recurrentnova. we then apply the same set of parametersto a quiescent phase and confirmthat these parameters give a unified picture of the binary. the early visuallight curve (1-10 days after the optical maximum) is well reproduced by athermonuclear runaway model on a very massive wd close to the chandrasekharlimit (1.37 +- 0.01 m_sun). the ensuing plateau phase (10-30 days) is alsoreproduced by the combination of a slightly irradiated ms and a fullyirradiated flaring-up disk with a radius ~1.4 times the roche lobe size. thebest fit parameters are the wd mass 1.37 m_sun, the companion mass 1.5 m_sun(0.8-2.0 m_sun is acceptable), the inclination angle of the orbit i~65-68degree, and the flaring-up rim ~0.30 times the disk radius. the envelope massat the optical peak is estimated to be ~6 x 10^{-6} m_sun, which indicates anaverage mass accretion rate of 1.5 x 10^{-7} m_sun yr^{-1} during the quiescentphase between the 1949 and 1987 outbursts. in the quiescent phase, the observedlight curve can be reproduced with a disk size of 0.7 times the roche lobe sizeand a rather slim thickness of 0.05 times the accretion disk size at the rim.about 0.5 mag sinusoidal variation of the light curve requires the massaccretion rate higher than ~1.0 x 10^{-7} m_sun yr^{-1}, which is consistentwith the above estimation from the 1987 outburst. these newly obtainedquantities are exactly the same as those predicted in a new progenitor model oftype ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0110263	evolution of binaries producing type ia supernovae, luminous supersoft  x-ray sources, and recurrent novae	we have been proposing two evolutionary paths to type ia supernovae (sne ia),which are called the supersoft x-ray source (sss) channel and the symbioticchannel, depending on the orbital separation just prior to an sn ia explosion.the essential difference of our treatment is inclusion of strong, opticallythick winds on mass-accreting white dwarfs (wds) in binary evolutions when themass accretion rate on to wds exceeds a critical rate of ~ 1 x 10^{-6} mo/yr.once optically thick winds blow from the wd, the binary can avoid forming acommon envelope in some cases. so that the wds are able to grow up to thechandrasekhar mass and explode as an sn ia, showing sss or recurrent novaphenomena in the way to sne ia. thus, the accretion wind process of wds canopen new channels to sne ia. we have modeled the lmc supersoft source rxj0513.9-6951 as an example of the systems in the accretion wind phase. furtherinclusions of two other elementary processes make the channels much wider;these are the case bb mass transfer in the sss channel and the strong orbitalshrinkage during the superwind phase of the primary star in the symbioticchannel. as a result, the estimated birth rate of sne ia via these two channelsbecomes compatible with the observation in our galaxy. interestingly, the u scoand t crb subclasses of recurrent novae can be naturally understood as a partof evolutionary stages in these two sss and symbiotic channels to sne ia,respectively. thus we have a unified picture of binary evolutions to sne ia,luminous sss, and recurrent novae.

astro-ph;0607609	a universal decline law of classical novae	we calculate many different nova light curves for a variety of white dwarfmasses and chemical compositions, with the assumption that free-free emissionfrom optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux. we show that all theselight curves are homologous and a universal law can be derived by introducing a``time scaling factor.'' the template light curve for the universal law has aslope of the flux, f \propto t^{-1.75}, in the middle part (from ~2 to ~6 magbelow the optical maximum), but it declines more steeply, f \propto t^{-3.5},in the later part (from ~6 to ~10 mag). this break on the light curve is due toa quick decrease in the wind mass-loss rate. the nova evolutions areapproximately scaled by the time of break. once the time of break isobservationally determined, we can derive the various timescales of novae suchas the period of a uv burst phase, the duration of optically thick wind phase,and the turnoff date of hydrogen shell-burning. we have applied our templatelight curve model to the three well-observed novae, v1500 cyg, v1668 cyg, andv1974 cyg. our theoretical light curves show excellent agreement with theoptical y and infrared j, h, k light curves. the wd mass is estimated, from thelight curve fitting, to be 1.15 m_\sun for v1500 cyg, 0.95 ~m_\sun for v1668cyg, and 0.95-1.05 m_\sun for v1974 cyg.

astro-ph;0607650	the hydrogen burning turn-off of rs ophiuchi 2006	we report a coordinated multi-band photometry of the rs oph 2006 outburst andhighlight the emission line free y-band photometry that shows a mid-plateauphase at y ~ 10.2 mag from day 40 to day 75 after the discovery followed by asharp drop of the final decline. such mid-plateau phases are observed in othertwo recurrent novae, u sco and ci aql, and are interpreted as a bright diskirradiated by the white dwarf. we have calculated theoretical light curvesbased on the optically thick wind theory and have reproduced the observed lightcurves including the mid-plateau phase and the final sharp decline. this finaldecline is identified with the end of steady hydrogen shell-burning, whichturned out the day ~80. this turnoff date is consistent with the end of asupersoft x-ray phase observed with swift. our model suggests a white dwarfmass of 1.35 \pm 0.01 m_\sun, which indicates that rs oph is a progenitor oftype ia supernovae. we strongly recommend the y-filter observation of novae todetect both the presence of a disk and the hydrogen burning turn-off.

astro-ph;0611519	photometric observation and numerical simulation of early superhumps in  bc uma during the 2003 superoutburst	we carried out time-resolved photometric observations of an su uma type dwarfnova, bc uma, during its superoutburst in february 2003. we detect earlysuperhumps (or outburst orbital humps) during the first two days of theoutburst. the period of early superhumps is 0.06258(13) d and the amplitude is0.04 mag. after the early superhump phase, common superhumps with an amplitudeof 0.3 mag and a period of 0.064466(16) d developed. the change rate ofsuperhump periods was positive through the superoutburst. the superhump periodexcess is 3% and we derive a mass ratio of 0.13. this is twice as large as thatof wz sge, suggesting that the mechanism of early superhumps in bc uma is notthe 2:1 resonance which was proposed in wz sge.  we have modelled early superhump light curves including irradiation effectsof the accretion disk and secondary star by the white dwarf and accretion disk.the observed early superhumps can be reproduced when two-armed spirals appearon the accretion disk.  we have found the long term data taken from aavso, vsolj and vsnet shows bcuma has normal outbursts with a maximum magnitude of v~13 and two types ofsuperoutbursts: one has a short duration (around 10 days) and faint maximummagnitude (v~12.5), the other has a long duration (around 20 days) and brightmaximum (v~11-11.5). bc uma is the first example of dwarf novae showing the twotypes of superoutbursts. the supercycle of bc uma is between 600 days and 1000days. this is shorter than wz sge type dwarf novae and longer than normal suuma type stars. this phenomenon suggests that bc uma is an intermediate dwarfnova between wz sge and su uma.

astro-ph;0702563	a universal decline law of classical novae. ii. gk persei 1901 and novae  in 2005	optical and infrared light-curves of classical novae are approximatelyhomologous among various white dwarf (wd) masses and chemical compositions whenfree-free emission from optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux ofnovae. such a homologous template light-curve is called a ``universal declinelaw.'' the timescale of the light curve depends strongly on the wd mass butweakly on the chemical composition, so we are able to roughly estimate the wdmass from the light-curve fitting. we have applied the universal decline law tothe old nova gk persei 1901 and recent novae that outbursted in 2005. theestimated wd mass is 1.15 m_sun for gk per, which is consistent with a centralvalue of the wd mass determined from the orbital velocity variations. the otherwd masses of 10 novae in 2005 are also estimated to be 1.05 m_sun (v2361 cyg),1.15 m_sun (v382 nor), 1.2 m_sun (v5115 sgr), 0.7 m_sun (v378 ser), 0.9 m_sun(v5116 sgr), 1.25 m_sun (v1188 sco), 0.7 m_sun (v1047 cen), 0.95 m_sun (v476sct), 0.95 m_sun (v1663 aql), and 1.30 m_sun (v477 sct), within a roughaccuracy of +- 0.1 m_sun. four (v382 nor, v5115 sgr, v1188 sco, and v477 sct)of ten novae in the year 2005 are probably neon novae on an o-ne-mg wd. each wdmass depends weakly on the chemical composition (especially the hydrogencontent x in mass weight), i.e., the obtained wd masses increase by+0.5(x-0.35) m_sun for the six co novae and by +0.5(x-0.55) m_sun for the fourneon novae above. various nova parameters are discussed in relation to its wdmass.

astro-ph;9806335	low-metallicity inhibition of type ia supernovae and galactic and cosmic  chemical evolution	we introduce a metallicity dependence of type ia supernova (sn ia) rate intothe galactic and cosmic chemical evolution models. in our sn ia progenitorscenario, the accreting white dwarf (wd) blows a strong wind to reach thechandrasekhar mass limit. if the iron abundance of the progenitors is as low as[fe/h] &lt; -1, then the wind is too weak for sne ia to occur. our modelsuccessfully reproduces the observed chemical evolution in the solarneighborhood. we make the following predictions which can test this metallicityeffect: 1) sne ia are not found in the low-iron abundance environments such asdwarf galaxies and the outskirts of spirals. 2) the cosmic sn ia rate drops atz \sim 1-2 due to the low-iron abundance, which can be observed with the nextgeneration space telescope. at z &gt; 1-2, sne ia can be found only in theenvironments where the timescale of metal enrichment is sufficiently short asin starburst galaxies and ellipticals.  the low-metallicity inhibition of sne ia can shed new light on the followingissues: 1) the limited metallicity range of the sn ia progenitors would implythat ``evolution effects'' are relatively small for the use of high redshiftsne ia to determine the cosmological parameters. 2) wds of halo populations arepoor producers of sne ia, so that the wd contribution to the halo mass is notconstrained from the iron abundance in the halo. 3) the abundance patterns ofglobular clusters and field stars in the galactic halo lack of sn ia signaturesin spite of their age difference of several gyrs, which can be explained by thelow-metallicity inhibition of sne ia. 4) it could also explain why the sn iacontamination is not seen in the damped ly\alpha systems for over a wide rangeof redshift.

astro-ph;9902303	a new evolutionary path to type ia supernovae: helium-rich super-soft  x-ray source channel	we have found a new evolutionary path to type ia supernovae (sne ia) whichhas been overlooked in previous work. in this scenario, a carbon-oxygen whitedwarf (c+o wd) is originated, not from an asymptotic giant branch star with ac+o core, but from a red-giant star with a helium core of $\sim 0.8-2.0m_\odot$. the helium star, which is formed after the first common envelopeevolution, evolves to form a c+o wd of $\sim 0.8-1.1 m_\odot$ with transferringa part of the helium envelope onto the secondary main-sequence star. this newevolutionary path, together with the optically thick wind from mass-accretingwhite dwarf, provides a much wider channel to sne ia than previous scenarios. apart of the progenitor systems are identified as the luminous supersoft x-raysources or the recurrent novae like u sco, which are characterized by theaccretion of helium-rich matter. the white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich,helium-enhanced matter from a lobe-filling, slightly evolved companion at acritical rate and blows excess matter in the wind. the white dwarf grows inmass to the chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes as an sn ia. a theoreticalestimate indicates that this channel contributes a considerable part of theinferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy, i.e., the rate is about ten times largerthan the previous theoretical estimates for white dwarfs with slightly evolvedcompanions.

astro-ph;9902304	a wide symbiotic channel to type ia supernovae	as a promising channel to type ia supernovae (sne ia), we have proposed asymbiotic binary system consisting of a white dwarf (wd) and a low massred-giant (rg), where strong winds from the accreting wd play a key role toincrease the wd mass to the chandrasekhar mass limit. here we propose two newevolutionary processes which make the symbiotic channel to sne ia much wider.(1) we first show that the wd + rg close binary can form from a wide binaryeven with such a large initial separation as $a_i \lesssim 40000 r_\odot$. sucha binary consists of an agb star and a low mass main-sequence (ms) star, wherethe agb star is undergoing superwind before becoming a wd. if the superwind atthe end of agb evolution is as fast as or slower than the orbital velocity, thewind outflowing from the system takes away the orbital angular momentumeffectively. as a result the wide binary shrinks greatly to become a closebinary. therefore, the wd + rg binary can form from much wider binaries thanour earlier estimate. (2) when the rg fills its inner critical roche lobe, thewd undergoes rapid mass accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. ourearlier analysis has shown that the mass transfer is stabilized by this windonly when the mass ratio of rg/wd is smaller than 1.15. our new finding is thatthe wd wind can strip mass from the rg envelope, which could be efficientenough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the rg/wd mass ratio exceeds1.15. with the above two new effects (1) and (2), the symbiotic channel canaccount for the inferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy.

astro-ph;9903254	a new interpretation for the second peak of t coronae borealis  outbursts: a tilting disk around a very massive white dwarf	a new interpretation for the second peak of t coronae borealis (t crb)outbursts is proposed based on a thermonuclear runaway (tnr) model. the systemconsists of a very massive white dwarf (wd) with a tilting accretion disk and alobe-filling red-giant. the first peak of the visual light curve of t crboutbursts is well reproduced by the tnr model on a wd close to thechandrasekhar mass ($m_{\rm wd} \gtrsim 1.35 ~m_\odot$), while the second peakis reproduced by the combination of the irradiated m-giant and the irradiatedtilting disk. the derived fitting parameters are the wd mass $m_{\rm wd} \sim1.35 ~m_\odot$, the m-giant companion mass $m_{\rm rg} \sim 0.7 m_\odot$($0.6-1.0 m_\odot$ is acceptable), the inclination angle of the orbit $i \sim70 \arcdeg$, and the tilting angle of the disk $i_{\rm prec} \sim 35 \arcdeg$.these parameters are consistent with the recently derived binary parameters oft crb.

astro-ph;9907386	type ia supernova progenitors, environmental effects, and cosmic  supernova rates	relatively uniform light curves and spectral evolution of type ia supernovae(sne ia) have led to the use of sne ia as a ``standard candle'' to determinecosmological parameters, such as the hubble constant, the density parameter,and the cosmological constant. whether a statistically significant value of thecosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminositiesof sne ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galacticevolutions. here we first review the single degenerate scenario for thechandrasekhar mass white dwarf (wd) models of sne ia. we identify theprogenitor's evolution and population with two channels: (1) the wd+rg(red-giant) and (2) the wd+ms (near main-sequence he-rich star) channels. inthese channels, the strong wind from accreting white dwarfs plays a key role,which yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution. we thenaddress the questions whether the nature of sne ia depends systematically onenvironmental properties such as metallicity and age of the progenitor systemand whether significant evolutionary effects exist. we suggest that thevariation of the carbon mass fraction $x$(c) in the c+o wd (or the variation ofthe initial wd mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of sne ia. thismodel can explain the observed dependence of sne ia brighness on the galaxytypes. finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of sn iaprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as acomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.

astro-ph;9912244	a theoretical light-curve model for the 1999 outburst of u scorpii	a theoretical light curve for the 1999 outburst of u scorpii is presented inorder to obtain various physical parameters of the recurrent nova. our u scomodel consists of a very massive white dwarf (wd) with an accretion disk and alobe-filling, slightly evolved, main-sequence star (ms). the model includes areflection effect by the companion and the accretion disk together with ashadowing effect on the companion by the accretion disk. the early visual lightcurve (t ~ 1-15 days after maximum) is well reproduced by a thermonuclearrunaway model on a very massive wd close to the chandrasekhar limit (m_{wd}=1.37 \pm 0.01 m_\odot), in which optically thick winds blowing from the wd playa key role in determining the nova duration. the duration of the strong windphase (t~0-17 days) is very consistent with the bepposax supersoft x-raydetection at t~19-20 days because supersoft x-rays are self-absorbed by themassive wind. the envelope mass at the peak is estimated to be ~3x10^{-6}m_\odot, which is indicating an average mass accretion rate ~2.5x10^{-7}m_\odot yr^{-1} during the quiescent phase between 1987 and 1999. thesequantities are exactly the same as those predicted in a new progenitor model oftype ia supernovae.
