0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0704.1244	sn 2003du: 480 days in the life of a normal type ia supernova	an extensive set of optical and nir photometry and low-resolution spectra thetype ia supernova (sn ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. theobservations started 13 days before b-band maximum light and continued for 480days with exceptionally good time sampling. the optical photometry wascalibrated through the s-correction technique.  the ubvrijhk light curves and the color indices of sn 2003du closely resemblethose of normal sne ia. sn 2003du reached a b-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)mag on jd2452766.38 (+/-0.5). we derive a b-band stretch parameter of 0.988(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dm15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a sn ia ofstandard luminosity. the reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by threemethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. we estimate a distancemodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, ugc 9391. the peak uvoirbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and arnett's rule impliesthat m(ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)m_sun of ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.modeling of the uvoir bolometric light curve also indicates m(ni56) in therange 0.6-0.8 m_sun. the spectral evolution of sn 2003du at both optical andnir wavelengths also closely resembles normal sne ia. in particular, the si iiratio at maximum r(si ii)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of theblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. the pre-maximumspectra of sn 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the ca ii h&amp;kdoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in si ii 6355, lines. we compare thetime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed sne iaand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of si ii 6355 line inmany sne ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0908.0942	vlt spectropolarimetry of the optical transient in ngc300. evidence for  asymmetry in the circumstellar dust	aims: the main goal of this work is to study possible signs of asymmetry inthe bright optical transient in ngc300, with the aim of getting independentinformation on the explosion mechanism, the progenitor star and itscircumstellar environment.  methods: using vlt-fors1 we have obtained low-resolution optical linearspectropolarimetry of ngc300 ot2008-1 on two epochs, 48 and 55 days after thediscovery, covering the spectral range 3600--9330a.  results: the data show a continuum polarization at a very significant level.at least two separate components are identified. the first is characterized bya strong wavelength dependency and a constant position angle (68.6+/-0.3degrees), which is parallel to the local spiral arm of the host galaxy. thesecond shows a completely different position angle (151.3+/-0.4) and displays amild but statistically significant evolution between the two epochs. while theformer is identified as arising in the interstellar dust associated withngc300, the latter is most likely due to continuum polarization by dustscattering in the circumstellar environment. no line depolarization is detectedin correspondence of the most intense emission lines, disfavoring electronscattering as the source of intrinsic polarization. this implies a very smalldeviation from symmetry in the continuum-forming region. given the observedlevel of intrinsic polarization, the transient must be surrounded by asignificant amount of dust (&gt;4x10^-5 msun), asymmetrically distributed within afew thousand au. this most likely implies that one or more asymmetric outflowepisodes took place during the past history of the progenitor.

0909.5564	vlt spectropolarimetry of the fast expanding type ia sn2006x	using vlt-fors1 we performed optical spectropolarimetric observations of thetype ia sn2006x on 7 pre-maximum epochs (day -10 to day -1) and onepost-maximum epoch (+39 days). the sn shows strong continuum interstellarpolarization reaching about 8% at 4000a, characterized by a wavelengthdependency that is substantially different from that of the milky-way dustmixture. several sn features, like siii 6355a and the caii ir triplet, presenta marked evolution. the caii near-ir triplet shows a pronounced polarization(~1.4%) already on day -10 in correspondence with a strong high-velocityfeature (hvf). the siii polarization peaks on day -6 at about 1.1% anddecreases to 0.8% on day -1. by day +39 no polarization signal is detected forthe siii line, while the caii ir triplet shows a marked re-polarization at thelevel of 1.2%. as in the case of another strongly polarized sn (2004dt), nopolarization was detected across the oi 7774a absorption. the fast-expandingsn2006x lies on the upper edge of the relation between peak polarization anddecline rate, and it confirms previous speculations about a correlation betweendegree of polarization, expansion velocity, and hvf strength. the polarizationof caii detected in our last epoch, the most advanced ever obtained for a typeia sn, coincides in velocity with the outer boundary of the ca synthesizedduring the explosion (15,000-17,000 km/s) in delayed-detonation models. thissuggests a large scale chemical inhomogeneity as produced by off-centerdetonations, a rather small amount of mixing, or a combination of both effects.in contrast, the absence of polarization at the inner edge of the ca-rich layer(8000-10,000 km/s) implies a substantial amount of mixing in these deeperregions.

0707.2237	spectropolarimetry of the type ib/c sn 2005bf	we present spectropolarimetric observations of the peculiar type ib/c sn2005bf, in mcg+00-27-005, from 3600-8550\aa. the sn was observed on 2005 april30.9, 18 days after the first b-band light-curve maximum and 6 days before thesecond b-band light-curve maximum. the degree of the interstellar polarization,determined from depolarized emission lines in the spectrum, is found to belarge with $p_{max}(isp)=1.6%$ and $\theta(isp)=149$\fdg$7\pm4.0$, but this maybe an upper limit on the real value of the isp. after isp subtraction,significant polarization is observed over large wavelength regions, indicatinga significant degree of global asymmetry, $\gtrsim 10%$. polarizations of 3.5%and 4% are observed for absorption components of ca ii h&amp;k and ir triplet, and1.3% for he i 5876\aa and fe ii. on the $q-u$ plane clear velocity-dependentloop structure is observed for the he i 5876\aa line, suggestive of departuresfrom an axial symmetry and possible clumping of the sn ejecta. weak highvelocity components of $\mathrm{h\alpha}$, $\mathrm{h\beta}$ and$\mathrm{h\gamma}$ are observed, with velocities of -15 000\kms. the low degreeof polarization observed at h$\beta$ suggests that the polarization observedfor the other balmer lines ($\sim 0.4%$ above the background polarization) mayrather be due to blending of $\mathrm{h\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{h\gamma}$ withpolarized si ii and fe ii lines, respectively. we suggest a model in which ajet of material, that is rich in $\mathrm{^{56}ni}$, has penetrated the c-ocore, but not the he mantle. the jet axis is tilted with respect to the axis ofthe photosphere. this accounts for the lack of significant polarization of o i7774\aa, the delayed excitation and, hence, observability of he i and,potentially, the varied geometries of he and ca.

1001.1099	correction of field rotator-induced flat-field systematics - a case  study using archived vlt-fors data	eso's two focal reducer and low dispersion spectrographs (fors) are theprimary optical imaging instruments for the vlt. they are not direct-imaginginstruments, as there are several optical elements in the light path. inparticular, both instruments are attached to a field rotator. obtaining trulyphotometric data with such instruments present a significant challenge. in thispaper, we investigate in detail twilight flats taken with the fors instruments.we find that a large fraction of the structure seen in these flatfields rotateswith the field rotator.  we discuss in detail the methods we use to determine the cause of thiseffect. the effect was tracked down to be caused by the linear atmosphericdispersion corrector (ladc). the results are thus of special interest fordesigners of instruments with ladcs and developers of calibration plans andpipelines for such instruments. the methods described here to find and correctit, however, are of interest also for other instruments using a field rotator.  if not properly corrected, this structure in the flatfield may degrade thephotometric accuracy of imaging observations taken with the fors instruments byadding a systematic error of up to 4% for broad band filters. we discussseveral strategies to obtain photometric images in the presence of rotatingflatfield pattern.

1008.0651	the unification of asymmetry signatures of type ia supernovae	we present a compilation of the geometry measures acquired using optical andir spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry to probe the explosion geometryof type ia sne. polarization measurements are sensitive to asymmetries in theplane of the sky, whereas line profiles in nebular phase spectra are expectedto trace asymmetries perpendicular to the plane of the sky. the combination ofthese two measures can overcome their respective projection effects, completelyprobing the 3d structures of these events. for 9 normal type ia sne, we findthat the polarization of \ion{si}{2} $\lambda 6355$ at 5 days before maximum($p_{si\,ii}$) is well correlated with its velocity evolution ($\dot{\rmv}_{si\,ii}$), implying $\dot{\rm v}_{si\,ii}$ is predominantly due to theasymmetry of the sne. we find only a weak correlation between the polarizationof \ion{si}{2} and the reported velocities (${\rm v}_{neb}$) for peak emissionof optical \ion{fe}{2} and \ion{ni}{2} lines in nebular spectra. our sample isbiased, with polarization measurements being only available for normal snewhich subsequently exhibited positive (i.e. redshifted) ${\rm v}_{neb}$. inunison these indicators are consistent with an off-centre delayed detonation,in which the outer layers are dominated by a spherical oxygen layer, mixed withan asymmetric distribution of intermediate mass elements. the combination ofspectroscopic and spectropolarimetric indicators suggests a single geometricconfiguration for normal type ia sne, with some of the diversity of observedproperties arising from orientation effects.

1008.3985	a spectropolarimetric view on the nature of the peculiar type i sn  2005hk	we report two spectropolarimetric observations of sn 2005hk, which is a closecopy of the "very peculiar" sn 2002cx, showing low peak luminosity, slowdecline, high ionization near peak and an unusually low expansion velocity ofonly about 7,000 km s^-1. further to the data presented by chornock et al.,(2006), at -4 days before maximum, we present data of this object taken on 9november 2005 (near maximum) and 23 november (+ two weeks) that show thecontinuum and most of the spectral lines to be polarized at levels of about0.2-0.3%. at both epochs the data corresponds to the spectropolarimetric typed1. the general low level of line polarization suggests that the line formingregions for most species observed in the spectrum have a similar shape to thatof the photosphere, which deviates from a spherical symmetry by &lt;10%. incomparison with spectropolarimetry of type ia and core-collapse sne at similarepochs, we find that the properties of sn 2005hk are most similar to those oftype ia sne. in particular, we find the low levels of continuum and linepolarization to indicate that the explosion mechanism is approximatelyspherical, with homogeneous ejecta (unlike the chemically segregated ejecta ofccsne). we discuss the possibility that sn 2005hk was the result of the puredeflagration of a white dwarf and note the issues concerning thisinterpretation.

0708.3698	upper limit for circumstellar gas around the type ia sn 2000cx	the nature of the companion stars in type ia supernova (sne) progenitorsystems remains unclear. one possible way to discriminate between differentscenarios is the presence (or absence) of circumstellar material, the leftovers from the progenitor evolution that may be revealed by their interactionwith the sn. a new method to probe the circumstellar environment has beenexploited for the normal type ia sn 2006x, leading for the first time to thedirect detection of material which escaped the progenitor system. in this paperwe apply the same analysis to the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx, with the aim ofconstraining the properties of its progenitor system. using multi-epoch,high-resolution spectroscopy we have studied the spectral region where narrow,time-variable naid absorption features are expected in case circumstellarmaterial is present along the line of sight. no naid absorption is detected inthe rest-frame of the host galaxy to a level of a few ma, setting a stringentupper limit to the column density of the absorbing material (n(nai)&lt;=2 x 10^10cm-2). in this respect the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx is different from thenormal ia sn 2006x. whether this is to be attributed to a different progenitorsystem, to viewing-angle effects or to a low metallicity remains to beclarified.

0708.4119	the early spectral evolution of sn 2004dt	aims. we study the optical spectroscopic properties of type ia supernova (snia) 2004dt, focusing our attention on the early epochs.  methods. observation triggered soon after the sn 2004dt discovery allowed usto obtain a spectrophotometric coverage from day -10 to almost one year (~353days) after the b band maximum. observations carried out on an almost dailybasis allowed us a good sampling of the fast spectroscopic evolution of sn2004dt in the early stages. to obtain this result, low-resolution, long-slitspectroscopy was obtained using a number of facilities.  results. this supernova, which in some absorption lines of its early spectrashowed the highest degree of polarization ever measured in any sn ia, has acomplex velocity structure in the outer layers of its ejecta. unburnt oxygen ispresent, moving at velocities as high as ~16,700 km/s, with someintermediate-mass elements (mg, si, ca) moving equally fast. modeling of thespectra based on standard density profiles of the ejecta fails to reproduce theobserved features, whereas enhancing the density of outer layers significantlyimproves the fit. our analysis indicates the presence of clumps ofhigh-velocity, intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers, which isalso suggested by the spectropolarimetric data.

1104.0506	connecting rs oph to [some] type ia supernovae	aims: recurrent nova systems like rs oph have been proposed as a possiblechannel to type ia supernova explosions, based on the high mass of theaccreting white dwarf. additional support to this hypothesis has been recentlyprovided by the detection of circumstellar material around sn2006x andsn2007le, showing a structure compatible with that expected for recurrent novaoutbursts.in this paper we investigate the circumstellar environment of rs ophand its structure, with the aim of establishing a firmer and independent linkbetween this class of objects and type ia sn progenitors.  methods: we study the time evolution of caii, nai and ki absorption featuresin rs oph, before, during, and after the last outburst, using multi-epoch,high-resolution spectroscopy, and applying the same method adopted for sn2006xand sn2007le.  results: a number of components, blue-shifted with respect to the systemicvelocity of rs oph, are detected. in particular, one feature strongly weakensin the first two weeks after the outburst, simultaneously with thedisappearance of very narrow p-cyg profiles overimposed on the much wider novaemission lines of h, he, feii and other elements.  conclusions: we interpret these facts as the signature of densityenhancements in the circumstellar material, suggesting that the recurrenteruptions might indeed create complex structures within the material lost bythe donor star. this establishes a strong link between rs oph and theprogenitor system of the type ia sn2006x, for which similar features have beendetected.

1111.2497	sn 2009e: a faint clone of sn 1987a	in this paper we investigate the properties of sn 2009e, which exploded in arelatively nearby spiral galaxy (ngc 4141) and that is probably the faintest1987a-like supernova discovered so far. spectroscopic observations whichstarted about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significantdifferences between sn 2009e and the prototypical sn 1987a. modelling the dataof sn 2009e allows us to constrain the explosion parameters and the propertiesof the progenitor star, and compare the inferred estimates with those availablefor the similar sne 1987a and 1998a. the light curve of sn 2009e is lessluminous than that of sn 1987a and the other members of this class, and themaximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in sn 1987a.late-time photometric observations suggest that sn 2009e ejected about 0.04solar masses of 56ni, which is the smallest 56ni mass in our sample of1987a-like events. modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamicscode, we infer for sn 2009e a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, aninitial radius of ~7 x 10^12 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 solar masses. thephotospheric spectra show a number of narrow (v~1800 km/s) metal lines, withunusually strong ba ii lines. the nebular spectrum displays narrow emissionlines of h, na i, [ca ii] and [o i], with the [o i] feature being relativelystrong compared to the [ca ii] doublet. the overall spectroscopic evolution isreminiscent of that of the faint 56ni-poor type ii-plateau supernovae. thissuggests that sn 2009e belongs to the low-luminosity, low 56ni mass, low-energytail in the distribution of the 1987a-like objects in the same manner as sn1997d and similar events represent the faint tail in the distribution ofphysical properties for normal type ii-plateau supernovae.

1112.0247	multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopy of sn2011fe - linking the  progenitor to its environment	this study attempts to establish a link between the reasonably well knownnature of the progenitor of sn2011fe and its surrounding environment. this isdone with the aim of enabling the identification of similar systems in the vastmajority of the cases, when distance and epoch of discovery do not allow adirect approach. to study the circumstellar environment of sn2011fe we haveobtained high-resolution spectroscopy of sn2011fe on 12 epochs, from 8 to 86days after the estimated date of explosion, targeting in particular at the timeevolution of caii and nai. three main absorption systems are identified fromcaii and nai, one associated to the milky way, one probably arising within ahigh-velocity cloud, and one most likely associated to the halo of m101. thegalactic and host galaxy reddening, deduced from the integrated equivalentwidths (ew) of the nai lines are e(b-v)=0.011+/-0.002 and e(b-v)=0.014+/-0.002mag, respectively. the host galaxy absorption is dominated by a componentdetected at the same velocity measured from the 21-cm hi line at the projectedsn position (~180 km/s). during the ~3 months covered by our observations, itsew changed by 15.6+/-6.5 ma. this small variation is shown to be compatiblewith the geometric effects produced by therapid sn photosphere expansioncoupled to the patchy fractal structure of the ism. the observed behavior isfully consistent with ism properties similar to those derived for our owngalaxy, with evidences for structures on scales &lt;100 au. sn2011fe appears to besurrounded by a "clean" environment. the lack of blue-shifted, time-variantabsorption features is fully consistent with the progenitor being a binarysystem with a main-sequence, or even another degenerate star.

0710.3763	supernova rates from the southern intermediate redshift eso supernova  search (stress)	to measure the supernova (sn) rates at intermediate redshift we performed thesouthern intermediate redshift eso supernova search (stress). unlike most ofthe current high redshift sn searches, this survey was specifically designed toestimate the rate for both type ia and core collapse (cc) sne. we counted thesne discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring sn rate per unit blue bandluminosity. our analysis is based on a sample of ~43000 galaxies and on 25spectroscopically confirmed sne plus 64 selected sn candidates. our approach isaimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates andat investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties,most notably their colour. the type ia sn rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, amountsto 0.22^{+0.10+0.16}_{-0.08 -0.14} h_{70}^2 snu, while the cc sn rate, atz=0.21, is 0.82^{+0.31 +0.30}_{-0.24 -0.26} h_{70}^2 snu. the quoted errors arethe statistical and systematic uncertainties. with respect to local value, thecc sn rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of ~2 already at redshift, whereasthe type ia sn rate remains almost constant. this implies that a significantfraction of sn ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2-3 gyr. we alsomeasured the sn rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the sn iarate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the cc snrate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local universe. sn rates perunit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing asteeper evolution with redshift for cc sne with respect to sne ia. finally wehave exploited the link between star formation (sf) and sn rates to predict theevolutionary behaviour of the sn rates and compare it with the path indicatedby observations.

1206.1858	vlt spectropolarimetry of the type ia sn2005ke - a step towards  understanding subluminous events	we performed optical spectropolarimetric observations of the subluminous typeia sn2005ke at 3 epochs (days -8, -7, and +76). the explosion properties arederived by comparing the data to explosion and radiation transfer models. thesn shows polarimetric properties that are very similar to the only othersubluminous event for which spectropolarimetry is available, i.e. sn1999by. thedata present a very marked dominant axis, which is shared by both the continuumand lines such as siii 6355, suggesting that the relatively large, globalasymmetry is common to the photosphere and the line-forming region. the maximumpolarization degree observed in the siii 6355 absorption reaches 0.39+/-0.08%.at variance with what is seen in core-normal type ia, sn2005ke displayssignificant continuum polarization, which grows from the blue to the red andpeaks at about 7000 a, reaching ~0.7%. the properties of the polarization andflux spectra can be understood within the framework of a subluminousdelayed-detonation (dd), or pulsating dd scenario, or wd mergers. thedifference in appearance with respect to core-normal sne ia is caused by lowphotospheric temperatures in combination with layers of unburned c, and moremassive layers of the products of explosive c and o burning. the comparativelyhigh level of continuum polarization is explained in terms of a significantglobal asymmetry (~15%), which is well reproduced by an oblate ellipsoidalgeometry. our results suggest that sn2005ke arose either from asingle-degenerate system in which the wd is especially rapidly rotating, closeto the break-up velocity, or from a double-degenerate merger. based on thecurrent polarization data, we cannot distinguish between these twopossibilities.

1206.5532	the optical sn 2012bz associated with the long grb 120422a	the association of type ic sne with long-duration grbs is well established.we endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, tocharacterize these sne at increasingly high redshifts. we obtained a series ofoptical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ic sn2012bzassociated with the swift long-duration grb120422a (z=0.283) using the 3.6-mtng and the 8.2-m vlt telescopes. the peak times of the light curves ofsn2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the b-band and i'-band lightcurves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. thebolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometricmeasurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in thenear-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. therefore, the presentlight curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual uv-optical-irbolometric light curve. this pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (mbol= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape andluminosity to the bolometric light curves of the sne associated with z&lt;0.2 grbsand more luminous than those of sne associated with xrfs. a comparison with themodel generated for the bolometric light curve of sn2003dh suggests thatsn2012bz produced only about 15% less 56ni than sn2003dh, about 0.35 msol.similarly the vlt spectra of sn2012bz, after correction for galactic extinctionand for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosionparameters with those observed in sn2003dh (ek~3.5 x 10^52 erg, mej~7 msol) anda similar progenitor mass (~25-40 msol). grb120422a is consistent with theepeak-eiso and the ex,iso-egamma,iso-e_peak relations. grb120422a/sn2012bzshows the grb-sn connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitoredboth photometrically and spectroscopically.

1302.0166	spectropolarimetry of the type ia supernova 2012fr	spectropolarimetry provides the means to probe the 3d geometries ofsupernovae at early times. we report spectropolarimetric observations of thetype ia supernova 2012fr at four epochs: -11, -5, +2 and +24 days, with respectto b-lightcurve maximum. sn 2012fr is a normal type ia sn, similar to sne1990n, 2000cx and 2005hj (that all exhibit low velocity decline rates for theprincipal si ii line). the sn displays high velocity components at -11 daysthat are highly polarized. the polarization of these features decreases as theybecome weaker from -5 days. at +2 days, the polarization angles of the lowvelocity components of silicon and calcium are identical and oriented at 90degrees relative to the high velocity ca component. in addition to having verydifferent velocities, the high and low velocity ca components have orthogonaldistributions in the plane of the sky. the continuum polarization for the sn atall four epochs is low &lt;0.1%. we conclude that the low level of continuumpolarization is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. thesimple axial symmetry evident from the polarization angles of the high velocityand low velocity ca components, along with the presence of high velocitycomponents of si and ca, are consistent with the pulsating delayed detonationmodel. we predict that, during the nebular phase, sn 2012fr will displayblue-shifted emission lines of fe-group elements.

0801.2270	the dancing sky: 6 years of night sky observations at cerro paranal	the present work provides the results of the first six years of operation ofthe systematic night-sky monitoring at eso-paranal (chile). the ubvri night-skybrightness was estimated on about 10,000 vlt-fors1 archival images, obtained onmore than 650 separate nights, distributed over 6 years and covering thedescent from maximum to minimum of sunspot cycle n.23. additionally, a set ofabout 1,000 low resolution, optical night-sky spectra have been extracted andanalyzed. the unprecedented database discussed in this paper has led to thedetection of a clear seasonal variation of the broad band night sky brightnessin the vri passbands, similar to the well known semi-annual oscillation of thenai d doublet. the spectroscopic data demonstrate that this seasonality iscommon to all spectral features, with the remarkable exception of the ohrotational-vibrational bands. a clear dependency on the solar activity isdetected in all passbands and it is particularly pronounced in the u band,where the sky brightness decreased by about 0.6 mag arcsec-2 from maximum tominimum of solar cycle n.23. no correlation is found between solar activity andthe intensity of the nai d doublet and the oh bands. a strong correlationbetween the intensity of ni 5200a and [oi]6300,6364a is reported here for thefirst time. the paper addresses also the determination of the correlationtimescales with solar activity and the possible connection with the flux ofcharged particles emitted by the sun.

1311.0147	on the source of the dust extinction in type ia supernovae and the  discovery of anomalously strong na i absorption	high-dispersion observations of the na i d 5890, 5896 and k i 7665, 7699interstellar lines, and the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms in thespectra of 32 type ia supernovae are used as an independent means of probingdust extinction. we show that the dust extinction of the objects where thediffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms is detected is consistent with thevisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. this strongly suggeststhat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar materialassociated with the progenitor system. one quarter of the supernovae displayanomalously large na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dustextinction derived from their colors. remarkably, all of the cases of unusuallystrong na i d absorption correspond to "blueshifted" profiles in theclassification scheme of sternberg et al. (2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1403.4386	dense molecular clouds in the sn2008fp host galaxy	(abridged) we use observations of interstellar absorption features, such asatomic and molecular lines as well as diffuse interstellar bands (dibs),towards sn2008fp to study the physical properties of extra-galactic diffuseinterstellar clouds in the host galaxy, eso428-g14. the properties of theintervening dust are investigated via spectropolarimetry. the spectra ofsn2008fp reveal a complex of diffuse atomic clouds at radial velocities in linewith the systematic velocities of the host galaxy (~1700 km/s). a translucent(a_v ~ 1.5 mag) cloud is detected at a heliocentric velocity of 1770 km/s thiscold dense cloud is rich in dense atomic gas tracers, molecules, as well asdiffuse interstellar bands. we have detected both c2 and c3 for the first timein a galaxy beyond the local group. the cn (0,0) band line ratios are used toderive an in-situ measurement of the cosmic background radiation temperature inan external galaxy; this gives an excitation temperature of t = 2.9 +- 0.3 k.the interstellar polarization law deviates significantly from what is observedin the galaxy, indicating substantial differences in the composition or sizedistribution of dust grains in the sn2008fp host galaxy. c2 is used to probethe cold diffuse ism density and temperature. the lack of variability in theextra-galactic absorption line profiles over a period of one month implies thatthe absorbing material is not circumstellar and thus not affected directly bythe sn event. also it shows that there are no significant density variation inthe small-scale structure of the molecular cloud down to 100 au.

1407.0136	properties of extragalactic dust inferred from linear polarimetry of  type ia supernovae	aims: the aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to investigate the properties ofextragalactic dust and compare them to what is seen in the galaxy; 2) toaddress in an independent way the problem of the anomalous extinction curvesreported for reddened type ia supernovae (sn) in connection to the environmentsin which they explode. methods: the properties of the dust are derived from thewavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddenedtype ia sn: 1986g, 2006x, 2008fp, and 2014j. [...] results: all four objectsare characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios(r_v) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized byvery blue polarization peaks. in all cases the polarization position angle iswell aligned with the local spiral structure. while sn~1986g is compatible withthe most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the galaxy,sn2006x, 2008fp, and 2014j show unprecedented behaviours. the observeddeviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to therelatively large amounts of reddening characterizing the objects in the sample.conclusions: the dust responsible for the polarization of these four sn is mostlikely of interstellar nature. the polarization properties can be interpretedin terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. the anomalousbehaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galacticenvironment in which the sn explode, rather than with the progenitor systemfrom which they originate. for the extreme case of sn2014j, we cannot excludethe contribution of light scattered by local material; however, the observedpolarization properties require an ad hoc geometrical dust distribution.

0805.3028	interstellar atoms, molecules and diffuse bands toward sn2006x in m100	aims. supernovae offer the unique possibility to probe diffuse extra-galacticsightlines via observation of the optical transitions of atoms, molecules andthe diffuse interstellar bands (dibs). through optical spectroscopy thepresence of (complex) molecules in distant galaxies can be established.  methods. high resolution optical (3300 -- 6800 angstrom) spectra of sn2006xat different phase obtained with uves on the vlt were reduced and analysed.  results. in addition to previously detected atomic (nai and caii) andmolecular (cn) transitions we present detections of dibs (6196, 6283 angstrom),diatomic molecules (ch, ch+) and neutral atoms (cai) in the spectra of sn2006xtaken at different phases (at 2 days before and 14 and 61 days after thebrightness maximum). an analysis of the absorption profiles shows no variationbetween phases in the abundance, nor the central velocities (within 3-sigmaerror bars) of the (dense) gas tracers (ch, ch+ and cai) and the dibs. this isconsistent with the conclusion in the literature that sn2006x exploded behind adense interstellar cloud (inferred from strong atomic sodium and calcium linesand cn transitions) which caused strong photometric reddening but whosematerial was not directly affected by the supernova explosion. the ch and cncolumn densities correspond to a reddening of one magnitude following thegalactic correlation derived previously. the 6196 and 6283 lines detected inthe m100 ism are under-abundant by factor of 2.5 to 3.5 (assuming a visualextinction of ~2 mag) compared to the average galactic ism relationship. upperlimits for 6379 and 6613 dibs show that these are at least a factor of sevenweaker. therefore, the galactic dib-reddening relation does not seem to hold inm100, although the lower gas-to-dust ratio may further reduce this discrepancy.

astro-ph;0003077	the properties of hypernovae: sne ic 1998bw, 1997ef, and sn iin 1997cy	we discuss the properties of the hyper-energetic type ic supernovae (sne ic)1998bw and 1997ef and type iin supernova (sn iin) 1997cy. sne ic 1998bw and1997ef are characterized by their large luminosity and the very broad spectralfeatures. their observed properties can be explained if they are very energeticsn explosions with the kinetic energy of $e_{\rm k} \gsim 1\times10^{52}$ erg,originating probably from the core collapse of the bare c+o cores of massivestars ($\sim 30-40$m$_\odot$). at late times, both the light curves and thespectra suggest that the explosions may have been asymmetric; this may help usunderstand the claimed connection with grb's. the type iin sn 1997cy is evenmore luminous than sn 1998bw and the light curve declines more slowly than$^{56}$co decay. we model such a light curve with circumstellar interaction,which requires the explosion energy of $\sim 5 \times 10^{52}$ erg. becausethese kinetic energies of explosion are much larger than in normalcore-collapse sne, we call objects like these sne "hypernovae". the mass of$^{56}$ni in sn 1998bw is estimated to be as large as 0.5 - 0.7 $m_\odot$ fromboth the maximum brightness and late time emission spectra, which suggests thatthe asymmetry may not be extreme.

astro-ph;0309264	low luminosity type ii supernovae: spectroscopic and photometric  evolution	in this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric observations for fourcore collapse supernovae (sne), namely sne 1994n, 1999br, 1999eu and 2001dc.together with sn 1997d, we show that they form a group of exceptionallylow-luminosity events. these sne have narrow spectral lines (indicating lowexpansion velocities) and low luminosities at every phase (significantly lowerthan those of typical core-collapse supernovae). the very low luminosity duringthe ^{56}co radioactive decay tail indicates that the mass of ^{56}ni ejectedduring the explosion is much smaller (m(ni) ~ 2-8 x 10^{-3} mo) than theaverage (m(ni) ~ 6-10 x 10^{-2} mo). two supernovae of this group (sn 1999brand sn 2001dc) were discovered very close to the explosion epoch, allowing usto determine the lengths of their plateaux (~ 100 days) as well asestablishiing the explosion epochs of the other, less-completely observed sne.it is likely that this group of sne represent the extreme low-luminosity tailof a single continuous distribution of sn ii-p events. their kinetic energy isalso exceptionally low. although an origin from low mass progenitors has alsobeen proposed for low-luminosity core-collapse sne, recent work providesevidence in favour of the high mass progenitor scenario. the incidence of theselow--luminosity sne could be as high as 4-5$ $ of all type ii sne.

astro-ph;0502531	high-velocity features: a ubiquitous property of type ia sne	evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximumspectra of some type ia supernovae (eg sn 2000cx) has been searched for in theavailable snia spectra observed earlier than one week before b maximum. recentobservational efforts have doubled the number of sneia with very early spectra.remarkably, all sneia with early data (7 in our rtn sample and 10 from otherprogrammes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in caiiir, and some also in siii 6255a line. high-velocity features may be interpretedas abundance or density enhancements. abundance enhancements would imply anouter region dominated by si and ca. density enhancements may result from thesweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity sn ejecta. inthis scenario, the high incidence of hvfs suggests that a thick disc and/or ahigh-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be thecase in single degenerate systems. large-scale angular fluctuations in theradial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this couldoriginate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likelyexplosion mechanism. csm-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. in some sne the hvfs arenarrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burnedmaterial.

astro-ph;9910324	the properties of supernova 1997cy associated to grb970514	the extraordinary sn 1997cy associated with grb 970514 has been observedphotometrically and spectroscopically for nearly 2 yr. at the time of discoverysn 1997cy was the brightest sn ever observed (mv=&lt;-20.1, v(hel)=19140 km/s,h_0=65 km/s/mpc). up to the last available observations (600 days after thegrb) the total time-integrated flux was equal to or larger than that expectedfrom the complete thermalization of the gamma-rays produced by 2.3 mo of 56co.however, starting already on day 60 the luminosity decline is slower than the56co decay rate, indicating that the sn ejecta was interacting withcircumstellar material (csm). the interaction appeared to weaken around day550. the spectra of sn 1997cy are dominated at all epochs by halpha emission,which shows at least 3 components of different widths, as in sn 1988z. severalother lines with different widths are also visible, especially at early epochs.the entire light curve of sn 1997cy is reproduced by a model of the interactionof the very energetic (e=5 x 10^(52) ergs) ejecta of a massive star (25 mo)with the csm, with some contribution from radioactive decays. the csm couldhave been ejected with a mass-loss rate of mdot ~ 4x10^(-4) mo yr^(-1) as theprogenitor star evolved from a bsg to a rsg about 10^4 yr before the explosion.the lack of oxygen and magnesium lines in the spectra at nebular phases poses aproblem for models requiring high mass progenitors. the possibility that mostof the core material of the progenitor has fallen onto a massive black hole sothat the reverse shock dies at the inner edge of the h/he envelope isdiscussed.

0811.0002	a second case of variable na i d lines in a highly-reddened type ia  supernova	recent high-resolution spectra of the type ia sn 2006x have revealed thepresence of time-variable and blueshifted na i d features, interpreted by patatet al. as originating in circumstellar material within the progenitor system.the variation seen in sn 2006x induces relatively large changes in the total nai d equivalent width (\delta ew ~ 0.5 a in just over two weeks), that would bedetectable at lower resolutions. we have used a large data set comprising 2400low-resolution spectra of 450 type ia supernovae (sne ia) obtained by the cfasupernova program to search for variable na i d features. out of the 31 sne ia(including sn 2006x) in which we could have detected similar ew variations,only one other (sn 1999cl) shows variable na i d features, with an even largerchange over a similar ~10-day timescale (\delta ew = 1.66 +/- 0.21 a).interestingly, both sn 1999cl and sn 2006x are the two most highly-reddenedobjects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability isconnected to dusty environments.
