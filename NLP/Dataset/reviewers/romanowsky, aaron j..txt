0902.3025	structure and substructure of galactic spheroids	the full spatio-chemo-dynamical structure of galaxies of all types andenvironments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observationsof galaxy formation at high redshift. the next decade brings the observationalopportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formationand assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority ofthe stellar mass in the universe but have until now been difficult to study. inorder to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal "red-sequence",various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly withresolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, canbe scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation isincreasingly available. at the same time, progress in adaptive optics on gianttelescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric andspectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. strong theoretical support is needed inorder to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling andself-consistent simulations of star and galaxy formation throughout cosmictime.

0905.4424	probing the 2-d kinematic structure of early-type galaxies out to 3  effective radii	we detail an innovative new technique for measuring the 2-d velocity moments(rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and gauss-hermite coefficients h$_3$and h$_4$) of the stellar populations of galaxy halos using spectra from keckdeimos multi-object spectroscopic observations. the data are used toreconstruct 2-d rotation velocity maps.  here we present data for five nearby early-type galaxies to ~3 effectiveradii. we provide significant insights into the global kinematic structure ofthese galaxies, and challenge the accepted morphological classification inseveral cases. we show that between 1-3 effective radii the velocity dispersiondeclines very slowly, if at all, in all five galaxies. for the two galaxieswith velocity dispersion profiles available from planetary nebulae data we findvery good agreement with our stellar profiles. we find a variety of rotationprofiles beyond 1 effective radius, i.e rotation speed remaining constant,decreasing \emph{and} increasing with radius. these results are of particularimportance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematicstructure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast-and slow- rotator classes by the sauron project. our data suggests that therotator class may change when larger galacto-centric radii are probed. this hasimportant implications for dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies. the datafrom this study are available on-line.

1003.1716	the central dark matter content of early-type galaxies: scaling  relations and connections with star formation histories	we examine correlations between the masses, sizes, and star formationhistories for a large sample of low-redshift early-type galaxies, using asimple suite of dynamical and stellar populations models. we confirm ananti-correlation between size and stellar age, and survey for trends with thecentral content of dark matter (dm). an average relation between central dmdensity and galaxy size of &lt;rho_dm&gt; ~ reff^-2 provides the first clearindication of cuspy dm haloes in these galaxies -- akin to standard lcdm haloesthat have undergone adiabatic contraction. the dm density scales with galaxymass as expected, deviating from suggestions of a universal halo profile fordwarf and late-type galaxies. we introduce a new fundamental constraint ongalaxy formation by finding that the central dm fraction decreases with stellarage. this result is only partially explained by the size-age dependencies, andthe residual trend is in the opposite direction to basic dm halo expectations.therefore we suggest that there may be a connection between age and halocontraction, and that galaxies forming earlier had stronger baryonic feedbackwhich expanded their haloes, or else lumpier baryonic accretion that avoidedhalo contraction. an alternative explanation is a lighter initial mass functionfor older stellar populations.

1005.1289	galaxies in lcdm with halo abundance matching: luminosity-velocity  relation, baryonic mass-velocity relation, velocity function and clustering	it has long been regarded as difficult for a cosmological model to accountsimultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. werevisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along withthe best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter. we findthat the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundancematching (ham) and simple dynamical corrections, fits all basic statistics ofgalaxies with circular velocities vcirc &gt; 80 km/s. our observational constraintis the luminosity-velocity relation which allows all types of galaxies to beincluded. we have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarfirregulars to giant ellipticals. the data present a clear monotonicluminosity-velocity relation from 50 km/s to 500 km/s, with a bend below 80km/s and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. forcomparison to theory, we employ our lcdm "bolshoi" simulation of dark matter,which has unprecedented mass and force resolution. we use halo abundancematching to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the dark matter halos.the resulting predictions for the luminosity-velocity relation are in excellentagreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies forthe luminosity range from mr = -14-22. we also compare our predictions for the"cold" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function ofcircular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very goodagreement. the predicted circular velocity function is in agreement with thegalaxy velocity function for 80-400 km/s. however, we find that the dark matterhalos with vcirc &lt; 80 km/s are much more abundant than observed galaxies withthe same vcirc . we find that the two-point correlation function of galaxies inour model matches very well the results from the sdss.

1102.0038	crazy heart: kinematics of the "star pile" in abell 545	we study the structure and internal kinematics of the "star pile" in abell545 - a low surface brightness structure lying in the center of the cluster.wehave obtained deep long-slit spectroscopy of the star pile using vlt/fors2 andgemini/gmos, which is analyzed in conjunction with deep multiband cfht/megacamimaging. as presented in a previous study the star pile has a flat luminosityprofile and its color is consistent with the outer parts of ellipticalgalaxies. its velocity map is irregular, with parts being seemingly associatedwith an embedded nucleus, and others which have significant velocity offsets tothe cluster systemic velocity with no clear kinematical connection to any ofthe surrounding galaxies. this would make the star pile a dynamically definedstellar intra-cluster component. the complicated pattern in velocity andvelocity dispersions casts doubts on the adequacy of using the whole star pileas a dynamical test for the innermost dark matter profile of the cluster. thisstatus is fulfilled only by the nucleus and its nearest surroundings which lieat the center of the cluster velocity distribution.

1104.5503	global properties of `ordinary' early-type galaxies: photometry and  spectroscopy of stars and globular clusters in ngc 4494	we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial, kinematic, and chemicalproperties of stars and globular clusters (gcs) in the `ordinary' ellipticalgalaxy ngc 4494 using data from the keck and subaru telescopes. we derivegalaxy surface brightness and colour profiles out to large galactocentricradii. we compare the latter to metallicities derived using the near-infraredcalcium triplet. we obtain stellar kinematics out to ~3.5 effective radii. thelatter appear flattened or elongated beyond ~1.8 effective radii in contrast tothe relatively round photometric isophotes. in fact, ngc 4494 may be aflattened galaxy, possibly even an s0, seen at an inclination of ~45 degrees.we publish a catalogue of 431 gc candidates brighter than i=24 based on thephotometry, of which 109 are confirmed spectroscopically and 54 have measuredspectroscopic metallicities. we also report the discovery of 3spectroscopically confirmed ultra-compact dwarfs around ngc 4494 with measuredmetallicities of -0.4&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.3. based on their properties, we conclude thatthey are simply bright gcs. the metal-poor globular clusters are found to berotating with similar amplitude as the galaxy stars, while the metal-richglobular clusters show marginal rotation. we supplement our analysis withavailable literature data and results. using model predictions of galaxyformation, and a suite of merger simulations, we find that many of theobservational properties of ngc 4494 may be explained by formation in arelatively recent gas-rich major merger. complete studies of individualgalaxies incorporating a range of observational avenues and methods such as theone presented here will be an invaluable tool for constraining the fine detailsof galaxy formation models, especially at large galactocentric radii.

1106.0745	the fossil record of two-phase galaxy assembly: kinematics and  metallicities in the nearest s0 galaxy	we present a global analysis of kinematics and metallicity in the nearest s0galaxy, ngc 3115, along with implications for its assembly history. the datainclude high-quality wide-field imaging from suprime-cam on the subarutelescope, and multi-slit spectra of the field stars and globular clusters(gcs) obtained using keck-deimos/lris and magellan-imacs. within two effectiveradii, the bulge (as traced by the stars and metal-rich gcs) is flattened androtates rapidly (v/sigma &gt; 1.5). at larger radii, the rotation declinesdramatically to v/sigma ~ 0.7, but remains well-aligned with the inner regions.the radial decrease in characteristic metallicity of both the metal-rich andmetal-poor gc subpopulations produces strong gradients with power law slopes of-0.17 +/- 0.04 and -0.38 +/- 0.06 dex per dex, respectively. we argue that thispattern is not naturally explained by a binary major merger, but instead by atwo-phase assembly process where the inner regions have formed in an earlyviolent, dissipative phase, followed by the protracted growth of the outerparts via minor mergers with typical mass ratios of ~ 15-20:1.

1109.5696	the relationships among compact stellar systems: a fresh view of ultra  compact dwarfs	we use a combined imaging and spectroscopic survey of the nearby centralcluster galaxy, m87, to assemble a sample of 34 confirmed ultra compact dwarfs(ucds) with half-light radii of &gt;~ 10 pc measured from hubble space telescopeimages. this doubles the existing sample in m87, making it the largest suchsample for any galaxy, while extending the detection of ucds to unprecedentedlylow luminosities (mv = -9). with this expanded sample, we find no correlationbetween size and luminosity, in contrast to previous suggestions, and nogeneral correlation between size and galactocentric distance. we explore therelationships between ucds, less luminous extended clusters (including faintfuzzies), globular clusters (gcs), as well as early-type galaxies and theirnuclei, assembling an extensive new catalog of sizes and luminosities forstellar systems. most of the m87 ucds follow a tight color-magnitude relation,offset from the metal-poor gcs. this, along with kinematical differences,demonstrates that most ucds are a distinct population from normal gcs, and notsimply a continuation to larger sizes and higher luminosities. the ucdcolor-magnitude trend couples closely with that for virgo dwarf ellipticalnuclei. we conclude that the m87 ucds are predominantly stripped nuclei. thebrightest and reddest ucds may be the remnant nuclei of more massive galaxieswhile a subset of the faintest ucds may be tidally limited and related to morecompact star clusters. in the broader context of galaxy assembly, blue ucds maytrace halo build-up by accretion of low-mass satellites, while red ucds may bemarkers of metal-rich bulge formation in larger galaxies.

1112.2154	dwarfs gobbling dwarfs: a stellar tidal stream around ngc 4449 and  hierarchical galaxy formation on small scales	a candidate diffuse stellar substructure was previously reported in the haloof the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 4449 by karachentsev et al. we map andanalyze this feature using a unique combination of deep integrated-light imagesfrom the black bird 0.5-meter telescope, and high-resolution wide-field imagesfrom the 8-meter subaru telescope, which resolve the nebulosity into a streamof red giant branch stars, and confirm its physical association with ngc 4449.the properties of the stream imply a massive dwarf spheroidal progenitor, whichafter complete disruption will deposit an amount of stellar mass that iscomparable to the existing stellar halo of the main galaxy. the ratio betweenluminosity or stellar-mass between the two galaxies is ~1:50, while theindirectly measured dynamical mass-ratio, when including dark matter, may be~1:10-1:5. this system may thus represent a "stealth" merger, where aninfalling satellite galaxy is nearly undetectable by conventional means, yethas a substantial dynamical influence on its host galaxy. this singulardiscovery also suggests that satellite accretion can play a significant role inbuilding up the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies, and possibly in triggeringtheir starbursts.

1112.2213	evidence for inhomogeneous reionization in the local universe from  metal-poor globular cluster systems	exploiting a fundamental characteristic of galaxy assembly in the{\lambda}cdm paradigm, the observed spatial biasing and kinematics ofmetal-poor globular star clusters are used to constrain the local reionizationepoch around individual galaxies. selecting three galaxies located in differentenvironments, the first attempt at constraining the environmental propagationof reionization in the local universe is carried out. the joint constraint fromthe three galaxies (z_reion = 10.5^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) agrees remarkably well withthe latest wmap constraint on z_reion for a simple instantaneous reionizationmodel. more importantly, the range of z_reion values found here are consistentwith the global range of z_reion estimates from other observations. wefurthermore find a 1.7{\sigma} indication that reionization completed inlow-density environments before the intergalactic medium in high-densityenvironments was reionized. this is consistent with certain theoretical modelsthat predict that reionization was globally prolonged in duration, with neutralhydrogen pockets surviving in high-density environments, even after thesurrounding regions were reionized. more generally, this work provides a usefulconstraint on the formation history of galaxy stellar halos.

1112.3959	the ongoing assembly of a central cluster galaxy: phase-space  substructures in the halo of m87	the halos of galaxies preserve unique records of their formation histories.we carry out the first combined observational and theoretical study ofphase-space halo substructure in an early-type galaxy: m87, the central galaxyin the virgo cluster. we analyze an unprecedented wide-field, high-precisionphotometric and spectroscopic data set for 488 globular clusters (gcs), whichincludes new, large-radius subaru/suprime-cam and keck/deimos observations. wefind signatures of two substructures in position-velocity phase-space. one is asmall, cold stream associated with a known stellar filament in the outer halo;the other is a large shell-like pattern in the inner halo that implies amassive, hitherto unrecognized accretion event. we perform extensivestatistical tests and independent metallicity analyses to verify the presenceand characterize the properties of these features, and to provide more generalmethodologies for future extragalactic studies of phase-space substructure. thecold outer stream is consistent with a dwarf galaxy accretion event, while forthe inner shell there is tension between a low progenitor mass implied by thecold velocity dispersion, and a high mass from the large number of gcs, whichmight be resolved by a ~0.5 l* e/s0 progenitor. we also carry outproof-of-principle numerical simulations of the accretion of smaller galaxiesin an m87-like gravitational potential. these produce analogous features to theobserved substructures, which should have observable lifetimes of ~1 gyr. theshell and stream gcs together support a scenario where the extended stellarenvelope of m87 has been built up by a steady rain of material that continuesuntil the present day. this phase-space method demonstrates unique potentialfor detailed tests of galaxy formation beyond the local group.

1207.4189	angular momentum and galaxy formation revisited	motivated by new kinematic data in the outer parts of early-type galaxies(etgs), we re-examine angular momentum (am) in all galaxy types. we presentmethods for estimating the specific am j, focusing on etgs, to derive relationsbetween stellar j_* and mass m_* (after fall 1983). we perform analyses of 8galaxies out to ~10 r_e, finding that data at 2 r_e are sufficient to estimatetotal j_*. our results contravene suggestions that ellipticals (es) harborlarge reservoirs of hidden j_* from am transport in major mergers. we carry outa j_*-m_* analysis of literature data for ~100 nearby bright galaxies of alltypes. the es and spirals form parallel j_*-m_* tracks, which for spirals islike the tully-fisher relation, but for es derives from a mass-size-rotationconspiracy. the es contain ~3-4 times less am than equal-mass spirals. wedecompose the spirals into disks+bulges and find similar j_*-m_* trends tospirals and es overall. the s0s are intermediate, and we propose thatmorphological types reflect disk/bulge subcomponents following separate j_*-m_*scaling relations -- providing a physical motivation for characterizinggalaxies by mass and bulge/disk ratio. next, we construct idealizedcosmological models of am content, using a priori estimates of dark matter halospin and mass. we find that the scatter in halo spin cannot explain thespiral/e j_* differences, but the data are matched if the galaxies retaineddifferent fractions of initial j (~60% and ~10%). we consider physicalmechanisms for j_* and m_* evolution (outflows, stripping, collapse bias,merging), emphasizing that the vector sum of such processes must produce theobserved j_*-m_* relations. a combination of early collapse and multiplemergers (major/minor) may account for the trend for es. more generally, theobserved am variations represent fundamental constraints for any galaxyformation model.

1207.4475	an inventory of the stellar initial mass function in early-type galaxies	given a flurry of recent claims for systematic variations in the stellarinitial mass function (imf), we carry out the first inventory of theobservational evidence using different approaches. this includes literatureresults, as well as our own new findings from combined stellar-populationssynthesis (sps) and jeans dynamical analyses of data on $\sim$~4500 early-typegalaxies (etgs) from the spider project. we focus on the mass-to-light ratiomismatch relative to the milky way imf, \dimf, correlated against the centralstellar velocity dispersion, \sigs. we find a strong correlation between \dimf\and \sigs, for a wide set of dark matter (dm) model profiles. these results arerobust if a uniform halo response to baryons is adopted across the sample. theoverall normalization of \dimf, and the detailed dm profile, are less certain,but the data are consistent with standard cold-dm halos, and a central dmfraction that is roughly constant with \sigs. for a variety of related studiesin the literature, using sps, dynamics, and gravitational lensing, similarresults are found. studies based solely on spectroscopic line diagnostics agreeon a salpeter-like imf at high \sigs, but differ at low \sigs. overall, we findthat multiple independent lines of evidence appear to be converging on asystematic variation in the imf, such that high-\sigs\ etgs have an excess oflow-mass stars relative to spirals and low-\sigs\ etgs. robust verification ofsuper-salpeter imfs in the highest-\sigs\ galaxies will require additionalscrutiny of scatter and systematic uncertainties. the implications for thedistribution of dm are still inconclusive.

1208.1767	radially extended kinematics in the s0 galaxy ngc 2768 from planetary  nebulae, globular clusters and starlight	there are only a few tracers available to probe the kinematics of individualearly-type galaxies beyond one effective radius. here we directly compare asample of planetary nebulae (pne), globular clusters (gcs) and galaxy starlightvelocities out to ~4 effective radii, in the s0 galaxy ngc 2768. using abulge-to-disk decomposition of a k-band image we assign pne and starlight toeither the disk or the bulge. we show that the bulge pne and bulge starlightfollow the same radial density distribution as the red subpopulation of gcs,whereas the disk pne and disk starlight are distinct components. we find goodkinematic agreement between the three tracers to several effective radii (andwith stellar data in the inner regions). further support for the distinctnature of the two galaxy components come from our kinematic analysis. afterseparating the tracers into bulge and disk components we find the bulge to be aslowly rotating pressure-supported system, whereas the disk reveals a rapidlyrising rotation curve with a declining velocity dispersion profile. theresulting v/sigma ratio for the disk resembles that of a spiral galaxy andhints at an origin for ngc 2768 as a transformed late-type galaxy. atwo-component kinematic analysis for a sample of s0s will help to elucidate thenature of this class of galaxy.

1209.4351	the sluggs survey: kinematics for over 2500 globular clusters in twelve  early-type galaxies	we present a spectro-photometric survey of 2522 extragalactic globularclusters (gcs) around twelve early-type galaxies, nine of which have not beenpublished previously. combining space-based and multi-colour wide fieldground-based imaging, with spectra from the keck deimos instrument, we obtainan average of 160 gc radial velocities per galaxy, with a high velocityprecision of 15 km/s per gc. after studying the photometric properties of thegc systems, such as their spatial and colour distributions, we focus on thekinematics of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) gc subpopulations to anaverage distance of ~8 effective radii from the galaxy centre. our results showthat for some systems the bimodality in gc colour is also present in gckinematics. the kinematics of the red gc subpopulations are strongly coupledwith the host galaxy stellar kinematics. the blue gc subpopulations are moredominated by random motions, especially in the outer regions, and decoupledfrom the red gcs. peculiar gc kinematic profiles are seen in some galaxies: theblue gcs in ngc 821 rotate along the galaxy minor axis, whereas the gc systemof the lenticular galaxy ngc 7457 appears to be strongly rotation supported inthe outer region. we supplement our galaxy sample with data from the literatureand carry out a number of tests to study the kinematic differences between thetwo gc subpopulations. we confirm that the gc kinematics are coupled with thehost galaxy properties and find that the velocity kurtosis and the slope oftheir velocity dispersion profiles is different between the two gcsubpopulations in more massive galaxies.

1209.5390	the sluggs survey: ngc 3115, a critical test case for metallicity  bimodality in globular cluster systems	due to its proximity (9 mpc) and the strongly bimodal color distribution ofits spectroscopically well-sampled globular cluster (gc) system, the early-typegalaxy ngc 3115 provides one of the best available tests of whether the colorbimodality widely observed in gc systems generally reflects a true metallicitybimodality. color bimodality has alternatively been attributed to a stronglynonlinear color--metallicity relation reflecting the influence of hothorizontal branch stars. here we couple subaru suprime-cam gi photometry withkeck/deimos spectroscopy to accurately measure gc colors and a cat index thatmeasures the caii triplet. we find the ngc 3115 gc system to be unambiguouslybimodal in both color and the cat index. using simple stellar populationmodels, we show that the cat index is essentially unaffected by variations inhorizontal branch morphology over the range of metallicities relevant to gcsystems (and is thus a robust indicator of metallicity) and confirm bimodalityin the metallicity distribution. we assess the existing evidence for andagainst multiple metallicity subpopulations in early and late-type galaxies andconclude that metallicity bi/multimodality is common. we briefly discuss howthis fundamental characteristic links directly to the star formation andassembly histories of galaxies.

1304.6723	the sluggs survey: probing the supermassive black hole connection with  bulges and haloes using red and blue globular cluster systems	understanding whether the bulge or the halo provides the primary link to thegrowth of supermassive black holes has strong implications for galaxy evolutionand supermassive black hole formation itself. in this paper, we approach thisissue by investigating extragalactic globular cluster (gc) systems, which canbe used to probe the physics of both the bulge and the halo of the host galaxy.we study the relation between the supermassive black hole masses m_bh and theglobular cluster system velocity dispersions sigma_gc using an updated andimproved sample of 21 galaxies. we exploit the dichotomy of globular clustersystem colours, to test if the blue and red globular clusters correlatedifferently with black hole mass. this may be expected if they trace thepotentially different formation history of the halo and of the bulge of thehost galaxy respectively. we find that m_bh correlates with the total gc systemvelocity dispersion, although not as strongly as claimed by recent work ofsadoun &amp; colin. we also examine the m_bh - sigma_gc relation forbarred/bar-less and core/non-core galaxies, finding no significant difference,and for the first time we quantify the impact of radial gradients in the gcsystem velocity dispersion profile on the m_bh - sigma_gc relation. weadditionally predict m_bh in 13 galaxies, including dwarf elliptical galaxiesand the cd galaxy ngc 3311. we conclude that our current results cannotdiscriminate between the bulge/halo scenario. although there is a hint that thered gc velocity dispersion might correlate better with m_bh than the blue gcvelocity dispersion, the number statistics are still too low to be certain.

1305.1626	angular momentum and galaxy formation revisited: effects of variable  mass-to-light ratios	we rederive the relation between the specific angular momentum j_* and themass m_* of the stellar matter in galaxies of different morphological types.this is a revision of the j_*--m_* diagram presented in our recentcomprehensive study of galactic angular momentum. in that work, we estimatedj_* from kinematic and photometric data that extended to large radii and m_*from near-infrared luminosities l_k with an assumed universal mass-to-lightratio m_*/l_k. however, recent stellar population models show large variationsin m_*/l_k correlated with b-v color. in the present work, we use thiscorrelation to estimate m_*/l_k and hence m_* from the measured b-v and l_k.our revised j_*--m_* diagram is similar to our previous one; bothdisk-dominated and elliptical galaxies follow nearly parallel sequences withj_* \propto m_*^\alpha\ and \alpha = 0.6 +/- 0.1. however, the offset betweenthe sequences is now a factor of about 5, some 30% larger than before (andclose to the offset found by fall in 1983). thus, our new results place eventighter constraints on the loss of specific angular momentum by galactic disksover their lifetimes.

1308.3531	the sluggs survey: outer triaxiality of the fast rotator elliptical ngc  4473	systematic surveys of nearby early type galaxies (etgs) using integral fieldunit spectrograph (ifu) data have revealed that galaxies can hide interestingstructures only visible through kinematic studies. as part of their pioneeringwork, the atlas3d team have shown that most morphologically elliptical galaxiesare centrally kinematically disk-like. hence, while global morphology suggeststhat ellipticals are ellipsoidal/triaxial in shape, their central kinematicsmay be consistent with (inclined) oblate systems.  here we study the fast rotator elliptical galaxy: ngc 4473. using slitlets,we obtain galaxy light kinematics out to unprecedentedly large galactocentricradii (2.5 effective radii). while we confirm the ifu results in the centralregions, we find that at large galactocentric radii ngc 4473 exhibits akinematic transition. in the outskirts, we observe clear minor and major axisrotation, a tell-tale sign of triaxiality, which agrees well with the galaxy'shubble type.  this outer "kinematically distinct halo" (kdh) may be expected fromsimulations of galaxy formation, and in this system contains around one-thirdof the stellar light. while this galaxy may be a special case, it suggestsfurther investigation of the outskirts of galaxies is needed to confirm the newparadigm of galaxy classification.

1310.1979	the sluggs survey: the globular cluster systems of three early-type  galaxies using wide-field imaging	we present the results from a wide-field imaging study of globular cluster(gc) systems in three early-type galaxies. combinations of subaru/suprime-cam,cfht/megacam and hst/wfpc2/acs data were used to determine the gc systemproperties of three highly flattened galaxies ngc 720, ngc 1023 and ngc 2768.this work is the first investigation of the gc system in ngc 720 and ngc 2768to very large galactocentric radius ($\sim$ 100 kpc). the three galaxies haveclear blue and red gc subpopulations. the radial surface densities of the gcsystems are fitted with sersic profiles, and detected out to 15, 8 and 10galaxy effective radii respectively. the total number of gcs and specificfrequency are determined for each gc system. the ellipticity of the redsubpopulation is in better agreement with the host galaxy properties than isthe blue subpopulation, supporting the traditional view that metal-rich gcs areclosely associated with the bulk of their host galaxies' field stars, whilemetal-poor gcs reflect a distinct stellar halo. with the addition of another 37literature studied galaxies, we present a new correlation of gc system extentwith host galaxy effective radius. we find a dependence of the relativefraction of blue to red gcs with host galaxy environmental density forlenticular galaxies (but not for elliptical or spiral galaxies). we proposethat tidal interactions between galaxies in cluster environments might be thereason behind the observed trend for lenticular galaxies.

1310.2607	the sluggs survey: wide-field stellar kinematics of early-type galaxies	we present stellar kinematics of 22 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs), basedon two-dimensional (2d) absorption line stellar spectroscopy out to ~2-4 r_e(effective radii), as part of the ongoing sluggs survey. the galaxies span afactor of 20 in intrinsic luminosity, as well as a full range of environmentand etg morphology. our data consist of good velocity resolution (sigma_inst ~25 km/s) integrated stellar-light spectra extracted from the individualslitlets of custom made keck/deimos slitmasks. we extract stellar kinematicsmeasurements (v, sigma, h_3, and h_4) for each galaxy. combining withliterature values from smaller radii, we present 2d spatially resolved maps ofthe large-scale kinematic structure in each galaxy. we find that the kinematichomogeneity found inside 1 r_e often breaks down at larger radii, where avariety of kinematic behaviors are observed. while central slow rotators remainslowly rotating in their halos, central fast rotators show more diversity,ranging from rapidly increasing to rapidly declining specific angular momentumprofiles in the outer regions. there are indications that the outer trendsdepend on morphological type, raising questions about the proposed unificationof the elliptical and lenticular (s0) galaxy families in the atlas^3d survey.several galaxies in our sample show multiple lines of evidence for distinctdisk components embedded in more slowly rotating spheroids, and we suggest ajoint photometric-kinematic approach for robust bulge-disk decomposition. ourobservational results appear generally consistent with a picture of two-phase(in-situ plus accretion) galaxy formation.

1401.1501	the sluggs survey: breaking degeneracies between dark matter, anisotropy  and the imf using globular cluster subpopulations in the giant elliptical ngc  5846	we study the mass and anisotropy distribution of the giant elliptical galaxyngc 5846 using stars, as well as the red and blue globular cluster (gc)subpopulations. we break degeneracies in the dynamical models by takingadvantage of the different phase space distributions of the two gcsubpopulations to unambiguously constrain the mass of the galaxy and theanisotropy of the gc system. red gcs show the same spatial distribution andbehaviour as the starlight, whereas blue gcs have a shallower density profile,a larger velocity dispersion and a lower kurtosis, all of which suggest adifferent orbital distribution. we use a dispersion-kurtosis jeans analysis andfind that the solutions of separate analyses for the two gc subpopulationsoverlap in the halo parameter space. the solution converges on a massive darkmatter halo, consistent with expectations from $\lambda$cdm and wmap7 cosmologyin terms of virial mass ($\log m_{dm} \sim13.3 m_{sun}$) and concentration($c_{vir}\sim8$). this is the first such analysis that solves the dynamics ofthe different gc subpopulations in a self-consistent manner. our methodimproves the uncertainties on the halo parameter determination by a factor oftwo and opens new avenues for the use of elliptical galaxy dynamics as tests ofpredictions from cosmological simulations. the implied stellar mass-to-lightratio derived from the dynamical modelling is fully consistent with a salpeterinitial mass function (imf) and rules out a bottom light imf. the different gcsubpopulations show markedly distinct orbital distributions at large radii,with red gcs having an anisotropy parameter $\beta\sim0.4$ outside $\sim3r_e$,and the blue gcs having $\beta\sim0.15$ at the same radii, while centrally($\sim1r_e$) they are both isotropic. we discuss the implications of ourfindings within the two-phase formation scenario for early-type galaxies.

1401.5128	the sluggs survey: new evidence for a tidal interaction between the  early type galaxies ngc 4365 and ngc 4342	we present new imaging and spectral data for globular clusters (gcs) aroundngc 4365 and ngc 4342. ngc 4342 is a compact, x-ray luminous s0 galaxy with anunusually massive central black hole. ngc 4365 is another atypical galaxy thatdominates the w' group of which ngc 4342 is a member. using imaging from themegacam instrument on the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) we identify astream of gcs between the two galaxies and extending beyond ngc 4342. thestream of gcs is spatially coincident with a stream/plume of stars previouslyidentified. we find that the photometric colours of the stream gcs match thoseassociated with ngc 4342, and that the recession velocity of the combined gcsfrom the stream and ngc 4342 match the recession velocity for ngc 4342 itself.these results suggest that ngc 4342 is being stripped of gcs (and stars) as itundergoes a tidal interaction with the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 4365. wecompare ngc 4342 to two well-known, tidally stripped galaxies (m32 and ngc4486b) and find various similarities. we also discuss previous claims by bogdanet al. (2012a) that ngc 4342 cannot be undergoing significant tidal strippingbecause it hosts a large dark matter halo.

1402.0687	ultra compact dwarfs in the perseus cluster: ucd formation via tidal  stripping	we present the results of a keck/deimos survey of ultra compact dwarfs (ucds)in the perseus cluster core. we confirm cluster membership for 14 ucds, withradial velocities ~5300 km s$^{-1}$. two of these confirmed perseus ucds haveextremely blue colours ($b-r &lt; 0.6$ mag), reside in star forming filamentssurrounding ngc 1275, and have likely formed as massive star clusters in thelast ~100 myr. we also measure a central velocity dispersion of a third, ucd13($\sigma_0 = 38 \pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$), the most extended ucd in our sample. wedetermine it to have radius $r_{e} = 85 \pm 1.1$ pc, a dynamical mass of ($2.3\pm 0.8)\times10^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$, and a metallicity [z/h]$=-0.52^{+0.33}_{-0.29}$ dex. ucd13 and the cluster's central galaxy, ngc 1275,have a projected separation of 30 kpc and a radial velocity difference of ~20km s$^{-1}$. based on its size, red colour, internal velocity dispersion,dynamical mass, metallicity and proximity to ngc 1275, we argue that ucd13 islikely the remnant nucleus of a tidally stripped de, with this progenitor dehaving $m_{b} \approx -16$ mag and mass $\sim10^{9}$ m$_{\odot}$.

1405.0008	the sluggs survey: hst/acs mosaic imaging of the ngc 3115 globular  cluster system	we present hst/acs $g$ and $z$ photometry and half-light radii $r_{\rm h}$measurements of 360 globular cluster (gc) candidates around the nearby s0galaxy ngc 3115. we also include subaru/suprime-cam $g$, $r$, and $i$photometry of 421 additional candidates. the well-established color bimodalityof the gc system is obvious in the hst/acs photometry. we find evidence for a"blue tilt" in the blue gcs, wherein the blue gcs get redder as luminosityincreases, indicative of a mass-metallicity relationship. we find a colorgradient in both the red and blue subpopulations, with each group of clustersbecoming bluer at larger distances from ngc 3115. the gradient is of similarstrength in both subpopulations, but is monotonic and more significant for theblue clusters. on average, the blue clusters have ~10% larger $r_{\rm h}$ thanthe red clusters. this average difference is less than is typically observedfor early-type galaxies but does match that measured in the literature form104, suggesting that morphology and inclination may affect the measured sizedifference between the red and blue clusters. however, the scatter on the$r_{\rm h}$ measurements is large. we also identify 31 clusters more extendedthan typical gcs, which we consider ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) candidates. manyof these objects are fainter than typical ucds. while it is likely that asignificant number will be background contaminants, six of these ucd candidatesare spectroscopically confirmed. to explore low-mass x-ray binaries in the gcsystem, we match our acs and suprime-cam detections to corresponding chandrax-ray sources. we identify 45 x-ray - gc matches, 16 among the bluesubpopulation and 29 among the red subpopulation. these x-ray/gc coincidencefractions are larger than is typical for most gc systems, probably due to theincreased depth of the x-ray data compared to previous studies of gc systems.

1405.2079	the sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies survey (sluggs): sample  definition, methods, and initial results	we introduce and provide the scientific motivation for a wide-fieldphotometric and spectroscopic chemodynamical survey of nearby early-typegalaxies (etgs) and their globular cluster (gc) systems. the sluggs (sageslegacy unifying globulars and galaxies) survey is being carried out primarilywith subaru/suprime-cam and keck/deimos. the former provides deep gri imagingover a 900 arcmin^2 field-of-view to characterize gc and host galaxy colors andspatial distributions, and to identify spectroscopic targets. the nir caiitriplet provides gc line-of-sight velocities and metallicities out to typically~8 r_e, and to ~15 r_e in some cases. new techniques to extract integratedstellar kinematics and metallicities to large radii (~2-3 r_e) are used inconcert with gc data to create two-dimensional velocity and metallicity mapsfor comparison with simulations of galaxy formation. the advantages of sluggscompared with other, complementary, 2d-chemodynamical surveys are its superiorvelocity resolution, radial extent, and multiple halo tracers. we describe thesample of 25 nearby etgs, the selection criteria for galaxies and gcs, theobserving strategies, the data reduction techniques, and modeling methods. thesurvey observations are nearly complete and more than 30 papers have so farbeen published using sluggs data. here we summarize some initial results,including signatures of two-phase galaxy assembly, evidence for gc metallicitybimodality, and a novel framework for the formation of extended star clustersand ultracompact dwarfs. an integrated overview of current chemodynamicalconstraints on gc systems points to separate, in-situ formation modes at highredshifts for metal-poor and metal-rich gcs.

1405.2338	the sluggs survey: exploring the metallicity gradients of nearby  early-type galaxies to large radii	stellar metallicity gradients in the outer regions of galaxies are a criticaltool for disentangling the contributions of in-situ and ex-situ formed stars.in the two-phase galaxy formation scenario, the initial gas collapse createssteep metallicity gradients, while the accretion of stars formed in satellitestends to flatten these gradients in the outskirts, particularly for massivegalaxies. this work presents the first compilation of extended metallicityprofiles over a wide range of galaxy mass. we use the deimos spectrograph onthe keck telescope in multi-slit mode to obtain radial stellar metallicityprofiles for 22 nearby early-type galaxies. from the calcium triplet lines inthe near-infrared we measure the metallicity of the starlight up to 3 effectiveradii. we find a relation between the outer metallicity gradient and galaxymass, in the sense that lower mass systems show steeper metallicity gradientsthan more massive galaxies. this result is consistent with a picture in whichthe ratio of ex-situ to in-situ formed stars is lower in less massive galaxiesas a consequence of the smaller contribution by accretion. in addition, weinfer a correlation between the strength of the calcium triplet feature in thenear-infrared and the stellar initial mass function slope that is consistentwith recent models in the literature.

1406.5511	kinematics and simulations of the stellar stream in the halo of the  umbrella galaxy	we study the dynamics of faint stellar substructures around the umbrellagalaxy, ngc 4651, which hosts a dramatic system of streams and shells formedthrough the tidal disruption of a nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. weelucidate the basic characteristics of the system (colours, luminosities,stellar masses) using multi-band subaru/suprime-cam images. the implied stellarmass-ratio of the ongoing merger event is about 1:50. we identify candidatekinematic tracers (globular clusters, planetary nebulae, h ii regions), andfollow up a subset with keck/deimos spectroscopy to obtain velocities. we findthat 15 of the tracers are likely associated with halo substructures, includingthe probable stream progenitor nucleus. these objects delineate a kinematicallycold feature in position-velocity phase space. we model the stream using singletest-particle orbits, plus a rescaled pre-existing n-body simulation. we infera very eccentric orbit with a period of roughly 0.35 gyr and turning points atapproximately 2-4 and 40 kpc, implying a recent passage of the satellitethrough the disc, which may have provoked the visible disturbances in the hostgalaxy. this work confirms that the kinematics of low surface brightnesssubstructures can be recovered and modeled using discrete tracers - abreakthrough that opens up a fresh avenue for unraveling the detailed physicsof minor merging.

1406.6065	the aimss project i: bridging the star cluster - galaxy divide	we describe the structural and kinematic properties of the first compactstellar systems discovered by the aimss project. these spectroscopicallyconfirmed objects have sizes ($\sim$6 $&lt;$ r$_{\rm e}$ [pc] $&lt;$ 500) and masses($\sim$2$\times$10$^{6}$ $&lt;$ m$_*$/m$_\odot$ $&lt;$ 6$\times$10$^{9}$) spanningthe range of massive globular clusters (gcs), ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact elliptical galaxies (ces), completely filling the gap between starclusters and galaxies.  several objects are close analogues to the prototypical ce, m32. theseobjects, which are more massive than previously discovered ucds of the samesize, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend forcompact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for auniversal "zone of avoidance" for dynamically hot stellar systems in themass-size plane.  overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1)massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. our dataprovide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type ucd/ce populationinto two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by thestripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formedthrough the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues ofclassical ellipticals. we find compact stellar systems around galaxies in lowto high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processesresponsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.

1407.4812	simulating multiple merger pathways to the central kinematics of  early-type galaxies	two-dimensional integral field surveys such as atlas^3d are producing richobservational data sets yielding insights into galaxy formation. these newkinematic observations have highlighted the need to understand the evolutionarymechanisms leading to a spectrum of fast-rotators and slow-rotators inearly-type galaxies. we address the formation of slow and fast rotators througha series of controlled, comprehensive hydrodynamical simulations samplingidealized galaxy merger scenarios constructed from model spiral galaxies.idealized and controlled simulations of this sort complement the more'realistic' cosmological simulations by isolating and analyzing the effects ofspecific parameters, as we do in this paper. we recreate minor and major binarymergers, binary merger trees with multiple progenitors, and multiple sequentialmergers. within each of these categories of formation history, we correlateprogenitor gas fraction, mass ratio, orbital pericenter, orbital ellipticity,and spin with remnant kinematic properties. we create kinematic profiles ofthese 95 simulations comparable to atlas^3d data. by constructing remnantprofiles of the projected specific angular momentum (lambda_r = &lt;r|v|&gt; /&lt;sqrt(v^2+sigma^2)&gt;, triaxiality, and measuring the incidences of kinematictwists and kinematically decoupled cores, we distinguish between varyingformation scenarios. we find that binary mergers nearly always form fastrotators. slow rotators can be formed from zero initial angular momentumconfigurations and gas-poor mergers, but are not as round as the atlas^3dgalaxies. remnants of binary merger trees are triaxial slow rotators.sequential mergers form round slow rotators that most resemble the atlas^3drotators.

1408.2558	the aimss project ii: dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios across the star  cluster - galaxy divide	the previously clear division between small galaxies and massive starclusters is now occupied by objects called ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact ellipticals (ces). here we combine a sample of ucds and ces withvelocity dispersions from the aimss project with literature data to exploretheir dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.  we confirm that the mass ratios of many ucds in the stellar mass range 10$^6$-- 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$ are systematically higher than those for globularclusters which have mass ratios near unity. however, at the very highest massesin our sample, i.e. 10$^9$ -- 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, we find that ce galaxiesalso have mass ratios of close to unity, indicating their central regions aremostly composed of stars.  suggested explanations for the elevated mass ratios of ucds have included avariable imf, a central black hole, and the presence of dark matter. here wepresent another possible explanation, i.e. tidal stripping. under variousassumptions, we find that the apparent variation in the mass ratio with stellarmass and stellar density can be qualitatively reproduced by published tidalstripping simulations of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. in the early stages of thestripping process the galaxy is unlikely to be in virial equilibrium. at latestages, the final remnant resembles the properties of $\sim$10$^7$ m$_{\odot}$ucds. finally, we discuss the need for more detailed realistic modelling oftidal stripping over a wider range of parameter space, and observations tofurther test the stripping hypothesis.

1409.8676	the sluggs survey: globular cluster stellar population trends from weak  absorption lines in stacked spectra	as part of the sluggs survey, we stack 1137 keck deimos spectra of globularclusters from 10 galaxies to study their stellar populations in detail. thestacked spectra have median signal to noise ratios of $\sim 90$ \aa$^{-1}$.besides the calcium triplet, we study weaker sodium, magnesium, titanium andiron lines as well as the h$\alpha$ and higher order paschen hydrogen lines. ingeneral, the stacked spectra are consistent with old ages and a milky way-likeinitial mass function. however, we see different metal line index strengths atfixed colour and magnitude, and differences in the calcium triplet--colourrelation from galaxy to galaxy. we interpret this as strong evidence forvariations in the globular cluster colour--metallicity relation betweengalaxies. two possible explanations for the colour--metallicity relationvariations are that the average ages of globular clusters vary from galaxy togalaxy or that the average abundances of light elements (i.e. he, c, n and o)differ between galaxies. stacking spectra by magnitude, we see that the coloursbecome redder and metal line indices stronger with brighter magnitudes. thesetrends are consistent with the previously reported `blue tilts' beingmass--metallicity relations.

1412.2752	detection of a distinct metal-poor stellar halo in the early-type galaxy  ngc 3115	we present the resolved stellar populations in the inner and outer halo ofthe nearby lenticular galaxy ngc~3115. using deep hst observations, we analyzestars two magnitudes fainter than the tip of the red giant branch (trgb). westudy three fields along the minor axis of this galaxy, 19, 37 and 54 kpc fromits center -- corresponding to 7, 14, 21 effective radii (r_{e}). even at theselarge galactocentric distances, all of the fields are dominated by a relativelyenriched population, with the main peak in the metallicity distributiondecreasing with radius from [z/h] ~ -0.5 to -0.65. the fraction of metal-poorstars ([z/h] &lt; -0.95) increases from 17%, at 16-37 kpc, to 28%, at ~54 kpc. weobserve a distinct low metallicity population (peaked at [z/h] ~ -1.3 and withtotal mass 2*10^{10}m_{\odot} ~ 14% of the galaxy's stellar mass) and arguethat this represents the detection of an underlying low metallicity stellarhalo. such halos are generally predicted by galaxy formation theories and havebeen observed in several late type galaxies including the milky way and m31.the metallicity and spatial distribution of the stellar halo of ngc~3115 areconsistent with the galaxy's globular cluster system, which has a similar lowmetallicity population that becomes dominant at these large radii. this findingsupports the use of globular clusters as bright chemo-dynamical tracers ofgalaxy halos. these data also allow us to make a precise measurement of themagnitude of the trgb, from which we derive a distance modulus of ngc~3115 of30.05\pm0.05\pm0.10_{sys} (10.2\pm0.2\pm0.5_{sys} mpc).

1502.06598	how elevated is the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of the ultra-compact  dwarf s999?	here we present new keck esi high-resolution spectroscopy and deep archivalhst/acs imaging for s999, an ultra-compact dwarf in the vicinity of m87, whichwas claimed to have an extremely high dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio. our dataincrease the total integration times by a factor of 5 and 60 for spectroscopyand imaging, respectively. this allows us to constrain the stellar populationparameters for the first time (simple stellar population equivalent age$=7.6^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ gyr; $[z/\textrm{h}]=-0.95^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$;$[\alpha/\textrm{fe}]=0.34^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$). assuming a kroupa stellar initialmass function, the stellar population parameters and luminosity($m_{f814w}=-12.13\pm0.06$ mag) yield a stellar mass of$m_*=3.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^6 m_{\odot}$, which we also find to beconsistent with near-infrared data. via mass modelling, with our newmeasurements of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{ap}=27\pm2$ km s$^{-1}$) and size($r_e=20.9\pm1.0$ pc), we obtain an elevated dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio$m_{dyn}/m_*=8.2$ (with a range $5.6\le m_{dyn}/m_* \le 11.2$). furthermore, weanalyse the surface brightness profile of s999, finding only a small excess oflight in the outer parts with respect to the fitted s\'ersic profile, and apositive colour gradient. taken together these observations suggest that s999is the remnant of a much larger galaxy that has been tidally stripped. if so,the observed elevated mass ratio may be caused by mechanisms related to thestripping process: the existence of an massive central black hole or internalkinematics that are out of equilibrium due to the stripping event. given theobserved dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio we suggest that s999 is an idealcandidate to search for the presence of an overly massive central black hole.

1504.00075	small scatter and nearly-isothermal mass profiles to four half-light  radii from two-dimensional stellar dynamics of early-type galaxies	we study the total mass-density profile for a sample of 14 fast-rotatorearly-type galaxies (stellar masses $10.2&lt;\log m_\ast/m_\odot&lt;11.7$). wecombine observations from the sluggs and atlas3d surveys to map out the stellarkinematics in two-dimensions, out to a median radius for the sample of fourhalf-light radii $r_e$ (or 10 kpc), and a maximum radius of 2.0-6.2 $r_e$ (or4-21 kpc). we use axisymmetric dynamical models based on the jeans equations,which allow for a spatially varying anisotropy, and employ quite generalprofiles for the dark halos, and in particular do not place any restriction onthe profile slope. this is made possible by the availability of spatiallyextended two-dimensional kinematics. we find that our relatively simple modelsprovide a remarkably good description of the observed kinematics. the resultingtotal density profiles are well described by a nearly-isothermal power law$\rho_{\rm tot}(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ from $r_e$/10 to at least 4$r_e$, thelargest average deviation being 11%. the average logarithmic slope is$\langle\gamma\rangle=2.19\pm0.03$ with observed rms scatter of just$\sigma_\gamma=0.11$. this scatter out to large radii, where dark matterdominates, is as small as previously reported by lensing studies around$r\approx r_e/2$, where the stars dominate. our bulge-halo conspiracy placesmuch tighter constraints on galaxy formation models. it illustrates the powerof two-dimensional stellar kinematics observations at large radii. it would nowbe important to test the generality of our results for different galaxy typesand larger samples.

1504.03325	the sluggs survey: multi-population dynamical modelling of the  elliptical galaxy ngc 1407 from stars and globular clusters	we perform in-depth dynamical modelling of the luminous and dark matter (dm)content of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1407. our strategy consists of solving thespherical jeans equations for three independent dynamical tracers: stars, bluegcs and red gcs in a self-consistent manner. we adopt a maximum-likelihoodmarkov-chain monte carlo fitting technique in the attempt to constrain theinner slope of the dm density profile (the cusp/core problem), and the stellarinitial mass function (imf) of the galaxy. we find the inner logarithmic slopeof the dm density profiles to be $\gamma = 0.6\pm0.4$, which is consistent witheither a dm cusp ($\gamma = 1$) or with a dm core $(\gamma = 0)$. our findingsare consistent with a salpeter imf, and marginally consistent with a kroupaimf. we infer tangential orbits for the blue gcs, and radial anisotropy for redgcs and stars. the modelling results are consistent with the virialmass--concentration relation predicted by $\lambda$cdm simulations. the virialmass of ngc 1407 is $\log$ $m_{\rm vir} = 13.3 \pm 0.2 m_{\odot}$, whereas thestellar mass is $\log m_* = 11.8 \pm 0.1 m_{\odot}$. the overall uncertaintieson the mass of ngc 1407 are only 5 per cent at the projected stellar effectiveradius. we attribute the disagreement between our results and previous x-rayresults to the gas not being in hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regionsof the galaxy. the halo of ngc 1407 is found be dm dominated, with a dynamicalmass-to-light ratio of $m/l=260_{-100} ^{+174} m_{\odot}/l_{\odot, b}$.however, this value can be larger up to a factor of 3 depending on the assumedprior on the dm scale radius.

1505.04795	the sluggs survey: combining stellar and globular cluster metallicities  in the outer regions of early-type galaxies	the outer halo regions of early-type galaxies carry key information abouttheir past accretion history. however, spectroscopically probing the stellarcomponent at such galactocentric radii is still challenging. using keck/deimos,we have been able to measure the metallicities of the stellar and globularcluster components in 12 early-type galaxies out to more than $10~\rm{r_{e}}$.we find similar metallicity gradients for the metal-poor and metal-richglobular cluster subpopulations, suggesting a common formation process for thetwo subpopulations. this is in conflict with most current theoreticalpredictions, where the metal-poor globular clusters are thought to be purelyaccreted and metal-rich globular clusters mostly formed in-situ. moreover, wefind that the globular cluster metallicity gradients show a trend with galaxymass, being steeper in lower-mass galaxies than in higher-mass galaxies. thisis similar to what we find for the outermost galaxy stars and suggests a moreactive accretion history, with a larger role played by major mergers, in themost massive galaxies. this conclusion is qualitatively consistent withexpectations from two-phase galaxy assembly models. finally, we find that thesmall difference in metallicity between galaxy stars and metal-rich globularclusters at $1~\rm{r_{e}}$ may correlate with galaxy mass. the origin of thisdifference is not currently clear.

1506.05447	the megasecond chandra x-ray visionary project observation of ngc 3115  (iii): luminosity functions of lmxbs and dependence on stellar environments	we have studied the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) in the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 3115, using the megasecondchandra x-ray visionary project observation. with a total exposure time of ~1.1ms, we constructed the xlf down to a limiting luminosity of ~10^36 erg/s, muchdeeper than typically reached for other early-type galaxies. we foundsignificant flattening of the overall lmxb xlf from dn/dl \proptol^{-2.2\pm0.4} above 5.5x10^37 erg/s to dn/dl \propto l^{-1.0\pm0.1} below it,though we could not rule out a fit with a higher break at ~1.6x10^38 erg/s. wealso found evidence that the xlf of lmxbs in globular clusters (gcs) is overallflatter than that of field lmxbs. thus our results for this galaxy do notsupport the idea that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. the xlf of field lmxbs seemsto show spatial variation, with the xlf in the inner region of the galaxy beingflatter than that in the outer region, probably due to contamination of lmxbsfrom undetected and/or disrupted gcs in the inner region. the xlf in the outerregion is probably the xlf of primordial field lmxbs, exhibiting dn/dl \proptol^{-1.2\pm0.1} up to a break close to the eddington limit of neutron star lmxbs(~1.7x10^38 erg/s). the break of the gc lmxb xlf is lower, at ~1.1x10^37 erg/s.we also confirm previous findings that the metal-rich/red gcs are more likelyto host lmxbs than the metal-poor/blue gcs, which is more significant for moreluminous lmxbs, and that more massive gcs are more likely to host lmxbs.

1506.05448	the megasecond chandra x-ray visionary project observation of ngc 3115  (ii): properties of point sources	we have carried out an in-depth study of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs)detected in the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 3115, using the megasecond chandrax-ray visionary project observation (total exposure time 1.1 ms). in total wefound 136 candidate lmxbs in the field and 49 in globular clusters (gcs) above2\sigma\ detection, with 0.3--8 kev luminosity l_x ~10^36-10^39 erg/s. otherthan 13 transient candidates, the sources overall have less long-termvariability at higher luminosity, at least at l_x &gt; 2x10^37 erg/s. in order toidentify the nature and spectral state of our sources, we compared theircollective spectral properties based on single-component models (a simple powerlaw or a multicolor disk) with the spectral evolution seen in representativegalactic lmxbs. we found that in the l_x versus photon index \gamma_pl and l_xversus disk temperature kt_mcd plots, most of our sources fall on a narrowtrack in which the spectral shape hardens with increasing luminosity belowl_x~7x10^37 erg/s but is relatively constant (\gamma_pl~1.5 or kt_mcd~1.5 kev)above this luminosity, similar to the spectral evolution of galactic neutronstar (ns) lmxbs in the soft state in the chandra bandpass. therefore weidentified the track as the ns lmxb soft-state track and suggested sources withl_x&lt;7x10^37 erg/s as atolls in the soft state and those with l_x&gt;7x10^37 erg/sas z sources. ten other sources (five are transients) displayed significantlysofter spectra and are probably black hole x-ray binaries in the thermal state.one of them (persistent) is in a metal-poor gc.

1506.06820	the sluggs survey: inferring the formation epochs of metal-poor and  metal-rich globular clusters	we present a novel, observationally-based framework for the formation epochsand sites of globular clusters (gcs) in a cosmological context. measuringdirectly the mean ages of the metal-poor and metal-rich gc subpopulations inour own galaxy, and in other galaxies, is observationally challenging. here weapply an alternative approach utilising the property that the galaxymass-metallicity relation is a strong function of redshift (or look-back age)but is relatively insensitive to galaxy mass for massive galaxies. assumingthat gcs follow galaxy mass-metallicity relations that evolve with redshift,one can estimate the mean formation epochs of the two gc subpopulations byknowing their mean metallicities and the growth in host galaxy mass withredshift. recently, the sluggs survey has measured the spectroscopicmetallicities for over 1000 gcs in a dozen massive early-type galaxies. here weuse these measurements, and our new metallicity matching method, to infer amean age for metal-rich gcs of 11.5 gyr (z = 2.9) and a range of 12.2 to 12.8gyr (4.8 &lt; z &lt; 5.9) for the metal- poor gcs, depending on whether they mostlyformed in accreted satellites or in-situ within the main host galaxy. wecompare our values to direct age measurements for milky way gcs and predictionsfrom cosmological models. our findings suggest that reionisation preceded mostgc formation, and that it is unlikely to be the cause of gc bimodal metallicitydistributions.

1506.07882	the sluggs survey: globular cluster kinematics in a "double sigma"  galaxy - ngc 4473	ngc 4473 is a so--called double sigma (2$\sigma$) galaxy, i.e. a galaxy withrare, double peaks in its 2d stellar velocity dispersion. here, we present theglobular cluster (gc) kinematics in ngc 4473 out to $\sim10\,r_e$ (effectiveradii) using data from combined hst/acs and subaru/suprime--cam imaging andkeck/deimos spectroscopy. we find that the 2$\sigma$ nature of ngc 4473persists up to 3 $r_e$, though it becomes misaligned to the photometric majoraxis. we also observe a significant offset between the stellar and gc rotationamplitudes. this offset can be understood as a co--addition ofcounter--rotating stars producing little net stellar rotation. we identify asharp radial transition in the gc kinematics at $\sim4\,r_e$ suggesting a welldefined kinematically distinct halo. in the inner region ($&lt;4\,r_e$), the bluegcs rotate along the photometric major axis, but in an opposite direction tothe galaxy stars and red gcs. in the outer region ($&gt;4\,r_e$), the red gcsrotate in an opposite direction compared to the inner region red gcs, along thephotometric major axis, while the blue gcs rotate along an axis intermediatebetween the major and minor photometric axes. we also find a kinematicallydistinct population of very red gcs in the inner region with elevated rotationamplitude and velocity dispersion. the multiple kinematic components in ngc4473 highlight the complex formation and evolutionary history of this 2$\sigma$galaxy, as well as a distinct transition between the inner and outercomponents.

1506.08828	hiding in plain sight: record-breaking compact stellar systems in the  sloan digital sky survey	motivated by the recent, serendipitous discovery of the densest known galaxy,m60-ucd1, we present two initial findings from a follow-up search, using thesloan digital sky survey, subaru/suprime-cam and hubble space telescopeimaging, and southern astrophysical research (soar)/goodman spectroscopy. thefirst object discovered, m59-ucd3, has a similar size to m60-ucd1 (half-lightradius of r_h ~ 20 pc) but is 40% more luminous (m_v ~ -14.6), making it thenew densest-known galaxy. the second, m85-hcc1, has a size like a typicalglobular cluster (gc; r_h ~ 1.8 pc) but is much more luminous (m_v ~ -12.5).this hypercompact cluster is by far the densest confirmed free-floating stellarsystem, and is equivalent to the densest known nuclear star clusters. fromspectroscopy, we find that both objects are relatively young (~9 gyr and ~3gyr, respectively), with metal-abundances that resemble those of galaxycenters. their host galaxies show clear signs of large-scale disturbances, andwe conclude that these dense objects are the remnant nuclei of recentlyaccreted galaxies. m59-ucd3 is an ideal target for follow-up withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy to search for an overweight centralsupermassive black hole as was discovered in m60-ucd1. these findings alsoemphasize the potential value of ultra-compact dwarfs and massive gcs astracers of the assembly histories of galaxies.

1507.01336	vegas: a vst early-type galaxy survey. i. presentation, wide-field  surface photometry, and substructures in ngc 4472	we present the vst early-type galaxy survey (vegas), which is designed toobtain deep multiband photometry in g, r, i, of about one hundred nearbygalaxies down to 27.3, 26.8, and 26 mag/arcsec^2 respectively, using the esofacility vst/omegacam. the goals of the survey are 1) to map the lightdistribution up to ten effective radii, r_e, 2) to trace color gradients andsurface brightness fluctuation gradients out to a few r_e for stellarpopulation characterization, and 3) to obtain a full census of the satellitesystems (globular clusters and dwarf galaxies) out to 20% of the galaxy virialradius. the external regions of galaxies retain signatures of the formation andevolution mechanisms that shaped them, and the study of nearby objects enablesa detailed analysis of their morphology and interaction features. to clarifythe complex variety of formation mechanisms of early-type galaxies (etgs), wideand deep photometry is the primary observational step, which at the moment hasbeen pursued with only a few dedicated programs. the vegas survey has beendesignated to provide these data for a volume-limited sample with exceptionalimage quality. in this commissioning photometric paper we illustrate thecapabilities of the survey using g- and i-band vst/omegacam images of thenearby galaxy ngc 4472 and of smaller etgs in the surrounding field. oursurface brightness profiles reach rather faint levels and agree excellentlywell with previous literature. genuine new results concern the detection of anintracluster light tail in ngc 4472 and of various substructures at increasingscales. we have also produced extended (g-i) color profiles.  the vst/omegacam data that we acquire in the context of the vegas surveyprovide a detailed view of substructures in the optical emission from extendedgalaxies, which can be as faint as a hundred times below the sky level.

1509.04710	ngc 3628-ucd1: a possible $\omega$ cen analog embedded in a stellar  stream	using subaru/suprime-cam wide-field imaging and both keck/esi and lbt/modsspectroscopy, we identify and characterize a compact star cluster, which weterm ngc 3628-ucd1, embedded in a stellar stream around the spiral galaxy ngc3628. the size and luminosity of ucd1 are similar to $\omega$ cen, the mostluminous milky way globular cluster, which has long been suspected to be thestripped remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy. the object has a magnitude of$i=19.3$ mag (${\rm l}_{\rm i}=1.4\times10^{6}~{\rm l}_{\odot}$). ucd1 ismarginally resolved in our ground-based imaging, with a half-light radius of$\sim10$ pc. we measure an integrated brightness for the stellar stream of$i=13.1$ mag, with $(g-i)=1.0$. this would correspond to an accreted dwarfgalaxy with an approximate luminosity of ${\rm l}_i\sim4.1\times10^{8}~{\rml}_{\odot}$. spectral analysis reveals that ucd1 has an age of $6.6$ gyr ,$[\rm{z}/\rm{h}]=-0.75$, an $[{\alpha}/\rm{fe}]=-0.10$. we propose that ucd1 isan example of an $\omega$ cen-like star cluster possibly forming from thenucleus of an infalling dwarf galaxy, demonstrating that at least some of themassive star cluster population may be created through tidal stripping.

1511.03264	the aimss project iii: the stellar populations of compact stellar  systems	in recent years, a growing zoo of compact stellar systems (csss) have beenfound whose physical properties (mass, size, velocity dispersion) place thembetween classical globular clusters (gcs) and true galaxies, leading to debatesabout their nature. here we present results using a so far underutiliseddiscriminant, their stellar population properties. based on new spectroscopyfrom 8-10m telescopes, we derive ages, metallicities, and [\alpha/fe] of 29csss. these range from gcs with sizes of merely a few parsec to compactellipticals larger than m32. together with a literature compilation, thisprovides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics ofearly-type systems. we find that the csss are predominantly more metal richthan typical galaxies at the same stellar mass. at high mass, the compactellipticals (ces) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massiveearly-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. atlower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (ucds) changesat a few times $10^7$ m$_{\odot}$, which roughly coincides with the mass whereluminosity function arguments previously suggested the gc population ends. thehighest metallicities in csss are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxynuclei and the central parts of massive early types. these findings can beinterpreted as csss previously being more massive and undergoing tidalinteractions to obtain their current mass and compact size. such aninterpretation is supported by csss with direct evidence for tidal stripping,and by an examination of the css internal escape velocities.

1512.01185	the sluggs survey: chromo-dynamical modelling of the lenticular galaxy  ngc 1023	globular clusters (gcs) can be considered discrete, long-lived, dynamicaltracers that retain crucial information about the assembly history of theirparent galaxy. in this paper, we present a new catalogue of gc velocities andcolours for the lenticular galaxy ngc 1023, we study their kinematics andspatial distribution, in comparison with the underlying stellar kinematics andsurface brightness profile, and we test a new method for studying gcproperties. specifically, we decompose the galaxy light into its spheroid(assumed to represent the bulge + halo components) and disk components and useit to assign to each gc a probability of belonging to one of the twocomponents. then we model the galaxy kinematics, assuming a disk and spheroidalcomponent, using planetary nebulae (pne) and integrated stellar light. we usethis kinematic model and the probability previously obtained from thephotometry to recalculate for each gc its likelihood of being associated withthe disk, the spheroid, or neither. we find that the reddest gcs are likely tobe associated with the disk, as found for faint fuzzies in this same galaxy,suggesting that the disk of this s0 galaxy originated at z ~ 2. the majority ofblue gcs are found likely to be associated with the spheroidal (hot) component.the method also allows us to identify objects that are unlikely to be inequilibrium with the system. in ngc1023 some of the rejected gcs form asubstructure in phase space that is connected with ngc 1023 companion galaxy.

1512.06130	the sluggs survey: stellar kinematics, kinemetry and trends at large  radii in 25 early-type galaxies	due to longer dynamical timescales, the outskirts of early-type galaxiesretain the footprint of their formation and assembly. under the populartwo-phase galaxy formation scenario, an initial in-situ phase of star formationis followed by minor merging and accretion of ex-situ stars leading to theexpectation of observable transitions in the kinematics and stellar populationson large scales. however, observing the faint galactic outskirts ischallenging, often leaving the transition unexplored. the large scale,spatially-resolved stellar kinematic data from the sages legacy unifyinggalaxies and globulars (sluggs) survey are ideal for detecting kinematictransitions. we present kinematic maps out to 2.6 effective radii on average,kinemetry profiles, measurement of kinematic twists and misalignments, and theaverage outer intrinsic shape of 25 sluggs galaxies. we find good overallagreement in the kinematic maps and kinemetry radial profiles with literature.we are able to confirm significant radial modulations in rotational versuspressure support of galaxies with radius so that the central and outerrotational properties may be quite different. we also test the suggestion thatgalaxies may be more triaxial in their outskirts and find that while fastrotating galaxies were already shown to be axisymmetric in their inner regions,we are unable to rule out triaxiality in their outskirts. we compare ourderived outer kinematic information to model predictions from a two-phasegalaxy formation scenario. we find that the theoretical range of local outerangular momentum agrees well with our observations, but that radial modulationsare much smaller than predicted.

0809.2088	mapping the dark side with deimos: globular clusters, x-ray gas, and  dark matter in the ngc 1407 group	ngc 1407 is the central elliptical in a nearby evolved galaxy groupapparently destined to become a cluster core. we use the kinematics of globularclusters to probe the dynamics and mass profile of the group's center, out to60 kpc (~10 r_eff) -- the most extended data set to date around an early-typegalaxy. this sample consists of 172 gc velocities, most of them newly obtainedusing keck/deimos, with a few additional objects identified as dgtos or asigcs. we find weak rotation in the gc system's outer parts, with the metal-poorand metal-rich gcs misaligned. the rms velocity profile declines rapidly to aradius of ~20 kpc, and then becomes flat or rising to ~60 kpc. there isevidence that the gc orbits have a tangential bias that is strongest for themetal-poor gcs -- possibly contradicting theoretical expectations. we constructcosmologically-motivated galaxy+dark halo dynamical models and infer a masswithin 60 kpc of ~3x10^12 m_sun, extrapolating to a virial mass of ~6x10^13m_sun for a typical lcdm halo -- in agreement with results from group galaxykinematics. we present an independent chandra-based analysis, whose relativelyhigh mass at ~20 kpc disagrees strongly with the gc-based result unless the gcsare assumed to have a peculiar orbit distribution, and we discuss some generalcomparisons between x-ray and optical results. the group's b-band mass-to-lightratio of ~800 is extreme even for a rich galaxy cluster, much less a poor group-- placing it among the most dark matter dominated systems in the universe, andalso suggesting a massive reservoir of baryons lurking in an unseen phase, inaddition to the nonbaryonic dark matter. we compare the kinematical and massproperties of the ngc 1407 group to other nearby groups and clusters, anddiscuss some implications of this system for structure formation.
