0905.3737	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a systematic survey toestablish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for avolume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (d&lt;4 mpc). the survey volumeencompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &amp;large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. the galaxies include anearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 inluminosity and star formation rate. the survey data consists of images takenwith acs on hst, supplemented with archival data and new wfpc2 imaging takenafter the failure of acs. survey images include wide field tilings covering thefull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowdedregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. the new wide field imagingin angst reaches median 50% completenesses of m_f475w=28.0 mag, m_f606w=27.3mag, and m_f814w=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb). the deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve thestructure in the red clump. the resulting photometric catalogs are publiclyaccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of &gt;14 millionstars. in this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysisof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the acs andwfpc2 imaging. we also present uniformly derived relative distances measuredfrom the apparent magnitude of the trgb.

0906.4369	dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation	we review the problem of the formation of terrestrial planets, withparticular emphasis on the interaction of dynamical and geochemical models. thelifetime of gas around stars in the process of formation is limited to a fewmillion years based on astronomical observations, while isotopic dating ofmeteorites and the earth-moon system suggest that perhaps 50-100 million yearswere required for the assembly of the earth. therefore, much of the growth ofthe terrestrial planets in our own system is presumed to have taken place underlargely gas-free conditions, and the physics of terrestrial planet formation isdominated by gravitational interactions and collisions. the earliest phase ofterrestrial-planet formation involve the growth of km-sized or largerplanetesimals from dust grains, followed by the accumulations of theseplanetesimals into ~100 lunar- to mars-mass bodies that are initiallygravitationally isolated from one-another in a swarm of smaller planetesimals,but eventually grow to the point of significantly perturbing one-another. themutual perturbations between the embryos, combined with gravitational stirringby jupiter, lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth toearth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years. numerical treatmentof this process has focussed on the use of symplectic integrators which canrapidly integrate the thousands of gravitationally-interacting bodies necessaryto accurately model planetary growth. while the general nature of theterrestrial planets--their sizes and orbital parameters--seem to be broadlyreproduced by the models, there are still some outstanding dynamical issues.one of these is the presence of an embryo-sized body, mars, in our system inplace of the more massive objects that simulations tend to yield.

0707.0737	the causes of halo shape changes induced by cooling baryons: disks  versus substructures	cold dark matter cosmogony predicts triaxial dark matter halos, whereasobservations find quite round halos. this is most likely due to thecondensation of baryons leading to rounder halos. we examine the halo phasespace distribution basis for such shape changes. triaxial halos are supportedby box orbits, which pass arbitrarily close to the density center. the decreasein triaxiality caused by baryons is thought to be due to the scattering ofthese orbits. we test this hypothesis with simulations of disks grown insidetriaxial halos. after the disks are grown we check whether the phase spacestructure has changed by evaporating the disks and comparing the initial andfinal states. while the halos are substantially rounder when the disk is atfull mass, their final shape after the disk is evaporated is not much differentfrom the initial. likewise, the halo becomes (more) radially anisotropic whenthe disk is grown, but the final anisotropy is consistent with the initial.only if the baryons are unreasonably compact or massive does the halo changeirreversibly. we show that the character of individual orbits is not generallychanged by the growing mass. thus the central condensation of baryons does notdestroy enough box orbits to cause the shape change. rather, box orbits merelybecome rounder along with the global potential. however, if angular momentum istransferred to the halo, either via satellites or via bars, a largeirreversible change in the halo distribution occurs. the ability of satellitesto alter the phase space distribution of the halo is of particular concern togalaxy formation simulations since halo triaxiality can profoundly influencethe evolution of disks.

0909.1321	the nature of hi absorbers in grb afterglows: clues from hydrodynamic  simulations	in recent work, we have shown that it is possible to link quantitatively manyaspects of damped lyman alpha (dla) absorbers in the spectra of quasars to highresolution simulations of galaxy formation. using runs from the same series ofhydrodynamic numerical studies, we consider the expected properties of lymanalpha absorbers seen in the spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) gamma ray burstafterglows (grb-dlas). if grbs are associated with the death of massive stars,their afterglows provide insights into otherwise unprobed regions ofprotogalactic objects, but detailed physical interpretations are currentlyembryonic.  we find that median impact parameters (measured from the potential minimum)are approximately 1 kpc for grbs compared with 4 kpc for qso-dlas. however, anequally important difference is that grb-dlas are predominantly associated withhalos of mass 10^10&lt;m_vir/m_sol&lt;10^12, an order of magnitude larger than thehosts of qso-dlas. accordingly, there are differences in the stellar propertiesof hosts.  our simulations accurately predict the form of the grb-dla hi column densitydistribution, producing quantitative agreement for n_hi&gt;10^19 cm^-2, but theysomewhat underpredict the incidence of low column densities n_hi&lt;10^19 cm^-2.line-of-sight neutral gas metallicities predicted by our simulations (10^-2 &lt;z/z_sol &lt; 1) are consistent with the modest observational constraints. becauseof large internal dispersions in gas metallicities, this agreement is notsignificantly compromised by imposing a cut-off on the metallicity of starsable to launch grbs (z_star&lt;z_sol/3), confounding claims that the observedmetallicity of grb-dlas poses a challenge to current grb models.

0911.2237	at the heart of the matter: the origin of bulgeless dwarf galaxies and  dark matter cores	for almost two decades the properties of "dwarf" galaxies have challenged thecold dark matter (cdm) paradigm of galaxy formation. most observed dwarfgalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive dm halo witha near constant-density core. yet, models based on the cdm scenario invariablyform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar "bulges" and steep central dmprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and dm sink to the center of galaxiesthrough accretion and repeated mergers. processes that decrease the centraldensity of cdm halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theorywith observations of present day dwarfs. this failure is potentiallycatastrophic for the cdm model, possibly requiring a different dm particlecandidate. this letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a lambda$cdmframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallowcentral dm profile, are formed. this is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneousinterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosionswhich remove low angular momentum gas. this inhibits the formation of bulgesand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the centralkiloparsec. realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome ofgalaxy formation in the cdm scenario.

0707.4515	the formation of the oort cloud in open cluster environments	we study the influence of an open cluster environment on the formation andcurrent structure of the oort cloud. to do this, we have run 19 differentsimulations of the formation of the oort cloud for 4.5 gyrs. in eachsimulation, the solar system spends its first 100 myrs in a different opencluster environment before transitioning to its current field environment. wefind that, compared to forming in the field environment, the inner oort cloudis preferentially loaded with comets while the sun resides in the open clusterand that most of this material remains locked in the interior of the cloud forthe next 4.4 gyrs. in addition, the outer oort cloud trapping efficiencies weobserve in our simulations are lower than previous formation models by about afactor of 2, possibly implying an even more massive early planetesimal disk.furthermore, some of our simulations reproduce the orbits of observed extendedscattered disk objects, which may serve as an observational constraint on thesun's early environment. depending on the particular open cluster environment,the properties of the inner oort cloud and extended scattered disk can varywidely. on the other hand, the outer portions of the oort cloud in each of oursimulations are all similar.

1005.1681	star formation and feedback in smoothed particle hydrodynamic  simulations ii: resolution effects	we examine the effect of mass and force resolution on a specific starformation (sf) recipe using a set of n-body/smooth particle hydrodynamicsimulations of isolated galaxies. our simulations span halo masses from 10^9 to10^13 solar masses, more than four orders of magnitude in mass resolution, andtwo orders of magnitude in the gravitational softening length, epsilon,representing the force resolution. we examine the total global star formationrate, the star formation history, and the quantity of stellar feedback andcompare the disk structure of the galaxies. based on our analysis, we recommendusing at least 10^4 particles each for the dark matter and gas component and aforce resolution of epsilon approximately equal to 10^-3 r_vir when studyingglobal sf and feedback. when the spatial distribution of stars is important,the number of gas and dark matter particles must be increased to at least 10^5of each. low mass resolution simulations with fixed softening lengths showparticularly weak stellar disks due to two-body heating. while decreasingspatial resolution in low mass resolution simulations limits two-body effects,density and potential gradients cannot be sustained. regardless of thesoftening, low-mass resolution simulations contain fewer high density regionswhere sf may occur. galaxies of approximately 10^10 solar masses display uniquesensitivity to both mass and force resolution. this mass of galaxy has ashallow potential and is on the verge of forming a disk. the combination ofthese factors give this galaxy the potential for strong gas outflows driven bysupernova feedback and make it particularly sensitive to any changes to thesimulation parameters.

1104.3858	the first massive black hole seeds and their hosts	we investigate the formation of the first massive black holes in highredshift galaxies, with the goal of providing insights to which galaxies do ordo not host massive black holes. we adopt a novel approach to forming seedblack holes in galaxy halos in cosmological sph+n-body simulations. theformation of massive black hole seeds is dictated directly by the local gasdensity, temperature, and metallicity, and motivated by physical models ofmassive black hole formation. we explore seed black hole populations as afunction of halo mass and redshift, and examine how varying the efficiency ofmassive black hole seed formation affects the relationship between black holesand their hosts. seed black holes tend to form in halos with mass between 10^7and 10^9 msun, and the formation rate is suppressed around z = 5 due to thediffusion of metals throughout the intergalactic medium. we find that the timeof massive black hole formation and the occupation fraction of black holes area function of the host halo mass. by z = 5, halos with mass m_halo &gt; 3 x 10^9msun host massive black holes regardless of the efficiency of seed formation,while the occupation fraction for smaller halos increases with black holeformation efficiency. our simulations explain why massive black holes are foundin some bulgeless and dwarf galaxies, but we also predict that their occurrencebecomes rarer and rarer in low-mass systems.

1108.1570	sedna and the oort cloud around a migrating sun	recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that the sun's dynamicalhistory within the milky way may be much more complex than that suggested byits current low peculiar velocity. in particular, the sun may have radiallymigrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc. this has importantramifications for the structure of the oort cloud, as it means that the solarsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that weresignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. tocharacterize the effects of solar migration within the milky way, we use directnumerical simulations to model the formation of an oort cloud around stars thatend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a milky way-likedisk formation. surprisingly, our simulations indicate that sedna's orbit maybelong to the classical oort cloud. contrary to previous understanding, we showthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the oort cloud'sextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edgesometimes extends to sedna's orbit. the sun's galactic migration heightens thechance of powerful stellar passages, and sedna production occurs around ~20-30%of the solar-like stars we study. considering the entire oort cloud, we findits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attainedduring the sun's orbital history. the inner edge also shows a similardependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellarencounters. both of these oort cloud parameters can vary by an order ofmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an oort cloud formation model thatassumes a fixed galactic environment. in addition, the amount of materialtrapped in outer oort cloud orbits can be extremely low and may presentdifficulties for models of oort cloud formation and long-period cometproduction.

1205.5567	implementing molecular hydrogen in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy  formation	motivated by the observed connection between molecular hydrogen (h2) and starformation, we present a method for tracking the non-equilibrium abundance andcooling processes of h2 and h2-based star formation in smoothed particlehydrodynamic simulations. the local abundances of h2 are calculated byintegrating over the hydrogen chemical network. this calculation includes thegas-phase and dust grain formation of h2, shielding of hi and h2, andphotodissociation of h2 by lyman-werner radiation from nearby stellarpopulations. because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it isparticularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicityenvironments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early universe. we furtherintroduce an explicit link between star formation and local h2 abundance. thislink limits star formation to "star-forming regions," represented by areas withabundant h2.  with this implementation, we determine the effect of h2 on star formation ina cosmological simulation of a dwarf galaxy. this simulation is the firstcosmological simulation with non-equilibrium h2 abundances to be integrated toa redshift of zero or to include efficient sn feedback. we find that oursimulations are consistent with the observed tully-fisher, globalkennicutt-schmidt, and resolved kennicutt-schmidt relations. we find that theinclusion of shielding of both the atomic and molecular hydrogen and, to alesser extent, the additional cooling from h2 at temperatures between 200 and5000 k increases the amount of cold gas in the galaxies. the changes to the ismresult in an increased amount of cold, dense gas in the disk of the galaxy andthe formation of a clumpier interstellar media (ism). the explicit link betweenstar formation and h2 and the clumpier ism results in a bluer galaxy with agreater spatial distribution of star formation at a redshift of zero.(abridged)

1211.0326	the effect of models of the interstellar media on the central mass  distribution of galaxies	we compare the central mass distribution of galaxies simulated with threedifferent models of the interstellar medium (ism) with increasing complexity:primordial (h+he) cooling down to 10^4k, additional cooling via metal lines andto lower temperatures, and molecular hydrogen (h_2) with shielding of atomicand molecular hydrogen, in addition to metal line cooling. in order to analyzethe effect of these models, we follow the evolution of four field galaxies withv_peak &lt; 120 km/s to a redshift of zero using high-resolution smoothed particlehydrodynamic simulations in a fully cosmological lcdm context. the spiralgalaxies produced in simulations with either primordial cooling or h_2 physicshave realistic, rising rotation curves. in contrast, the simulations with metalline cooling and otherwise similar feedback and star formation producedgalaxies with the peaked rotation curves typical of most previous lcdmsimulations of spiral galaxies. the less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotationcurves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or h_2 are linked tochanges in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. these galaxies hadsmaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas lossfrom stellar feedback. when there is only primordial cooling, the star forminggas is hotter and the feedback-heated gas cools more slowly than when metalline cooling is included and so requires less energy to be expelled. when h_2is included, the accompanying shielding produces large amounts of clumpy, coldgas where h_2 forms. star formation in clumpy gas results in more concentratedsupernova feedback and greater efficiency of mass loss. the higher feedbackefficiency causes a decrease of low-angular momentum material.

1301.2670	what's up in the milky way? the orientation of the disc relative to the  triaxial halo	models of the sagittarius stream have consistently found that the milky waydisc is oriented such that its short axis is along the intermediate axis of thetriaxial dark matter halo. we attempt to build models of disc galaxies in suchan `intermediate-axis orientation'. we do this with three models. in the firsttwo cases we simply rigidly grow a disc in a triaxial halo such that the discends up perpendicular to the global intermediate axis. we also attempt to coaxa disc to form in an intermediate-axis orientation by producing a gas+darkmatter triaxial system with gas angular momentum about the intermediate axis.in all cases we fail to produce systems which remain with stellar angularmomentum aligned with the halo's intermediate axis, even when the disc'spotential flattens the inner halo such that the disc is everywhereperpendicular to the halo's local minor axis. for one of these unstablesimulations we show that the potential is even rounder than the models of themilky way potential in the region probed by the sagittarius stream. we concludethat the milky way's disc is very unlikely to be in an intermediate axisorientation. however we find that a disc can persist off one of the principalplanes of the potential. we propose that the disc of the milky way must betilted relative to the principal axes of the dark matter halo. directconfirmation of this prediction would constitute a critical test of modifiednewtonian dynamics.

1305.5253	the influence of outer solar system architecture on the structure and  evolution of the oort cloud	we study the influence of outer solar system architecture on the structuralevolution of the oort cloud (oc) and the flux of earth-crossing comets. inparticular, we seek to quantify the role of the giant planets as "planetaryprotectors". to do so, we have run simulations in each of four differentplanetary mass configurations to understand the significance of each of thegiant planets. because the outer planets modify the structure of the octhroughout its formation, we integrate each simulation over the full age of thesolar system. over this time, we follow the evolution of cometary orbits fromtheir starting point in the protoplanetary disk to their injection into the octo their possible re-entry into the inner planetary region. we find that theoverall structure of the oc, including the location of boundaries and therelative number of comets in the inner and outer parts, does not changesignificantly between configurations; however, as planetary mass decreases, thetrapping efficiency (te) of comets into the oc and the flux of comets into theobservable region increases. we determine that those comets that evolve ontoearth-crossing orbits come primarily from the inner oc but show no preferencefor initial protoplanetary disk location. we also find that systems that haveat least a saturn-mass object are effective at deflecting possibleearth-crossing comets but the difference in flux between systems with andwithout such a planet is less than an order of magnitude. we conclude bydiscussing the individual roles of the planets and the implications ofincorporating more realistic planetary accretion and migration scenarios intosimulations, particularly on existing discrepancies between low te and the massof the protoplanetary disk and on determining the structural boundaries of theoc.

1307.0856	the relative role of galaxy mergers and cosmic flows in feeding black  holes	using a set of zoomed-in cosmological simulations of high-redshiftprogenitors of massive galaxies, we isolate and trace the history of gas thatis accreted by central supermassive black holes. we determine the origins ofthe accreted gas, in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a mergerevent or was smoothly accreted. furthermore, we designate whether the smoothlyaccreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into thehalo. for moderate-mass (10^6 - 10^7 msun) black holes at z ~ 4, there is apreference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin.however, this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has ahigher fraction of gas from cold flows. in general, each black hole tends toaccrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger-accreted gas as is containedin its host galaxy, suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomeswell-mixed, and its origins are erased. we find that the angular momentum ofthe gas upon halo entry is a more important factor; black holes preferentiallyaccrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy,regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers.

1407.0022	faint dwarfs as a test of dm models: wdm vs. cdm	we use high resolution hydro$+$n-body cosmological simulations to compare theassembly and evolution of a small field dwarf (stellar mass ~ 10$^{6-7}$m$\odot$, total mass 10$^{10}$ m$\odot$ in $\lambda$ dominated cdm and 2kev wdmcosmologies. we find that star formation (sf) in the wdm model is reduced anddelayed by 1-2 gyr relative to the cdm model, independently of the details ofsf and feedback. independent of the dm model, but proportionally to the sfefficiency, gas outflows lower the central mass density through `dynamicalheating', such that all realizations have circular velocities $&lt;$ 20kms at500$~$pc, in agreement with local kinematic constraints. as a result ofdynamical heating, older stars are less centrally concentrated than youngerstars, similar to stellar population gradients observed in nearby dwarfgalaxies. introducing an important diagnostic of sf and feedback models, wetranslate our simulations into artificial color-magnitude diagrams and starformation histories in order to directly compare to available observations. thesimulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many $\sim$10 myr long bursts.the cdm galaxy has a global sfh, hi abundance and fe/h and alpha-elementsdistribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies. theseresults highlight the importance of directly including `baryon physics' insimulations when 1) comparing predictions of galaxy formation models with thekinematics and number density of local dwarf galaxies and 2) differentiatingbetween cdm and non-standard models with different dm or power spectra.

1411.5683	direct formation of supermassive black holes in metal-enriched gas at  the heart of high-redshift galaxy mergers	we present novel 3d multi-scale sph simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergersbetween the most massive galaxies at $z \sim 8 - 10$, designed to scrutinizethe direct collapse formation scenario for massive black hole seeds proposed in\citet{mayer+10}. the simulations achieve a resolution of 0.1 pc, and includeboth metallicity-dependent optically-thin cooling and a model for thermalbalance at high optical depth. we consider different formulations of the sphhydrodynamical equations, including thermal and metal diffusion. when the twomerging galaxy cores collide, gas infall produces a compact, optically thicknuclear disk with densities exceeding $10^{-10}$ g cm$^3$. the disk rapidlyaccretes higher angular momentum gas from its surroundings reaching $\sim 5$ pcand a mass of $\gtrsim 10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ in only a few $10^4$ yr. outside$\gtrsim 2$ pc it fragments into massive clumps. instead, supersonic turbulenceprevents fragmentation in the inner parsec region, which remains warm ($\sim3000-6000$ k) and develops strong non-axisymmetric modes that cause prominentradial gas inflows ($&gt; 10^4$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), forming an ultra-densemassive disky core. angular momentum transport by non-axisymmetric modes shouldcontinue below our spatial resolution limit, quickly turning the disky coreinto a supermassive protostar which can collapse directly into a massive blackhole of mass $10^8-10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ via the relativistic radial instability.such a "cold direct collapse"' explains naturally the early emergence of high-zqsos. its telltale signature would be a burst of gravitational waves in thefrequency range $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ hz, possibly detectable by the plannedelisa interferometer.

1506.00652	the effect of stellar feedback on a milky way-like galaxy and its  gaseous halo	we present the study of a set of n-body+sph simulations of a milky way-likesystem produced by the radiative cooling of hot gas embedded in a dark matterhalo. the galaxy and its gaseous halo evolve for 10 gyr in isolation, whichallows us to study how internal processes affect the evolution of the system.we show how the morphology, the kinematics and the evolution of the galaxy areaffected by the input supernova feedback energy e$_{\rm sn}$, and we compareits properties with those of the milky way. different values of e$_{\rm sn}$ donot significantly affect the star formation history of the system, but the discof cold gas gets thicker and more turbulent as feedback increases. our mainresult is that, for the highest value of e$_{\rm sn}$ considered, the galaxyshows a prominent layer of extra-planar cold (log(t)&lt;4.3) gas extended up to afew kpc above the disc at column densities of $10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. thekinematics of this material is in agreement with that inferred for the hi halosof our galaxy and ngc 891, although its mass is lower. also, the location, thekinematics and the typical column densities of the hot (5.3&lt;log(t)&lt;5.7) gas arein good agreement with those determined from the o$_{\rm vi}$ absorptionsystems in the halo of the milky way and external galaxies. in contrast withthe observations, however, gas at log(t)&lt;5.3 is lacking in the circumgalacticregion of our systems.

1508.00007	in-n-out: the gas cycle from dwarfs to spiral galaxies	we examine the scalings of galactic outflows with halo mass across a suite oftwenty high-resolution cosmological zoom galaxy simulations covering halomasses from 10^9.5 - 10^12 m_sun. these simulations self-consistently generateoutflows from the available supernova energy in a manner that successfullyreproduces key galaxy observables including the stellar mass-halo mass,tully-fisher, and mass-metallicity relations. we quantify the importance ofejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efficiency of gasaccretion and star formation. ejective feedback is increasingly important asgalaxy mass decreases; we find an effective mass loading factor that scales asv_circ^(-2.2), with an amplitude and shape that is invariant with redshift.these scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind,based solely on the halo potential. recycling is common: about half the outflowmass across all galaxy masses is later re-accreted. the recycling timescale istypically about 1 gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. recycled material isre-accreted farther out in the disk and with typically about 2-3 times moreangular momentum. these results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycleplausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distributionof disk material across the halo mass range where most of cosmic star formationoccurs.

1508.02224	a comparison of black hole growth in galaxy mergers with gasoline and  ramses	supermassive black hole dynamics during galaxy mergers is crucial indetermining the rate of black hole mergers and cosmic black hole growth. assimulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whetherthe black hole dynamics is influenced by the treatment of the interstellarmedium in different simulation codes. we here compare simulations of black holegrowth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamicscode gasoline, and the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. we seek toidentify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences inhydrodynamic methods and implementations of sub-grid physics. we find that thegeneral behavior is consistent between codes. black hole accretion is minimalwhile the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they "fly-by" within 10 kpcat first pericenter). at late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,tidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black holeaccretion accompanied by star formation. we also note quantitativediscrepancies that are model-dependent: our ramses simulations show less starformation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with largerclumps and filaments, than our gasoline simulations. we attribute thesedifferences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling andfeedback and gas thermodynamics. the main conclusion is that differences existquantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when makingcomparisons with observations. however, reassuringly, both codes capture thesame dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering of black hole accretion, starformation, and black hole dynamics.

astro-ph;0004011	great circle tidal streams: evidence for a nearly spherical massive dark  halo around the milky way	an all high-latitude sky survey for cool carbon giant stars in the galactichalo has revealed 75 such stars, of which the majority are new detections. ofthese, more than half are clustered on a great circle on the sky whichintersects the center of sagittarius dwarf galaxy (sgr) and is parallel to itsproper motion vector, while many of the remainder are outlying magellanic cloudc-stars. a pole-count analysis of the carbon star distribution clearlyindicates that the great circle stream we have isolated is statisticallysignificant, being a 5-6 sigma over-density. these two arguments stronglysupport our conclusion that a large fraction of the halo carbon starsoriginated in sgr. the stream orbits the galaxy between the present location ofsgr, 16 kpc from the galactic center, and the most distant stream carbon star,at ~60 kpc. it follows neither a polar nor a galactic plane orbit, so that alarge range in both galactic r and z distances are probed. that the stream isobserved as a great circle indicates that the galaxy does not exert asignificant torque upon the stream, so the galactic potential must be nearlyspherical in the regions probed by the stream. we present n-body experimentssimulating this disruption process as a function of the distribution of mass inthe galactic halo. a likelihood analysis shows that, in the galactocentricdistance range 16 kpc &lt; r &lt; 60 kpc, the dark halo is most likely almostspherical. we rule out, at high confidence levels, the possibility that thehalo is significantly oblate, with isodensity contours of aspect q_m &lt; 0.7.this result is quite unexpected and contests currently popular galaxy formationmodels.

astro-ph;0103430	the metamorphosis of tidally stirred dwarf galaxies	we present results from high-resolution n-body/sph simulations ofrotationally supported dwarf irregular galaxies moving on bound orbits in themassive dark matter halo of the milky way.the dwarf models span a range in disksurface density and the masses and sizes of their dark halos are consistentwith the predictions of cold dark matter cosmogonies. we show that the strongtidal field of the milky way determines severe mass loss in their halos anddisks and induces bar and bending instabilities that transform low surfacebrightness dwarfs (lsbs) into dwarf spheroidals (dsphs) and high surfacebrightness dwarfs (hsbs) into dwarf ellipticals (des) in less than 10 gyr. thefinal central velocity dispersions of the remnants are in the range 8-30 km/sand their final $v/\sigma$ falls to values $&lt; 0.5$, matching well thekinematics of early-type dwarfs. the transformation requires the orbital timeof the dwarf to be $\simlt 3-4$ gyr, which implies a halo as massive andextended as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation to explain theorigin of even the farthest dsph satellites of the milky way, leo i and leo ii.only dwarfs with central dark matter densities as high as those of draco andursa minor can survive for 10 gyr in the proximity of the milky way: this isnaturally achieved within hierarchical models, where the densest objects shouldhave small orbital times due to their early formation epochs. part of the gasis stripped and part is funneled to the center due to the bar, generating onestrong burst of star formation in hsbs and smaller, multiple bursts in lsbs.extended low-surface brightness stellar and gaseous streams originate from lsbsand, when projected along the line of sight, can lead to overestimate themass-to-light ratio of the bound remnant by a factor $\simlt 2$,

astro-ph;0110386	tidal debris of dwarf spheroidals as a probe of structure formation  models	recent observations suggest that carina and other nearby dwarf spheroidalgalaxies are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the milky way. werun high-resolution n-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within themilky way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with darkmatter potentials as those implied by current structure formation models. weshow that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or withcuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter ($c &lt; 5$) lead to flatouter stellar density profiles like that of carina for a variety of orbitalconfigurations. on the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars fromcuspy dark matter halos with concentrations as high as predicted by cdm modelsat the mass scale of dwarf galaxies ($c \simgt 10$) and the data can only bereproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. our simulations show that carina islosing mass at a fractional rate $&lt; 0.1$ gyr$^{-1}$ and its mass-to-light ratiocould be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected alongthe line of sight. we follow the evolution of the tidal debris within atriaxial clumpy cold dark matter milky way halo which causes differentialprecession and small scale heating of the stellar streams. this renders theiruse as a dynamical tracer of the galactic potential practically useless, butdoes provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. models with warmdark matter (wdm) or fluid dark matter (fdm) produce dwarf halos with lowercentral densities than cdm and would be consistent with the observed tidaltails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current dataon nearby dwarf spheroidals. galactic halos in fdm are smooth and spherical andwould be favored by the detection of coherent streams.

astro-ph;0203004	the structural evolution of substructure	we investigate the evolution of substructure in cold dark matter halos usingn-body simulations of tidal stripping of substructure halos (subhalos) within astatic host potential. we find that halos modeled following the navarro, frenk&amp; white (nfw) mass profile lose mass continuously due to tides from the massivehost, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidalradii. the structure of stripped nfw halos depends mainly on the fraction ofmass lost, and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the originalnfw profile. we apply these results to substructure in the milky way, andconclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dsph)satellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminousradius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellarvelocity dispersion. our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dsphslie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightnessprofile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but ratherfeatures in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. for draco, inparticular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger thanderived by irwin &amp; hatzidimitriou (1995), lending support to the interpretationof recent sloan survey data by odenkirchen et al. (2001). similarly, our modelsuggests that carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of ~55 km/s, which mayhelp explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergoseveral bursts of star formation. our results imply a close correspondencebetween the most massive subhalos expected in a cdm universe and the knownsatellites of the milky way, and suggest that only subhalos with peak circularvelocities below 35 km/s lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.

astro-ph;0310771	the evolution of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks:  fragmentation and possible giant planet formation	we carry out a large set of very high resolution, three dimensional smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations describing the evolution ofgravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks. we consider a broadrange of initial disk parameters. disk masses out to 20 au range from 0.075 to0.125 $m_{\odot}$, roughly consistent with the high-end of the massdistribution inferred for disks around t tauri stars. the initial disks spanminimum $q$ parameters between 0.8 and 2, with most models being around $\sim1.4$. the disks are evolved assuming either a locally isothermal equation ofstate or an adiabatic equation of state with varying $\gamma$. whenoverdensities above a specific threshold appear as a result of gravitationalinstability in a locally isothermal calculation, the equation of state isswitched to adiabatic to account for the increased optical depth. we show thatwhen a disk has a minimum $q$ parameter less than 1.4 strong trailing spiralinstabilities, typically three or four armed modes, form and grow untilfragmentation occurs along the arms after about 5 mean disk orbital times. theresulting clumps contract quickly to densities several orders of magnitudehigher than the initial disk density, and the densest of them survive evenunder adiabatic conditions. these clumps are stable to tidal disruption andmerge quickly, leaving 2-3 protoplanets on fairly eccentric orbits (the meaneccentricity being around 0.2) with masses between 0.7 and more than $7m_{jup}$, well in agreement with those of detected extrasolar planets.after$\sim 10^3$ years. fragmentation is not strongly dependent on whether the diskstarts from a marginally unstable state or gradually achieves it, as shown by atest where the disk gradually achieves the critical $q$ by growing in mass.

astro-ph;0312544	evolution of the density profiles of dark matter haloes	we use numerical simulations in a lambda cdm cosmology to model densityprofiles in a set of 16 dark matter haloes with resolutions of up to 7 millionparticles within the virial radius. these simulations allow us to followrobustly the formation and evolution of the central cusp over a large massrange of 10^11 to 10^14 m_sun, down to approximately 0.5% of the virial radius,and from redshift 5 to the present. the cusp of the density profile is set atredshifts of 2 or greater and remains remarkably stable to the present time,when considered in non-comoving coordinates. we fit our haloes to a 2 parameterprofile where the steepness of the asymptotic cusp is given by gamma, and itsradial extent is described by the concentration, c_gamma. in our simulations,we find gamma = 1.4 - 0.08log(m/m_*) for haloes of 0.01m_* to 1000m_*, with alarge scatter of gamma ~ +/-0.3$; and c_gamma = 8*m/m_*^{-0.15}, with a largem/m_* dependent scatter roughly equal to +/- c_gamma. our redshift zero haloeshave inner slope parameters ranging approximately from r^{-1} to r^{-1.5}, witha median of roughly r^{-1.3}. this 2 parameter profile fit works well for allour halo types, whether or not they show evidence of a steep asymptotic cusp.we also model a cluster in power law cosmologies of p ~ k^n (n=0,-1,-2,-2.7).we find larger concentration radii and shallower cusps for steeper n. theminimum resolved radius is well described by the mean interparticle separation.the trend of steeper and more concentrated cusps for smaller $m/m_*$ haloesclearly shows that dwarf sized lambda cdm haloes have, on average,significantly steeper density profiles within the inner few percent of thevirial radius than inferred from recent observations. code to reproduce thisprofile can be downloaded from http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/~reed/profile.html

astro-ph;0406034	dark matter subhaloes in numerical simulations	we use cosmological lcdm numerical simulations to model the evolution of thesubstructure population in sixteen dark matter haloes with resolutions of up toseven million particles within the virial radius. the combined substructurecircular velocity distribution function (vdf) for hosts of 10^11 to 10^14 msunat redshifts from zero to two or higher has a self-similar shape, isindependent of host halo mass and redshift, and follows the relation:dn/dv=(1/8)(v_cmax/v_cmax,host)^-4. halo to halo variance in the vdf is afactor of roughly two to four. at high redshifts, we find preliminary evidencefor fewer large substructure haloes (subhaloes). specific angular momenta aresignificantly lower for subhaloes nearer the host halo centre where tidalstripping is more effective. the radial distribution of subhaloes is marginallyconsistent with the mass profile for r &gt;~ 0.3r_vir, where the possibility ofartificial numerical disruption of subhaloes can be most reliably excluded byour convergence study, although a subhalo distribution that is shallower thanthe mass profile is favoured. subhalo masses but not circular velocitiesdecrease toward the host centre. subhalo velocity dispersions hint at apositive velocity bias at small radii. there is a weak bias toward morecircular orbits at lower redshift, especially at small radii. we additionallymodel a cluster in several power law cosmologies of p ~ k^n, and demonstratethat a steeper spectral index, n, results in significantly less substructure.

astro-ph;0407407	fate of supermassive black holes and evolution of the m(bh)-sigma  relation in merging galaxies: the effect of gaseous dissipation	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the orbital evolution of supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) using high-resolution self-consistent gasdynamicalsimulations of binary equal- and unequal-mass mergers of disk galaxies. thegalaxy models are consistent with the lcdm paradigm of structure formation andthe simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. wefind that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close smbh pairat the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adoptedforce resolution of ~ 100 pc. instead, the final smbh separation inunequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of themerging galaxies is modified by dissipation. in the absence of dissipation, thesatellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completedleaving its smbh wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnantfor the formation of a close pair. in contrast, we show that gas coolingfacilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companiongalaxy to tidal disruption. moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxiesconstructed to obey the m(bh)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending onwhether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of themass ratio of the merging systems. collisionless simulations reveal thatremnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role ofgas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.  in dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associatedwith the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by starformation provides the necessary fuel to the smbhs and allows the mergerremnants to satisfy the relation.

astro-ph;0407620	the formation and habitability of terrestrial planets in the presence of  hot jupiters	`hot jupiters,' giant planets with orbits very close to their parent stars,are thought to form farther away and migrate inward via interactions with amassive gas disk. if a giant planet forms and migrates quickly, theplanetesimal population has time to re-generate in the lifetime of the disk andterrestrial planets may form (armitage 2003). we present results of simulationsof terrestrial planet formation in the presence of hot jupiters, broadlydefined as having orbital radii &lt;= 0.5 au. we show that terrestrial planetssimilar to those in the solar system can form around stars with hot jupiters,and can have water contents equal to or higher than the earth's. for smallorbital radii of hot jupiters (e.g. 0.15, 0.25 au) potentially habitableplanets can form, but for semi-major axes of 0.5 au or greater their formationis suppressed. we show that the presence of an outer giant planet such asjupiter does not enhance the water content of the terrestrial planets, butrather decreases their formation and water delivery timescales. we speculatethat asteroid belts may exist interior to the terrestrial planets in systemswith hot jupiters.

astro-ph;0502213	on the survival and disruption of earth mass cdm micro-haloes	neutralino dark matter leads to the formation of numerous earth mass darkmatter haloes at redshifts z\approx 60 (diemand et al. 2005). these abundantcdm micro-haloes have cuspy density profiles that can easily withstand thegalactic tidal field at the solar radius. zhao, taylor, silk &amp; hooper(astro-ph/0502049) concluded that ``...the majority of dark mattersubstructures with masses \sim 10^{-6}m_o will be tidally disrupted due tointeractions with stars in the galactic halo''. however these authors assumed ahalo density of stars that is at least an order of magnitude higher thanobserved. we show that the appropriate application of the impulse approximationis to the regime of multiple encounters, not single disruptive events asadopted by zhao et al., which leads to a survival time of several hubble times.therefore we do not expect the tidal heating by galactic stars to affect theabundance of micro-haloes. disk crossing will cause some mass loss but thecentral cores are likely to survive and could be detected as gamma-ray sourceswith proper motions of several arc minutes per year.

astro-ph;0509310	the secular evolution of disk structural parameters	we present a comprehensive series of $n$-body as well as $n$-body + sphsimulations to study the secular evolution of the structure of disk galaxies.our simulations are organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity, rangingfrom rigid-halo collisionless simulations to fully live simulations with gasand star formation. comparisons between the different types of simulationsallow us to isolate the role of various physical mechanisms. we focus on theevolution of systems expected in a lcdm universe.  our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies mayresult from secular evolution rather than from direct hierarchical assembly. inthe vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms can lead to heating.the strongest heating occurs during the vertical buckling instability of a bar.among the consequences of this instability is the formation of peanut-shapedbulges which produce clear kinematic signatures when observed face-on. we findthat bars are robust structures that are not destroyed by buckling. they can bedestroyed instead by a central mass concentration but we find that this massneeds to be a large fraction of the total mass of the disk. we then study theevolution of stellar surface density profiles showing how angular momentumredistribution leads to increasing central densities and disk scale lengths andto profile breaks at large radii. the breaks in these simulations are inexcellent agreement with observed breaks, even when the evolution is purelycollisionless. disk scale-lengths increase even when the total disk angularmomentum is conserved; thus mapping halo angular momenta to scale-lengths isnon-trivial.

astro-ph;0510284	high-resolution simulations of the final assembly of earth-like planets  1: terrestrial accretion and dynamics	the final stage in the formation of terrestrial planets consists of theaccumulation of ~1000-km ``planetary embryos'' and a swarm of billions of 1-10km ``planetesimals.'' during this process, water-rich material is accreted bythe terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies from beyond roughly2.5 au. we present results from five high-resolution dynamical simulations.these start from 1000-2000 embryos and planetesimals, roughly 5-10 times moreparticles than in previous simulations.  each simulation formed 2-4 terrestrial planets with masses between 0.4 and2.6 earth masses. the eccentricities of most planets were ~0.05, lower than inprevious simulations, but still higher than for venus, earth and mars. eachplanet accreted at least the earth's current water budget.  we demonstrate several new aspects of the accretion process: 1) the feedingzones of terrestrial planets change in time, widening and moving outward. evenin the presence of jupiter, water-rich material from beyond 2.5 au is notaccreted for several millions of years. 2) even in the absence of secularresonances, the asteroid belt is cleared of &gt;99% of its original mass byself-scattering of bodies into resonances with jupiter. 3) if planetary embryosform relatively slowly, following the models of kokubo &amp; ida, then theformation of embryos in the asteroid belt may have been stunted by the presenceof jupiter. 4) self-interacting planetesimals feel dynamical friction fromother small bodies, which has important effects on the eccentricity evolutionand outcome of a simulation.

astro-ph;0510285	high-resolution simulations of the final assembly of earth-like planets  2: water delivery and planetary habitability	the water content and habitability of terrestrial planets are determinedduring their final assembly, from perhaps a hundred 1000-km "planetary embryos"and a swarm of billions of 1-10 km "planetesimals." during this process, weassume that water-rich material is accreted by terrestrial planets via impactsof water-rich bodies that originate in the outer asteroid region. we presentanalysis of water delivery and planetary habitability in five high-resolutionsimulations containing about ten times more particles than in previoussimulations (raymond et al 2006a, icarus, 183, 265-282). these simulationsformed 15 terrestrial planets from 0.4 to 2.6 earth masses, including fiveplanets in the habitable zone. every planet from each simulation accreted atleast the earth's current water budget; most accreted several times that amount(assuming no impact depletion). each planet accreted at least five water-richembryos and planetesimals from past 2.5 au; most accreted 10-20 water-richbodies.  we present a new model for water delivery to terrestrial planets indynamically calm systems, with low-eccentricity or low-mass giant planets --such systems may be very common in the galaxy. we suggest that water isaccreted in comparable amounts from a few planetary embryos in a "hit or miss"way and from millions of planetesimals in a statistically robust process.variations in water content are likely to be caused by fluctuations in thenumber of water-rich embryos accreted, as well as from systematic effects suchas planetary mass and location, and giant planet properties.

astro-ph;0602003	the age dependence of galaxy clustering	we construct mock galaxy catalogues to analyse clustering properties of alambda cold dark matter (lcdm) universe within a cosmological dark mattersimulation of sufficient resolution to resolve structure down to the scale ofdwarfs. we show that there is a strong age-clustering correlation for objectslikely to host luminous galaxies, which includes the satellite halo (subhalo)population. older mock galaxies are significantly more clustered in ourcatalog, which consists of satellite haloes as well as the central peaks ofdiscrete haloes, selected solely by peak circular velocity. this age dependenceis caused mainly by the age-clustering relation for discrete haloes, recentlyfound by gao et al., acting mostly on field members, combined with the tendencyfor older mock galaxies to lie within groups and clusters, where galaxyclustering is enhanced. our results suggest that the clustering age dependenceis manifested in real galaxies. at small scales (less than ~5 mpc/h), the verysimple assumption that galaxy colour depends solely on halo age is inconsistentwith the strength of the observed clustering colour trends, where red galaxiesbecome increasingly more clustered than blue galaxies toward smaller scales,suggesting that luminosity weighted galaxy ages do not closely trace theassembly epoch of their dark matter hosts. the age dependence is present but ismuch weaker for satellite haloes lying within groups and clusters than for theglobal population.

astro-ph;0602029	multi-scale simulations of merging galaxies with supermassive black  holes	we present the results of the first multi-scale n-body+sph simulations ofmerging galaxies containing central supermassive black holes (smbhs) and havinga spatial resolution of only a few parsecs. strong gas inflows associated withequal-mass mergers produce non-axisymmetric nuclear disks with masses of order$10^9 m_{\odot}$, resolved by about $10^6$ sph particles. such disks have sizesof several hundred parsecs but most of their mass is concentrated within lessthan $50$ pc. we find that a close smbh pair forms after the merger. theseparation of the two smbhs then shrinks further owing to dynamical frictionagainst the predominantly gaseous background. the orbits of the smbhs decaydown to the minimum resolvable scale in a few million years for an ambient gastemperature and density typical of a region undergoing a starburst. theseresults suggest the initial conditions necessary for the eventual coalescenceof the two holes arise naturally from the merging of two equal-mass galaxieswhose structure and orbits are consistent with the predictions of the$\lambda$cdm model. our findings have important implications for plannedgravitational wave detection experiments such as {\it lisa}.

astro-ph;0603179	gravitational instabilities in gaseous protoplanetary disks and  implications for giant planet formation	protoplanetary gas disks are likely to experience gravitational instabilites(gi's) during some phase of their evolution. density perturbations in anunstable disk grow on a dynamic time scale into spiral arms that produceefficient outward transfer of angular momentum and inward transfer of massthrough gravitational torques. in a cool disk with rapid enough cooling, thespiral arms in an unstable disk form self-gravitating clumps. whether gas giantprotoplanets can form by such a disk instability process is the primaryquestion addressed by this review. we discuss the wide range of calculationsundertaken by ourselves and others using various numerical techniques, and wereport preliminary results from a large multi-code collaboration. additionaltopics include -- triggering mechanisms for gi's, disk heating and cooling,orbital survival of dense clumps, interactions of solids with gi-driven wavesand shocks, and hybrid scenarios where gi's facilitate core accretion. thereview ends with a discussion of how well disk instability and core accretionfare in meeting observational constraints.

astro-ph;0606361	fragmentation of gravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks  with radiative transfer	we report on the results of the first 3d sph simulation of massive,gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks with radiative transfer. we adopta flux-limited diffusion scheme justified by the high opacity of most of thedisk. the optically thin surface of the disk cools as a blackbody. the disksgrow slowly in mass starting from a toomre-stable initial condition to thepoint at which they become marginally unstable. we find that gravitationallybound clumps with masses close to a jupiter mass can arise. fragmentationappears to be driven by vertical convective-like motions capable oftransporting the heat from the disk midplane to its surface on a timescale ofonly about 40 years at 10 au. a larger or smaller cooling efficiency of thedisk at the optically thin surface can promote or stifle fragmentation byaffecting the vertical temperature profile, which determines whether convectioncan happen or not, and by regulating the accretion flow from optically thinregions towards overdense regions. we also find that the chances offragmentation increase for a higher mean molecular weight $\mu$ sincecompressional heating is reduced. around a star with mass $1 m_{\odot}$ onlydisks with $\mu \ge 2.4$, as expected for gas with a metallicity comparable tosolar or higher, fragment. this suggests that disk instability, likecore-accretion, should be more effective in forming gas giants at higher gasmetallicities, consistent with the observed correlation between metallicity ofthe planet-hosting stars and frequency of planets

astro-ph;0608560	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - i. dynamical evolution  and emergent transient structures	we report on the analysis of a suite of sph simulations (incorporatingcooling and star formation) of mergers involving idealised x-ray clusters whoseinitial conditions resemble relaxed clusters with cool compact cores observedby chandra and xmm. the simulations sample the most interesting, theoreticallyplausible, range of impact parameters and progenitor mass ratios. we find thatall mergers evolve via a common progression. we illustrate this progression inthe projected gas density, x-ray surface brightness, sz, temperature, and gasentropy maps. several different classes of transient ``cold front''-likefeatures can arise over the course of a merger. we find that all of theseclasses are present in chandra and xmm observations of merging systems andpropose a naming scheme for these features: ``comet-like'' tails, bridges,plumes, streams and edges. in none of the cases considered do the initial coolcompact cores of the primary and the secondary get destroyed during the courseof the mergers. we quantify the evolving morphology of our mergers usingcentroid variance, power ratios and offset between the x-ray and the projectedmass maps. we find that the centroid variance best captures the dynamical stateof the cluster. placing the system at z=0.1, we find that all easily identifiedobservable traces of the secondary disappear from a simulated 50 ks chandraimage following the second pericentric passage. the system, however, takesapproximately 2 additional gyrs to relax and virialize. temperaturefluctuations at the level of 20% can persist in the final systems well past thepoint of virialization, suggesting that that the existence of temperaturefluctuations, in and of themselves, do not necessarily indicate a disturbed orunrelaxed system.

astro-ph;0701586	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - ii. effects on global  x-ray and sz properties and their scaling relations	we use the suite of simulations presented in poole et al (2006) to examineglobal x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) observables for systems of mergingrelaxed x-ray clusters. in all of the scaling relations generated from theproperties we have studied, we observe a generic evolution (in good qualitativeagreement with previous authors): a rapid transient roughly along the massscaling relations, a subsequent slow drift across the scatter untilvirialization, followed by a slow evolution along and up the mass scalingrelations as cooling recovers in the cluster cores. however, this drift is notsufficient to account for the observed scatter in the scaling relations. wealso study the effects of mergers on several theoretical temperature measuresof the intracluster medium: emission weighted measures (t_ew), thespectroscopic-like measure proposed by mazzotta et al (2004; t_sl) and plasmamodel fits to the integrated spectrum of the system (t_spec). we find that t_sltracks t_spec for the entire duration of our mergers, illustrating that itremains a good tool for observational comparison even for highly disturbedsystems. furthermore, the transient temperature increases produced during firstand second pericentric passage are 15-40% larger for t_ew than for t_sl ort_spec. this suggests that the effects of transient temperature increases onsigma_8 and omega_m derived by randall et al (2002) are over estimated. lastly,we examine the x-ray sz proxy proposed by kravtsov et al (2006) and find thatthe tight mass scaling relation they predict remains secure through the entireduration of a merger event, independent of projection effects.

astro-ph;9509128	photoionization and the formation of dwarf galaxies	it has been argued that a uv photoionizing background radiation fieldsuppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies, and may even inhibit the formationof larger galaxies. in order to test this, we present gas-dynamical simulationsof the formation of small objects in a cdm universe with and without aphotoionizing background. the objects are selected from a collisionlesssimulation at a redshift of 2.4, and rerun at higher resolution including theeffects of gas dynamics and using a hierarchical grid of particles. fiveobjects, each with a circular speed of 46 km/sec are simulated. the presence ofthe photoionizing background has only a small effect on the amount of gas thatcollapses in these objects, reducing the amount of cold collapsed gas by atmost 30%. analysis of the smaller objects found in the higher resolutionsimulation indicates that the photoionizing background only significantlyaffects the formation of objects with a virialized halo mass less than 10^9soalr masses and circular speeds less than 23 km/sec. however, the ionizationbalance is greatly changed by the presence of the background radiation field.typical lines of sight through the objects have 4 orders of magnitude lessneutral hydrogen column density when the photoionizing background is included.

astro-ph;9710043	time stepping n-body simulations	leapfrog integration has been the method of choice in n-body simulationsowing to its low computational cost for a symplectic integrator with secondorder accuracy. we introduce a new leapfrog integrator that allows for variabletimesteps for each particle in large n-body simulations. tests with singleparticles in fixed potentials show that it behaves as a symplectic integrator.  we then examine the results of both standard leapfrog and our temporallyadaptive leapfrog on full n-body integrations of clusters and large scalestructure establishing accuracy criteria for both methods. the adaptive methodshows significant speed-ups over single step integrations---but the integratorno longer appears to be symplectic or, in the case of large scale structuresimulations, accurate. this loss of accuracy appears to be caused by the waythat the timestep is chosen, not by the integrator itself. we present a relatedintegration technique that does retain sufficient accuracy. although it is notsymplectic, it is apparently better than previous implementations and is ourcurrent integrator of choice for large astrophysical simulations. we also notethat the standard leapfrog difference equations used in cosmological n-bodyintegrations in comoving coordinates are not symplectic. we derive animplementation of leapfrog that is in comoving canonical coordinates to correctfor this deficiency.

astro-ph;9801192	dark matter halos within clusters	we examine the properties of dark matter halos within a rich galaxy clusterusing a high resolution simulation that captures the cosmological context of acold dark matter universe. the mass and force resolution permit the resolutionof 150 halos with circular velocities larger than 80 kms within the cluster'svirial radius of 2 mpc. this enables an unprecedented study of the statisticalproperties of a large sample of dark matter halos evolving in a denseenvironment. the cumulative fraction of mass attached to these halos variesfrom 0% at 200 kpc, to 13% at the virial radius. even at this resolution theovermerging problem persists; halos that pass within 200 kpc of the clustercenter are tidally disrupted. additional substructure is lost at earlier epochswithin the massive progenitor halos. the median ratio of apocentric topericentric radii is 6:1; the orbital distribution is close to isotropic,circular orbits are rare, radial orbits are common. the orbits of halos areunbiased with respect to both position within the cluster and with the orbitsof the smooth dark matter background and no velocity bias is detected. thetidal radii of surviving halos are generally well-fit using the simple analyticprediction applied to their orbital pericenters. halos within clusters havehigher concentrations than those in the field. within the cluster, halo densityprofiles can be modified by tidal forces and individual encounters with otherhalos that cause significant mass loss - ``galaxy harassment''. mergers betweenhalos do not occur inside the clusters virial radius.

astro-ph;9810190	n-point correlations in cdm and $\omega$cdm simulations	higher order statistics are investigated in ($\omega$)cdm universes byanalyzing $500\mpc$ high resolution tree n-body simulations with both $\omega =1$, and $\omega &lt; 1$. the amplitudes of the n-point correlation functions arecalculated from moments of counts-in-cells determined by a pair of newalgorithms especially developed for large simulations. this approach enablesmassive oversampling with $\simeq 10^{9-14}$ cells for accurate determinationof factorial moments from up to 47 million particles in the scale range of $8\kpc - 125\mpc$. thorough investigation shows that there are three scale rangesin the simulations: $\ge 8\mpc$, weakly non-linear regime, where perturbationtheory applies with utmost precision, $1\mpc - 8\mpc$, the non-linear plateau,and finally $\le 1\mpc$, a regime where dynamical discreteness effects dominatethe higher order statistics. in the physically relevant range of$1\mpc-125\mpc$ the results i) confirm the validity of perturbation theory inthe weakly non-linear regime, ii) establish the existence of a plateau in thehighly non-linear regime similar to the one observed in scale free simulationsiii) show extended perturbation theory to be an excellent approximation for thenon-linear regime iv) find the time dependence of the $s_n$'s to be negligiblein both regimes v) in comparison with similar measurements in the edsgc survey,strongly support $\omega &lt; 1$ with no biasing vi) show that the formulae ofszapudi &amp; colombi (1996) provide a good approximation for errors on higherorder statistics measured in n-body simulations.

astro-ph;9811127	on the survival and destruction of spiral galaxies in clusters	we follow the evolution of disk galaxies within a cluster that formshierarchically in a cold dark matter n-body simulation. at a redshift z=0.5 weselect several dark matter halos that have quiet merger histories and are aboutto enter the newly forming cluster environment. the halos are replaced withequilibrium high resolution model spirals that are constructed to representexamples of low surface brightness (lsb) and high surface brightness (hsb)galaxies. varying the disk and halo structural parameters reveals that theresponse of a spiral galaxy to tidal encounters depends primarily on thepotential depth of the mass distribution and the disk scale length. lsbgalaxies, characterised by slowly rising rotation curves and large scalelengths, evolve dramatically under the influence of rapid encounters withsubstructure and strong tidal shocks from the global cluster potential ---galaxy harassment. we find that up to 90% of their stars are tidally strippedand congregate in large diffuse tails that trace the orbital path of the galaxyand form the diffuse intra-cluster light. the bound stellar remnants closelyresemble the dwarf spheroidals (de's) that populate nearby clusters. hsbgalaxies are stable to the chaos of cluster formation and tidal encounters.these disks lie well within the tidally limited dark matter halos and theirpotentials are more concentrated. although very few stars are stripped, thescale height of the disks increases substantially and no spiral featuresremain, therefore we speculate that these galaxies would be identified as s0galaxies in present day clusters.

0811.0615	pairing of supermassive black holes in unequal-mass galaxy mergers	we examine the pairing process of supermassive black holes (smbhs) down toscales of 20-100 pc using a set of n-body/sph simulations of binary mergers ofdisk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:4 and 1:10. our numerical experiments aredesigned to represent merger events occurring at various cosmic epochs. theinitial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the lambdacdm paradigmof structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiativecooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback. we find that the pairing ofsmbhs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in thecenter of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. inparticular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and star formation, we findthat a pair of smbhs can form in 1:10 minor mergers provided that galaxies arerelatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that themergers occur at relatively high redshift (z~3), when dynamical frictiontimescales are shorter. since 1:10 mergers are most common events during theassembly of galaxies, and mergers are more frequent at high redshift whengalaxies are also more gas-rich, our results have positive implications forfuture gravitational wave experiments such as the laser interferometer spaceantenna.
