0901.0915	a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in starbursts as an  explanation for the high mass-to-light ratios of ultra compact dwarf galaxies	it has been shown recently that the dynamical v-band mass-to-light ratios ofcompact stellar systems with masses from 10^6 to 10^8 solar masses are notconsistent with the predictions from simple stellar population (ssp) models.top-heavy stellar initial mass functions (imfs) in these so-called ultracompact dwarf galaxies (ucds) offer an attractive explanation for this finding,the stellar remnants and retained stellar envelopes providing the unseen mass.we therefore construct a model which quantifies by how much the imfs of ucdswould have to deviate in the intermediate-mass and high-mass range from thecanonical imf in order to account for the enhanced m/l_v ratio of the ucds. thededuced high-mass imf in the ucds depends on the age of the ucds and the numberof faint products of stellar evolution retained by them. assuming that the imfin the ucds is a three-part power-law equal to the canonical imf in thelow-mass range and taking 20% as a plausible choice for the fraction of theremnants of high-mass stars retained by ucds, the model suggests the exponentof the high-mass imf to be approximately 1.6 if the ucds are 13 gyr old (i.e.almost as old as the universe) or approximately 1.0 if the ucds are 7 gyr old,in contrast to 2.3 for the salpeter-massey imf. if the imf was as top-heavy assuggested here, the stability of the ucds might have been threatened by heavymass loss induced by the radiation and evolution of massive stars. the centraldensities of ucds must have been in the range 10^6 to 10^7 solar masses percubic parsec when they formed with star formation rates of 10 to 100 solarmasses per year.

0706.1976	tidal dwarf galaxies as a test of fundamental physics	within the cold dark matter (cdm) framework tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs)cannot contain dark matter, so the recent results by bournaud et al. (2007)that 3 rotating tdgs do show significant evidence for being dark matterdominated is inconsistent with the current concordance cosmological theoryunless yet another dark matter component is postulated. we confirm that the tdgrotation curves are consistent with newtonian dynamics only if either anadditional dark matter component is postulated, or if all 3 tdgs happen to beviewed nearly edge-on, which is unlikely given the geometry of the tidaldebris. we also find that the observed rotation curves are very naturallyexplained without any free parameters within the modified newtonian dynamics(mond) framework if inclinations are adopted as derived by bournaud et al. weexplore different inclination angles and two different assumptions about theexternal field effect. the results do not change significantly, and we concludetherefore that newtonian dynamics has severe problems while mond doesexceedingly well in explaining the observed rotation curves of the 3 tdgsstudied by bournaud et al.

0903.4448	testing fundamental physics with distant star clusters: analysis of  observational data on palomar 14	we use the distant outer halo globular cluster palomar 14 as a test case forclassical vs. modified newtonian dynamics (mond). previous theoreticalcalculations have shown that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion predicted bythese theories can differ by up to a factor of three for such sparse, remoteclusters like pal 14. we determine the line-of-sight velocity dispersion ofpalomar 14 by measuring radial velocities of 17 red giant cluster membersobtained using the very large telescope (vlt) and keck telescope. the systemicvelocity of palomar 14 is (72.28+-0.12)km/s. the derived velocity dispersion of(0.38+-0.12)km/s of the 16 definite member stars is in agreement with thetheoretical prediction for the classical newtonian case according to baumgardtet al. (2005). in order to exclude the possibility that a peculiar massfunction might have influenced our measurements, we derived the cluster's mainsequence mass function down to 0.53msolar using archival images obtained withthe hubble space telescope. we found a mass function slope of 1.27+-0.44, whichis, compared to the canonical mass function, a significantly shallower slope.the derived lower limit on the cluster's mass is higher than the theoreticallypredicted mass in case of mond. our data are consistent with a central densityof 0.1 msolar pc^-3. we need no dark matter in palomar 14. if the cluster is ona circular orbit, our spectroscopic and photometric results argue against mond,unless this cluster experienced significant mass loss.

0905.0399	merging time-scales of stellar sub-clumps in young star-forming regions	recent observations and hydrodynamical simulations of star formation inside agiant molecular cloud have revealed that, within a star forming region, starsdo not form evenly distributed throughout this region, but rather in smallsub-clumps. it is generally believed that these sub-clumps merge and form ayoung star cluster. the time-scale of this merging process is crucial for theevolution and the possible survival of the final star cluster. the key issue iswhether this merging process happens faster than the time needed to remove theresidual gas of the cloud. a merging time-scale shorter than the gas-removaltime would enhance the survival chances of the resulting star cluster. in thispaper we show by means of numerical simulations that the time-scale of themerging is indeed very fast. depending on the details of the initial sub-clumpdistribution, the merging may occur before the gas is expelled from thenewly-formed cluster either via supernovae or the winds from massive stars. oursimulations further show that the resulting merger-objects have a highereffective star formation efficiency than the overall star forming region andconfirm the results that mass-segregated sub-clumps form mass-segregatedmerger-objects.

0906.1146	density profiles of dark matter haloes on galactic and cluster scales	in the present paper, we improve the "extended secondary infall model" (esim)of williams et al. (2004) to obtain further insights on the cusp/core problem.the model takes into account the effect of ordered and random angular momentum,dynamical friction and baryon adiabatic contraction in order to obtain asecondary infall model more close to the collapse reality. the model is appliedto structures on galactic scales (normal and dwarf spiral galaxies) and oncluster of galaxies scales. the results obtained suggest that angular momentumand dynamical friction are able, on galactic scales, to overcome the competingeffect of adiabatic contraction eliminating the cusp. the nfw profile can bereobtained, in our model only if the system is constituted just by dark matterand the magnitude of angular momentum and dynamical friction are reduced withrespect to the values predicted by the model itself. the rotation curves offour lsb galaxies from de blok &amp; bosma (2002) are compared to the rotationcurves obtained by the model in the present paper obtaining a good fit to theobservational data. on scales smaller than $\simeq 10^{11} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$the slope $\alpha \simeq 0$ and on cluster scales we observe a similarevolution of the dark matter density profile but in this case the densityprofile slope flattens to $\alpha \simeq 0.6$ for a cluster of $\simeq 10^{14}h^{-1} m_{\odot}$. the total mass profile, differently from that of darkmatter, shows a central cusp well fitted by a nfw model.

0906.2457	angular momentum transfer and the size - mass relation in early - type  galaxies	early - type galaxies (etgs) define a narrow strip in the size - mass planebecause of the observed correlation between the effective radius $r_{eff}$ andthe total stellar mass $m_{\star}$. when expressed in logarithmic units, alinear relation, $\log{r_{eff}} \propto \gamma \log{m_{\star}}$, is indeedobservationally found, but the slope $\gamma$ deviates from the canonical$\gamma = 1/2$ value which can be naively predicted for a spherically symmetricisotropic system. we propose here that a transfer of angular momentum to thestellar component induces an anisotropy in the velocity space thus leading to amodified distribution function (df). assuming an osipkov - merritt likeanisotropic df, we derive an analytic relation between the slope $\gamma$ ofthe size - mass relation and the slope $\alpha$ of the angular momentum term inthe df. with this simple model, we are then able to recover the observed$\gamma$ value provided $\alpha$ is suitably set. it turns out that ananisotropy profile which is tangential inside $\sim 0.6 r_a$ and radialoutside, with $r_a$ the anisotropy radius, is able to reproduce the observedsize - mass relation observed for massive ($m_{\star} \ge 2 \times 10^{10} \h^{-1} {\rm m}_{\odot}$) elliptical galaxies.

0909.1555	the relation between the most-massive star and its parental star cluster  mass	we present a thorough literature study of the most-massive star, m_max, inseveral young star clusters in order to assess whether or not star clusters arepopulated from the stellar initial mass function (imf) by random sampling overthe mass range 0.01 &lt; m &lt; 150 m_sol without being constrained by the clustermass, m_ecl. the data reveal a partition of the sample into lowest mass objects(m_ecl &lt; 10^2 m_sol), moderate mass clusters (10^2 m_sol &lt; m_ecl &lt; 10^3 m_sol)and rich clusters above 10^3 m_sol. additionally, there is a plateau of aconstant maximal star mass (m_max ~ 25 m_sol) for clusters with masses between10^3 m_sol and 4 10^3 m_sol. statistical tests of this data set reveal that thehypothesis of random sampling from the imf between 0.01 and 150 m_sol is highlyunlikely for star clusters more massive than 10^2 m_sol with a probability of p~ 2 10^-7 for the objects with m_ecl between 10^2 m_sol and 10^3 m_sol and p ~3 10^-9 for the more massive star clusters. also, the spread of m_max values ata given m_ecl is smaller than expected from random sampling. we suggest thatthe basic physical process able to explain this dependence of stellar inventoryof a star cluster on its mass may be the interplay between stellar feedback andthe binding energy of the cluster-forming molecular cloud core. given theseresults, it would follow that an integrated galactic initial mass function(igimf) sampled from such clusters would automatically be steeper in comparisonto the imf within individual star clusters.

0909.2619	tidal tails of star clusters	based on recent findings of a formation mechanism of substructure in tidaltails by kuepper, macleod &amp; heggie (2008) we investigate a more comprehensiveset of n-body models of star clusters on orbits about a milky-way-likepotential. we find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in anytidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the clusterlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.  the distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the clustercentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and thestrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,while for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causinga periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distanceoscillate with time. we provide an approximation for estimating the distance ofthe overdensities in this case.  we describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidaltails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal fieldon the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. moreover, we conclude that apericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensitywithin a tidal tail. escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take placeimmediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over theorbit of the cluster. all observable overdensities are therefore of thementioned two types. in particular, we note that substructured tidal tails donot imply the existence of dark-matter sub-structures in the haloes ofgalaxies.

0912.2998	mass-loss and expansion of ultra compact dwarf galaxies through gas  expulsion and stellar evolution for top-heavy stellar initial mass functions	(abridged) the dynamical v-band mass-to-light ratios of ultra compact dwarfgalaxies (ucds) are higher than predicted by simple stellar population modelswith the canonical stellar initial mass function (imf). one way to explain thisfinding is a top-heavy imf, so that the unseen mass is provided by additionalremnants of high-mass stars. a possible explanation for why the imf in ucdscould be top-heavy while this is not the case in less massive stellar systemsis that encounters between proto-stars and stars become probable in formingmassive systems. however, the required number of additional stellar remnantsproves to be rather high, which raises the question of how their progenitorswould affect the early evolution of a ucd. we have therefore calculated thefirst 200 myr of the evolution of the ucds, using the particle-mesh codesuperbox. it is assumed that the stellar populations of ucds were created in aninitial starburst, which implies heavy mass loss during the followingapproximately 40 myr due to primordial gas expulsion and supernova explosions.we find at the end of the simulations for various initial conditions and(tabulated) mass-loss histories objects that roughly resemble ucds. thus, theexistence of ucds does not contradict the notion that their stellar populationsformed rapidly and with a top-heavy imf. we find tentative evidence that theucds may have had densities as high as 10^8 m_sun/pc^3 at birth.

1001.3969	the formation of very wide binaries during the star cluster dissolution  phase	over the past few decades, numerous wide (&gt;1000 au) binaries in the galacticfield and halo have been discovered. their existence cannot be explained by theprocess of star formation or by dynamical interactions in the field, and theirorigin has long been a mystery. we explain the origin of these wide binaries byformation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initiallyunbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase-space issmall. using n-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binaryfraction in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1 pc for individual clustersis 1-30%, depending on the initial conditions. the existence of numerous widebinaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that mostclusters start out with a large degree of substructure. the wide binaryfraction decreases strongly with increasing cluster mass, and the semi-majoraxis of the newly formed binaries is determined by the initial cluster size.the resulting eccentricity distribution is thermal, and the mass ratiodistribution is consistent with gravitationally-focused random pairing. as alarge fraction of the stars form in primordial binaries, we predict that alarge number of the observed 'wide binaries' are in fact triple or quadruplesystems. by integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution, we predicta binary fraction of a few per cent in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1pc in the galactic field, which is smaller than the observed wide binaryfraction. however, this discrepancy may be solved when we consider a broadrange of cluster morphologies.

1002.4401	properties of hierarchically forming star clusters	we undertake a systematic analysis of the early (&lt; 0.5 myr) evolution ofclustering and the stellar initial mass function in turbulent fragmentationsimulations. these large scale simulations for the first time offer theopportunity for a statistical analysis of imf variations and correlationsbetween stellar properties and cluster richness. the typical evolutionaryscenario involves star formation in small-n clusters which then progressivelymerge; the first stars to form are seeds of massive stars and achieve aheadstart in mass acquisition. these massive seeds end up in the cores ofclusters and a large fraction of new stars of lower mass is formed in the outerparts of the clusters. the resulting clusters are therefore mass segregated atan age of 0.5 myr, although the signature of mass segregation is weakenedduring mergers. we find that the resulting imf has a smaller exponent(alpha=1.8-2.2) than the salpeter value (alpha=2.35). the imfs in subclustersare truncated at masses only somewhat larger than the most massive stars (whichdepends on the richness of the cluster) and an universal upper mass limit of150 msun is ruled out. we also find that the simulations show signs of theigimf effect proposed by weidner &amp; kroupa, where the frequency of massive starsis suppressed in the integrated imf compared to the imf in individual clusters.we identify clusters through the use of a minimum spanning tree algorithm whichallows easy comparison between observational survey data and the predictions ofturbulent fragmentation models. in particular we present quantitativepredictions regarding properties such as cluster morphology, degree of masssegregation, upper slope of the imf and the relation between cluster richnessand maximum stellar mass.

1003.5921	evolution of two stellar populations in globular clusters ii. effects of  primordial gas expulsion	we investigate the early evolution of two distinct populations of low-massstars in globular clusters under the influence of primordial gas expulsiondriven by supernovae to study if this process can increase the fraction ofsecond generation stars at the level required by observations. we analysen-body models that take into account the effect of primordial gas expulsion. wedivide the stars into two populations which mimic the chemical and dynamicalproperties of stars in globular clusters so that second generation stars startwith a more centrally concentrated distribution. the main effect of gasexpulsion is to eject preferentially first generation stars while secondgeneration stars remain bound to the cluster. in the most favourable casessecond generation stars can account for 60% of the bound stars we see today. wealso find that at the end of the gas expulsion phase, the radial distributionof the two populations is still different, so that long-term evolution willfurther increase the fraction of second generation stars. the large fraction ofchemically anomalous stars is readily explainable as a second generation ofstars formed out of the slow winds of rapidly rotating massive stars ifglobular clusters suffer explosive residual gas expulsion for a star formationefficiency of about 0.33.

1004.0832	effects of the integrated galactic imf on the chemical evolution of the  solar neighbourhood	the initial mass function determines the fraction of stars of differentintial mass born per stellar generation. in this paper, we test the effects ofthe integrated galactic initial mass function (igimf) on the chemical evolutionof the solar neighbourhood. the igimf (weidner &amp; kroupa 2005) is computed fromthe combination of the stellar intial mass function (imf), i.e. the massfunction of single star clusters, and the embedded cluster mass function, i.e.a power law with index beta. by taking into account also the fact that themaximum achievable stellar mass is a function of the total mass of the cluster,the igimf becomes a time-varying imf which depends on the star formation rate.we applied this formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solarneighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possiblevalues for beta with the results obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,constant imf. in general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatterigimf, hence a larger number of massive stars and larger metal ejection rates.this translates into higher type ia and ii supernova rates, higher massejection rates from massive stars and a larger amount of gas available for starformation, coupled with lower present-day stellar mass densities. (abridged) wealso discuss the importance of the present day stellar mass function (pdmf) inproviding a way to disentangle among various assumptions for beta. our resultsindicate that the model adopting the igimf computed with beta ~2 should beconsidered the best since it allows us to reproduce the observed pdmf and toaccount for most of the chemical evolution constraints considered in this work.

1005.4677	peculiarities in velocity dispersion and surface density profiles of  star clusters	based on our recent work on tidal tails of star clusters (kuepper et al.2009) we investigate star clusters of a few 10^4 msun by means of velocitydispersion profiles and surface density profiles. we use a comprehensive set of$n$-body computations of star clusters on various orbits within a realistictidal field to study the evolution of these profiles with time, and ongoingcluster dissolution from the velocity dispersion profiles we find that thepopulation of potential escapers, i.e. energetically unbound stars inside thejacobi radius, dominates clusters at radii above about 50% of the jacobiradius. beyond 70% of the jacobi radius nearly all stars are energeticallyunbound. the velocity dispersion therefore significantly deviates from thepredictions of simple equilibrium models in this regime. we furthermore arguethat for this reason this part of a cluster cannot be used to detect a darkmatter halo or deviations from newtonian gravity. by fitting templates to theabout 10^4 computed surface density profiles we estimate the accuracy which canbe achieved in reconstructing the jacobi radius of a cluster in this way. wefind that the template of king (1962) works well for extended clusters onnearly circular orbits, but shows significant flaws in the case of eccentriccluster orbits. this we fix by extending this template with 3 more freeparameters. our template can reconstruct the tidal radius over all fittedranges with an accuracy of about 10%, and is especially useful in the case ofcluster data with a wide radial coverage and for clusters showing significantextra-tidal stellar populations. no other template that we have tried can yieldcomparable results over this range of cluster conditions. all templates fail toreconstruct tidal parameters of concentrated clusters, however.

1012.3163	the curious case of palomar 13: the influence of the orbital phase on  the appearance of galactic satellites	we investigate the dynamical status of the low-mass globular cluster palomar13 by means of n-body computations to test whether its unusually highmass-to-light ratio of about 40 and its peculiarly shallow surface densityprofile can be caused by tidal shocking. alternatively, we test - by varyingthe assumed proper motion - if the orbital phase of palomar 13 within its orbitabout the milky way can influence its appearance and thus may be the origin ofthese peculiarities, as has been suggested by kuepper et al. (2010). we findthat, of these two scenarios, only the latter can explain the observedmass-to-light ratio and surface density profile. we note, however, that theparticular orbit that best reproduces those observed parameters has a propermotion inconsistent with the available literature value. we discuss thisdiscrepancy and suggest that it may be caused by an underestimation of theobservational uncertainties in the proper motion determination. we demonstratethat palomar 13 is most likely near apogalacticon, which makes the clusterappear supervirial and blown-up due to orbital compression of its tidal debris.since the satellites of the milky way are on average closer to apo- thanperigalacticon, their internal dynamics may be influenced by the same effect,and we advocate that this needs to be taken into account when interpretingtheir kinematical data. moreover, we briefly discuss the influence of apossible binary population on such measurements.

1101.1306	a new formation scenario for the milky way cluster ngc2419	we present a new formation scenario for ngc2419, which is one of the mostluminous,one of the most distant, and as well one of the most extended globularclusters of the milky way. we propose that ngc2419 is the remnant of a mergedstar cluster complex, which was possibly formed during an interaction between agas-rich galaxy and the milky way. to test this hypothesis, we performednumerical simulations of 27 different models of star cluster complexes (ccs)moving on a highly eccentric orbit in the galactic halo. we vary the cc mass,the cc size, and the initial distribution of star clusters in the cc to analyzethe influence of these parameters on the resulting objects. in all cases, thevast majority of star clusters merged into a stable object. the derivedparameters mass, absolute v-band magnitude, effective radius, velocitydispersion and the surface brightness profile are, for a number of models, ingood agreement with those observed for ngc2419. despite the large range of ccsizes, the effective radii of the merger objects are constrained to arelatively small interval. a turnover in the r_eff vs. m_encl space leads todegenerate states, i.e. relatively compact ccs can produce an object with thesame structural parameters as a more massive and larger cc. in consequence, arange of initial conditions can form a merger object comparable to ngc2419preventing us to pinpoint the exact parameters of the original cc, which formedngc2419. we conclude that ngc2419 can be well explained by the merged clustercomplex scenario. some of the recently discovered stellar streams in thegalactic halo might be related to the parent galaxy, which produced the clustercomplex in our scenario. measurements of the proper motion of ngc2419 arenecessary to prove an association with one of the stellar streams.

1103.5459	popping star clusters as building blocks of the milky way thick disc	it is widely believed that star clusters form with low star formationefficiencies. with the onset of stellar winds by massive stars or finally whenthe first super nova blows off, the residual gas is driven out of the embeddedstar cluster. due to this fact a large amount, if not all, of the stars becomeunbound and disperse in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. in thiscontext, kroupa (2002) suggested a new mechanism for the emergence of thickenedgalactic discs. massive star clusters add kinematically hot components to thegalactic field populations, building up in this way, the galactic thick disc aswell. in this work we perform, for the first time, numerical simulations toinvestigate this scenario for the formation of the galactic discs of the milkyway. we find that a significant kinematically hot population of stars may beinjected into the disk of a galaxy such that a thick disk emerges. for the mwthe star clusters that formed the thick disk must have had masses of about 10^6msol.

1106.2804	making counter-orbiting tidal debris: the origin of the milky way disc  of satellites	using stellar-dynamical calculations it is shown for the first time thatcounter-orbiting material emerges naturally in tidal interactions of discgalaxies. model particles on both pro- and retrograde orbits can be formed astidal debris in single encounters with disc galaxies of 1-to-1 and 4-to-1 massratios. a total of 74 model calculations are performed for a range of differentinitial parameters. interactions include fly-by and merger cases. the fractionof counter-orbiting material produced varies over a wide range (from a few upto 50 percent). all fly-by models show a similar two-phase behaviour, withretrograde material forming first. properties of the prograde and retrogradepopulations are extracted to make an observational discrimination possible.  during such encounters the tidal debris occupies a certain region in phasespace. in this material, tidal-dwarf galaxies may form. the modelling thereforecan explain why galaxies may have dwarf galaxies orbiting counter to the bulkof their dwarf galaxies. an example is the sculptor dwarf of the milky way,which orbits counter to the bulk of the disc of satellites. the modelling thussupports the scenario of the mw satellites being ancient tidal-dwarf galaxiesformed from gaseous material stripped from another galaxy during an encounterwith the young mw.  a possible candidate for this galaxy is identified as the magellanic cloudprogenitor galaxy. its angular motion fits the angular motion of the mw disc ofsatellites objects. this scenario is in agreement with lynden-bell's originalsuggestion for the origin of the dsph satellites and the near-unbound orbit ofthe lmc.

1108.4505	the origin of very wide binary stars	a large population of fragile, wide (&gt; 1000 au) binary systems exists in thegalactic field and halo. these wide binary stars cannot be primordial becauseof the high stellar density in star forming regions, while formation by capturein the galactic field is highly improbable. we propose that these binarysystems were formed during the dissolution phase of star clusters (seekouwenhoven et al. 2010, for details). stars escaping from a dissolving starcluster can have very similar velocities, which can lead to the formation of awide binary systems. we carry out n-body simulations to test this hypothesis.the results indicate that this mechanism explains the origin of wide binarysystems in the galaxy. the resulting wide binary fraction and semi-major axisdistribution depend on the initial conditions of the dissolving star cluster,while the distributions in eccentricity and mass ratio are universal. finally,since most stars are formed in (relatively tight) primordial binaries, wepredict that a large fraction of the wide "binary stars" are in facthigher-order multiple systems.

1109.2116	search for ob stars running away from young star clusters. ii. the ngc  6357 star-forming region	dynamical few-body encounters in the dense cores of young massive starclusters are responsible for the loss of a significant fraction of theirmassive stellar content. some of the escaping (runaway) stars move through theambient medium supersonically and can be revealed via detection of their bowshocks (visible in the infrared, optical or radio). in this paper, which is thesecond of a series of papers devoted to the search for ob stars running awayfrom young (several myr) galactic clusters and ob associations, we present theresults of the search for bow shocks around the star-forming region ngc 6357.using the archival data of the midcourse space experiment (msx) satellite andthe spitzer space telescope, and the preliminary data release of the wide-fieldinfrared survey explorer (wise), we discovered seven bow shocks, whose geometryis consistent with the possibility that they are generated by stars expelledfrom the young star clusters, pismis 24 and ah03 j1725-34.4, associated withngc 6357. two of the seven bow shocks are driven by the already known o stars.follow-up spectroscopy of three other bow shock-producing stars showed thatthey are o-type stars as well, while the 2mass photometry of the remaining twostars suggests that they could be b0 v stars, provided that both are located atthe same distance as ngc 6357. detection of numerous massive stars ejected fromthe very young clusters is consistent with the theoretical expectation thatstar clusters can effectively lose massive stars at the very beginning of theirdynamical evolution and lends strong support to the idea that probably allfield ob stars have been dynamically ejected from their birth clusters. aby-product of our search for bow shocks around ngc 6357 is the detection ofthree circular shells typical of luminous blue variable and late wn-typewolf-rayet stars.

1204.5176	the vpos: a vast polar structure of satellite galaxies, globular  clusters and streams around the milky way	it has been known for a long time that the satellite galaxies of the milkyway (mw) show a significant amount of phase-space correlation, they aredistributed in a highly inclined disc of satellites (dos). we have extended theprevious studies on the dos by analysing for the first time the orientations ofstreams of stars and gas, and the distributions of globular clusters within thehalo of the mw. it is shown that the spatial distribution of mw globularclusters classified as young halo clusters (yh gc) is very similar to the dos,while 7 of the 14 analysed streams align with the dos. the probability to findthe observed clustering of streams is only 0.3 per cent when assuming isotropy.the mw thus is surrounded by a vast polar structure (vpos) of subsystems(satellite galaxies, globular clusters and streams), spreading fromgalactocentric distances as small as 10 kpc out to 250 kpc. these findingsdemonstrate that a near-isotropic infall of cosmological sub-structurecomponents onto the mw is essentially ruled out because a large number ofinfalling objects would have had to be highly correlated, to a degree notnatural for dark matter sub-structures. the majority of satellites, streams andyh gcs had to be formed as a correlated population. this is possible in tidaltails consisting of material expelled from interacting galaxies. we discuss thetidal scenario for the formation of the vpos, including successes and possiblechallenges. the potential consequences of the mw satellites being tidal dwarfgalaxies are severe. if all the satellite galaxies and yh gcs have been formedin an encounter between the young mw and another gas-rich galaxy about 10-11gyr ago, then the mw does not have any luminous dark-matter substructures andthe missing satellites problem becomes a catastrophic failure of the standardcosmological model.

1204.6039	can filamentary accretion explain the orbital poles of the milky way  satellites?	several scenarios have been suggested to explain the phase-space distributionof the milky way (mw) satellite galaxies in a disc of satellites (dos). toquantitatively compare these different possibilities, a new method analysingangular momentum directions in modelled data is presented. it determines howlikely it is to find sets of angular momenta as concentrated and as close to apolar orientation as is observed for the mw satellite orbital poles. the methodcan be easily applied to orbital pole data from different models. the observeddistribution of satellite orbital poles is compared to published angularmomentum directions of subhalos derived from six cosmological state-of-the-artsimulations in the aquarius project. this tests the possibility thatfilamentary accretion might be able to naturally explain the satellite orbitswithin the dos. for the most likely alignment of main halo and mw disc spin,the probability to reproduce the mw satellite orbital pole properties turns outto be less than 0.5 per cent in aquarius models. even an isotropic distributionof angular momenta has a higher likelihood to produce the observeddistribution. the two via lactea cosmological simulations give results similarto the aquarius simulations. comparing instead with numerical models ofgalaxy-interactions gives a probability of up to 90 per cent for some models todraw the observed distribution of orbital poles from the angular momenta oftidal debris. this indicates that the formation as tidal dwarf galaxies in asingle encounter is a viable, if not the only, process to explain thephase-space distribution of the mw satellite galaxies.

1205.5029	dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way from dark matter free tidal  dwarf galaxy progenitors: maps of orbits	the long term time evolution of tidal dwarf satellite galaxies with twodifferent initial densities orbiting a host galaxy that resembles the milky wayhas been studied using a large set of newtonian n-body simulations. from thesimulations two maps of the orbital conditions that lead to quasi-equilibriumobjects were constructed. it has been found that several orbits of thesatellites allow for the existence, for about 1 gyr or more, ofout-of-equilibrium bodies with high apparent mass-to-light ratios. within thisframework the satellites in the quasi-stable phase reproduce the observedsatellite properties for about 16% of the orbit for high density progenitors,and for about 66% for progenitors with lower densities an additional simulationfor a single satellite with initial mass of 10^7 msun and plummer radius of0.15 kpc leads to remnants in the quasi- equilibrium phase that simultaneouslyreproduce remarkably well the observational quantities of the ufdgs of themilky way. this satellite in the quasi-stable phase reproduces the observedsatellite properties for about 42% of the orbit. the results suggest that afraction of the observed satellites could plausibly be galaxies without darkmatter that have true m/l ratios much lower than those measured. the inflatedm/l ratios arise because they are observed at the right time, along the rightorbit and during the quasi-equilibrium phase of their evolution. this is aviable explanation for the high m/l ratios observed in all satellites as longas the satellites are preferentially on certain orbits and are observed atcertain times. this could arise within the tdg scenario if all satellites arecreated at the same time along a few specific orbits that are particularlysusceptible to the quasi-equilibrium phase.

1206.1596	field o stars: formed in situ or as runaways?	a significant fraction of massive stars in the milky way and other galaxiesare located far from star clusters. it is known that some of these stars arerunaways and therefore most likely were formed in embedded clusters and thenejected into the field because of dynamical few-body interactions orbinary-supernova explosions. however, there exists a group of field o starswhose runaway status is difficult to prove via direct proper motionmeasurements or whose low space velocities and/or young ages appear to beincompatible with their large separation from known star clusters. theexistence of this group led some authors to believe that field o stars can formin situ. in this paper, we examine the runaway status of the best candidatesfor isolated formation of massive stars in the milky way and the magellanicclouds by searching for bow shocks around them, by using the new reduction ofthe hipparcos data, and by searching for stellar systems from which they couldoriginate within their lifetimes. we show that most of the known o starsthought to have formed in isolation are instead very likely runaways. we showalso that the field must contain a population of o stars whose low spacevelocities and/or young ages are in apparent contradiction with the largeseparation of these stars from their parent clusters and/or the ages of theseclusters. these stars (the descendants of runaway massive binaries) cannot betraced back to their parent clusters and therefore can be mistakenly consideredas having formed in situ. we argue also that some field o stars could bedetected in optical wavelengths only because they are runaways, while theircousins residing in the deeply embedded parent clusters might still remaintotally obscured. the main conclusion of our study is that there is nosignificant evidence whatsoever in support of the in situ proposal on theorigin of massive stars.

0712.1591	the influence of residual gas expulsion on the evolution of the galactic  globular cluster system and the origin of the population ii halo	we present new results on the evolution of the mass function of the globularcluster system of the milky way, taking the effect of residual gas expulsioninto account. we assume that gas embedded star clusters start with a power-lawmass function with slope \beta=2. the dissolution of the clusters is thenstudied under the combined influence of residual gas expulsion driven by energyfeedback from massive stars, stellar mass-loss, two-body relaxation and anexternal tidal field. the influence of residual gas expulsion is studied byapplying results from a large grid of n-body simulations computed by baumgardt&amp; kroupa (2007).  in our model, star clusters with masses less than 10^5 m_sun lose theirresidual gas on timescales much shorter than their crossing time and residualgas expulsion is the main dissolution mechanism for star clusters, destroyingabout 95% of all clusters within a few 10s of myr. we find that in this casethe final mass function of globular clusters is established mainly by the gasexpulsion and therefore nearly independent of the strength of the externaltidal field, and that a power-law mass function for the gas embedded starclusters is turned into a present-day log-normal one.  another consequence of residual gas expulsion and the associated stronginfant mortality of star clusters is that the galactic halo stars come fromdissolved star clusters. since field halo stars would come mainly fromlow-mass, short-lived clusters, our model provides an explanation for theobserved abundance variations of light elements among globular cluster starsand the absence of such variations among the halo field stars.

1304.4931	polar ring galaxies as tests of gravity	polar ring galaxies are ideal objects with which to study thethree-dimensional shapes of galactic gravitational potentials since tworotation curves can be measured in two perpendicular planes. observationalstudies have uncovered systematically larger rotation velocities in theextended polar rings than in the associated host galaxies. in the dark mattercontext, this can only be explained through dark halos that are systematicallyflattened along the polar rings. here, we point out that these objects can alsobe used as very effective tests of gravity theories, such as those based onmilgromian dynamics (mond). we run a set of polar ring models using bothmilgromian and newtonian dynamics to predict the expected shapes of therotation curves in both planes, varying the total mass of the system, the massof the ring with respect to the host, as well as the size of the hole at thecenter of the ring. we find that milgromian dynamics not only naturally leadsto rotation velocities being typically higher in the extended polar rings thanin the hosts, as would be the case in newtonian dynamics without dark matter,but that it also gets the shape and amplitude of velocities correct. milgromiandynamics thus adequately explains this particular property of polar ringgalaxies.

1310.4497	the [alpha/fe] ratios of very metal-poor stars within the igimf theory	the aim of this paper is to quantify the amplitude of the predicted plateauin [alpha/fe] ratios associated with the most metal-poor stars of a galaxy. weassume that the initial mass function in galaxies is steeper if the starformation rate (sfr) is low -- as per the integrated galactic initial massfunction (igimf) theory. a variant of the theory, in which the igimf dependsupon the metallicity of the parent galaxy, is also considered. the igimf theorypredicts low [alpha/fe] plateaus in dwarf galaxies, characterised by smallsfrs. the [alpha/fe] plateau is up to 0.7dex lower than the correspondingplateau of the milky way. for a universal imf one should expect instead thatthe [alpha/fe] plateau is the same for all the galaxies, irrespective of theirmasses or sfrs. assuming a strong dependence of the imf on the metallicity ofthe parent galaxy, dwarf galaxies can show values of the [alpha/fe] plateausimilar to those of the milky way, and almost independent on the sfr. the[mg/fe] ratios of the most metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies satellites of themilky way can be reproduced either if we consider metallicity-dependent imfs orif the early sfrs of these galaxies were larger than we presently think.present and future observations of dwarf galaxies can help disentangle betweenthese different igimf formulations.

1311.1507	phase mixing due to the galactic potential: steps in the position and  velocity distributions of popped star clusters	as star clusters are expected to form with low star formation efficiencies,the gas in the cluster is expelled quickly and early in their development: thestar cluster "pops." this leads to an unbound stellar system, evolving in thegalactic potential. previous n-body simulations have demonstrated the existenceof a stepped number density distribution of cluster stars after popping, bothin vertical position and vertical velocity, with a passing resemblance to achristmas tree. using numerical and analytical methods, we investigate thesource of this structure, which arises due to the phase mixing of theout-of-equilibrium stellar system, determined entirely by the backgroundanalytic potential. considering only the vertical motions, we construct atheoretical model to describe the time evolution of the phase spacedistribution of stars in a miyamoto-nagai disk potential and a full milky-waytype potential comprising bulge, halo and disk components, which is thencompared with n-body simulations. using our theoretical model, we investigatethe possible observational signatures and the feasibility of detection.

1311.2932	chemo-dynamical evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies. i. method and imf  dependence	we present high-resolution simulations of tidal dwarf galaxies (tdg) toinvestigate their early chemo-dynamical evolution and test their survivability.in this work the simulation setup is introduced and the response of tdgs toself-consistent star formation (sf) and an external tidal field is examined.throughout the simulation star cluster particles with variable masses down to$5\,m_{\odot}$ form, depending on the local gas reservoir. for low clustermasses $m_{\mathrm{cl}}$, the stellar initial mass function (imf) is consideredto be either filled or truncated at a maximal star mass $m_\mathrm{max}$ torepresent the observed $m_{\mathrm{max}} - m_{\mathrm{cl}}$ relation (igimftheory). the evolution of tdgs with fully-populated and truncated imfs arecompared to study the impact of stellar energy feedback on their survivability.both tdgs experience an initial starburst but after a dynamical time theyevolve into dwarf galaxies with self-regulated and continuous sf. at this stagethe truncated-imf model contains about 6 times more stellar mass than theinvariant imf models, but the final bound gas mass is comparable in bothmodels. in spite of their significantly different sf histories, both tdg modelsare not disrupted within the first 500 myr. we conclude that tdgs can survivean early starburst, independent of the underlying imf description, even thoughthey do not harbor a stabilizing dark matter halo.

0802.0703	from star clusters to dwarf galaxies: the properties of dynamically hot  stellar systems	(abridged) objects with radii of 10 to 100 pc and masses in the range from10^6 to 10^8 m_sun have been discovered during the past decade. these so-calledultra compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) constitute a transition between classicalstar clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times andv-band mass-to-light (m/l_v) ratios. using new data, we find that the massinterval from 10^6 to 10^7 m_sun is of special interest, because within thisrange typical half-light radii and dynamical mass-to-light ratios begin toincrease compared to globular clusters, the highest stellar densities arereached and typical median two-body relaxation times surpass a hubble time. them/l_v ratios of the ucds turn out to be incompatible with the predictions fromsimple stellar population (ssp) models when using the canonical stellar initialmass function (imf), although ssps probably are good approximations to the realstellar populations in ucds and the ssp models allow to account for metallicityeffects on the m/l_v ratio. this provides evidence for the ucds either havingformed with an imf different from the canonical one or containing dark matter.we emphasise that almost all pressure-supported stellar systems ranging fromstar clusters to massive elliptical galaxies have m/l_v ratios less than 10m_sun/l_sun, and that only dsph satellite galaxies have m/l_v ratios greaterthan 100 m_sun/l_sun and therewith form exceptional systems.

0803.1991	open cluster stability and the effects of binary stars	the diagnostic age versus mass-to-light ratio diagram is often used inattempts to constrain the shape of the stellar initial mass function (imf), andthe potential longevity of extragalactic young to intermediate-age massive starclusters. here, we explore its potential for galactic open clusters. on thebasis of a small, homogenised cluster sample we provide useful constraints onthe presence of significant binary fractions. using the massive young galacticcluster westerlund 1 as a key example, we caution that stochasticity in the imfintroduces significant additional uncertainties. we conclude that for an opencluster to survive for any significant length of time, and in the absence ofsubstantial external perturbations, it is a necessary but not a sufficientcondition to be located close to or (in the presence of a significant binarypopulation) somewhat below the predicted photometric evolutionary sequences for"normal" simple stellar populations (although such a location may be dominatedby a remaining "bound" cluster core and thus not adequately reflect the overallcluster dynamics).

1411.0318	the chemical evolution of galaxies with a variable igimf	standard analytical chemical evolution modelling of galaxies has beenassuming the stellar initial mass function (imf) to be invariant and fullysampled allowing fractions of massive stars to contribute even in dwarfgalaxies with very low star formation rates (sfrs). recent observations showthe integrated galactic initial mass function (igimf) of stars, i.e. thegalaxy-wide imf, to become systematically top-heavy with increasing sfr. thishas been predicted by the igimf theory, which is here used to develop theanalytical theory of the chemical evolution of galaxies. this theory isnon-linear and requires the iterative solution of implicit integral equationsdue to the dependence of the igimf on the metallicity and on the sfr. it isshown that the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies emerges naturally,although at low masses the theoretical predictions overestimate theobservations by 0.3--0.4 dex. a good agreement with the observation can beobtained only if gas flows are taken into account. in particular, we are ableto reproduce the mass--metallicity relation observed by lee et al. (2006) withmodest amounts of infall and with an outflow rate which decreases as a functionof the galactic mass. the outflow rates required to fit the data areconsiderably smaller than required in models with invariant imfs.

1504.02473	the mass-metallicity relation of tidal dwarf galaxies	dwarf galaxies generally follow a mass-metallicity (mz) relation, where moremassive objects retain a larger fraction of heavy elements. young tidal dwarfgalaxies (tdgs), born in the tidal tails produced by interacting gas-richgalaxies, have been thought to not follow the mz relation, because they inheritthe metallicity of the more massive parent galaxies. we present chemicalevolution models to investigate if tdgs that formed at very high redshifts,where the metallicity of their parent galaxy was very low, can produce theobserved mz relation. assuming that galaxy interactions were more frequent inthe denser high-redshift universe, tdgs could constitute an importantcontribution to the dwarf galaxy population. the survey of chemical evolutionmodels of tdgs presented here captures for the first time an initial massfunction (imf) of stars that is dependent on both the star formation rate andthe gas metallicity via the integrated galactic imf (igimf) theory. as tdgsform in the tidal debris of interacting galaxies, the pre-enrichment of thegas, an underlying pre-existing stellar population, infall, and mass dependentoutflows are considered. the models of young tdgs that are created in stronglypre-enriched tidal arms with a pre-existing stellar population can explain themeasured abundance ratios of observed tdgs. the same chemical evolution modelsfor tdgs, that form out of gas with initially very low metallicity, naturallybuild up the observed mz relation. the modelled chemical composition of ancienttdgs is therefore consistent with the observed mz relation of satellitegalaxies.

astro-ph;0009470	the formation of a bound star cluster: from the orion nebula cluster to  the pleiades	(shortened) direct n-body calculations are presented of the formation ofgalactic clusters using gasex, which is a variant of the code nbody6. thecalculations focus on the possible evolution of the orion nebula cluster (onc)by assuming that the embedded ob stars explosively drove out 2/3 of its mass inthe form of gas about 0.4 myr ago. a bound cluster forms readily and survivesfor 150 myr despite additional mass loss from the large number of massivestars, and the galactic tidal field. this is the very first time that clusterformation is obtained under such realistic conditions. the cluster containsabout 1/3 of the initial 10^4 stars, and resembles the pleiades cluster to aremarkable degree, implying that an onc-like cluster may have been a precursorof the pleiades. this scenario predicts the present expansion velocity of theonc, which will be measurable by upcoming astrometric space missions (diva andgaia). these missions should also detect the original pleiades members as anassociated expanding young galactic-field sub-population. the results arrivedat here suggest that galactic clusters form as the nuclei of expanding obassociations.

astro-ph;0102290	efficient n-body realisations of axisymmetric galaxies and haloes	we present an efficient method for building equilibrium multi-componentgalaxies with non-spherical haloes and bulges. the gist of our approach is totailor the velocity ellipsoid directly to the geometry of the massdistribution. thus we avoid computing the anisotropic velocity dispersionswhich leads to large savings in the cpu budget. the computational time of thealgorithm for triaxial equilibria scales linearly with the number of particles,n. the approximate solution to the velocity field causes structural relaxation:tests with n = 50,000 show that fluctuations of the inertia tensor (notexceeding the 10 per cent level) disappear within one half of a revolution atthe half-mass radius. at later times equilibrium properties settle to valuesclose to those sought from the initial conditions.  a disc component is then added as described by hernquist (1993).incorporating the above algorithm to his code buildgal, test runs show that thestability of the disc against vertical heating is not substantially modified byusing our method.  the code, magali, is made generally available.

astro-ph;0204378	scaling up tides in numerical models of galaxy- and halo-formation	the purpose of this article is to show that when dynamically cold,dissipationless self-gravitating systems collapse, their evolution is a strongfunction of the symmetry in the initial distribution. we explore with a set ofpressure-less homogeneous fluids the time-evolution of ellipsoidaldistributions and map the depth of potential achieved during relaxation asfunction of initial ellipsoid axis ratios. we then perform a series of $n$-bodynumerical simulations and contrast their evolution with the fluid solutions. weverify an analytic relation between collapse factor ${\cal c}$ and particlenumber $n$ in spherical symmetry, such that ${\cal c} \propto n^{1/3}$. wesought a similar relation for axisymmetric configurations, and found anempirical scaling relation such that ${\cal c} \propto n^{1/6}$ in these cases.we then show that when mass distributions do not respect spherical- oraxial-symmetry, the ensuing gravitational collapse deepens with increasingparticle number $n$ but only slowly: 86% of triaxial configurations maycollapse by a factor of no more than 40 as $n\to\infty$. for $n\approx 10^5$and larger, violent relaxation develops fully under the lin-mestel-shuinstability such that numerical $n$-body solutions now resolve the differentinitial morphologies adequately.

0808.2644	a discontinuity in the low-mass imf - the case of high multiplicity	the empirical binary properties of brown dwarfs (bds) differ from those ofnormal stars suggesting bds form a separate population. recent work by thies &amp;kroupa revealed a discontinuity of the initial mass function (imf) in thevery-low-mass star regime under the assumption of a low multiplicity of bds ofabout 15 per cent. however, previous observations had suggested that themultiplicity of bds may be significantly higher, up to 45 per cent. thiscontribution investigates the implication of a high bd multiplicity on theappearance of the imf for the orion nebula cluster, taurus-auriga, ic 348 andthe pleiades. we show that the discontinuity remains pronounced even if theobserved mf appears to be continuous, even for a bd binary fraction as high as60%. we find no evidence for a variation of the bd imf with star-formingconditions. the bd imf has a power-law index alpha = +0.3 and about two bdsform per 10 low-mass stars assuming equal-mass pairing of bds.

(abridged) the recent evidence obtained by briceno et al. that star-formationin taurus-auriga (ta) may be producing significantly fewer brown dwarfs (bds)per star than the onc is investigated by setting up a realistic model stellarplus bd population and explicitly taking into account a high binary proportionand dynamical evolution in the ta groups and the onc. the briceno result isreproduced almost exactly despite an identical imf in both systems because manybd-bd and star-bd binaries are disrupted in the onc thus freeing bds, while theta groups remain unevolved dynamically. however, the resulting populations donot have the correct star-star, star-bd and expecially bd-bd binary properties,even if a variable bd imf is allowed for. the conclusion is therefore that bdsneed to be added as a separate population which has its own binary properties.such an extra population can have various origins which are briefly discussedin this contribution but more fully in an associated paper.

astro-ph;0402631	implications for the formation of star clusters from extra-galactic  star-formation rates	observations indicate that young massive star clusters in spiral and dwarfgalaxies follow a relation between luminosity of the brightest young clusterand the star-formation rate (sfr) of the host galaxy, in the sense that highersfrs lead to the formation of brighter clusters. assuming that the empiricalrelation between maximum cluster luminosity and sfr reflects an underlyingsimilar relation between maximum cluster mass (m_ecl,max) and sfr, we comparethe resulting sfr(m_ecl,max) relation with different theoretical models. theempirical correlation is found to suggest that individual star clusters form ona free-fall time-scale with their pre-cluster molecular-cloud-core radiitypically being a few pc independent of mass. the cloud cores contract byfactors of 5 to 10 while building-up the embedded cluster. a theoreticalsfr(m_ecl,max) relation in very good agreement with the empirical correlationis obtained if the cluster mass function of a young population has a salpeterexponent beta approx. 2.35 and if this cluster population forms within acharacteristic time-scale of a few-10 myr. this short time-scale can beunderstood if the inter-stellar medium is pressurised thus precipitating rapidlocal fragmentation and collapse on a galactic scale. such triggered starformation on a galactic scale is observed to occur in interacting galaxies.with a global sfr of 3-5 msol/yr the milky way appears to lie on the empiricalsfr(m_ecl,max) relation, given the recent detections of very young clusterswith masses near 10^5 msol in the galactic disk. the observed properties of thestellar population of very massive young clusters suggests that there may exista fundamental maximum cluster mass, 10^6 &lt; m_ecl,max*/msol &lt; 10^7.

astro-ph;0406581	the pleiades mass function: models versus observations	two stellar-dynamical models of binary-rich embedded proto-orion-nebula-typeclusters that evolve to pleiades-like clusters are studied with an emphasis oncomparing the stellar mass function with observational constraints. by the ageof the pleiades (about 100 myr) both models show a similar degree of masssegregation which also agrees with observational constraints. this thusindicates that the pleiades is well relaxed and that it is suffering fromsevere amnesia. it is found that the initial mass function (imf) must have beenindistinguishable from the standard or galactic-field imf for stars with mass m&lt; 2 mo, provided the pleiades precursor had a central density of about 10^4.8stars/pc^3. a denser model with 10^5.8 stars/pc^3 also leads to reasonableagreement with observational constraints, but owing to the shorter relaxationtime of the embedded cluster it evolves through energy equipartition to amass-segregated condition just prior to residual-gas expulsion. this modelconsequently looses preferentially low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (bds), butthe effect is not very pronounced. the empirical data indicate that thepleiades imf may have been steeper than salpeter for stars with m &gt; 2 mo.

astro-ph;0411765	how star clusters could survive low star formation efficiencies	after the stars of a new, embedded star cluster have formed they blow theremaining gas out of the cluster. especially winds of high mass stars anddefinitely the on-set of the first super novae can remove the residual gas froma cluster. this leads to a very violent mass-loss and leaves the cluster out ofvirial equilibrium. standard models predict that the star formation efficiency(sfe) has to be about 33 per cent for sudden (within one crossing-time of thecluster) gas expulsion to retain some of the stars in a bound cluster. if theefficiency is lower the stars of the cluster disperse completely. recentobservations reveal that in strong star bursts star clusters do not form inisolation but in complexes containing dozens and up to several hundred starclusters (super-clusters). by carrying out numerical experiments we demonstratethat in these environments (i.e. the deeper potential of the star clustercomplex and the merging process of the star clusters within thesesuper-clusters) the sfes could be as low as 20 per cent, leaving agravitationally bound stellar population. we demonstrate that the merging ofthe first clusters happens faster than the dissolution time therefore enablingmore stars to stay bound within the merger object. such an object resembles theouter milky way globular clusters and the faint fuzzy star clusters recentlydiscovered in ngc 1023.

astro-ph;0412114	imf variations and their implications for supernovae numbers	the stellar initial mass function (imf) integrated over an entire galaxy isan integral over all separate star-formation events. since most stars form instar clusters with different masses the integrated imf becomes an integral ofthe (universal or invariant) canonical stellar imf over the star-cluster massfunction. this integrated imf is steeper (contains fewer massive stars perg-type star) than the canonical stellar imf. furthermore, observations indicatea relation between the star-formation rate of a galaxy and the most luminousstellar cluster in it. this empirical relation can be transformed into onebetween the star-formation rate of a galaxy and a maximum cluster mass. theassumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of a young-cluster massfunction leads to a connection of the star-formation rate and the slope ofintegrated imf for massive stars. this integrated imf varies with thestar-formation history of a galaxy. notably, large variations of the integratedimf are evident for dwarf galaxies. one important result is that the number oftype ii supernovae per star is supressed relative to that expected for acanonical imf, and that dwarf galaxies have a supressed number of supernovaeper star relative to massive galaxies. for dwarf galaxies the number ofsupernovae per star also varies substantially depending on the galaxy assemblyhistory.

astro-ph;0502086	a possible formation scenario for the ultra-massive cluster w3 in ngc  7252	the intermediate age star cluster w3 (age ~ 300-500 myr) in ngc 7252 is themost luminous star cluster known to date with a dynamical mass estimate of 8+/- 2 x 10^7 m_sun. with an effective radius of about 17.5 pc and a velocitydispersion of 45 km/s this object may be viewed as one of the recentlydiscovered ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds). its intermediate age, however,precludes an origin as a stripped nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. the galaxyngc 7252 is a merger remnant from two gas-rich disc galaxies. interactionsbetween two gas-rich galaxies lead to bursts of intense star formation. the ageof the interaction and the age of w3 are in good agreement, suggesting that wasw3 probably formed in the starburst. we propose a formation scenario for w3.observations of interacting galaxies reveal regions of strong star formationforming dozens up to hundreds of star cluster in confined regions of up toseveral hundred parsec in diameter. the total mass of new stars in theseregions can reach 10^7 or even 10^8 m_sun. by means of numerical simulations wehave shown that the star clusters in these regions merge on short time-scalesof a few myr up to a few hundred myr. we apply this scenario to w3 and predictproperties which could be observable and the future evolution of this object.this work lends credence to the notion that at least some of the ucds may beevolved star cluster complexes formed during early hierarchical mergers.

astro-ph;0502525	the variation of integrated star imfs among galaxies	the integrated galaxial initial mass function (igimf) is the relevantdistribution function containing the information on the distribution of stellarremnants, the number of supernovae and the chemical enrichment history of agalaxy. since most stars form in embedded star clusters with different massesthe igimf becomes an integral of the assumed (universal or invariant) stellarimf over the embedded star-cluster mass function (ecmf). for a range ofreasonable assumptions about the imf and the ecmf we find the igimf to besteeper (containing fewer massive stars per star) than the stellar imf, butbelow a few msol it is invariant and identical to the stellar imf for allgalaxies. however, the steepening sensitively depends on the form of the ecmfin the low-mass regime. furthermore, observations indicate a relation betweenthe star formation rate of a galaxy and the most massive young stellar clusterin it. the assumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of ayoung-cluster mass function leads to a connection of the star formation rateand the slope of the igimf above a few msol. the igimf varies with the starformation history of a galaxy. notably, large variations of the igimf areevident for de, dirr and lsb galaxies with a small to modest stellar mass. wefind that for any galaxy the number of supernovae per star (nsns) is suppressedrelative to that expected for a salpeter imf. dwarf galaxies have a smallernsns compared to massive galaxies. for dwarf galaxies the nsns variessubstantially depending on the galaxy assembly history and the assumptions madeabout the low-mass end of the ecmf. the findings presented here may be of someconsequence for the cosmological evolution of the number of supernovae perlow-mass star and the chemical enrichment of galaxies of different mass.

astro-ph;0505411	star cluster survival in star cluster complexes under extreme residual  gas expulsion	after the stars of a new, embedded star cluster have formed they blow theremaining gas out of the cluster. especially winds of massive stars anddefinitely the on-set of the first supernovae can remove the residual gas froma cluster. this leads to a very violent mass-loss and leaves the cluster out ofdynamical equilibrium. standard models predict that within the cluster volumethe star formation efficiency (sfe) has to be about 33 per cent for sudden(within one crossing-time of the cluster) gas expulsion to retain some of thestars in a bound cluster. if the efficiency is lower the stars of the clusterdisperse mostly. recent observations reveal that in strong star bursts starclusters do not form in isolation but in complexes containing dozens and up toseveral hundred star clusters, i.e. in super-clusters. by carrying outnumerical experiments for such objects placed at distances &gt;= 10 kpc from thecentre of the galaxy we demonstrate that under these conditions (i.e. thedeeper potential of the star cluster complex and the merging process of thestar clusters within these super-clusters) the sfes can be as low as 20 percent and still leave a gravitationally bound stellar population. such an objectresembles the outer milky way globular clusters and the faint fuzzy starclusters recently discovered in ngc 1023.

astro-ph;0610230	a highly abnormal massive star mass function in the orion nebula cluster  and the dynamical decay of trapezia systems	the onc appears to be unusual on two grounds: the observed constellation ofthe ob stars of the entire orion nebula cluster and its trapezium at its centreimplies a time-scale problem given the age of the trapezium, and an imf problemfor the whole ob star population in the onc. given the estimated crossing timeof the trapezium, it ought to have totally dynamically decayed by now.furthermore, by combining the lower limit of the onc mass with a standard imfit emerges that the onc should have formed at least about 40 stars heavier than5 m_sun while only ten are observed. using n-body experiments we (i) confirmthe expected instability of the trapezium and (ii) show that beginning with acompact ob-star configuration of about 40 stars the number of observed ob starsafter 1 myr within 1 pc radius and a compact trapezium configuration can bothbe reproduced. these two empirical constraints thus support our estimate of 40initial ob stars in the cluster. interestingly, a more-evolved version of theonc resembles the upper scorpius ob association. the n-body experiments areperformed with the new c-code catena by integrating the equations of motionusing the chain-multiple-regularisation method. in addition, we present a newnumerical formulation of the initial mass function.

astro-ph;0610933	the spatial distribution of the milky way and andromeda satellite  galaxies	there are two fundamentally different physical origins of faint satellitegalaxies: cosmological sub-structures that contain shining baryons and thefragmentation of gas-rich tidal arms thrown out from interacting galaxiesduring hierarchical structure formation. the latter tidal-dwarf galaxies (tdg)may form populations with correlated orbital angular momenta about their hostgalaxies. the existence of tdgs is a stringent necessity because they arise asa result of fundamental physical principals. we determine the significance ofthe apparent disc-like distribution of milky way (mw) satellite galaxies. thedistribution of the mw satellites is found to be inconsistent with an isotropicor prolate dm sub-structure distribution at a 99.5 per cent level including therecently discovered uma and cvn dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the distribution isextremely oblate and inclined by about $88\degr$ with respect to the the mwdisc. we also apply the methods to andromeda's (m31) satellite galaxies usingtwo recently published data-sets. it can not be excluded that the wholepopulation of m31 companions is drawn randomly from an isotropic parentdistribution. however, two subsamples of andromeda satellites are identifiedwhich have disc-like features.

astro-ph;0611723	a possible origin of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies	observations show that galaxies follow a mass-metallicity relation over awide range of masses. one currently favoured explanation is that less massivegalaxies are less able to retain the gas and stellar ejecta and thus may losethe freshly produced metals in the form of galactic outflows. galaxies with alow current star formation rate have been found to contain star clusters up toa lower mass limit. since stars are predominately born in clusters, and lessmassive clusters have been found to be less likely to contain very massivestars, this implies that in environments or at times of low star formation, thestellar initial mass function does not extend to as high masses as during highstar formation epochs. it is found that the oxygen yield is reduced by a factorof thirty when the star formation rate is decreased by 3 to 4 orders ofmagnitude. with this concept, chemical evolution models for galaxies of a rangeof masses are computed and shown to provide an excellent fit to themass-metallicity relation derived recently by tremonti et al. (2004).furthermore, the models match the relation between galaxy mass and effectiveyield. thus, the scenario of a variable integrated stellar initial massfunction, which is based on the concept of formation of stars in clusters, mayoffer an attractive alternative or partial explanation of the mass-metallicityrelation in galaxies.

astro-ph;0702001	on the infant weight loss of low- to intermediate-mass star clusters	star clusters are born in a highly compact configuration, typically withradii of less than about 1 pc roughly independently of mass. since thestar-formation efficiency is less than 50 per cent by observation and becausethe residual gas is removed from the embedded cluster, the cluster must expand.in the process of doing so it only retains a fraction f_st of its stars. todate there are no observational constrains for f_st, although nbodycalculations by kroupa et al. (2001) suggest it to be about 20-30 per cent fororion-type clusters. here we use the data compiled by testi et al. (1997, 1998,1999) for clusters around young ae/be stars and by de wit et al. (2004, 2005)around young o stars and the study of de zeeuw et al. (1999) of ob associationsand combine these measurements with the expected number of stars in clusterswith primary ae/be and o stars, respectively, using the empirical correlationbetween maximal-stellar-mass and star-cluster mass of weidner &amp; kroupa (2006).we find that f_st &lt; 50 per cent with a decrease to higher clustermasses/more-massive primaries. the interpretation would be that clusterformation is very disruptive. it appears that clusters with a birth stellarmass in the range 10 to 10^3 msun keep at most 50 per cent of their stars.

0706.0093	the early evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies	context: dwarf galaxies can arise from self-gravitating structures emergingfrom tidal tails. what fraction of the known dwarf galaxies in the localuniverse can have this origin is still a matter of debate. aims: in our effortto understand the origin and evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies and theircorrespondence with local objects, the first step is to understand how thesegalaxies (which are supposed to have a limited amount of dark matter) react tothe feedback of the ongoing star formation. methods: we make use of 2-dchemodynamical calculations in order to study the early evolution of isolated,dark matter-free dwarf galaxies. we present models in which feedback parametersare varied. we also compare the results with dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxymodels. results: all the considered models show that the star formationproceeds for more than 300 myr, therefore dwarf galaxies without large darkmatter halos are not necessarily quickly destroyed. the chemical evolution ofthese objects is consistent with the main chemical properties of the dsphs ofthe local group. models with large dark matter halos show results consistentwith models free of dark matter, indicating that the distribution of gas ismore important than the depth of the potential well in determining the globalbehaviour of dsph-sized dwarf galaxies.

0810.5345	the evolution of two stellar populations in globular clusters i. the  dynamical mixing timescale	we investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of two distinct stellarpopulations of low-mass stars in globular clusters in order to study whetherthe energy equipartition process can explain the high number of starsharbouring abundance anomalies seen in globular clusters. we analyse n-bodymodels by artificially dividing the low-mass stars (m&lt;0.9 msun) into twopopulations: a small number of stars (second generation) consistent with aninvariant imf and with low specific energies initially concentrated towards thecluster-centre mimic stars with abundance anomalies. these stars form from theslow winds of fast-rotating massive stars. the main part of low-mass (firstgeneration) stars has the pristine composition of the cluster. we study indetail how the two populations evolve under the influence of two-body elaxationand the tidal forces due to the host galaxy.stars with low specific energyinitially concentrated toward the cluster centre need about two relaxationtimes to achieve a complete homogenisation throughout the cluster. forrealistic globular clusters, the number ratio between the two populationsincreases only by a factor 2.5 due to the preferential evaporation of thepopulation of outlying first generation stars. we also find that the loss ofinformation on the stellar orbital angular momentum occurs on the sametimescale as spatial homogenisation.

0811.3730	the influence of multiple stars on the high-mass stellar initial mass  function and age-dating of young massive star clusters	the study of young stellar populations has revealed that most stars are inbinary or higher order multiple systems. in this study the influence on thestellar initial mass function (imf) of large quantities of unresolved multiplemassive stars is investigated by taking into account stellar evolution andphotometrically determined system masses. the models where initial masses arederived from the luminosity and colour of unresolved multiple systems show thateven under extreme circumstances (100% binaries or higher order multiples) thedifference between the power-law index of the mass function of all stars andthe observed mass function is small (~0.1). thus, if the observed imf has thesalpeter index alpha = 2.35 then the true stellar imf has an index not flatterthan alpha = 2.25. additionally, unresolved multiple systems may hide between15 and 60% of the underlying true mass of a star cluster. while already a knownresult, it is important to point out that the presence of a large number ofunresolved binaries amongst pre-main-sequence (pms) stars induces a significantspread in the measured ages of these stars even if there is none. also,lower-mass stars in a single-age binary-rich cluster appear older than themassive stars by about 0.6 myr.

0812.1567	the warped young stellar disc in the galactic centre	within the central parsec of the galaxy, several tens of young stars orbitinga central supermassive black hole are observed. a subset of these stars forms acoherently rotating disc. other observations reveal a massive molecular toruswhich lies at a radius ~1.5pc from the centre. in this paper we consider thegravitational influence of the molecular torus upon the stars of the stellardisc. we derive an analytical formula for the rate of precession of individualstellar orbits and we show that it is highly sensitive upon the orbitalsemi-major axis and inclination with respect to the plane of the torus as wellas on the mass of the torus. assuming that both the stellar disc and themolecular torus are stable on the time-scale &gt;6myr, we constrain the mass ofthe torus and its inclination with respect to the young stellar disc. wefurther suggest that all young stars observed in the galactic centre may have acommon origin in a single coherently rotating structure with an opening angle&lt;5deg, which was partially destroyed (warped) during its lifetime by thegravitational influence of the molecular torus.

0812.2912	the ages of galactic globular clusters in the context of self-enrichment	a significant fraction of stars in globular clusters (about 70%-85%) exhibitpeculiar chemical patterns with strong abundance variations in light elementsalong with constant abundances in heavy elements. these abundance anomalies canbe created in the h-burning core of a first generation of fast rotating massivestars and the corresponding elements are convoyed to the stellar surface thanksto rotational induced mixing. if the rotation of the stars is fast enough thismatter is ejected at low velocity through a mechanical wind at the equator. itthen pollutes the ism from which a second generation of chemically anomalousstars can be formed. the proportion of anomalous to normal star observed todaydepends on at least two quantities : (1) the number of polluter stars; (2) thedynamical history of the cluster which may lose during its lifetime first andsecond generation stars in different proportions. here we estimate theseproportions based on dynamical models for globular clusters. when internaldynamical evolution and dissolution due to tidal forces are accounted for,starting from an initial fraction of anomalous stars of 10% produces a presentday fraction of about 25%, still too small with respect to the observed 70-85%.in case gas expulsion by supernovae is accounted for, much higher fraction isexpected to be produced. in this paper we also address the question of theevolution of the second generation stars that are he-rich, and deduceconsequences for the age determination of globular clusters.
