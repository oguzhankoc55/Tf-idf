0902.4427	efficient pseudo-global fitting for helioseismic data	mode fitting or "peak-bagging" is an important procedure in helioseismologyallowing one to determine the various mode parameters of solar oscillations.here we describe a way of reducing the systematic bias in the fits of certainmode parameters that are seen when using "local" fitting techniques to analysethe sun-as-a-star p-mode power spectrum. to do this we have developed a new"pseudo-global" fitting algorithm designed to gain the advantages of fittingthe entire power spectrum, but without the problems involved in fitting a modelincorporating many hundreds of parameters.  we have performed a comparative analysis between the local and pseudo-globalpeak-bagging techniques by fitting the "limit" profiles of simulatedhelioseismic data. results show that for asymmetric modes the traditionalfitting technique returns systematically biased estimates of the centralfrequency parameter. this bias is significantly reduced when employing thepseudo-global routine. similarly, we show that estimates of the backgroundreturned from the pseudo-global routine match the input values much moreclosely than the estimates from the local fitting method.  we have also used the two fitting techniques to analyse a set of real solardata collected by the global oscillations at low frequencies (golf) instrumenton board the esa/nasa solar and heliospheric observatory (soho) spacecraft.similar differences between the estimated frequencies returned by the twotechniques are seen when fitting both the real and simulated data. we show thatthe background fits returned by the pseudo-global routine more closely matchthe estimate of the background one can infer from interpolating between fits tothe high and low frequency ends of the p-mode power spectrum.

0904.4122	new aspects of doppler imaging in sun-as-a-star observations	birmingham solar oscillations network (bison) instruments use resonantscattering spectrometers to make unresolved doppler velocity observations ofthe sun. unresolved measurements are not homogenous across the solar disc andso the observed data do not represent a uniform average over the entiresurface. the influence on the inhomogeneity of the solar rotation and limbdarkening has been considered previously (brookes et al. 1978a) and is wellunderstood. here we consider a further effect that originates from theinstrumentation itself. the intensity of light observed from a particularregion on the solar disc is dependent on the distance between that region onthe image of the solar disc formed in the instrument and the detector. themajority of bison instruments have two detectors positioned on opposite sidesof the image of the solar disc and the observations made by each detector areweighted towards differing regions of the disc. therefore the visibility andamplitudes of the solar oscillations and the realization of the solar noiseobserved by each detector will differ. we find that the modelled bias issensitive to many different parameters such as the width of solar absorptionlines, the strength of the magnetic field in the resonant scatteringspectrometer, the orientation of the sun's rotation axis, the size of the imageobserved by the instrument and the optical depth in the vapour cell. we findthat the modelled results best match the observations when the optical depth atthe centre of the vapour cell is 0.55. the inhomogeneous weighting means that a`velocity offset' is introduced into unresolved doppler velocity observationsof the sun, which varies with time, and so has an impact on the long-termstability of the observations.

0904.4126	pseudo-global fitting of gapped helioseismic data	mode fitting or "peak-bagging" is an important procedure in helioseismologyallowing one to determine the various mode parameters of solar oscillations. wehave recently developed a new "pseudo-global" fitting algorithm as a way ofreducing the systematic bias in the fits of certain mode parameters that areseen when using "local" fitting techniques to analyse "sun-as-a-star" p-modedata. this new algorithm has been designed specifically to gain the advantagesof fitting the entire power spectrum, while retaining the efficiency of localfitting techniques.  using simulated data with a full fill we have previously shown that thepseudo-global routine reduces the bias in estimates of the frequencies andasymmetries and in the estimates of the solar background when compared with atraditional fitting technique. here we present results that show that thepseudo-global routine is also effective in reducing bias in the parameterestimates when the time-series has significant gaps. as such we are now able toemploy the routine in order to fit ground based helioseismic data such as thatcollected by the birmingham solar oscillations network (bison).

0905.1722	mode lifetimes of stellar oscillations - implications for  asteroseismology	successful inference from asteroseismology relies on at least two things:that the oscillations in the stars have amplitudes large enough to be clearlyobservable; and that the oscillations themselves be stable enough to enableprecise measurements of mode frequencies and other parameters. solar-like pmodes are damped by convection, and hence the stability of the modes depends onthe lifetime.  we seek a simple scaling relation between the mean lifetime of the mostprominent solar-like p modes in stars, and the fundamental stellar parameters.  we base our search for a relation on use of stellar equilibrium and pulsationcomputations of a grid of stellar models, and the first asteroseismic resultson lifetimes of main-sequence, sub-giant and red-giant stars.  we find that the mean lifetimes of all three classes of solar-like starsscale like $t_{\rm eff}^{-4}$ (where $t_{\rm eff}$ is the effectivetemperature). when this relation is combined with the well-known scalingrelation of kjeldsen &amp; bedding (1995) for mode amplitudes observed innarrow-band intensity observations, we obtain the unexpected result that theheight (the maximum power spectral density) of mode peaks in the frequencypower spectrum scales as $g^{-2}$ (where $g$ is the surface gravity). as it isthe mode height (and not the amplitude) that fixes the s/n at which the modescan be measured, and as $g$ changes only slowly along the main sequence, thissuggests that stars cooler than the sun might be as good targets forasteroseismology as their hotter counterparts. when observations are insteadmade in doppler velocity, our results imply that mode height then does increasewith increasing effective temperature.

0906.0766	radius determination of solar-type stars using asteroseismology: what to  expect from the kepler mission	for distant stars, as observed by the nasa kepler satellite, parallaxinformation is currently of fairly low quality and is not complete. this limitsthe precision with which the absolute sizes of the stars and their potentialtransiting planets can be determined by traditional methods. asteroseismologywill be used to aid the radius determination of stars observed during nasa'skepler mission. we report on the recent asteroflag hare-and-hounds exercise#2,where a group of `hares' simulated data of f-k main-sequence stars that a groupof `hounds' sought to analyze, aimed at determining the stellar radii. based onthe asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-yeartime series data from the kepler mission, we demonstrate that the stellar radiican be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditionalstellar parameters from the kepler input catalogue. the radii found by thevarious methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the truevalues of the artificial stars to within 3%, when the large frequency spacingis used. this is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is notapplied. these results give strong confidence that radius estimation can beperformed to better than 3% for solar-like stars using automatic pipelinereduction. even when the stellar distance and luminosity are unknown we canobtain the same level of agreement.

0906.5441	sounding stellar cycles with kepler - i. strategy for selecting targets	the long-term monitoring and high photometric precision of the keplersatellite will provide a unique opportunity to sound the stellar cycles of manysolar-type stars using asteroseismology. this can be achieved by studyingperiodic changes in the amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillation modesobserved in these stars. by comparing these measurements with conventionalground-based chromospheric activity indices, we can improve our understandingof the relationship between chromospheric changes and those taking place deepin the interior throughout the stellar activity cycle. in addition,asteroseismic measurements of the convection zone depth and differentialrotation may help us determine whether stellar cycles are driven at the top orat the base of the convection zone. in this paper, we analyze the precisionthat will be possible using kepler to measure stellar cycles, convection zonedepths, and differential rotation. based on this analysis, we describe astrategy for selecting specific targets to be observed by the keplerasteroseismic investigation for the full length of the mission, to optimizetheir suitability for probing stellar cycles in a wide variety of solar-typestars.

0907.1139	analysing solar-like oscillations with an automatic pipeline	kepler mission will provide a huge amount of asteroseismic data during thenext few years, among which hundreds of solar-like stars will be targeted. theamount of stars and their observation length represent a step forward in thecomprehension of the stellar evolution that has already been initiated by corotand most missions. up to now, the slow cadence of observed targets allowed anindividual and personalized analysis of each star. during the survey phase ofkepler, this will be impossible. this is the reason why, within the asteroflagteam, we have been developing automatic pipelines for the kepler solar-likeoscillation stars. our code starts by finding the frequency-range where p-modepower is present and, after fitting the background, it looks for the modeamplitudes as well as the central frequency of the p-mode hump. a goodestimation of the large separation can thus be inferred in this region. if thesignal to noise is high enough, the code obtains the characteristics of the pmodes by doing a global fitting on the power spectrum. here, we will firstdescribe a few features of this pipeline and its application to asteroflagsynthetic data to check the validity of the code.

0907.2855	corrections of sun-as-a-star p-mode frequencies for effects of the solar  cycle	solar p-mode frequencies vary with solar activity. it is important to takethis into account when comparing the frequencies observed from epochs that spandifferent regions of the solar cycle. we present details of how to correctobserved p-mode frequencies for the effects of the solar cycle. we describethree types of correction. the first allows mode frequencies to be corrected toa nominal activity level, such as the canonical quiet-sun level. the secondaccounts for the effect on the observed mode frequencies, powers, and dampingrates of the continually varying solar cycle and is pertinent to frequenciesobtained from very long data sets. the third corrects for sun-as-a-starobservations not seeing all components of the modes. suitable combinations ofthe three correction procedures allow the frequencies obtained from differentsets of data to be compared and enable activity-independent inversions of thesolar interior. as an example of how to apply the corrections we describe thoseused to produce a set of definitive sun-as-a-star frequencies.

0907.3417	is the current lack of solar activity only skin deep?	the sun is a variable star whose magnetic activity and total irradiance varyon a timescale of approximately 11 years. the current activity minimum hasattracted considerable interest because of its unusual duration and depth. thisraises the question: what might be happening beneath the surface where themagnetic activity ultimately originates? the surface activity can be linked tothe conditions in the solar interior by the observation and analysis of thefrequencies of the sun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes.these seismic frequencies respond to changes in activity and are probes ofconditions within the sun. the birmingham solar-oscillations network (bison)has made measurements of p-mode frequencies over the last three solar activitycycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual andextended solar minimum. we show that the bison data reveal significantvariations of the p-mode frequencies during the current minimum. this is inmarked contrast to the surface activity observations, which show littlevariation over the same period. the level of the minimum is significantlydeeper in the p-mode frequencies than in the surface observations. we observe aquasi-biennial signal in the p-mode frequencies, which has not previously beenobserved at mid- and low-activity levels. the stark differences in the behaviorof the frequencies and the surface activity measures point to activity-relatedprocesses occurring in the solar interior, which are yet to reach the surface,where they may be attenuated.

0910.0848	the quest for the solar g modes	solar gravity modes (or g modes) -- oscillations of the solar interior forwhich buoyancy acts as the restoring force -- have the potential to provideunprecedented inference on the structure and dynamics of the solar core,inference that is not possible with the well observed acoustic modes (or pmodes). the high amplitude of the g-mode eigenfunctions in the core and theevanesence of the modes in the convection zone make the modes particularlysensitive to the physical and dynamical conditions in the core. owing to theexistence of the convection zone, the g modes have very low amplitudes atphotospheric levels, which makes the modes extremely hard to detect. in thispaper, we review the current state of play regarding attempts to detect gmodes. we review the theory of g modes, including theoretical estimation of theg-mode frequencies, amplitudes and damping rates. then we go on to discuss thetechniques that have been used to try to detect g modes. we review results inthe literature, and finish by looking to the future, and the potential advancesthat can be made -- from both data and data-analysis perspectives -- to giveunambiguous detections of individual g modes. the review ends by concludingthat, at the time of writing, there is indeed a consensus amongst the authorsthat there is currently no undisputed detection of solar g modes.

0912.3367	determining global parameters of the oscillations of solar-like stars	helioseismology has enabled us to better understand the solar interior, whilealso allowing us to better constrain solar models. but now is a tremendousepoch for asteroseismology as space missions dedicated to studying stellaroscillations have been launched within the last years (most and corot). corothas already proved valuable results for many types of stars, while kepler,which was launched in march 2009, will provide us with a huge number of seismicdata very soon. this is an opportunity to better constrain stellar models andto finally understand stellar structure and evolution. the goal of thisresearch work is to estimate the global parameters of any solar-likeoscillating target in an automatic manner. we want to determine the globalparameters of the acoustic modes (large separation, range of excited pressuremodes, maximum amplitude, and its corresponding frequency), retrieve thesurface rotation period of the star and use these results to estimate theglobal parameters of the star (radius and mass).to prepare the analysis ofhundreds of solar-like oscillating stars, we have developed a robust andautomatic pipeline. the pipeline consists of data analysis techniques, such asfast fourier transform, wavelets, autocorrelation, as well as the applicationof minimisation algorithms for stellar-modelling. we apply our pipeline to somesimulated lightcurves from the asteroflag team and the aarhus-asteroflagsimulator, and obtain results that are consistent with the input data to thesimulations. our strategy gives correct results for stars with magnitudes below11 with only a few 10% of bad determinations among the reliable results. wethen apply the pipeline to the sun and three corot targets.in particular wedetermine the parameters of the sun, hd49933, hd181906, and hd181420.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

1003.4167	automated asteroseismic analysis of solar-type stars	the rapidly increasing volume of asteroseismic observations on solar-typestars has revealed a need for automated analysis tools. the reason for this isnot only that individual analyses of single stars are rather time consuming,but more importantly that these large volumes of observations open thepossibility to do population studies on large samples of stars and suchpopulation studies demand a consistent analysis. by consistent analysis weunderstand an analysis that can be performed without the need to make anysubjective choices on e.g. mode identification and an analysis where theuncertainties are calculated in a consistent way.  here we present a set of automated asterosesimic analysis tools. the mainengine of these set of tools is an algorithm for modelling the autocovariancespectra of the stellar acoustic spectra allowing us to measure not only thefrequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation, but also thesmall frequency separation and potentially the mean rotational rate and theinclination.  the measured large and small frequency separations and the frequency ofmaximum power are used as input to an algorithm that estimates fundamentalstellar parameters such as mass, radius, luminosity, effective temperature,surface gravity and age based on grid modeling.  all the tools take into account the window function of the observations whichmeans that they work equally well for space-based photometry observations frome.g. the nasa kepler satellite and ground-based velocity observations from e.g.the eso harps spectrograph.

1104.4393	asteroseismic inferences on red giants in open clusters ngc 6791, ngc  6819 and ngc 6811 using kepler	context: four open clusters are present in the kepler field of view andtimeseries of nearly a year in length are now available. these timeseries allowus to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars inthe three open clusters ngc 6791, ngc 6819 and ngc 6811. from these parametersand effective temperatures, we derive mass, radii and luminosities for theclusters as well as field red giants. aims: we study the influence of evolutionand metallicity on the observed red-giant populations. methods: the globaloscillation parameters are derived using different published methods and theeffective temperatures are derived from 2mass colours. the observationalresults are compared with basti evolution models. results: we find that themass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities delta_nu vs.nu_max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under theassumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation / damping of theoscillations. the positions of the stars in the h-r diagram depend on both massand metallicity. furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field starsare bracketed by those of the cluster stars. conclusions: both the mass andmetallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the h-rdiagram of the old metal-rich cluster ngc 6791 and the middle-agedsolar-metallicity cluster ngc 6819. for the young cluster ngc 6811, theexplanation of the position of the stars in the h-r diagram challenges theassumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantlylower metallicity [fe/h] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. also, nearly all theobserved field stars seem to be older than ngc 6811 and younger than ngc 6791.

1104.5355	a new efficient method for determining weighted power spectra: detection  of low-frequency solar p-modes by analysis of bison data	we present a new and highly efficient algorithm for computing a powerspectrum made from evenly spaced data which combines the noise-reducingadvantages of the weighted fit with the computational advantages of the fastfourier transform (fft). we apply this method to a 10-year data set of thesolar p-mode oscillations obtained by the birmingham solar oscillations network(bison) and thereby uncover three new low-frequency modes. these are the l=2,n=5 and n=7 modes and the l=3, n=7 mode. in the case of the l=2, n=5 modes,this is believed to be the first such identification of this mode in theliterature. the statistical weights needed for the method are derived from acombination of the real data and a sophisticated simulation of the instrumentperformance. variations in the weights are due mainly to the differences in thenoise characteristics of the various bison instruments, the change in thosecharacteristics over time and the changing line-of-sight velocity between thestations and the sun. it should be noted that a weighted data set will have amore time-dependent signal than an unweighted set and that, consequently, itsfrequency spectrum will be more susceptible to aliasing.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1108.3807	asteroseismology from multi-month kepler photometry: the evolved  sun-like stars kic 10273246 and kic 10920273	the evolved main-sequence sun-like stars kic 10273246 (f-type) and kic10920273 (g-type) were observed with the nasa kepler satellite forapproximately ten months with a duty cycle in excess of 90%. such continuousand long observations are unprecedented for solar-type stars other than thesun.  we aimed mainly at extracting estimates of p-mode frequencies - as well as ofother individual mode parameters - from the power spectra of the light curvesof both stars, thus providing scope for a full seismic characterization.  the light curves were corrected for instrumental effects in a mannerindependent of the kepler science pipeline. estimation of individual modeparameters was based both on the maximization of the likelihood of a modeldescribing the power spectrum and on a classic prewhitening method. finally, weemployed a procedure for selecting frequency lists to be used in stellarmodeling.  a total of 30 and 21 modes of degree l=0,1,2 - spanning at least eight radialorders - have been identified for kic 10273246 and kic 10920273, respectively.two avoided crossings (l=1 ridge) have been identified for kic 10273246,whereas one avoided crossing plus another likely one have been identified forkic 10920273. good agreement is found between observed and predicted modeamplitudes for the f-type star kic 10273246, based on a revised scalingrelation. estimates are given of the rotational periods, the parametersdescribing stellar granulation and the global asteroseismic parameters$\delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm{max}}$.

1109.0869	verification of the kepler input catalog from asteroseismology of  solar-type stars	we calculate precise stellar radii and surface gravities from theasteroseismic analysis of over 500 solar-type pulsating stars observed by thekepler space telescope. these physical stellar properties are compared withthose given in the kepler input catalog (kic), determined from ground-basedmulti-color photometry. for the stars in our sample, we find general agreementbut we detect an average overestimation bias of 0.23 dex in the kicdetermination of log (g) for stars with log (g)_kic &gt; 4.0 dex, and a resultantunderestimation bias of up to 50% in the kic radii estimates for stars withr_kic &lt; 2 r sun. part of the difference may arise from selection bias in theasteroseismic sample; nevertheless, this result implies there may be fewerstars characterized in the kic with r ~ 1 r sun than is suggested by thephysical properties in the kic. furthermore, if the radius estimates are takenfrom the kic for these affected stars and then used to calculate the size oftransiting planets, a similar underestimation bias may be applied to theplanetary radii.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1109.2595	frequency dependence of the large frequency separation of solar-like  oscillators: influence of the helium second-ionization zone	the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive orders in a star is approximately proportional to the square rootof its mean density. to determine the large frequency separation as accuratelyas possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders isoften used. it is, however, known that the large frequency separation varieswith frequency in a second order effect. from observations it has been shownthat this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars thanit is for red-giant stars. here we use yrec models to verify and explain thisobservational result. we find that for stars with r &gt; 8 rsun the effect of thehelium second ionisation zone is relatively small. for these stars the deeplocation of the he ii zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a fewlarge separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to therelatively weak and extended he ii layer, causing a shallow wide depression inthe first adiabatic exponent. for less evolved stars the he ii zone is locatedcloser to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depressionin the first adiabatic exponent. this causes frequency modulations withrelatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducinga relatively large frequency modulation. additionally, we find that for lessevolved stars the he ii zone is stronger and more localised for more massivestars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude ofthe frequency modulation.

1109.3460	testing scaling relations for solar-like oscillations from the main  sequence to red giants using kepler data	we have analyzed solar-like oscillations in ~1700 stars observed by thekepler mission, spanning from the main-sequence to the red clump. usingevolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequencyof maximum power (nu_max), the large frequency separation (delta_nu) andoscillation amplitudes. we show that the difference of the delta_nu-nu_maxrelation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by differentdistributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with whatis expected from scaling relations. for oscillation amplitudes, we show thatneither (l/m)^s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by kjeldsen &amp; bedding(2011) are accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scalingrelation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculateamplitudes from the main-sequence to red-giants to a precision of ~25%. theresiduals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that anadditional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observedamplitudes. we investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellaractivity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is mostpronounced for subgiant stars. finally, we test the location of the cool edgeof the instability strip in the hertzsprung-russell diagram using solar-likeoscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with adomain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.

1110.0980	characterization of the power excess of solar-like oscillations in red  giants with kepler	we aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in kepler redgiants, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing theseparameters. from these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties ofred giant oscillations. various different methods were compared in order tovalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. for consistency, asingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevantglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of thebackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of thepower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility ofnon-radial modes. a method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillationspectrum. the comparison of the different methods has shown the important roleof the way the background is modelled. the convergence reached by thecollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning theoscillation power excess. we obtain several scaling relations, and identify theinfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. the effect of heliumburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strongmass-radius relation for clump stars. we find that none of the amplitudescaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observedmode amplitudes of red giant stars. in parallel, the degree-dependent modevisibility exhibits important variations. both effects seem related to thesignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. a familyof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties areanalyzed.

1111.2492	quasi-biennial variations in helioseismic frequencies: can the source of  the variation be localized?	we investigate the spherical harmonic degree (l) dependence of the "seismic"quasi-biennial oscillation (qbo) observed in low-degree solar p-modefrequencies, using sun-as-a-star birmingham solar oscillations network (bison)data. the amplitude of the seismic qbo is modulated by the 11-yr solar cycle,with the amplitude of the signal being largest at solar maximum. the amplitudeof the signal is noticeably larger for the l=2 and 3 modes than for the l=0 and1 modes. the seismic qbo shows some frequency dependence but this dependence isnot as strong as observed in the 11-yr solar cycle. these results areconsistent with the seismic qbo having its origins in shallow layers of theinterior (one possibility being the bottom of the shear layer extending 5percent below the solar surface). under this scenario the magnetic fluxresponsible for the seismic qbo is brought to the surface (where its influenceon the p modes is stronger) by buoyant flux from the 11-yr cycle, the strongcomponent of which is observed at predominantly low-latitudes. as the l=2 and 3modes are much more sensitive to equatorial latitudes than the l=0 and 1 modesthe influence of the 11-yr cycle on the seismic qbo is more visible in l=2 and3 mode frequencies. our results imply that close to solar maximum the maininfluence of the seismic qbo occurs at low latitudes (&lt;45 degrees), which iswhere the strong component of the 11-yr solar cycle resides. to isolate thelatitudinal dependence of the seismic qbo from the 11-yr solar cycle we mustconsider epochs when the 11-yr solar cycle is weak. however, away from solarmaximum, the amplitude of the seismic qbo is weak making the latitudinaldependence hard to constrain.

1206.3312	seismic evidence for a rapidly rotating core in a lower-giant-branch  star observed with kepler	rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and theevolution of stars. however, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport instars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account instellar models. to achieve a better understanding of these processes, wedesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,which until very recently were restricted to the sun. in this paper, we reportthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in thecore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giantkic7341231, which was observed during one year with the kepler spacecraft. byperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show thatits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able todetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. we then find astellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismicproperties of the star. we use this model to perform inversions of the internalrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of thestar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. this will shednew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. inparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angularmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, whichcould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed overthe last decades.

1207.0615	solar-like oscillations in red giants observed with \textit{kepler}:  influence of increased timespan on global oscillation parameters	the length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the kepler satelliteanalysed here span 19 months. kepler provides the longest continuous timeseriescurrently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increasedtimespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. we find that ingeneral a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary toobtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95%of the stars, but this does depend on &lt;dnu&gt;. in a statistical sense the quoteduncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of theobtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to beoverestimated for results of longer runs. furthermore, the differentdefinitions of the global parameters used in the different methods havenon-negligible effects on the obtained values. additionally, we show that thereis a correlation between nu_max and the flux variance. we conclude that longertimeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes(from ~60% in 50 day runs to &gt; 95% in 400 day runs with a slight methoddependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters.the trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longertimeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the medianabsolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). this work showsthat global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long datasets- using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state ofthe stars.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1211.0146	galactic archaeology: mapping and dating stellar populations with  asteroseismology of red-giant stars	our understanding of how the galaxy was formed and evolves is severelyhampered by the lack of precise constraints on basic stellar properties such asdistances, masses, and ages. here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giantsrepresent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning alarge age range, which can be used to map and date the galactic disc in theregions probed by observations made by the corot and kepler space telescopes.when combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of suchevolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but alsoprovide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxiesfor the ages of the stars. as a first application we consider red giantsobserved by corot in two different parts of the milky way, and determineprecise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of thegalactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solarneighbourhood. we find significant differences in the mass distributions ofthese two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models ofthe milky way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in thedistribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. in the future, theavailability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will notonly improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints onage-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different galactocentric radiiand heights from the plane.

0712.2931	distortion of the p-mode peak profiles by the solar-cycle frequency  shifts: do we need to worry?	we seek to address whether solar-cycle frequency shifts of the sun's low-l pmodes `distort' the underlying shapes of the mode peaks, when those peaks areobserved in power frequency spectra made from data spanning large fractions, ormore, of the cycle period. we present analytical descriptions of the expectedprofiles, and validate the predictions through use of artificial seismictimeseries data, in which temporal variations of the oscillator frequencies areintroduced. our main finding is that for the sun-like frequency shifts thedistortion of the asymmetrical lorentzian-like profiles is very small, but alsojust detectible. our analysis indicates that by fitting modes to the usuallorentzian-like models -- which do not allow for the distortion -- rather thannew models we derive, there is a bias in the mode height and linewidthparameters that is comparable in size to the observational uncertainties givenby multi-year datasets. bias in the frequency parameter gives much less causefor worry, being over an order of magnitude smaller than the correspondingfrequency uncertainties. the distortion discussed in this paper may need to beconsidered when multi-year sun-like asteroseismic datasets are analyzed onstars showing strong activity cycles.

1304.2772	stellar ages and convective cores in field main-sequence stars: first  asteroseismic application to two kepler targets	using asteroseismic data and stellar evolution models we make the firstdetection of a convective core in a kepler field main-sequence star, putting astringent constraint on the total size of the mixed zone and showing that extramixing beyond the formal convective boundary exists. in a slightly less massivetarget the presence of a convective core cannot be conclusively discarded, andthus its remaining main-sequence life time is uncertain. our results revealthat best-fit models found solely by matching individual frequencies ofoscillations corrected for surface effects do not always properly reproducefrequency combinations. moreover, slightly different criteria to define whatthe best-fit model is can lead to solutions with similar global properties butvery different interior structures. we argue that the use of frequency ratiosis a more reliable way to obtain accurate stellar parameters, and show that ouranalysis in field main-sequence stars can yield an overall precision of 1.5%,4%, and 10% in radius, mass and age, respectively. we compare our results withthose obtained from global oscillation properties, and discuss the possiblesources of uncertainties in asteroseismic stellar modeling where furtherstudies are still needed.

1305.6586	asteroseismic surface gravity for evolved stars	context: asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance indetermining spectroscopic stellar parameters. the independent log(g) value fromasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis toreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. since 2012, a combined analysisof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing fora large survey with sdss/apogee and kepler. therefore, knowledge of anypotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is nowbecoming important. aims: the seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is thefrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). here, we investigate theinfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)values. the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive radial orders (dnu) is often used as an additional constraint forthe determination of log(g). additionally, we checked the influence of smallcorrections applied to dnu on the derived values of log(g). methods we usemethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and dnutogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derivelog(g). results: we find that different approaches to derive oscillationparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases forred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. these biases are well within the quoteduncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). corrections suggested in the literature tothe dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). however somewhatunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the orderof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar referencevalues are used.

1306.4323	tests of the asymptotic large frequency separation of acoustic  oscillations in solar-type and red giant stars	asteroseismology, i.e. the study of the internal structures of stars viatheir global oscillations, is a valuable tool to obtain stellar parameters suchas mass, radius, surface gravity and mean density. these parameters can beobtained using certain scaling relations which are based on an asymptoticapproximation. usually the observed oscillation parameters are assumed tofollow these scaling relations. recently, it has been questioned whether thisis a valid approach, i.e., whether the order of the observed oscillation modesare high enough to be approximated with an asymptotic theory. in this work weuse stellar models to investigate whether the differences between observableoscillation parameters and their asymptotic estimates are indeed significant.we compute the asymptotic values directly from the stellar models and derivethe observable values from adiabatic pulsation calculations of the same models.we find that the extent to which the atmosphere is included in the models is akey parameter. considering a larger extension of the atmosphere beyond thephotosphere reduces the difference between the asymptotic and observable valuesof the large frequency separation. therefore, we conclude that the currentlysuggested discrepancies in the scaling relations might have been overestimated.hence, based on the results presented here we believe that the suggestions ofmosser et al. (2013) should not be followed without careful consideration.

1311.6990	study of kic 8561221 observed by kepler: an early red giant showing  depressed dipolar modes	the continuous high-precision photometric observations provided by the corotand kepler space missions have allowed us to better understand the structureand dynamics of red giants using asteroseismic techniques. a small fraction ofthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. the reductionin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximumpower. in this work we want to characterize kic 8561221 in order to confirmthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and todiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipolemode amplitudes. we used kepler short- and long-cadence data combined withspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of kic8561221. we then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to thereduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or theeffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. we also performed adetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. we have been able tocharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes abovenu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. we have inferred a surfacerotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation inthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. as expected, theinternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 timesfaster than the surface. with our grid of standard models we are able toproperly fit the observed frequencies. our model calculation of mode inertiaand damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. a fast rotatingcore is also ruled out as a possible explanation. finally, we do not have anyobservational evidence of the presence of a strong deep magnetic field insidethe star.

1312.4907	measurement of acoustic glitches in solar-type stars from oscillation  frequencies observed by kepler	for the very best and brightest asteroseismic solar-type targets observed bykepler, the frequency precision is sufficient to determine the acoustic depthsof the surface convective layer and the helium ionization zone. such sharpfeatures inside the acoustic cavity of the star, which we call acousticglitches, create small oscillatory deviations from the uniform spacing offrequencies in a sequence of oscillation modes with the same spherical harmonicdegree. we use these oscillatory signals to determine the acoustic locations ofsuch features in 19 solar-type stars observed by the kepler mission. fourindependent groups of researchers utilized the oscillation frequenciesthemselves, the second differences of the frequencies and the ratio of thesmall and large separation to locate the base of the convection zone and thesecond helium ionization zone. despite the significantly different methods ofanalysis, good agreement was found between the results of these four groups,barring a few cases. these results also agree reasonably well with thelocations of these layers in representative models of the stars. these resultsfirmly establish the presence of the oscillatory signals in the asteroseismicdata and the viability of several techniques to determine the location ofacoustic glitches inside stars.

0802.1418	the visibility of low-frequency solar acoustic modes	we make predictions of the detectability of low-frequency p modes. estimatesof the powers and damping times of these low-frequency modes are found byextrapolating the observed powers and widths of higher-frequency modes withlarge observed signal-to-noise ratios. the extrapolations predict that thelow-frequency modes will have small signal-to-noise ratios and narrow widths ina frequency-power spectrum. monte carlo simulations were then performed wheretimeseries containing mode signals and normally distributed gaussian noise wereproduced. the mode signals were simulated to have the powers and damping timespredicted by the extrapolations. various statistical tests were then performedon the frequency-amplitude spectra formed from these timeseries to investigatethe fraction of spectra in which the modes could be detected. the results ofthese simulations were then compared to the number of p-modes candidatesobserved in real sun-as-a-star data at low frequencies. the fraction ofsimulated spectra in which modes were detected decreases rapidly as thefrequency of modes decreases and so the fraction of simulations in which thelow-frequency modes were detected was very small. however, increasing thesignal-to-noise (s/n) ratio of the low-frequency modes by a factor of 2 abovethe extrapolated values led to significantly more detections. therefore effortsshould continue to further improve the quality of solar data that is currentlyavailable.

1401.3096	seismic constraints on the radial dependence of the internal rotation  profiles of six kepler subgiants and young red giants	context : we still do not know which mechanisms are responsible for thetransport of angular momentum inside stars. the recent detection of mixed modesthat contain the signature of rotation in the spectra of kepler subgiants andred giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this issue.  aims: our aim is to probe the radial dependance of the rotation profiles fora sample of kepler targets. for this purpose, subgiants and early red giantsare particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings aremore sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case fortheir more evolved counterparts.  methods: we first extract the rotational splittings and frequencies of themodes for six young kepler red giants. we then perform a seismic modeling ofthese stars using the evolutionary codes cesam2k and astec. by using theobserved splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, weperform inversions of the internal rotation profiles of the six stars.  results: we obtain estimates of the mean rotation rate in the core and in theconvective envelope of these stars. we show that the rotation contrast betweenthe core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. our resultsalso suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, contrary to the rgbstars whose core has been shown to spin down. for two of the stars, we showthat a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces theobserved splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile.interestingly, the depths that are found most probable for the discontinuitiesroughly coincide with the location of the h-burning shell, which separates thelayers that contract from those that expand. these results will bringobservational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport instars.

1403.7045	prospects for asteroseismic inference on the envelope helium abundance  in red giant stars	regions of rapid variation in the internal structure of a star are oftenreferred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodicsignature in the frequencies of p modes. here we examine the localizeddisturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branchand clump stars. more specifically, we determine how accurately and preciselythe parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillationfrequencies of stellar models. we use models produced by three differentgeneration codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution alongthe red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances.we discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accuratelydetermine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. thedetermined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencieswere found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabaticexponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge ofthe second ionization zone of helium. finally, we consider whether this methodcan be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. although adefinite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction wouldbe difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly differenthelium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameterscan be reduced. however, application of our methodology could be useful fordistinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globularclusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances havebeen observed.

1409.0696	super-nyquist asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators with kepler and  k2 - expanding the asteroseismic cohort at the base of the red-giant branch	we consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the"super-nyquist" regime of long-cadence (lc) kepler photometry, i.e., above theassociated nyquist frequency of approximately 283 {\mu}hz. targets of interestare cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red-giantbranch. these stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (sc)data, since the associated sc nyquist frequency lies well above the frequenciesof the detectable oscillations. however, the number of available sc targetslots is quite limited. this imposes a severe restriction on the size of theensemble available for sc asteroseismic study.we find that archival kepler lcdata from the nominal mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies oftargets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as approximately 500{\mu}hz, i.e., about 1.75- times the lc nyquist frequency. the frequencydetection threshold for the shorter-duration science campaigns of there-purposed kepler mission, k2, is lower. the maximum threshold will probablylie somewhere between approximately 400 and 450 {\mu}hz. the potential toexploit the archival kepler and k2 lc data in this manner opens the door toincreasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red-gianttargets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitationsimposed by the small number of sc slots.we estimate that around 400 suchtargets are now available for study in the kepler lc archive. that number couldpotentially be a lot higher for k2, since there will be a new target list foreach of its campaigns.

1411.1082	mixed modes in red giants: a window on stellar evolution	the detection of oscillations with a mixed character in subgiants and redgiants allows us to probe the physical conditions in their cores. with thesemixed modes, we aim at determining seismic markers of stellar evolution. keplerasteroseismic data were selected to map various evolutionary stages and stellarmasses. seismic evolutionary tracks were then drawn with the combination of thefrequency and period spacings. we measured the asymptotic period spacing formore than 1170 stars at various evolutionary stages. this allows us to monitorstellar evolution from the main sequence to the asymptotic giant branch anddraw seismic evolutionary tracks. we present clear quantified asteroseismicdefinitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, inparticular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giantbranch, and the end of the horizontal branch.the seismic information is soprecise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models.the quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling,especially for studying the energy transport in the helium-burning core or forspecifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giantbranches. modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to bein the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting thesecondary clump, or stars that could be in the blue-loop stage.

1501.06227	an ancient extrasolar system with five sub-earth-size planets	the chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii lessthan four earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts,which tend to be metal-rich. this implies that small, including earth-size,planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's historywhen metals were more scarce. we report kepler spacecraft observations ofkepler-444, a metal-poor sun-like star from the old population of the galacticthick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets withsizes between those of mercury and venus. we validate this system as a truefive-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailedcharacterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysisof the transit photometry. kepler-444 is the densest star with detectedsolar-like oscillations. we use asteroseismology to directly measure a preciseage of 11.2+/-1.0 gyr for the host star, indicating that kepler-444 formed whenthe universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldestknown system of terrestrial-size planets. we thus show that earth-size planetshave formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8-billion-year history,leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy.the age of kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among thehosts to the first galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint thebeginning of the era of planet formation.

0804.4371	challenges for asteroseismic analysis of sun-like stars	asteroseismology of sun-like stars is undergoing rapid expansion with, forexample, new data from the corot mission and continuation of ground-basedcampaigns. there is also the exciting upcoming prospect of nasa's keplermission, which will allow the asteroseismic study of several hundred sun-liketargets, in some cases for periods lasting up to a few years. the seismic modeparameters are the input data needed for making inference on stars and theirinternal structures. in this paper we discuss the ease with which it will bepossible to extract estimates of individual mode parameters, dependent on themass, age, and visual brightness of the star. our results are generallyapplicable; however, we look at mode detectability in the context of theupcoming kepler observations. to inform our discussions we make predictions ofvarious seismic parameters. to do this we use simple empirical scalingrelations and detailed pulsation computations of the stochastic excitation anddamping characteristics of the sun-like p modes. the issues related toparameter extraction on individual p modes discussed here are modedetectability, the detectability and impact of stellar activity cycles, and theability to measure properties of rotationally split components, which isdependent on the relative importance of the rotational characteristics of thestar and the damping of the stochastically excited p modes.

1504.07992	ages and fundamental properties of kepler exoplanet host stars from  asteroseismology	we present a study of 33 {\it kepler} planet-candidate host stars for whichasteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio toallow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. we implement a newbayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillationfrequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, andderive robust fundamental properties for these targets. applying this scheme togrids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statisticaluncertainties of 1.2\% (radius), 1.7\% (density), 3.3\% (mass), 4.4\%(distance), and 14\% (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with themost precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. we assessthe systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-lengthparameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. we alsodetermine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms andexplore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsationcodes, resulting in 1\% in density and radius, and 2\% and 7\% in mass and age,respectively. we confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundancebeing a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, anddiscuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combiningasteroseismology and data from space missions. finally we compare our derivedproperties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismicobservables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding anexcellent level of agreement. owing to selection effects, our results show thatthe majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic {\it kepler} hoststars are older than the sun.

1505.06087	a test of the asteroseismic numax scaling relation for solar-like  oscillations in main-sequence and sub-giant stars	large-scale analyses of stellar samples comprised of cool, solar-likeoscillators now commonly utilize the so-called asteroseismic scaling relationsto estimate fundamental stellar properties. in this paper we present a test ofthe scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter $\nu_{\rm max}$,the frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observedpulsation amplitude. the classic relation assumes that this characteristicfrequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effectivetemperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency foracoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e., $\nu_{\rm max} \proptogt_{\rm eff}^{-1/2}$. we test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequenceand sub-giant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismictargets observed by the nasa \emph{kepler} mission. our results, which comefrom a grid-based analysis, rule out departures from the classic $gt_{\rmeff}^{-1/2}$ scaling dependence at the level of $\simeq 1.5\,\rm per cent$ overthe full $\simeq 1560\,\rm k$ range in $t_{\rm eff}$ that we tested. there issome uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the scaling. however, anyvariation with $t_{\rm eff}$ is evidently small, with limits similar to thoseabove.

1506.08931	oscillating red giants observed during campaign 1 of the kepler k2  mission: new prospects for galactic archaeology	nasa's re-purposed kepler mission -- dubbed k2 -- has brought new scientificopportunities that were not anticipated for the original kepler mission. onescience goal that makes optimal use of k2's capabilities, in particular its360-degree ecliptic field of view, is galactic archaeology -- the study of theevolution of the galaxy from the fossil stellar record. the thrust of thisresearch is to exploit high-precision, time-resolved photometry from k2 inorder to detect oscillations in red giant stars. this asteroseismic informationcan provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass and age of vastnumbers of stars across the galaxy. here we present the initial analysis of asubset of red giants, observed towards the north galactic gap, during themission's first full science campaign. we investigate the feasibility of usingk2 data for detecting oscillations in red giants that span a range in apparentmagnitude and evolutionary state (hence intrinsic luminosity). we demonstratethat oscillations are detectable for essentially all cool giants within the$\log g$ range $\sim 1.9-3.2$. our detection is complete down to$\mathit{kp}\sim 14.5$, which results in a seismic sample with little or nodetection bias. this sample is ideally suited to stellar population studiesthat seek to investigate potential shortcomings of contemporary galaxy models.

1509.06894	validation of solar-cycle changes in low-degree helioseismic parameters  from the birmingham solar-oscillations network	we present a new and up-to-date analysis of the solar low-degree $p$-modeparameter shifts from the birmingham solar-oscillations network (bison) overthe past 22 years, up to the end of 2014. we aim to demonstrate that they arenot dominated by changes in the asymmetry of the resonant peak profiles of themodes and that the previously published results on the solar-cycle variationsof mode parameters are reliable. we compare the results obtained using aconventional maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and a new one based on themarkov chain monte carlo (mcmc) technique, both taking into account modeasymmetry. we assess the reliability of the solar-cycle trends seen in the databy applying the same analysis to artificially generated spectra. we find thatthe two methods are in good agreement. both methods accurately reproduce theinput frequency shifts in the artificial data and underestimate the amplitudeand width changes by a small amount, around 10 per cent. we confirm earlierfindings that the frequency and line width are positively correlated, and themode amplitude anticorrelated, with the level of solar activity, with theenergy supplied to the modes remaining essentially unchanged. for the modeasymmetry the correlation with activity is marginal, but the mcmc algorithmgives more robust results than the mle. the magnitude of the parameter shiftsis consistent with earlier work. there is no evidence that the frequencychanges we see arise from changes in the asymmetry, which would need to be muchlarger than those observed in order to give the observed frequency shift.

0807.0989	solarflag hare and hounds: estimation of p-mode frequencies from  sun-as-star helioseismology data	we report on the results of the latest solarflag hare-and-hounds exercise,which was concerned with testing methods for extraction of frequencies oflow-degree solar p modes from data collected by sun-as-a-star observations. wehave used the new solarflag simulator, which includes the effects of correlatedmode excitation and correlations with background noise, to make artificialtimeseries data that mimic doppler velocity observations of the sun as a star.the correlations give rise to asymmetry of mode peaks in the frequency powerspectrum. ten members of the group (the hounds) applied their ``peak bagging''codes to a 3456-day dataset, and the estimated mode frequencies were returnedto the hare (who was wjc) for comparison. analysis of the results reveals asystematic bias in the estimated frequencies of modes above approximately 1.8mhz. the bias is negative, meaning the estimated frequencies systematicallyunderestimate the input frequencies.  we identify two sources that are the dominant contributions to the frequencybias. both sources involve failure to model accurately subtle aspects of theobserved power spectral density in the part (window) of the frequency powerspectrum that is being fitted. one source of bias arises from a failure toaccount for the power spectral density coming from all those modes whosefrequencies lie outside the fitting windows. the other source arises from afailure to account for the power spectral density of the weak l=4 and 5 modes,which are often ignored in sun-as-a-star analysis. the sun-as-a-starpeak-bagging codes need to allow for both sources, otherwise the frequenciesare likely to be biased.

astro-ph;0607172	frequency, splitting, linewidth and amplitude estimates of low-l p modes  of alpha cen a: analysis of wire photometry	we present results of fitting the 50-day time series of photometry of alphacen a taken by the wire satellite in 1999. both power spectrum andautocovariance function (acf) fitting techniques were used in an attempt todetermine mode frequencies, rotational splittings, lifetimes and amplitudes oflow-l p-modes. in all, using both techniques, we managed to fit 18 modes (sevenl = 0, eight l = 1 and three l = 2) with frequencies determined to within 1 - 2micro-hz. these estimates are shown to be 0.6 +/- 0.3 micro-hz lower, onaverage, than the frequencies determined from two other more recent studies(bouchy &amp; carrier, 2002; bedding et al. 2004) which used data gathered about 19months after the wire observations. this could be indicative of an activitycycle, although due to the large uncertainty, more data would be needed toconfirm this.  over a range of 1700 to 2650 micro-hz we were also able to use the acffitting to determine an average lifetime of 3.9 +/- 1.4 days, and an averagerotational splitting of 0.54 +/- 0.22 micro-hz, which is the first everreliable estimate of this parameter. in contrast to the acf, the power spectrumfitting was shown to return significantly biased results for these parameters.

astro-ph;0609156	sun-as-a-star observations: evidence for degree dependence of changes in  damping of low-l p modes along the solar cycle	we use 9.5-yr of bison sun-as-a-star data to search for dependence ofsolar-cycle parameter changes on the angular degree, l, of the data. the natureof the sun-as-a-star observations is such that for changes measured at fixedfrequency, or for changes averaged across the same range in frequency, any ldependence present carries information on the latitudinal distribution of theagent (i.e., the activity) responsible for those changes. we split the 9.5-yrtimeseries into contiguous 108-d pieces, and determine mean changes in thedamping of, power in, and energy supplied to the modes through the solar cycle.we also apply a careful correction to account for the deleterious effects ofthe ground-based bison window function on the results. from our full analysiswe obtain a marginally significant result for the damping parameter, where themean change is found to be weakest at l=0. the other parameters show hints ofsome dependence in l. our main conclusion is that the mean fractionalsolar-cycle change in the l=0 damping rates is approximately 50 % smaller thanwas previously assumed. it had been common practice to use an average over alllow-l modes; our downward revision of the radial-mode value has implicationsfor comparisons with models of the global solar cycle changes, which areusually based on a spherically symmetric geometry.

astro-ph;9702105	solar internal sound speed as inferred from combined bison and lowl  oscillation frequencies	observations of the sun with the lowl instrument provide a homogeneous set ofsolar p-mode frequencies from low to intermediate degree which allows one todetermine the structure of much of the solar interior avoiding systematicerrors that are introduced when different data sets are combined, i.e.,principally the effects of solar cycle changes on the frequencies.unfortunately, the lowl data set contains very few of the lowest-degree modes,which are essential for determining reliably the structure of the solar core -in addition, these lowest-degree data have fairly large associateduncertainties. however, observations made by the birmingham solar-oscillationsnetwork (bison) in integrated sunlight provide high-accuracy measurements of alarge number of low-degree modes. in this paper we demonstrate that thelow-degree mode set of the lowl data can be successfully combined with the moreaccurate bison data, provided the observations are contemporaneous for thosefrequencies where the solar-cycle-induced effects are important. we show thatthis leads to a factor-of-two decrease in the error on the inferred sound speedin the solar core. we find that the solar sound speed is higher than in solarmodels for r &lt; 0.2rsun. the density of the solar core is, however, lower thanthat in solar models.

0810.5022	excitation and damping of p-mode oscillations of alpha cen b	this paper presents an analysis of observational data on the p-mode spectrumof the star alpha cen b and a comparison with theoretical computations of thestochastic excitation and damping of the modes. we find that at frequencies &gt;4500 micro-hz, the model damping rates appear to be too weak to explain theobserved shape of the power spectral density of alpha cen b. the conclusionrests on the assumption that most of the disagreement is due to problemsmodelling the damping rates, not the excitation rates, of the modes. thisassumption is supported by a parallel analysis of bison sun-as-a-star data, forwhich it is possible to use analysis of very long timeseries to place tightconstraints on the assumption. the bison analysis shows that there is a similarhigh-frequency disagreement between theory and observation in the sun.  we demonstrate that by using suitable comparisons of theory and observationit is possible to make inference on the dependence of the p-mode linewidths onfrequency, without directly measuring those linewidths, even though the alphacen b dataset is only a few nights long. use of independent measures from aprevious study of the alpha cen b linewidths in two parts of its spectrum alsoallows us to calibrate our linewidth estimates for the star. the resultingcalibrated linewidth curve looks similar to a frequency-scaled version of itssolar cousin, with the scaling factor equal to the ratio of the respectiveacoustic cut-off frequencies of the two stars. the ratio of the frequencies atwhich the onset of high-frequency problems is seen in both stars is also givenapproximately by the same scaling factor.
