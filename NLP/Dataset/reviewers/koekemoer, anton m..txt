0905.0162	mid-ir luminosities and uv/optical star formation rates at z&lt;1.4	uv continuum and mid-ir emission constitute two widely used star formationindicators at intermediate and high redshifts. we study 2430 galaxies withz&lt;1.4 in the extended groth strip with mips 24 mic observations from fidel,spectroscopy from deep2, and uv, optical, and near-ir photometry from aegis.the data are coupled with stellar population models and bayesian sed fitting toestimate dust-corrected sfrs. in order to probe the dust heating from stellarpopulations of various ages, the derived sfrs were averaged over varioustimescales--from 100 myr for "current" sfr to 1--3 gyr for long-timescale sfrs.these sed-based uv/optical sfrs are compared to total infrared luminositiesextrapolated from 24 mic observations. we find that for the blue, actively starforming galaxies the correlation between the ir luminosity and the uv/opticalsfr shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer sfr-averagingtimescales. we interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellarpopulations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. this holds overthe entire redshift range. many so-called green valley galaxies are simplydust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. however, there exist 24mic-detected galaxies, some with l&gt;10^11 l_sun, yet with little current starformation. for them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light issufficient to produce the observed levels of ir. in our sample optical andx-ray agns do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-irluminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "ir excess"galaxies (abridged).

0906.1010	studying large and small scale environments of ultraviolet luminous  galaxies	studying the environments of 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2 uv-selected galaxies, as examples ofextreme star-forming galaxies (with star formation rates in the range of 3-30m_sol/yr), we explore the relationship between high rates of star-formation,host halo mass and pair fractions. we study the large-scale and small-scaleenvironments of local ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) by measuringangular correlation functions. we cross-correlate these systems with othergalaxy samples: a volume-limited sample (all), a blue luminous galaxy sample(blg) and a luminous red galaxy sample (lrg). we determine the uvlg comovingcorrelation length to be r_0=4.8(+11.6/-2.4) h^-1 mpc at &lt;z&gt; =1.0, which isunable to constrain the halo mass for this sample. however, we find that uvlgsform close (separation &lt; 30 kpc) pairs with the all sample, but do notfrequently form pairs with lrgs. a rare subset of uvlgs, those with the highestfuv surface brightnesses, are believed to be local analogs of high redshiftlyman break galaxies (lbgs) and are called lyman break analogs (lbas). lbgs andlbas share similar characteristics (i.e., color, size, surface brightness,specific star formation rates, metallicities, and dust content). recent hstimages of z~0.2 lbas show disturbed morphologies, signs of mergers andinteractions. uvlgs may be influenced by interactions with other galaxies andwe discuss this result in terms of other high star-forming, merging systems.

0907.5199	massive galaxies in cosmos: evolution of black hole versus bulge mass  but not versus total stellar mass over the last 9 gyrs?	we constrain the ratio of black hole (bh) mass to total stellar mass oftype-1 agn in the cosmos survey at 1&lt;z&lt;2. for 10 agn at mean redshift z~1.4with both hst/acs and hst/nicmos imaging data we are able to compute totalstellar mass m_(*,total), based on restframe uv-to-optical host galaxy colorswhich constrain mass-to-light ratios. all objects have virial bh mass-estimatesavailable from the cosmos magellan/imacs and zcosmos surveys. we find zerodifference between the m_bh--m_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation in the local universe.  our interpretation is: (a) if our objects were purely bulge-dominated, them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. however, (b) since wehave evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies(logm_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logm_bh~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. since allnecessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation oraddition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. merging, inaddition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both bh andstellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final m_bh/m_(*,bulge)ratio.  since the overall cosmic stellar and bh mass buildup trace each other tightlyover time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independentof any strong bh-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling bh and bulgemass until the present is very indirect.

0908.0739	early-type galaxies in the pears survey: probing the stellar populations  at moderate redshift	using hst/acs slitless grism spectra from the pears program, we study thestellar populations of morphologically selected early-type galaxies in thegoods north and south fields. the sample - extracted from a visualclassification of the (v2.0) hst/acs images and restricted to redshifts z&gt;0.4 -comprises 228 galaxies (f775w&lt;24 abmag) out to z~1.3 over 320 arcmin2, with amedian redshift zm=0.75. this work significantly increases our previous samplefrom the grapes survey in the hudf (18 galaxies over ~11 arcmin2; pasquali etal. 2006b). the grism data allow us to separate the sample into `red' and`blue' spectra, with the latter comprising 15% of the total. three differentgrids of models parameterising the star formation history are used to fit thelow-resolution spectra. over the redshift range of the sample - correspondingto a cosmic age between 5 and 10 gyr - we find a strong correlation betweenstellar mass and average age, whereas the **spread** of ages (defined by therms of the distribution) is roughly ~1 gyr and independent of stellar mass. thebest-fit parameters suggest it is formation epoch and not formation timescale,that best correlates with mass in early-type galaxies. this result - along withthe recently observed lack of evolution of the number density of massivegalaxies - motivates the need for a channel of (massive) galaxy formationbypassing any phase in the blue cloud, as suggested by the simulations of dekelet al. (2009).

0910.2672	the nature of optically dull active galactic nuclei in cosmos	we present infrared, optical, and x-ray data of 48 x-ray bright, opticallydull agns in the cosmos field. these objects exhibit the x-ray luminosity of anactive galactic nucleus (agn) but lack broad and narrow emission lines in theiroptical spectrum. we show that despite the lack of optical emission lines, mostof these optically dull agns are not well-described by a typical passive redgalaxy spectrum: instead they exhibit weak but significant blue emission likean unobscured agn. photometric observations over several years additionallyshow significant variability in the blue emission of four optically dull agns.the nature of the blue and infrared emission suggest that the opticallyinactive appearance of these agns cannot be caused by obscuration intrinsic tothe agns. instead, up to ~70% of optically dull agns are diluted by theirhosts, with bright or simply edge-on hosts lying preferentially within thespectroscopic aperture. the remaining ~30% of optically dull agns haveanomalously high f_x/f_o ratios and are intrinsically weak, not obscured, inthe optical. these optically dull agns are best described as a weakly accretingagn with a truncated accretion disk from a radiatively inefficient accretionflow.

1005.4727	moircs deep survey. vi. near-infrared spectroscopy of k-selected  star-forming galaxies at z~2	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy for 37 bzk-color-selectedstar-forming galaxies with moircs on subaru. the sample is drawn from theks-band selected catalog of the moircs deep survey (mods) in the goods-nregion. about half of our samples are selected from the mips 24um-sourcecatalog. ha emission lines are detected from 23 galaxies, of which the medianredshift is 2.12. we derived the star formation rates (sfrs) fromextinction-corrected ha luminosities. the extinction correction is estimatedfrom the sed fitting of multi-band photometric data covering uv to nirwavelengths. the balmer decrement of the stacked emission lines shows that theamount of extinction for the ionized gas is larger than that for the stellarcontinuum. from a comparison of the extinction corrected ha luminosity andother sfr indicators we found that the relation between the dust properties ofstellar continuum and ionized gas is different depending on the intrinsic sfr.the comparison between the ha sfr and stellar mass estimated from sed fittingshows no correlation between them. some galaxies with stellar mass smaller than~10^10 msun show sfrs higher than ~100 msun/yr. the specific sfrs (ssfrs) ofthese galaxies are remarkably high. the average stellar-population age of thesehigh-ssfr galaxies is younger than 100 myr, which is consistent with theimplied high ssfr. the large sfr implies the possibility that the high ssfrgalaxies significantly contribute to the cosmic sfr density of the universe atz~2. the total sfr density estimated from the ha emission line galaxies is0.089-0.136 msun/yr/mpc^3, which is consistent with the total sfr densities inthe literature. the metallicity of the high-ssfr galaxies is larger than thatexpected from the mass-metallicity relation of uv-selected galaxies at z~2 byerb et al.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

1008.3384	a new extensive catalog of optically variable agn in the goods fields  and a new statistical approach to variability selection	variability is a property shared by practically all agn. this makesvariability selection a possible technique for identifying agn. given thatvariability selection makes no prior assumption about spectral properties, itis a powerful technique for detecting both low-luminosity agn in which the hostgalaxy emission is dominating and agn with unusual spectral properties. in thispaper, we will discuss and test different statistical methods for the detectionof variability in sparsely sampled data that allow full control over the falsepositive rates. we will apply these methods to the goods north and south fieldsand present a catalog of variable sources in the z band in both goods fields.out of 11931 objects checked, we find 155 variable sources at a significancelevel of 99.9%, corresponding to about 1.3% of all objects. after rejection ofstars and supernovae, 139 variability selected agn remain. their magnitudesreach down as faint as 25.5 mag in z. spectroscopic redshifts are available for22 of the variability selected agn, ranging from 0.046 to 3.7. the absolutemagnitudes in the rest-frame z-band range from ~ -18 to -24, reachingsubstantially fainter than the typical luminosities probed by traditional x-rayand spectroscopic agn selection in these fields. therefore, this is a powerfultechnique for future exploration of the evolution of the faint end of the agnluminosity function up to high redshifts.

1009.3265	the bulk of the black hole growth since z~1 occurs in a secular  universe: no major merger-agn connection	what is the relevance of major mergers and interactions as triggeringmechanisms for active galactic nuclei (agn) activity? to answer thislongstanding question, we analyze 140 xmm-selected agn host galaxies and amatched control sample of 1264 inactive galaxies over z~0.3-1.0 andlog(m_*/m_sun)&lt;11.7 with high-resolution hst/acs imaging from the cosmos field.the visual analysis of their morphologies by 10 independent human classifiersyields a measure of the fraction of distorted morphologies in the agn andcontrol samples, i.e. quantifying the signature of recent mergers which mightpotentially be responsible for fueling/triggering the agn. we find that (1) thevast majority (&gt;85%) of the agn host galaxies do not show strong distortions,and (2) there is no significant difference in the distortion fractions betweenactive and inactive galaxies. our findings provide the best direct evidencethat, since z~1, the bulk of black hole accretion has not been triggered bymajor galaxy mergers, therefore arguing that the alternative mechanisms, i.e.,secular processes and minor interactions, are the leading triggers for theepisodes of major black hole growth. we also exclude an alternativeinterpretation of our results: a significant time lag between merging and theobservability of the agn phase could wash out the most significant mergingsignatures, explaining the lack of enhancement of strong distortions on the agnhosts. we show that this alternative scenario is unlikely due to: (1) recentmajor mergers being ruled out for the majority of sources due to the highfraction of disk-hosted agn, (2) the lack of a significant x-ray signal inmerging inactive galaxies as a signature of a potential buried agn, and (3) thelow levels of soft x-ray obscuration for agn hosted by interacting galaxies, incontrast to model predictions.

1011.6370	the star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the cosmos field	we explore the evolution of the specific star formation rate (ssfr) for3.6um-selected galaxies of different m_* in the cosmos field. the average sfrfor sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4ghz radio continuumemission. we separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (sf)that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frameoptical sed. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;3 both populations show a strong and m_*-independentdecrease in their ssfr towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for sf sources. the decrease appears tohave started at z&gt;2, at least above 4x10^10m_sun where our conclusions are mostrobust. we find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, ssfr (m_*)^beta,between ssfr and m_* at all z. it tends to flatten below ~10^10m_sun ifquiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_sfg-0.4 fits the correlation. on average, higher m_* objects always have lowerssfrs, also among sf galaxies. at z&gt;1.5 there is tentative evidence for anupper ssfr-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. it is suggested by aflattening of the ssfr-m_* relation (also for sf sources), but affects massive(&gt;10^10m_sun) galaxies only at the highest z. below z=1.5 there thus is nodirect evidence that galaxies of higher m_* experience a more rapid waning oftheir ssfr than lower m_* sf systems. in this sense, the data rule out anystrong 'downsizing'. we combine our results with recent measurements of thegalaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass ofa sf galaxy (m_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)m_sun). in this sense, too, there is no'downsizing'. our analysis constitutes the most extensive sfr densitydetermination with a single technique to z=3. recent herschel results areconsistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

1101.2423	the majority of compact massive galaxies at z~2 are disk dominated	we investigate the stellar structure of massive, quiescent galaxies at z~2,based on hubble space telescope/wfc3 imaging from the early release scienceprogram. our sample of 14 galaxies has stellar masses of m* &gt; 10^{10.8} msoland photometric redshifts of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. in agreement with previous work,their half-light radii are &lt;2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxiesin the present-day universe. a significant subset of the sample appears highlyflattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics,that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounceddisks. this is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits.we estimate that 65% +/- 15% of the population of massive, quiescent z~2galaxies are disk-dominated. the median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc,substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in thepresent-day universe. our results provide strong observational evidence thatthe much-discussed ultra-dense high-redshift galaxies should generally bethought of as disk-like stellar systems with the majority of stars formed fromgas that had time to settle into a disk.

1102.4621	spectropolarimetric evidence for radiatively inefficient accretion in an  optically dull active galaxy	we present subaru/focas spectropolarimetry of two active galaxies in thecosmic evolution survey. these objects were selected to be optically dull, withthe bright x-ray emission of an agn but missing optical emission lines in ourprevious spectroscopy. our new observations show that one target has very weakemission lines consistent with an optically dull agn, while the other objecthas strong emission lines typical of a host-diluted type 2 seyfert galaxy. inneither source do we observe polarized emission lines, with 3-sigma upperlimits of p_blr &lt; 2%. this means that the missing broad emission lines (andweaker narrow emission lines) are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration,e.g., by the canonical agn torus. the weak-lined optically dull agn exhibits ablue polarized continuum with p = 0.78 +/- 0.07% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 7200a (p = 1.37 +/- 0.16% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 5050 a). the wavelengthdependence of this polarized flux is similar to that of an unobscured agncontinuum and represents the intrinsic agn emission, either as synchrotronemission or the outer part of an accretion disk reflected by a clumpy dustscatterer. because this intrinsic agn emission lacks emission lines, thissource is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

1103.0276	accretion rate and the physical nature of unobscured active galaxies	we show how accretion rate governs the physical properties of a sample ofunobscured broad-line, narrow-line, and lineless active galactic nuclei (agns).we avoid the systematic errors plaguing previous studies of agn accretion rateby using accurate accretion luminosities (l_int) from well-sampledmultiwavelength seds from the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), and accurateblack hole masses derived from virial scaling relations (for broad-line agns)or host-agn relations (for narrow-line and lineless agns). in general, broademission lines are present only at the highest accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &gt;0.01), and these rapidly accreting agns are observed as broad-line agns orpossibly as obscured narrow-line agns. narrow-line and lineless agns at lowerspecific accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01) are unobscured and yet lack abroad line region. the disappearance of the broad emission lines is caused byan expanding radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf) at the inner radiusof the accretion disk. the presence of the riaf also drives l_int/l_edd &lt; 10^-2narrow-line and lineless agns to 10 times higher ratios of radio to optical/uvemission than l_int/l_edd &gt; 0.01 broad-line agns, since the unbound nature ofthe riaf means it is easier to form a radio outflow. the ir torus signaturealso tends to become weaker or disappear from l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01 agns, althoughthere may be additional mid-ir synchrotron emission associated with the riaf.together these results suggest that specific accretion rate is an importantphysical "axis" of agn unification, described by a simple model.

1104.0928	new constraints on the evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter  connection: a combined analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering, and  stellar mass functions from z=0.2 to z=1	using data from the cosmos survey, we perform the first joint analysis ofgalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy numberdensities. carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter betweenstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using anovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. our results provide strongconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo massrelation (shmr) from z=0.2 to z=1. at low stellar mass, we find that halo massscales as mh m*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly withredshift to z=1. we show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, mh/m*, varies from lowto high masses, reaching a minimum of mh/m*~27 at m*=4.5x10^10 msun andmh=1.2x10^12 msun. this minimum is important for models of galaxy formationbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of thecentral galaxy has been the most efficient. we describe the shmr at thisminimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", m*piv, the "pivot halo mass",mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (mh/m*)piv. thanks to a homogeneous analysis of asingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends forboth mhpiv and m*piv. the pivot stellar mass decreases fromm*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 msun at z=0.88 to m*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 msun at z=0.37.intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of mhpiv leaves the pivotratio constant with redshift at (mh/m*)piv~27. we use simple arguments to showhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching mayultimately depend on mh/m* and not simply mh, as is commonly assumed. we showthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in thesites of star formation. finally, we discuss the implications of our results inthe context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and agnfeedback.

1106.5502	on star formation rates and star formation histories of galaxies out to  z ~ 3	we compare multi-wavelength sfr indicators out to z~3 in goods-south. ouranalysis uniquely combines u-to-8um photometry from fireworks, mips 24um andpacs 70, 100, and 160um photometry from the pep survey, and ha spectroscopyfrom the sins survey. we describe a set of conversions that lead to acontinuity across sfr indicators. a luminosity-independent conversion from 24umto total infrared luminosity yields estimates of lir that are in the medianconsistent with the lir derived from pacs photometry, albeit with significantscatter. dust correction methods perform well at low to intermediate levels ofstar formation. they fail to recover the total amount of star formation insystems with large sfr_ir/sfr_uv ratios, typically occuring at the highest sfrs(sfr_uv+ir \gtrsim 100 msun/yr) and redshifts (z \gtrsim 2.5) probed. finally,we confirm that ha-based sfrs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 are consistent with sfr_sed andsfr_uv+ir provided extra attenuation towards hii regions is taken into account(av,neb = av,continuum / 0.44). with the cross-calibrated sfr indicators inhand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferredfrom sed modeling. we compare the observed sfr-m relations and mass functionsat a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lowerredshift galaxies backwards in time. we find evidence for underestimatedstellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied. wedemonstrate how resolved sed modeling, or alternatively deep uv data, may helpto overcome this bias. the age bias is most severe for galaxies with youngstellar populations, and reduces towards older systems. finally, our analysissuggests that sfhs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several100 myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.

1107.0317	galaxy structure and mode of star formation in the sfr-mass plane from z  ~ 2.5 to z ~ 0.1	we analyze the dependence of galaxy structure (size and sersic index) andmode of star formation (\sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv) on the position ofgalaxies in the sfr versus mass diagram. our sample comprises roughly 640000galaxies at z~0.1, 130000 galaxies at z~1, and 36000 galaxies at z~2.structural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on hstimaging, and sfrs are derived using a herschel-calibrated ladder of sfrindicators. we find that a correlation between the structure and stellarpopulation of galaxies (i.e., a 'hubble sequence') is already in place since atleast z~2.5. at all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequenceare well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescentgalaxies are better described by de vaucouleurs profiles. in the upper envelopeof the main sequence, the relation between the sfr and sersic index reverses,suggesting a rapid build-up of the central mass concentration in thesestarbursting outliers. we observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-formingsystems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. at eachmass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. therate of size growth correlates with specific sfr, and so does \sigma_sfr ateach redshift. a simple model using an empirically determined sf law andmetallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and starsis able to relate the observed \sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv, provided a morepatchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.

1108.6075	a candels wfc3 grism study of emission-line galaxies at z~2: a mix of  nuclear activity and low-metallicity star formation	we present hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 slitless grismspectroscopy of 28 emission-line galaxies at z~2, in the goods-s region of thecosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). thehigh sensitivity of these grism observations, with 1-sigma detections ofemission lines to f &gt; 2.5x10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2, means that the galaxies in thesample are typically ~7 times less massive (median m_* = 10^{9.5} m_sun) thanpreviously studied z~2 emission-line galaxies. despite their lower mass, thegalaxies have oiii/hb ratios which are very similar to previously studied z~2galaxies and much higher than the typical emission-line ratios of localgalaxies. the wfc3 grism allows for unique studies of spatial gradients inemission lines, and we stack the two-dimensional spectra of the galaxies forthis purpose. in the stacked data the oiii emission line is more spatiallyconcentrated than the hb emission line with 98.1 confidence. we additionallystack the x-ray data (all sources are individually undetected), and find thatthe average l(oiii)/l(0.5-10 kev) ratio is intermediate between typical z~0obscured active galaxies and star-forming galaxies. together the compactness ofthe stacked oiii spatial profile and the stacked x-ray data suggest that atleast some of these low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies harbor weak activegalactic nuclei.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1109.4633	secular evolution and a non-evolving black hole to galaxy mass ratio in  the last 7 gyr	we present new constraints on the ratio of black hole (bh) mass to totalgalaxy stellar mass at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9 for a sample of 32 type-1 active galacticnuclei (agns) from the xmm-cosmos survey covering the rangem_bh/m_sun~10^(7.2--8.7). virial m_bh estimates based on h_beta are availablefrom the cosmos magellan/imacs survey. we use high-resolution hubble spacetelescope (hst) imaging to decompose the light of each type-1 agn and hostgalaxy, and employ a specially-built mass-to-light ratio to estimate thestellar masses (m_*). the m_bh-m_* ratio shows a zero offset with respect tothe local relation for galactic bulge masses, and we also find no evolution inthe mass ratio m_bh/m_*=(1+z)^{0.02+-0.34} up to z~0.9. interestingly, at thehigh-m_bh end there is a positive offset from the z=0 relation, which can befully explained by a mass function bias with a cosmic scatter of 0.3,reaffirming that the intrinsic distribution is consistent with zero evolution.from our results we conclude that since z~0.9 no substantial addition ofstellar mass is required: the decline in star formation rates and mergeractivity at z&lt;1 support this scenario. nevertheless, given that a significantfraction of these galaxies show a disk component, their bulges are indeedundermassive. this is a direct indication that for the last 7 gyr the onlyessential mechanism required in order that these galaxies obey the z=0 relationis a redistribution of stellar mass to the bulge, likely driven by secularprocesses, i.e., internal instabilities and minor merging.

1109.6040	galaxies in x-ray groups i: robust membership assignment and the impact  of group environments on quenching	understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxieswith redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formationrates than field populations remains an important problem. as most candidateprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations ofthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a rangein halo mass and redshift are needed. in this work, we present and test arigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based onprecise photometric redshifts and x-ray selected groups drawn from the cosmosfield. the groups have masses in the range 10^13 &lt; m_200c/m_sun &lt; 10^14 andspan redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. we characterize our selection algorithm via tests onspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the vlt, and byapplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. we find that our group membergalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 r200c. wemeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on thequality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as wellas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. as a first application of our newgroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that membergalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixedstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between starformation and environment at group scales. we also address the suggestion thatdusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrumof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannotexplain the low power seen in recent sz measurements.

1110.3800	multi-wavelength view of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forming  galaxies at z~2	this paper studies the properties of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forminggalaxies at z~2 through multi-wavelength broad band photometry. a sample of 40clumps is identified through auto-detection and visual inspection from 10galaxies with 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 in the hubble ultra deep field, where deep andhigh-resolution hst/wfc3 and acs images enable us to resolve structures of z~2galaxies down to kpc scale in the rest-frame uv and optical bands as well as todetect clumps toward the faint end. the physical properties of clumps aremeasured through fitting spatially resolved seven-band (bvizyjh) spectralenergy distribution to models. on average, the clumps are blue and have similarmedian rest-frame uv--optical color as the diffuse components of their hostgalaxies, but the clumps have large scatter in their colors. although the starformation rate (sfr)--stellar mass relation of galaxies is dominated by thediffuse components, clumps emerge as regions with enhanced specific sfrs,contributing individually ~10% and together ~50% of the sfr of the hostgalaxies. however, the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv/opticalluminosity and stellar mass are smaller, typically a few percent individuallyand ~20% together. on average, clumps are younger by 0.2 dex and denser by afactor of 8 than diffuse components. clump properties have obvious radialvariations in the sense that central clumps are redder, older, more extincted,denser, and less active on forming stars than outskirts clumps. our results arebroadly consistent with a widely held view that clumps are formed throughgravitational instability in gas-rich turbulent disks and would eventuallymigrate toward galactic centers and coalesce into bulges. roughly 40% of thegalaxies in our sample contain a massive clump that could be identified as aproto-bulge, which seems qualitatively consistent with such a bulge-formationscenario.

1110.3801	rest-frame uv--optically selected galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5: searching for  dusty star-forming and passively-evolving galaxies	a new set of color selection criteria (vjl) analogous with the bzk method isdesigned to select both star-forming galaxies (sfgs) and passively-evolvinggalaxies (pegs) at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 by using rest-frame uv--optical (v-j vs. j-l)colors. the criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar populationsynthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluatetheir efficiency and contamination. we apply the well-tested vjl criteria tothe hst/wfc3 early release science field and study the physical properties ofselected galaxies. the redshift distribution of selected sfgs peaks at z~2.7,slightly lower than that of lyman break galaxies at z~3. comparing the observedmid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellaremission, we find that our vjl method is effective at selecting massive dustysfgs that are missed by the lyman break technique. about half of the starformation in massive (m_{star}&gt;10^{10}m_{sun}) galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 iscontributed by dusty (extinction e(b-v)&gt;0.4) sfgs, which however, only accountfor ~20% of the number density of massive sfgs. we also use the mid-infraredfluxes to clean our peg sample, and find that galaxy size can be used as asecondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty sfgs.the redshift distribution of the cleaned peg sample peaks at z~2.5. we find 6peg candidates at z&gt;3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them fromdusty contamination. we conclude that at least part of our candidates are realpegs at z~3, implying that this type of galaxies began to form their stars atz&gt;5. we measure the integrated stellar mass density of pegs at z~2.5 and setconstraints on it at z&gt;3. we find that the integrated stellar mass densitygrows by at least about factor of 10 in 1 gyr at 3&lt;z&lt;5 and by another factor of10 in next 3.5 gyr (1&lt;z&lt;3).

1111.3370	measuring the geometry of the universe from weak gravitational lensing  behind galaxy groups in the hst cosmos survey	gravitational lensing can provide pure geometric tests of the structure ofspace-time, for instance by determining empirically the angular diameterdistance-redshift relation. this geometric test has been demonstrated severaltimes using massive clusters which produce a large lensing signal. in thiscase, matter at a single redshift dominates the lensing signal, so the analysisis straightforward. it is less clear how weaker signals from multiple sourcesat different redshifts can be stacked to demonstrate the geometric dependence.we introduce a simple measure of relative shear which for flat cosmologiesseparates the effect of lens and source positions into multiplicative terms,allowing signals from many different source-lens pairs to be combined. applyingthis technique to a sample of groups and low-mass clusters in the cosmossurvey, we detect a clear variation of shear with distance behind the lens.this represents the first detection of the geometric effect using weak lensingby multiple, low-mass systems. the variation of distance with redshift ismeasured with sufficient precision to constrain the equation of state of theuniverse under the assumption of flatness, equivalent to a detection of a darkenergy component omega_x at greater than 99% confidence for anequation-of-state parameter -2.5 &lt; w &lt; -0.1. for the case w = -1, we find avalue for the cosmological constant density parameter omega_lambda =0.85+0.044-0.19 (68% c.l.), and detect cosmic acceleration (q_0 &lt; 0) at the 98%c.l.. we consider the systematic uncertainties associated with this techniqueand discuss the prospects for applying it in forthcoming weak-lensing surveys.

1112.2260	the role of galaxy interaction in environmental dependence of the star  formation activity at z~1.2	in order to understand environmental effects on star formation inhigh-redshift galaxies, we investigate the physical relationships between thestar formation activity, stellar mass, and environment for z ~1.2 galaxies inthe 2 deg^2 cosmos field. we estimate star formation using the [oii] emissionline and environment from the local galaxy density. our analysis shows that formassive galaxies m_*&gt;10^10 m_sun, the fraction of [oii] emitters inhigh-density environments is 1.7 times higher than in low-density environments,while the [oii] emitter fraction does not depend on environment for low-massm_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun galaxies. in order to understand what drives these trends, weinvestigate the role of companion galaxies in our sample. we find that thefraction of [oii] emitters in galaxies with companions is 2.4 times as high asthat in galaxies without companions at m_* &gt; 10^10 m_sun. in addition, massivegalaxies are more likely to have companions in high-density environments.however, although the "number" of star forming galaxies increases for massivegalaxies with close companions and in dense environments, the "average" starformation rate of star forming galaxies at a given mass is independent ofenvironment and the presence/absence of a close companion. these resultssuggest that interactions and/or mergers in high-density environment couldinduce star formation in massive galaxies at z~1.2, increasing the fraction ofstar-forming galaxies with m_* &gt; 10^10 m_sun.

1112.2657	pixel-z: studying substructure and stellar populations in galaxies out  to z~3 using pixel colors i. systematics	we perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of 467 galaxies in the goods-vimossurvey to study systematic effects in extracting properties of stellarpopulations (age, dust, metallicity and sfr) from pixel colors using thepixel-z method. the systematics studied include the effect of the input stellarpopulation synthesis model, passband limitations and differences betweenindividual sed fits to pixels and global sed-fitting to a galaxy's colors. wefind that with optical-only colors, the systematic errors due to differencesamong the models are well constrained. the largest impact on the age and sfre-folding time estimates in the pixels arises from differences between themaraston models and the bruzual&amp;charlot models, when optical colors are used.this results in systematic differences larger than the 2{\sigma} uncertaintiesin over 10 percent of all pixels in the galaxy sample. the effect ofrestricting the available passbands is more severe. in 26 percent of pixels inthe full sample, passband limitations result in systematic biases in the ageestimates which are larger than the 2{\sigma} uncertainties. systematic effectsfrom model differences are reexamined using near-ir colors for a subsample of46 galaxies in the goods-nicmos survey. for z &gt; 1, the observed optical/nircolors span the rest frame uv-optical sed, and the use of different models doesnot significantly bias the estimates of the stellar population parameterscompared to using optical-only colors. we then illustrate how pixel-z can beapplied robustly to make detailed studies of substructure in high redshiftgalaxies such as (a) radial gradients of age, sfr, ssfr and dust and (b) thedistribution of these properties within subcomponents such as spiral arms andclumps. finally, we show preliminary results from the candels surveyillustrating how the new hst/wfc3 data can be exploited to probe substructurein z~1-3 galaxies.

1201.2410	physical properties of herschel selected galaxies in a semi-analytic  galaxy formation model	[abridged] we make use of a semi-analytic cosmological model that includessimple prescriptions for dust attenuation and emission to make predictions forthe observable and physical properties of galaxies that may be detected by therecently launched herschel space observatory in deep fields such asgoods-herschel. we compare our predictions for differential galaxy numbercounts in the pacs (100 &amp; 160) and spire (250, 350, and 500 micron) bands withavailable observations. we find very good agreement with the counts in the pacsbands, for the overall counts and for galaxies binned by redshift at z&lt; 2. at z&gt; 2 our model underpredicts the number of bright galaxies by a factor of ten.the agreement is much worse for all three spire bands, and becomesprogressively worse with increasing wavelength. we discuss a number of possiblereasons for these discrepancies, and hypothesize that the effect of blending onthe observational flux estimates is likely to be the dominant issue. we notethat the pacs number counts are relatively robust to changes in the dustemission templates, while the predicted spire number counts are more templatedependent. we present quantitative predictions for the relationship between theobserved pacs 160 and spire 250 micron fluxes and physical quantities such ashalo mass, stellar mass, cold gas mass, star formation rate, and total infrared(ir) luminosity, at different redshifts. we also present quantitativepredictions for the correlation between pacs 160 micron flux and theprobability that a galaxy has experienced a recent major or minor merger.although our models predict a strong correlation between these quantities, suchthat more ir-luminous galaxies are more likely to be merger-driven, we findthat more than half of all high redshift ir-luminous galaxies detected byherschel are able to attain their high star formation rates without enhancementby a merger.

1206.0735	candels: the contribution of the observed galaxy population to cosmic  reionization	we present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from asample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. these galaxies were selected from new deepnear-infrared hst imaging from the candels, hudf09 and ers programs. incontrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that thedistribution of galaxy ultraviolet (uv) luminosities follows a schechterdistribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below ourobservable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxieswhich we can observe, free from these assumptions. we find that the observablepopulation of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized igm at z=6, if the averageionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. a number of previous studieshave measured uv luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5x, withmany concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless alarge population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, orextremely high values of f_esc were present. the observed uv luminosity densityfrom our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fullyreionized igm unless f_esc&gt;50%. combining our observations with constraints onthe emission rate of ionizing photons from ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,we can constrain f_esc&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the onlycontributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity functionextends to m_uv = -13. these escape fractions are sufficient to completereionization by z=6. these constraints imply that the volume ionized fractionof the igm becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number ofcomplementary reionization probes. if faint galaxies dominate reionization,future jwst observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing anindirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1207.3283	near-infrared imaging of a z=6.42 quasar host galaxy with the hubble  space telescope wide field camera 3	we report on deep near-infrared f125w (j) and f160w (h) hubble spacetelescope wide field camera 3 images of the z=6.42 quasar j1148+5251 to attemptto detect rest-frame near-ultraviolet emission from the host galaxy. theseobservations included contemporaneous observations of a nearby star of similarnear-infrared colors to measure temporal variations in the telescope andinstrument point spread function (psf). we subtract the quasar point sourceusing both this direct psf and a model psf.  using direct subtraction, we measure an upper limit for the quasar hostgalaxy of m_j&gt;22.8, m_h&gt;23.0 ab mag (2 sigma). after subtracting our best modelpsf, we measure a limiting surface brightness from 0.3"-0.5" radius of mu_j &gt;23.5, mu_h &gt; 23.7 ab magarc (2 sigma). we test the ability of the modelsubtraction method to recover the host galaxy flux by simulating host galaxieswith varying integrated magnitude, effective radius, and s\'ersic index, andconducting the same analysis. these models indicate that the surface brightnesslimit (mu_j &gt; 23.5 ab magarc) corresponds to an integrated upper limit of m_j &gt;22 - 23 ab mag, consistent with the direct subtraction method. combined withexisting far-infrared observations, this gives an infrared excess log(irx) &gt;1.0 and corresponding ultraviolet spectral slope beta &gt; -1.2\pm0.2. thesevalues match those of most local luminous infrared galaxies, but are redderthan those of almost all local star-forming galaxies and z~6 lyman breakgalaxies.

(1994, e94) type 1 agnmean sed. we found that the mean seds in each bin are closely similar to eachother, showing no statistical significant evidence of dependence on any of theanalyzed parameters. we also measured the sed dispersion as a function of thesefour parameters, and found no significant dependencies. the dispersion of thexmm-cosmos seds is generally larger than e94 sed dispersion in the ultraviolet,which might be due to the broader ``window function'' for cosmos quasars, andtheir x-ray based selection.

1210.3044	a quasar-galaxy mixing diagram: quasar spectral energy distribution  shapes in the optical to near-infrared	we define a quasar-galaxy mixing diagram using the slopes of their spectralenergy distributions (seds) from 1\mu m to 3000\aa\ and from 1\mu m to 3\mu min the rest frame. the mixing diagram can easily distinguish amongquasar-dominated, galaxy-dominated and reddening-dominated sed shapes. bystudying the position of the 413 xmm selected type 1 agn in the wide-field"cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) in the mixing diagram, we find that acombination of the elvis et al. (1994, hereafter e94) quasar sed with variouscontributions from galaxy emission and some dust reddening is remarkablyeffective in describing the sed shape from 0.3-3\mu m for large ranges ofredshift, luminosity, black hole mass and eddington ratio of type 1 agn. inparticular, the location in the mixing diagram of the highest luminosity agn isvery close (within 1\sigma) to that of the e94 sed. the mixing diagram can alsobe used to estimate the host galaxy fraction and reddening in quasar. we alsoshow examples of some outliers which might be agn in different evolutionarystages compared to the majority of agn in the quasar-host galaxy co-evolutioncycle.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

1212.3869	evolution of the sizes of galaxies over 7&lt;z&lt;12 revealed by the 2012  hubble ultra deep field campaign	we analyze the redshift- and luminosity-dependent sizes of dropout galaxycandidates in the redshift range z~7-12 using deep images from the udf12campaign, data which offers two distinct advantages over that used in earlierwork. firstly, we utilize the increased s/n ratio offered by the udf12 imagingto provide improved size measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in thehudf. specifically, we stack the new deep f140w image with the existing f125wdata in order to provide improved measurements of the half-light radii ofz-dropouts. similarly we stack this image with the new deep udf12 f160w imageto obtain new size measurements for a sample of y-dropouts. secondly, becausethe udf12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy samplein the hudf at z&gt;8, we have been able to extend the measurement of averagegalaxy size out to significantly higher redshifts. restricting our sizemeasurements to sources which are now detected at &gt;15sigma, we confirm earlierindications that the average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies are extremelysmall, 0.3-0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations inlocal star-forming galaxies. we also confirm that there is a clear trend ofdecreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the firstevidence that this trend continues beyond z~8. modeling the evolution of theaverage half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s, we obtain a best-fit index ofs=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, mid-way between the physicallyexpected evolution for baryons embedded in dark halos of constant mass (s=-1)and constant velocity (s=-1.5). a clear size-luminosity relation, such as thatfound at lower redshift, is also evident in both our z- and y-dropout sample.this relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of starformation over a range in luminosity of 0.05-1.0l*_z=3.(abridged)

1305.0607	candels observations of the environmental dependence of the  color-mass-morphology relation at z = 1.6	we study the environmental dependence of color, stellar mass, and morphologyby comparing galaxies in a forming cluster to those in the field at z = 1:6with hubble space telescope near-infrared imaging in the candels/uds field. wequantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, reff, ands\'ersic index, n. in both the cluster and field, approximately half of thebulge-dominated galaxies (n &gt; 2) reside on the red sequence of thecolor-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n &lt; 2) have colorsexpected for star-forming galaxies. there is weak evidence that clustergalaxies have redder rest-frame u - b colors and higher stellar masses comparedto the field. star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show nosignificant differences in their morphologies. in contrast, there is evidencethat quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii andsmaller s\'ersic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2?. thesedifferences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 mpc&lt; rproj &lt; 1.5 mpc, which have low s\'ersic indices and possibly largereffective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch andin contrast to other quiescent galaxies. we argue that star-forming galaxiesare processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distancesgreater than the cluster-halo virial radius. our results are consistent withmodels where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processesassociated with the cluster environment.

1305.1357	uvudf: ultraviolet imaging of the hubble ultradeep field with wide-field  camera 3	we present an overview of a 90-orbit hubble space telescope treasury programto obtain near ultraviolet imaging of the hubble ultra deep field using thewide field camera 3 uvis detector with the f225w, f275w, and f336w filters.this survey is designed to: (i) investigate the episode of peak star formationactivity in galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5; (ii) probe the evolution of massive galaxiesby resolving sub-galactic units (clumps); (iii) examine the escape fraction ofionizing radiation from galaxies at z~2-3; (iv) greatly improve the reliabilityof photometric redshift estimates; and (v) measure the star formation rateefficiency of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas at z~1-3. in this overviewpaper, we describe the survey details and data reduction challenges, includingboth the necessity of specialized calibrations and the effects of chargetransfer inefficiency. we provide a stark demonstration of the effects ofcharge transfer inefficiency on resultant data products, which whenuncorrected, result in uncertain photometry, elongation of morphology in thereadout direction, and loss of faint sources far from the readout. we agreewith the stsci recommendation that future uvis observations that require verysensitive measurements use the instrument's capability to add background lightthrough a "post-flash". preliminary results on number counts of uv-selectedgalaxies and morphology of galaxies at z~1 are presented. we find that thenumber density of uv dropouts at redshifts 1.7, 2.1, and 2.7 is largelyconsistent with the number predicted by published luminosity functions. we alsoconfirm that the image mosaics have sufficient sensitivity and resolution tosupport the analysis of the evolution of star-forming clumps, reaching 28-29thmagnitude depth at 5 sigma in a 0.2 arcsecond radius aperture depending onfilter and observing epoch.

1305.2204	the redshift and mass dependence on the formation of the hubble sequence  at z&gt;1 from candels/uds	in this paper we present a detailed study of the structures and morphologiesof a sample of 1188 massive galaxies with mstar&gt;10^10msun between redshiftsz=1-3 within the ultra deep survey (uds) region of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) field. using thissample we determine how galaxy structure and morphology evolve with time. wevisually classify our sample into disks, ellipticals and peculiar systems andcorrect for redshift effects on our classifications through simulations. wefind evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual classification asa function of redshift. the peculiar population is dominant at z&gt;2 with asubstantial spheroid population, and a negligible disk population. we computethe transition redshift, ztrans, where the combined fraction of spheroids anddisks is equal to that of peculiar galaxies, as ztrans=1.86+/-0.62 for galaxiesin our stellar mass range. we find that this changes as a function of stellarmass, with hubble-type systems becoming dominant at higher redshifts for highermass galaxies (ztrans=2.22+/-0.82), than for the lower mass galaxies(ztrans=1.73+/-0.57). higher mass galaxies become morphologically settledbefore their lower mass counterparts, a form of morphological downsizing. wefurthermore compare our visual classifications with sersic index, theconcentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (cas) parameters, star formation rateand rest frame u-b colour. we find links between the colour of a galaxy, itsstar formation rate and how extended or peculiar it appears. finally, wediscuss the negligible z&gt;2 disk fraction based on visual morphologies andspeculate that this is an effect of forming disks appearing peculiar throughprocesses such as violent disk instabilities or mergers. we conclude that toproperly define high redshift morphology a new and more exact classificationscheme is needed.

1305.6931	structural evolution of early-type galaxies to z=2.5 in candels	projected axis ratio measurements of 880 early-type galaxies at redshifts1&lt;z&lt;2.5 selected from candels are used to reconstruct and model their intrinsicshapes. the sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors toreflect low star-formation activity. we demonstrate that these galaxies as anensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth lightprofiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. similar to theirpresent-day counterparts, the z&gt;1 early-type galaxies show a variety ofintrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributionscannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with verysimilar intrinsic shapes. however, a two-population model for the intrinsicshapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat(c/a~0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratiodistributions of both present-day and z&gt;1 early-type galaxies. we find that theproportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies'stellar mass, and - at a given mass - on redshift. for present-day and z&lt;1early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. at z&gt;1this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here(10^10&lt;m*/m_sun&lt;10^11), because the oblate fraction among massive (m*~10^11m_sun) was much higher in the past: 0.59+-0.10 at z&gt;1, compared to 0.20+-0.02at z~0.1. in contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies(log(m*/m_sun)&lt;10.5) increased toward the present, from 0.38+-0.11 at z&gt;1 to0.72+-0.06 at z=0.

1307.3247	evidence for a correlation between the sizes of quiescent galaxies and  local environment to z ~ 2	we present evidence for a strong relationship between galaxy size andenvironment for the quiescent population in the redshift range 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.environments were measured using projected galaxy overdensities on a scale of400 kpc, as determined from ~ 96,000 k-band selected galaxies from the ukidssultra deep survey (uds). sizes were determined from ground-based k-bandimaging, calibrated using space-based candels hst observations in the centre ofthe uds field, with photometric redshifts and stellar masses derived from11-band photometric fitting. from the resulting size-mass relation, we confirmthat quiescent galaxies at a given stellar mass were typically ~ 50 % smallerat z ~ 1.4 compared to the present day. at a given epoch, however, we find thatpassive galaxies in denser environments are on average significantly larger ata given stellar mass. the most massive quiescent galaxies (m_stellar &gt; 2 x10^11 m_sun) at z &gt; 1 are typically 50 % larger in the highest densityenvironments compared to those in the lowest density environments. using montecarlo simulations, we reject the null hypothesis that the size-mass relation isindependent of environment at a significance &gt; 4.8 sigma for the redshift range1 &lt; z &lt; 2. in contrast, the evidence for a relationship between size andenvironment is much weaker for star-forming galaxies.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1402.0866	bulge growth and quenching since z = 2.5 in candels/3d-hst	exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 candels fields, andaccurate redshift information provided by 3d-hst, we investigate the relationbetween structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764galaxies above 10^10 msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. for thefirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single sersic fit andtwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the h-band lightdistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolvedstellar population modeling. we confirm that the increased bulge prominenceamong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-opticalobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellarmass. moreover, we observe an increase of the typical sersic index andbulge-to-total ratio (with median b/t reaching 40-50%) among star-forminggalaxies above 10^11 msun. given that quenching for these most massive systemsis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growthprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. we demonstrate thatthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a morereliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy thanthe total stellar mass. the same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-artsemi-analytic model by somerville et al. in the latter, bulges and black holesgrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and agn-feedbackshuts off star formation. further observations will be required to pin downstar formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must beinternal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.

1402.3268	properties of submillimeter galaxies in the candels goods-s field	we derive physical properties of 10 submillimeter galaxies located in thecandels coverage of the goods-s field. the galaxies were first identified assubmillimeter sources with the laboca bolometer and subsequently targeted for870um continuum observation with alma. the high angular resolution of the almaimaging allows secure counterparts to be identified in the candels multibanddataset. the candels data provide deep photometric data from uv throughnear-infrared wavelengths. using synthetic spectral energy distributions, wederive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, extinction, ages, and the starformation history. the redshift range is z=1.65-4.76, with two of the galaxieslocated at z&gt;4. two smg counterparts have stellar masses 2-3 orders ofmagnitude lower than the rest. the remaining smg counterparts have stellarmasses around 1x10^11 msun. the stellar population in the smgs is typicallyolder than the expected duration of the submillimeter phase, suggesting thatthe star formation history of submillimeter galaxies is more complex than asingle burst. non-parametric morphology indices suggest that the smgcounterparts are among the most asymmetric systems compared with galaxies ofthe same stellar mass and redshift. the hst images shows that 3 of the smgs areassociated with on-going mergers. the remaining counterparts are isolated.estimating the dust and molecular gas mass from the submm fluxes, and comparingwith our stellar masses shows that the molecular gas mass fraction of smgs is~28% and that the final stellar mass is likely to be (1-2)x10^11 msun.

0802.2912	emission-line galaxies from the pears hubble ultra deep field: a 2-d  detection method and first results	the hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) grismpears (probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically) survey provides alarge dataset of low-resolution spectra from thousands of galaxies in the goodsnorth and south fields. one important subset of objects in these data areemission-line galaxies (elgs), and we have investigated several differentmethods aimed at systematically selecting these galaxies. here we present a newmethodology and results of a search for these elgs in the pears observations ofthe hubble ultra deep field (hudf) using a 2d detection method that utilizesthe observation that many emission lines originate from clumpy knots withingalaxies. this 2d line-finding method proves to be useful in detecting emissionlines from compact knots within galaxies that might not otherwise be detectedusing more traditional 1d line-finding techniques. we find in total 96 emissionlines in the hudf, originating from 81 distinct "knots'' within 63 individualgalaxies. we find in general that [oiii] emitters are the most common,comprising 44% of the sample, and on average have high equivalent widths (70%of [oiii] emitters having rest-frame ew&gt;100a). there are 12 galaxies withmultiple emitting knots--with different knots exhibiting varying flux values,suggesting that the differing star formation properties across a single galaxycan in general be probed at redshifts z~0.2-0.4. the most prevalentmorphologies are large face-on spirals and clumpy interacting systems, manybeing unique detections owing to the 2d method described here, thushighlighting the strength of this technique.

1403.1435	pdbi cold dust imaging of two extremely red h-[4.5]&gt;4 galaxies  discovered with seds and candels	we report plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) 1.1 mm continuum imagingtowards two extremely red h-[4.5]&gt;4 (ab) galaxies at z&gt;3, which we havepreviously discovered making use of spitzer seds and hubble space telescopecandels ultra-deep images of the ultra deep survey field. one of our objects isdetected on the pdbi map with a 4.3 sigma significance, corresponding tosnu(1.1mm)=(0.78 +/- 0.18) mjy. by combining this detection with the spitzer 8and 24 micron photometry for this source, and scuba2 flux density upper limits,we infer that this galaxy is a composite active galactic nucleus/star-formingsystem. the infrared (ir)-derived star formation rate is sfr~(200 +/- 100)msun/yr, which implies that this galaxy is a higher-redshift analogue of theordinary ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) more commonly found atz~2-3. in the field of the other target, we find a tentative 3.1 sigmadetection on the pdbi 1.1 mm map, but 3.7 arcsec away of our target position,so it likely corresponds to a different object. in spite of the lowersignificance, the pdbi detection is supported by a close scuba2 3.3 sigmadetection. no counterpart is found on either the deep seds or candels maps, so,if real, the pdbi source could be similar in nature to the sub-millimetresource gn10. we conclude that the analysis of ultra-deep near- and mid-irimages offers an efficient, alternative route to discover new sites of powerfulstar formation activity at high redshifts.

1403.7463	the wavelength dependence of high-redshift galaxy structure in the  rest-frame ultraviolet	we present the rest-frame uv wavelength dependence of the petrosian-likehalf-light radius ($r_{50}$), and the concentration parameter for a sample of198 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. we find a ~5% decrease in $r_{50}$from 1500 \aa\ to 3000 \aa, with half-light radii at 3000 \aa\ ranging from 0.6kpc to 6 kpc. we also find a decrease in concentration of ~0.07 (1.9 &lt;$c_{3000}$ &lt; 3.9). the lack of a strong relationship between $r_{50}$ andwavelength is consistent with a model in which clumpy star formation isdistributed over length scales comparable to the galaxy's rest-frame opticallight. while the wavelength dependence of $r_{50}$ is independent of size atall redshifts, concentration decreases more sharply in the far-uv (~1500 \aa)for large galaxies at z ~ 1. this decrease in concentration is caused by aflattening of the inner ~20% of the light profile in disk-like galaxies,indicating that the central regions have different uv colors than the rest ofthe galaxy. we interpret this as a bulge component with older stellarpopulations and/or more dust. the size-dependent decrease in concentration isless dramatic at z ~ 2, suggesting that bulges are less dusty, younger, and/orless massive than the rest of the galaxy at higher redshifts.

1403.7524	star-forming blue etgs in two newly discovered galaxy overdensities in  the hudf at z=1.84 and 1.9: unveiling the progenitors of passive etgs in  cluster cores	we present the discovery of two galaxy overdensities in the hubble spacetelescope udf: a proto-cluster, hudfj0332.4-2746.6 at $z = 1.84 \pm 0.01$, anda group, hudfj0332.5-2747.3 at $z =1.90 \pm 0.01$. assuming viralization, thevelocity dispersion of hudfj0332.4-2746.6 implies a mass of $m_{200}= (2.2 \pm1.8) \times 10^{14} m_{\odot}$, consistent with the lack of extended x-rayemission. neither overdensity shows evidence of a red sequence. about $50\%$ oftheir members show interactions and/or disturbed morphologies, which aresignatures of merger remnants or disk instability. most of their etgs have bluecolors and show recent star-formation. these observations reveal for the firsttime large fractions of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming blue etgs inproto-clusters at $z\approx 2$. these star-forming etgs are most likely amongthe progenitors of the quiescent population in clusters at more recent epochs.their mass-size relation is consistent with that of passive etgs in clusters at$z\sim0.7-1.5$. if these galaxies are the progenitors of cluster etgs at theselower redshifts, their size would evolve according to a similar mass-sizerelation. it is noteworthy that quiescent etgs in clusters at $z=1.8-2$ also donot show any significant size evolution over this redshift range, contrary tofield etgs. the etg fraction is $\lesssim 50\%$, compared to the typicalquiescent etg fraction of $\approx 80\%$ in cluster cores at $z&lt; 1$. thefraction, masses, and colors of the newly discovered etgs imply that othercluster etgs will be formed/accreted at a later time.

1405.3661	discovery of a strong lensing galaxy embedded in a cluster at z = 1.62	we identify a strong lensing galaxy in the cluster irc 0218 (also known asxmm-lss j02182$-$05102) that is spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=1.62$,making it the highest-redshift strong lens galaxy known. the lens is one of thetwo brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into anarc and a counterimage. with hubble space telescope (hst) grism and keck/lrisspectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be $z_{\rm s}=2.26$. using hstimaging in acs/f475w, acs/f814w, wfc3/f125w, and wfc3/f160w, we model the lensmass distribution with an elliptical power-law profile and account for theeffects of the cluster halo and nearby galaxies. the einstein radius is$\theta_{\rm e}=0.38^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$" ($3.2_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$ kpc) and the totalenclosed mass is m$_{\rm tot} (&lt; \theta_{\rme})=1.8^{+0.2}_{-0.1}\times10^{11}~{\rm m}_{\odot}$. we estimate that thecluster environment contributes $\sim10$% of this total mass. assuming achabrier imf, the dark matter fraction within $\theta_{{\rm e}}$ is $f_{\rmdm}^{{\rm chab}} = 0.3_{-0.3}^{+0.1}$, while a salpeter imf is marginallyinconsistent with the enclosed mass ($f_{\rm dm}^{{\rm salp}} =-0.3_{-0.5}^{+0.2}$). the total magnification of the source is $\mu_{\rmtot}=2.1_{-0.3}^{+0.4}$. the source has at least one bright compact regionoffset from the source center. emission from ly$\alpha$ and [o iii] are likelyto probe different regions in the source.

1405.4869	rapid decline of lyman-alpha emission toward the reionization era	the observed deficit of strongly lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;6.5 isattributed to either increasing neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium(igm) and/or to the evolving galaxy properties. to investigate this, we haveperformed very deep near-ir spectroscopy of z&gt;7 galaxies using mosfire on thekeck-i telescope. we measure the lyman-alpha fraction at z~8 (combinedphotometric redshift peak at z=7.7) using two methods. first, we derivednly{\alpha}/ntot directly using extensive simulations to correct forincompleteness. second, we used a bayesian formalism (introduced by treu et al.2012) that compares the z&gt;7 galaxy spectra to models of the lyman-alphaequivalent width (wly{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. we explored two simpleevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where lyman-alpha is attenuated in allgalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolutionor a slowly increasing igm opacity), and patchy evolution where lyman-alpha isblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the igm being opaque alongonly some fraction of sightlines). the bayesian formalism places strongerconstraints compared with the direct method. combining our data with that inthe literature we find that at z~8 the lyman-alpha fraction has dropped by afactor &gt;3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy scenarioscompared to the z~6 values. furthermore, we find a tentative evidence that thedata favor the patchy scenario over smooth (with "positive" bayesian evidence),extending trends observed at z~7 to higher redshift. if this decrease is aresult of reionization as predicted by theory, then our data imply the volumeaveraged neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm to be &gt;0.3 suggesting that thereionization of the universe is in progress at z~8.

1406.3351	the nature of extreme emission line galaxies at z=1-2: kinematics and  metallicities from near-infrared spectroscopy	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 22 extreme emission linegalaxies at redshifts 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, confirming that these are low-mass (m* =10^8 - 10^9 m_sun) galaxies undergoing intense starburst episodes (m*/sfr ~10-100 myr). the sample is selected by [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line fluxand equivalent width using near-infrared grism spectroscopy from the 3d-hstsurvey. high-resolution nir spectroscopy is obtained with lbt/luci andvlt/x-shooter. the [o iii]/h{\beta} line ratio is high (&gt; 5) and [nii]/h{\alpha} is always significantly below unity, which suggests a lowgas-phase metallicity. we are able to determine gas-phase metallicities for 7of our objects using various strong-line methods, with values in the range0.05-0.30 z_sun and with a median of 0.15 z_sun; for 3 of these objects wedetect [o iii]{\lambda}4363 which allows for a direct constraint on themetallicity. the velocity dispersion, as measured from the nebular emissionlines, is typically ~50 km/s. combined with the observed star-forming activity,the jeans and toomre stability criteria imply that the gas fraction must belarge (&gt; 2/3), consistent with the difference between our dynamical and stellarmass estimates. the implied gas depletion time scale (several hundred myr) issubstantially longer than the inferred mass-weighted ages (~50 myr), whichfurther supports the emerging picture that most stars in low-mass galaxies formin short, intense bursts of star formation.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.7525	no more active galactic nuclei in clumpy disks than in smooth galaxies  at z~2 in candels / 3d-hst	we use candels imaging, 3d-hst spectroscopy, and chandra x-ray data toinvestigate if active galactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially fueled byviolent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4. weselect galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number ofclumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. the candels visual classificationsystem is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matchedcomparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. we notethat, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates,the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulgescompared to the clumpy galaxies. the lack of smooth extended disks is probablya general feature of the z~2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directlycompare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift.we find that z~2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced agn fractions selectedby integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatiallyresolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena ratherthan nuclear agns. meanwhile the x-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, andintermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable agn fractions derived fromboth individual detections and stacked non-detections. the data demonstratethat agn fueling modes at z~1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities orsecular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpygalaxies.

1408.1090	inter-comparison of radio-loudness criteria for type 1 agns in the  xmm-cosmos survey	limited studies have been performed on the radio-loud fraction in x-rayselected type 1 agn samples. the consistency between various radio-loudnessdefinitions also needs to be checked. we measure the radio-loudness of the 407type 1 agns in the xmm-cosmos quasar sample using nine criteria from theliterature (six defined in the rest-frame and three defined in the observedframe): $r_l=\log(l_{5ghz}/l_b)$, $q_{24}=\log(l_{24\mu m}/l_{1.4ghz})$,$r_{uv}=\log(l_{5ghz}/l_{2500\aa})$, $r_{i}=\log(l_{1.4ghz}/l_i)$,$r_x=\log(\nu l_{\nu}(5ghz)/l_x)$, $p_{5ghz}=\log(p_{5ghz}(w/hz/sr))$,$r_{l,obs}=\log(f_{1.4ghz}/f_b)$ (observed frame),$r_{i,obs}=\log(f_{1.4ghz}/f_i)$ (observed frame), and $q_{24,obs}=\log(f_{24\mu m}/f_{1.4ghz})$ (observed frame). using any single criteriondefined in the rest-frame, we find a low radio-loud fraction of $\lesssim 5\%$in the xmm-cosmos type 1 agn sample, except for $r_{uv}$. requiring that anytwo criteria agree reduces the radio-loud fraction to $\lesssim 2\%$ for about3/4 of the cases. the low radio-loud fraction cannot be simply explained by thecontribution of the host galaxy luminosity and reddening. the$p_{5ghz}=\log(p_{5ghz}(w/hz/sr))$ gives the smallest radio-loud fraction. twoof the three radio-loud fractions from the criteria defined in the observedframe without k-correction ($r_{l,obs}$ and $r_{i,obs}$) are much larger thanthe radio-loud fractions from other criteria.

1408.2527	the mass evolution of the first galaxies: stellar mass functions and  star formation rates at $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$ in the candels goods-south field	we measure new estimates for the galaxy stellar mass function and starformation rates for samples of galaxies at $z \sim 4,~5,~6~\&amp;~7$ using data inthe candels goods south field. the deep near-infrared observations allow us toconstruct the stellar mass function at $z \geq 6$ directly for the first time.we estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectralenergy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular lineand continuum emission. the observed uv luminosity functions for the samplesare consistent with previous observations, however we find that the observed$m_{uv}$ - m$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constantmass to light ratio and a normalisation which evolves with redshift. ourstellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha \approx -1.9$),steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of theuv luminosity function. integrating our new mass functions, we find theobserved stellar mass density evolves from $\log_{10} \rho_{*} =6.64^{+0.58}_{-0.89}$ at $z \sim 7$ to $7.36\pm0.06$ $\text{m}_{\odot}\text{mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4$. finally, combining the measured uv continuumslopes ($\beta$) with their rest-frame uv luminosities, we calculate dustcorrected star-formation rates (sfr) for our sample. we find the specificstar-formation rate for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst theglobal sfr density falls rapidly over this period. our new sfr densityestimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.

1410.5439	the evolution of the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function  over the first two billion years	we present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet(uv) luminosity function at z=4-8. we use deep hubble space telescope imagingover the candels/goods fields, the hubble ultra deep field and the year 1hubble frontier field deep parallel observations. these surveys provides aneffective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us toperform a robust search for faint (m_uv=-18) and bright (m_uv &lt; -21) galaxies.we select candidate galaxies using a well-tested photometric redshift techniquewith careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446 galaxies at3.5&lt;z&lt;8.5, with &gt;1000 galaxies at z~6-8. we measure the luminosity functionusing a markov chain monte carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. atthe faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higherabundance of uv-bright galaxies at z&gt;6, with m* ~ -21 at z&gt;5, different thanthat inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. at z=8, a singlepower-law provides an equally good fit to the uv luminosity function, while atz=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. wecompare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in m* isconsistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-endof the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. we measure theevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dustattenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z&gt;4,consistent with observations at z&gt;9. our observations are consistent with areionization history that starts at z&gt;10, completes at z&gt;6, and reaches amidpoint (x_hii = 0.5) at 6.7&lt;z&lt;9.4. finally, our observations predict that theabundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies.

1410.7398	clumpy galaxies in candels. i. the definition of uv clumps and the  fraction of clumpy galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3	although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution,the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because thedefinition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. in this paper, we studythe basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3,using our proposed physical definition that uv-bright clumps are discretestar-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of therest-frame uv light of their galaxies. clumps defined this way aresignificantly brighter than the hii regions of nearby large spiral galaxies,either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution andcosmological dimming are considered. under this definition, we measure thefraction of sfgs that contain at least one off-center clump (fclumpy) and thecontributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv light and star formation rate ofsfgs in the candels/goods-s and uds fields, where our mass-complete sampleconsists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q&gt;0.5. the redshift evolution offclumpy changes with the stellar mass (m*) of the galaxies. low-mass(log(m*/msun)&lt;9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant fclumpy of about 60% fromz~3.0 to z~0.5. intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their fclumpy from55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. we find that (1) the trendof disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the fclumpytrend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of thefclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z&lt;1.5, given a realisticobservability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for thefclumpy trend in all masses at z&lt;1.5. the clump contribution to the rest-frameuv light of sfgs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(m*/msun)~10.5 atall redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.(abridged)

1411.3339	deconstructing the galaxy stellar mass function with ukidss and candels:  the impact of colour, structure and environment	we combine photometry from the uds, and candels uds and candels goods-ssurveys to construct the galaxy stellar mass function probing both the low andhigh mass end accurately in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3. the advantages of usinga homogeneous concatenation of these datasets include meaningful measures ofenvironment in the uds, due to its large area (0.88 deg^2), and the highresolution deep imaging in candels (h_160 &gt; 26.0), affording us robust measuresof structural parameters. we construct stellar mass functions for the entiresample as parameterised by the schechter function, and find that there is adecline in the values of phi and of alpha with higher redshifts, and a nearlyconstant m* up to z~3. we divide the galaxy stellar mass function by colour,structure, and environment and explore the links between environmentalover-density, morphology, and the quenching of star formation. we find that adouble schechter function describes galaxies with high sersic index (n&gt;2.5),similar to galaxies which are red or passive. the low-mass end of the n&gt;2.5stellar mass function is dominated by blue galaxies, whereas the high-mass endis dominated by red galaxies. this hints that possible links betweenmorphological evolution and star formation quenching are only present inhigh-mass galaxies. this is turn suggests that there are strong mass dependentquenching mechanisms. in addition, we find that the number density of high masssystems is elevated in dense environments, suggesting that an environmentalprocess is building up massive galaxies quicker in over densities than in lowerdensities.

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

1504.00005	an increasing stellar baryon fraction in bright galaxies at high  redshift	recent observations have shown that the characteristic luminosity of therest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function does not significantly evolveat 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 and is approximately m*_uv ~ -21. we investigate this apparentnon-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, m_uv &lt; -21 galaxies at z=4to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. including deepspitzer/irac imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find thatm*_uv galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(m/msol)=9.6-9.9 andare thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. however, bright galaxiesat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly brightgalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formationrates and levels of dust attenuation. we match the abundances of these brightz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the bolshoi lambda-cdm simulation toestimate the halo masses. we find that the typical halo masses in ~m*_uvgalaxies decrease from log(m_h/msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(m_h/msol)=11.4 at z=7.thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multipleredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. thestellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean omega_b/omega_m rises from5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigmalevel. this rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, isallowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars athigh redshifts.

1505.01160	uvudf: ultraviolet through near-infrared catalog and photometric  redshifts of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field	we present photometry and derived redshifts from up to eleven bandpasses for9927 galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field (udf), covering an observedwavelength range from the near-ultraviolet (nuv) to the near-infrared (nir)with hubble space telescope observations. our wide field camera 3 (wfc3)/uvf225w, f275w, and f336w image mosaics from the ultra-violet udf (uvudf) imagingcampaign are newly calibrated to correct for charge transfer inefficiency, anduse new dark calibrations to minimize background gradients and pattern noise.our nir wfc3/ir image mosaics combine the imaging from the udf09 and udf12campaigns with candels data to provide nir coverage for the entire udf field ofview. we use aperture-matched point-spread function corrected photometry tomeasure photometric redshifts in the udf, sampling both the lyman break andbalmer break of galaxies at z~0.8-3.4, and one of the breaks over the rest ofthe redshift range. our comparison of these results with a compilation ofrobust spectroscopic redshifts shows an improvement in the galaxy photometricredshifts by a factor of two in scatter and a factor three in outlier fractionover previous udf catalogs. the inclusion of the new nuv data is responsiblefor a factor of two decrease in the outlier fraction compared to redshiftsdetermined from only the optical and nir data, and improves the scatter atz&lt;0.5 and at z&gt;2. the panchromatic coverage of the udf from the nuv through thenir yields robust photometric redshifts of the udf, with the lowest outlierfraction available.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1507.04439	discovery of massive, mostly star-formation quenched galaxies with  extremely large lyman-alpha equivalent widths at z ~ 3	we report a discovery of 6 massive galaxies with both extremely large lyaequivalent width and evolved stellar population at z ~ 3. these massiveextremely strong lya emitting objects (maestlos) have been discovered in ourlarge-volume systematic survey for strong lya emitters (laes) with twelveoptical intermediate-band data taken with subaru/suprime-cam in the cosmosfield. based on the sed fitting analysis for these laes, it is found that thesemaestlos have (1) large rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0(lya) ~ 100--300 a,(2) m_star ~ 10^10.5--10^11.1 m_sun, and (3) relatively low specific starformation rates of sfr/m_star ~ 0.03--1 gyr^-1. three of the 6 maestlos haveextended ly$\alpha$ emission with a radius of several kpc although they showvery compact morphology in the hst/acs images, which correspond to therest-frame uv continuum. since the maestlos do not show any evidence for agns,the observed extended lya emission is likely to be caused by star formationprocess including the superwind activity. we suggest that this new class oflaes, maestlos, provides a missing link from star-forming to passively evolvinggalaxies at the peak era of the cosmic star-formation history.

1507.07939	shards: a global view of the star formation activity at z~0.84 and  z~1.23	in this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of star-forming galaxies(sfgs) at intermediate redshifts (z~1). we combine the ultra-deep opticalspectro-photometric data from the survey for high-z absorption red and deadsources (shards) with deep uv-to-fir observations in the goods-n field.exploiting two of the 25 shards medium-band filters, f687w17 and f823w17, weselect [oii] emission line galaxies at z~0.84 and z~1.23 and characterize theirphysical properties. their rest-frame equivalent widths(ew$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([oii])), line fluxes, luminosities, star formation rates(sfrs) and dust attenuation properties are investigated. the evolution of theew$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([oii]) closely follows the sfr density evolution of theuniverse, with a trend of ew$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([oii])$\propto$(1+z)$^3$ up toredshift z~1, followed by a possible flattening. the sf properties of thegalaxies selected on the basis of their [oii] emission are compared withcomplementary samples of sfgs selected by their mir and fir emission, and alsowith a general mass-selected sample of galaxies at the same redshifts. wedemonstrate observationally that the uvj diagram (or, similarly, a cut in thespecific sfr) is only partially able to distinguish the quiescent galaxies fromthe sfgs. the sfr-m$_*$ relation is investigated for the different samples,yelding a logarithmic slope ~1, in good agreement with previous results. thedust attenuations derived from different sfr indicators (uv(1600), uv(2800),[oii], ir) are compared and show clear trends with respect to both the stellarmass and total sfr, with more massive and highly star-forming galaxies beingaffected by stronger dust attenuation.

1509.03629	are compton-thick agn the missing link between mergers and black hole  growth?	we examine the host morphologies of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei(agn) at $z\sim1$ to test whether obscured supermassive black hole growth atthis epoch is preferentially linked to galaxy mergers. our sample consists of154 obscured agn with $n_{\rm h}&gt;10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $z&lt;1.5$. using visualclassifications, we compare the morphologies of these agn to control samples ofmoderately obscured ($10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $&lt;n_{\rm h}&lt; 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) andunobscured ($n_{\rm h}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) agn. these control agn are matchedin redshift and intrinsic x-ray luminosity to our heavily obscured agn. we findthat heavily obscured agn at z~1 are twice as likely to be hosted by late-typegalaxies relative to unobscured agn ($65.3^{+4.1}_{-4.6}\%$ vs$34.5^{+2.9}_{-2.7}\%$) and three times as likely to exhibit merger orinteraction signatures ($21.5^{+4.2}_{-3.3}\%$ vs $7.8^{+1.9}_{-1.3}\%$). theincreased merger fraction is significant at the 3.8$\sigma$ level. we also findthat the incidence of point-like morphologies is inversely proportional toobscuration. if we exclude all point sources and consider only extended hosts,we find the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is stillevident, however at a reduced statistical significance ($2.5\sigma$). the factthat we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicatesthat viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three agnsamples, as a simple unification model would suggest. the increased fraction ofdisturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, inwhich compton-thick agn are a distinct phase of obscured smbh growth followinga merger/interaction event. our findings also suggest that some of themerger-triggered smbh growth predicted by recent agn fueling models may behidden among the heavily obscured, compton-thick population.

astro-ph;0101441	3c236: radio source, interrupted?	we present new hst stis/mama near-uv images and archival wfpc2 v and r bandimages which reveal the presence of four star forming regions in an arc alongthe edge of the dust lane in the giant (4 mpc) radio galaxy 3c236. two of thestar forming regions are relatively young with ages of order 1e7 yr, while theother two are older with ages of order 1e8 - 1e9 yr which is comparable to theestimated age of the giant radio source. based on dynamical and spectral agingarguments, we suggest that the fuel supply to the agn was interrupted for 1e7yr and has now been restored, resulting in the formation of the inner 2 kpcscale radio source. this time scale is similar to that of the age of theyoungest of the star forming regions. we suggest that the transport of gas inthe disk is non-steady and that this produces both the multiple episodes ofstar formation in the disk as well as the multiple epochs of radio sourceactivity. if the inner radio source and the youngest star forming region arerelated by the same event of gas transport, the gas must be transported fromthe hundreds of pc scale to the sub-parsec scale on a time scale of 1e7 yr,which is similar to the dynamical time scale of the gas on the hundreds of pcscales.

astro-ph;0309187	morphologies and spectral energy distributions of extremely red galaxies  in the goods-south field	using u'- through ks-band imaging data in the goods-south field, we constructa large, complete sample of 275 ``extremely red objects'' (eros; k_s&lt;22.0,r-k_s&gt;3.35; ab), all with deep hst/acs imaging in b_435, v_606, i_775, andz_850, and well-calibrated photometric redshifts. quantitative concentrationand asymmetry measurements fail to separate eros into distinct morphologicalclasses. we therefore visually classify the morphologies of all eros into fourbroad types: ``early'' (elliptical-like), ``late'' (disk galaxies),``irregular'' and ``other'' (chain galaxies and low surface brightnessgalaxies), and calculate their relative fractions and comoving space densities.for a broad range of limiting magnitudes and color thresholds, the relativenumber of early-type eros is approximately constant at 33-44%, and the comovingspace densities of early- and late-type eros are comparable. mean rest-framespectral energy distributions (seds) at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1.2 um areconstructed for all eros. the seds are extremely similar in their range ofshapes, independent of morphological type. the implication is that anydifferences between the broad-band seds of early-type eros and the other typesare relatively subtle, and there is no robust way of photometricallydistinguishing between different morphological types with usualoptical/near-infrared photometry.
