0908.1025	discovery of a close substellar companion to the hot subdwarf star hd  149382 - the decisive influence of substellar objects on late stellar  evolution	substellar objects, like planets and brown dwarfs orbiting stars, areby-products of the star formation process. the evolution of their host starsmay have an enourmous impact on these small companions. vice versa a planetmight also influence stellar evolution as has recently been argued.  here we report the discovery of a 8-23 jupiter-mass substellar objectorbiting the hot subdwarf hd 149382 in 2.391 days at a distance of only aboutfive solar radii. obviously the companion must have survived engulfment in thered-giant envelope. moreover, the substellar companion has triggered envelopeejection and enabled the sdb star to form. hot subdwarf stars have beenidentified as the sources of the unexpected ultravoilet emission in ellipticalgalaxies, but the formation of these stars is not fully understood. being thebrightest star of its class, hd 149382 offers the best conditions to detect thesubstellar companion. hence, undisclosed substellar companions offer a naturalsolution for the long-standing formation problem of apparently single hotsubdwarf stars. planets and brown dwarfs may therefore alter the evolution ofold stellar populations and may also significantly affect the uv-emission ofelliptical galaxies.

1011.4793	massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars from sdss  (muchfuss) - analysis of seven close subdwarf b binaries	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims at finding hot subdwarf stars with massive compactcompanions like massive white dwarfs (m &gt; 1.0 msun), neutron stars or stellarmass black holes. the existence of such systems is predicted by binaryevolution theory and recent discoveries indicate that they exist in our galaxy.first results are presented for seven close binary sdbs with short orbitalperiods ranging from 0.21 d to 1.5 d. the atmospheric parameters of all objectsare compatible with core helium-burning stars. the companions are most likelywhite dwarfs. in one case the companion could be shown to be a white dwarf bythe absence of light-curve variations. however, in most cases late type mainsequence stars cannot be firmly excluded. comparing our small sample with theknown population of close sdb binaries we show that our target selection methodaiming at massive companions is efficient. the minimum companion masses of allbinaries in our sample are high compared to the reference sample of known sdbbinaries.

1102.4757	binaries discovered by the spy survey vi. discovery of a low mass  companion to the hot subluminous planetary nebula central star egb\,5 - a  recently ejected common envelope?	hot subdwarf b stars (sdbs) in close binary systems are assumed to be formedvia common envelope ejection. according to theoretical models, the amount ofenergy and angular momentum deposited in the common envelope scales with themass of the companion. that low mass companions near or below the corehydrogen-burning limit are able to trigger the ejection of this envelope iswell known. the currently known systems have very short periods$\simeq0.1-0.3\,{\rm d}$. here we report the discovery of a low mass companion($m_{\rm 2}&gt;0.14\,m_{\rm \odot}$) orbiting the sdb star and central star of aplanetary nebula egb\,5 with an orbital period of $16.5\,{\rm d}$ at a minimumseparation of $23\,r_{\rm \odot}$. its long period is only just consistent withthe energy balance prescription of the common envelope. the marked differencebetween the short and long period systems will provide strong constraints onthe common envelope phase, in particular if the masses of the sdb stars can bemeasured accurately. due to selection effects, the fraction of sdbs with lowmass companions and similar or longer periods may be quite high. low massstellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for thestill unclear formation of hot subdwarf stars. furthermore, the nebula aroundegb\,5 may be the remnant of the ejected common envelope making this binary aunique system to study this short und poorly understood phase of binaryevolution.

1103.1989	binaries discovered by the muchfuss project sdss j08205+0008 - an  eclipsing subdwarf b binary with brown dwarf companion	hot subdwarf b stars (sdbs) are extreme horizontal branch stars believed tooriginate from close binary evolution. indeed about half of the known sdb starsare found in close binaries with periods ranging from a few hours to a fewdays. the enormous mass loss required to remove the hydrogen envelope of thered-giant progenitor almost entirely can be explained by common envelopeejection. a rare subclass of these binaries are the eclipsing hw vir binarieswhere the sdb is orbited by a dwarf m star. here we report the discovery of anhw vir system in the course of the muchfuss project. a most likely substellarobject ($\simeq0.068\,m_{\rm \odot}$) was found to orbit the hot subdwarfj08205+0008 with a period of 0.096 days. since the eclipses are total, thesystem parameters are very well constrained. j08205+0008 has the lowestunambiguously measured companion mass yet found in a subdwarf b binary. thisimplies that the most likely substellar companion has not only survived theengulfment by the red-giant envelope, but also triggered its ejection andenabled the sdb star to form. the system provides evidence that brown dwarfsmay indeed be able to significantly affect late stellar evolution.

1103.4045	the muchfuss project - searching for hot subdwarf binaries with massive  unseen companions: survey, target selection and atmospheric parameters	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims at finding sdbs with compact companions like supermassivewhite dwarfs (m&gt;1.0 msun), neutron stars or black holes. the existence of suchsystems is predicted by binary evolution theory and recent discoveries indicatethat they are likely to exist in our galaxy. a determination of the orbitalparameters is sufficient to put a lower limit on the companion mass bycalculating the binary mass function. if this lower limit exceeds thechandrasekhar mass and no sign of a companion is visible in the spectra, theexistence of a massive compact companion is proven without the need for anyadditional assumptions. we identified about 1100 hot subdwarf stars from thesdss by colour selection and visual inspection of their spectra. stars withhigh velocities have been reobserved and individual sdss spectra have beenanalysed. in total 127 radial velocity variable subdwarfs have been discovered.binaries with high rv shifts and binaries with moderate shifts within shorttimespans have the highest probability of hosting massive compact companions.atmospheric parameters of 69 hot subdwarfs in these binary systems have beendetermined by means of a quantitative spectral analysis. the atmosphericparameter distribution of the selected sample does not differ from previouslystudied samples of hot subdwarfs. the systems are considered the bestcandidates to search for massive compact companions by follow-up time resolvedspectroscopy.

1104.4202	the fast rotating, low gravity subdwarf b star ec 22081-1916 - remnant  of a common envelope merger event	hot subdwarf b stars (sdbs) are evolved core helium-burning stars with verythin hydrogen envelopes. in order to form an sdb, the progenitor has to losealmost all of its hydrogen envelope right at the tip of the red giant branch.in binary systems, mass transfer to the companion provides the extraordinarymass loss required for their formation. however, apparently single sdbs existas well and their formation is unclear since decades. the merger of heliumwhite dwarfs leading to an ignition of core helium-burning or the merger of ahelium core and a low mass star during the common envelope phase have beenproposed. here we report the discovery of ec 22081-1916 as a fast rotating,single sdb star of low gravity. its atmospheric parameters indicate, that thehydrogen envelope must be unusually thick, which is at variance with the he-wdmerger scenario, but consistent with a common envelope merger of a low-mass,possibly substellar object with a red-giant core.

1107.4986	discovery of a stripped red giant core in a bright eclipsing binary  system	we have identified a star in the wasp archive photometry with an unusuallightcurve due to the total eclipse of a small, hot star by an apparentlynormal a-type star and with an orbital period of only 0.668d. from an analysisof the wasp lightcurve together with v-band and i_c-band photometry of theeclipse and a spectroscopic orbit for the a-type star we estimate that thecompanion star has a mass of (0.23+-0.03)msun and a radius of (0.33+-0.01)rsun,assuming that the a-type star is a main-sequence star with the metalicityappropriate for a thick-disk star. the effective temperature of the companionis (13400+-1200)k from which we infer a luminosity of (3+-1)lsun. from acomparison of these parameters to various models we conclude that the companionis most likely to be the remnant of a red giant star that has been veryrecently stripped of its outer layers by mass transfer onto the a-type star. inthis scenario, the companion is currently in a shell hydrogen-burning phase ofits evolution, evolving at nearly constant luminosity to hotter effectivetemperatures prior to ceasing hydrogen burning and fading to become a low-masswhite dwarf composed of helium (he-wd). the system will then resemble thepre-he-wd/he-wd companions to a-type and b-type stars recently identified fromtheir kepler satellite lightcurves (koi-74, koi-81 and kic10657664). this newlydiscovered binary offers the opportunity to study the evolution of a strippedred giant star through the pre-he-wd stage in great detail.

1112.2922	the muchfuss project - searching for the most massive companions to hot  subdwarf stars in close binaries and finding the least massive ones	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims at finding hot subdwarf stars with massive compactcompanions (massive white dwarfs m&gt;1.0 msun, neutron stars or stellar massblack holes). the existence of such systems is predicted by binary evolutiontheory and some candidate systems have been found. we classified about 1400 hotsubdwarf stars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) by colour selection andvisual inspection of their spectra. stars with high velocities have beenreobserved and individual sdss spectra have been analysed. in total 201 radialvelocity variable subdwarfs have been discovered and about 140 of them havebeen selected as good candidates for follow-up time resolved spectroscopy toderive their orbital parameters and photometric follow-up to search forfeatures like eclipses in the light curves. up to now we found seven closebinary sdbs with short orbital periods ranging from 0.21 d to 1.5 d and twoeclipsing binaries with companions that are most likely of substellar nature. anew pulsating sdb in a close binary system has been discovered as well.

1112.2929	low-mass stellar and substellar companions to sdb stars	it has been suggested that besides stellar companions, substellar objects inclose orbits may be able to trigger mass loss in a common envelope phase andform hot subdwarfs. in an ongoing project we search for close substellarcompanions combining time resolved high resolution spectroscopy withphotometry. we determine the fraction of as yet undetected radial velocityvariable systems from a sample of 27 apparently single sdb stars to be 16%. wediscovered low-mass stellar companions to the he-sdb cpd-20 1123 and thepulsator kpd 0629-0016. the brown dwarf reported to orbit the eclipsing binarysdss j0820+0008 could be confirmed by an analysis of high resolution spectrataken with uves. reflection effects have been detected in the light curves ofthe known sdb binaries cpd-64 481 and bps cs 22169-0001. the inclinations ofthese systems must be much higher than expected and the most likely companionmasses are in the substellar regime. finally, we determined the orbit of thesdb binary phl 457, which has a very small radial velocity amplitude and mayhost the lowest mass substellar companion known. the implications of these newresults for the open question of sdb formation are discussed.

1203.1143	multi-object spectroscopy of stars in the corot fields i: early-type  stars in the corot-fields ira01, lra01, lra02	observations of giant stars indicate that the frequency of giant planets ismuch higher for intermediate-mass stars than for solar-like stars. up to nowall known planets of giant stars orbit at relatively far distances from theirhost stars. it is not known whether intermediate-mass stars also had manyclose-in planets when they were on the main sequence, which were then engulfedwhen the star became a giant star. to understand the formation and evolution ofplanets it is therefore important to find out whether main-sequence stars ofintermediate-mass have close-in planets or not. a survey for transiting planetsof intermediate-mass stars would be ideal to solve this question, because thedetection of transiting planets is not affected by the rapid rotation of thesestars. as a first step for an efficient survey we need to identifyintermediate-mass stars in the corot-fields, which can then be used as an inputlist. to compile the input list we derived the spectral types of essentiallyall o, b and a stars down to 14.5 mag in the corot fields ira01, lra01, lra02taken with the multi-object spectrograph aaomega. we determined the spectraltypes by comparing the spectra with template spectra from a library. in totalwe identify 1856 a and b stars that have been observed with corot. given thenumber of planets that have been detected in these fields amongst late-typestars, we estimate that there are one to four transiting planets ofintermediate-mass stars waiting to be discovered. our survey not only allows usto carry out a dedicated planet search programme but is also essential for anytypes of studies of the light curves of early-type stars in the corot database.we also show that it would be possible to extend the survey to all fields thatcorot has observed using photometrically determined spectral types.

0710.5836	tidal synchronization of the subdwarf b binary pg 0101+039	tidally locked rotation is a frequently applied assumption that helps tomeasure masses of invisible compact companions in close binaries. thecalculations of synchronization times are affected by large uncertainties inparticular for stars with radiative envelopes calling for observationalconstraints. we aim at verifying tidally locked rotation for the binary pg0101+039, a subdwarf b star + white dwarf binary from its tiny (0.025 %) lightvariations measured with the most satellite (randall et al. 2005). binaryparameters were derived from the mass function, apparent rotation and surfacegravity of pg 0101+039 assuming a canonical mass of 0.47 mo and tidally lockedrotation. the light curve was then synthesised and was found to match theobserved amplitude well. we verified that the light variations are due toellipsoidal deformation and that tidal synchronization is established for pg0101+039. we conclude that this assumption should hold for all sdb binarieswith orbital periods of less than half a day. hence the masses can be derivedfrom systems too faint to measure tiny light variations.

1203.1919	the metal-enriched host of an energetic gamma-ray burst at z ~ 1.6	(abridged) long gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies might open a short-cut tothe characteristics of typical star-forming galaxies throughout the history ofthe universe. due to the absence of near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy, however,detailed investigations, specifically a determination of the gas-phasemetallicity of gamma-ray burst hosts, was largely limited to redshifts z &lt; 1 todate. here, we report observations of the galaxy hosting grb 080605 at z = 1.64using optical/nir spectroscopy and high-resolution hst/wfc3 imaging. we availof vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy to measure the metallicity, electron density,star-formation rate (sfr), and reddening of the host. specifically, we usedifferent strong-line diagnostics based on [n ii] to robustly measure thegas-phase metallicity for the first time for a grb host at this redshift. thehost of the energetic (e_iso ~ 2 x 10^53 erg) grb 080605 is a morphologicallycomplex, vigorously star-forming galaxy with an h\alpha-derived sfr of 31m_sun/yr. its ism is significantly enriched with metals with an oxygenabundance between 8.3 and 8.6 depending on the adopted strong-line calibrator.this corresponds to values in the range of 0.4-0.8 times the solar value. forits measured stellar mass of 8 x 10^9 m_sun and sfr this value is consistentwith the fundamental metallicity relation defined by star-forming fieldgalaxies. our observations directly illustrate that grb hosts are notnecessarily metal-poor, both on absolute scales as well as relative to theirstellar mass and sfr. grb hosts could thus be fair tracers of the population ofordinary star-forming galaxies as a whole at high redshift.

1204.4387	the helium-rich subdwarf cpd-20 1123: a post-common envelope binary  evolving onto the extended horizontal branch	subluminous b stars come in a variety of flavours including single stars,close and wide binaries, and pulsating and non-pulsating variables. a majorityhave helium-poor surfaces (helium by number nhe&lt;1%), whilst a minority haveextremely helium-rich surfaces (nhe&gt;90%). a small number have an intermediatesurface helium abundance (~ 10 - 30%), accompanied by peculiar abundances ofother elements. the questions posed are i) whether these abundancepeculiarities are associated with radiatively-driven and time-dependentstratification of elements within the photosphere as the star evolves from anhelium-enriched progenitor to become a normal helium-poor sdb star, and ii)whether these phenomena occur only in single sdb stars or are also associatedwith sdb stars in binaries.  we present a fine analysis of the bright intermediate-helium sdb star cpd-201123 (albus 1) which shows it to be cool, for a hot subdwarf, with teff~23 000k and with a surface helium abundance ~17% by number. other elements do notshow extraordinary anomalies; in common with majority sdb stars, carbon andoxygen are substantially depleted, whilst nitrogen is enriched. magnesiumthrough sulphur appear to be depleted by ~0.5 dex, but chlorine and argon aresubstantially enhanced.  we also present a series of radial-velocity measurements which show the starto be a close binary with an orbital period of 2.3 d, suggesting it to be apost-common-envelope system.  the discovery of an intermediate helium-rich sdb star in a close binary inaddition to known and apparently single exemplars supports the view that theseare very young sdb stars in which radiatively-driven stratification of thephotosphere is incomplete.

1206.6977	hot subdwarf stars in close-up view - ii. rotational properties of  single and wide binary subdwarf b stars	subluminous b stars (sdbs) form the extremely hot end of the horizontalbranch and are therefore related to the blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars.while the rotational properties of bhb stars have been investigatedextensively, studies of sdb stars have concentrated on close binaries that areinfluenced by tidal interactions between their components. here we present astudy of 105 sdb stars, which are either single stars or in wide binaries wheretidal effects become negligible. the projected rotational velocities have beendetermined by measuring the broadening of metal lines using high-resolutionoptical spectra. all stars in our sample are slow rotators (${v_{\rmrot}\sin{i}}&lt;10\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$). furthermore, the $v_{\rmrot}\sin{i}$-distributions of single sdbs are similar to those of hot subdwarfsin wide binaries with main-sequence companions as well as close binary systemswith unseen companions and periods exceeding $\simeq1.2\,{\rm d}$. we show thatblue horizontal and extreme horizontal branch stars are also related in termsof surface rotation and angular momentum. hot blue horizontal branch stars($t_{\rm eff}&gt;11\,500\,{\rm k}$) with diffusion-dominated atmospheres are slowrotators like the hot subdwarf stars located on the extreme horizontal branch,which lost more envelope and therefore angular momentum in the red-giant phase.the uniform rotation distributions of single and wide binary sdbs pose achallenge to our understanding of hot subdwarf formation. especially the highfraction of helium white dwarf mergers predicted by theory seems to beinconsistent with the results presented here.

1207.1193	optical/near-infrared selection of red qsos: evidence for steep  extinction curves towards galactic centers?	we present the results of a search for red qsos using a selection based onoptical imaging from sdss and near-infrared imaging from ukidss. for a sampleof 58 candidates 46 (79%) are confirmed to be qsos. the qsos are predominantlydust-reddened except a handul at redshifts z&gt;3.5. the dust is most likelylocated in the qso host galaxies. 4 (7%) of the candidates turned out to belate-type stars, and another 4 (7%) are compact galaxies. the remaining 4objects we could not identify. in terms of their optical spectra the qsos aresimilar to the qsos selected in the first-2mass red quasar survey except theyare on average fainter, more distant and only two are detected in the firstsurvey. we estimate the amount of extinction using the sdss qso templatereddened by smc-like dust. it is possible to get a good match to the observed(restframe ultraviolet) spectra, but for nearly all the reddened qsos it is notpossible to match the near-ir photometry from ukidss. the likely reasons arethat the sdss qso template is too red at optical wavelengths due tocontaminating host galaxy light and that the assumed smc extinction curve istoo shallow. our survey has demonstrated that selection of qsos based onnear-ir photometry is an efficent way to select qsos, including reddened qsos,with only small contamination from late-type stars and compact galaxies. thiswill be useful with ongoing and future wide-field near-ir surveys such as thevista and euclid surveys.

1211.2689	hot subdwarf stars in close-up view - iii. metal abundances of subdwarf  b stars	context: hot subdwarf b stars (sdbs) are considered to be core helium-burningstars with very thin hydrogen envelopes situated on or near the extremehorizontal branch (ehb). the formation of sdbs is still unclear as well as thechemical composition of their atmospheres. the observed helium depletion isattributed to atmospheric diffusion. metal abundances have been determined forabout a dozen sdbs only resulting in puzzling patterns with enrichment of heavymetals and depletion of lighter ones. aims: in this paper we present a detailedmetal abundance analysis of 106 sdbs. methods: from high resolution spectra wemeasured elemental abundances of up to 24 different ions per star. asemi-automatic analysis pipeline was developed to calculate and fit lte modelsto a standard set of spectral lines. results: a general trend of enrichment wasfound with increasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. the lighterelements like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted and less affected bytemperature. although there is considerable scatter from star to star, thegeneral abundance patterns in most sdbs are similar. state-of-the-art diffusionmodels predict such patterns and are in qualitative agreement with our results.however, the highest enrichments measured cannot not be explained with thesemodels. peculiar line shapes of the strongest metal lines in some starsindicate vertical stratification to be present in the atmospheres. such effectsare not accounted for in current diffusion models and may be responsible forsome of the yet unexplained abundance anomalies.

1304.4452	a progenitor binary and an ejected mass donor remnant of faint type ia  supernovae	type ia supernovae (sn ia) are the most important standard candles formeasuring the expansion history of the universe. the thermonuclear explosion ofa white dwarf can explain their observed properties, but neither the progenitorsystems nor any stellar remnants have been conclusively identified.underluminous sn ia have been proposed to originate from a so-calleddouble-detonation of a white dwarf. after a critical amount of helium isdeposited on the surface through accretion from a close companion, the heliumis ignited causing a detonation wave that triggers the explosion of the whitedwarf itself. we have discovered both shallow transits and eclipses in thetight binary system cd-30 11223 composed of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf and ahot helium star, allowing us to determine its component masses and fundamentalparameters. in the future the system will transfer mass from the helium star tothe white dwarf. modelling this process we find that the detonation in theaccreted helium layer is sufficiently strong to trigger the explosion of thecore. the helium star will then be ejected at so large a velocity that it willescape the galaxy. the predicted properties of this remnant are an excellentmatch to the so-called hypervelocity star us 708, a hot, helium-rich starmoving at more than 750 km/s, sufficient to leave the galaxy. theidentification of both progenitor and remnant provides a consistent picture ofthe formation and evolution of underluminous type ia supernovae.

1305.6832	discovery of the broad-lined type ic sn 2013cq associated with the very  energetic grb 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) at z &lt; 1 are in most cases found to beaccompanied by bright, broad-lined type ic supernovae (sne ic-bl). thehighest-energy grbs are mostly located at higher redshifts, where theassociated sne are hard to detect observationally. here we present early andlate observations of the optical counterpart of the very energetic grb 130427a.despite its moderate redshift z = 0.3399+/-0.0002, grb 130427a is at the highend of the grb energy distribution, with an isotropic-equivalent energy releaseof eiso ~ 9.6x10^53 erg, more than an order of magnitude more energetic thanother grbs with spectroscopically confirmed sne. in our dense photometricmonitoring, we detect excess flux in the host-subtracted r-band light curve,consistent with what expected from an emerging sn, ~0.2 mag fainter than theprototypical sn 1998bw. a spectrum obtained around the time of the sn peak(16.7 days after the grb) reveals broad undulations typical of sne ic-bl,confirming the presence of a sn, designated sn 2013cq. the spectral shape andearly peak time are similar to those of the high expansion velocity sn 2010bhassociated with grb 100316d. our findings demonstrate that high-energylong-duration grbs, commonly detected at high redshift, can also be associatedwith sne ic-bl, pointing to a common progenitor mechanism.

1306.2940	the galaxy counterparts of the two high-metallicity dlas at z=2.412 and  z=2.583 towards q0918+1636	the quasar q0918+1636 (z=3.07) has two intervening high-metallicity dampedlyman-alpha absorbers (dlas) along the line of sight, at redshifts of z=2.412and 2.583. the z=2.583 dla is located at a large impact parameter of 16.2 kpc,and despite this large impact parameter it has a very high metallicity(consistent with solar), a substantial fraction of h_2 molecules, and it isdusty as inferred from the reddened spectrum of the background qso. the z=2.412dla has a metallicity of [m/h]=-0.6 (based on znii and siii). in this paper wepresent new observations of this interesting sightline. hst/wfc3 imaging wasobtained in the f606w, f105w and f160w bands. this is complemented byground-based imaging in the u-, g-bands as well as k_s observations in thenear-infrared (nir). in addition, we present further spectroscopy with theeso/vlt x-shooter spectrograph. based on these observations we obtain thefollowing results: by fitting stellar population synthesis models to thephotometric sed we constrain the physical properties of the z=2.583 dla galaxy,and we infer its morphology by fitting a sersic model to its surface brightnessprofile. we find it to be a relatively massive (m_star 10^10 m_sun), stronglystar-forming (sfr~30 m_sun / yr, dusty (e_(b-v)=0.4) galaxy with a disk-likemorphology. we detect most of the strong emission lines from the z=2.583 dla[oiii],3727, [oiii],4960, [oiii],5007, hbeta, and halpha, albeit at lowsignal-to-noise (sn) ratio except for the [oiii],5007 line. we also detect[oiii],5007 emission from the galaxy counterpart of the z=2.412 dla at a smallimpact parameter (&lt;2 kpc). overall our findings are consistent with theemerging picture that high-metallicity dlas are associated with relatively(compared to typical dlas) luminous and massive galaxy counterparts.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.5263	binaries discovered by the muchfuss project: sdss j162256.66$+$473051.1  - an eclipsing subdwarf b binary with a brown dwarf companion	hot subdwarf b stars (sdbs) are core helium-burning stars located on theextreme horizontal branch. about half of the known sdb stars are found in closebinaries. their short orbital periods of 1.2 h to a few days suggest that theyare post common-envelope systems. eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries are rare, butimportant to determine the fundamental stellar parameters. low-mass companionsare identified by the reflection effect. in most cases the companion is a mainsequence star near the stellar mass limit. here we report the discovery of aneclipsing hot subdwarf binary sdss j162256.66+473051.1 (j1622) of very shortorbital period (0.0697 d), found in the course of the muchfuss project. thelightcurve shows grazing eclipses and a prominent reflection effect. ananalysis of the light- and radial velocity (rv) curves indicated a mass ratioof $q=$ 0.1325, an rv semiamplitude $k=47.2\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$, and an inclinationof $i=72.33^\circ$. we show that a companion mass of 0.064 $m_{\rm \odot}$,well below the hydrogen-burning limit, is the most plausible solution, whichimplies a mass close to the canonical mass (0.47 $m_{\rm \odot}$) of the sdbstar. therefore, the companion is a brown dwarf, which not only survived theengulfment by the red-giant envelope, but also triggered its ejection, andenabled the sdb star to form. the rotation of j1622 is expected to be tidallylocked to the orbit. however, j1622 rotates too slowly ($v_{\rm rot}=74.5\pm7\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$) to be synchronized, challenging tidal interaction models.

1404.4446	constraints on the winds of hot subdwarf stars from x-ray observations  of two sdb binaries with compact companions: cd -30 11223 and pg 1232-136	little observational data are available on the weak stellar winds of hotsubdwarf stars of b spectral type (sdb). close binary systems composed of ansdb star and a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) couldbe detected as accretion-powered x-ray sources. the study of their x-rayemission can probe the properties of line-driven winds of sdb stars that cannot be derived directly from spectroscopy because of the low luminosity ofthese stars. here we report on the first sensitive x-ray observations of twosdb binaries with compact companions. cd -30 11223 is the sdb binary with theshortest known orbital period (1.2 h) and its companion is certainly a whitedwarf. pg 1232-136 is an sdb binary considered the best candidate to host ablack hole companion. we observed these stars with xmm-newton in august 2013for 50 ks and in july 2009 for 36 ks, respectively. none of them was detectedand we derived luminosity upper limits of about 1.5x10^29 erg/s for cd -3011223 5x10^29 erg/s for pg 1232-136. the corresponding mass loss rate for pg1232-136 is poorly constrained, owing to the unknown efficiency for black holeaccretion. on the other hand, in the case of cd -30 11223 we could derive,under reasonable assumptions, an upper limit of about 3x10^-13 solar masses/yron the wind mass loss rate from the sdb star. this is one of the fewobservational constraints on the weak winds expected in this class of low masshot stars. we also report the results on the x-ray emission from a cluster ofgalaxies serendipitously discovered in the field of cd -30 11223.

1408.4288	selecting asteroids for a targeted spectroscopic survey	asteroid spectroscopy reflects surface mineralogy. there are few thousandasteroids whose surfaces have been observed spectrally. determining the surfaceproperties of those objects is important for many practical and scientificapplications, such as for example developing impact deflection strategies orstudying history and evolution of the solar system and planet formation.  the aim of this study is to develop a pre-selection method that can beutilized in searching for asteroids of any taxonomic complex. the method couldthen be utilized im multiple applications such as searching for the missingv-types or looking for primitive asteroids.  we used the bayes naive classifier combined with observations obtained in thecourse of the sloan digital sky survey and the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer surveys as well as a database of asteroid phase curves for asteroidswith known taxonomic type. using the new classification method we have selecteda number of possible v-type candidates. some of the candidates were thanspectrally observed at the nordic optical telescope and south african largetelescope.  we have developed and tested the new pre-selection method. we found threeasteroids in the mid/outer main belt that are likely of differentiated type.near-infrared are still required to confirm this discovery. similarly to otherstudies we found that v-type candidates cluster around the vesta family and arerare in the mid/oter main belt.  the new method shows that even largely explored large databases combinedtogether could still be further exploited in for example solving the missingdunite problem.

1409.2345	kic7668647: a 14 day beaming sdb+wd binary with a pulsating subdwarf	the recently discovered subdwarf b (sdb) pulsator kic7668647 is one of the 18pulsating sdb stars detected in the kepler field. it features a rich g-modefrequency spectrum, with a few low-amplitude p-modes at short periods.  we use new ground-based low-resolution spectroscopy, and the near-continuous2.88 year kepler lightcurve, to reveal that kic7668647 consists of a subdwarf bstar with an unseen white-dwarf companion with an orbital period of 14.2d. anorbit with a radial-velocity amplitude of 39km/s is consistently determinedfrom the spectra, from the orbital doppler beaming seen by kepler at 163ppm,and from measuring the orbital light-travel delay of 27 by timing of the manypulsations seen in the kepler lightcurve. the white dwarf has a minimum mass of0.40 m_sun.  we use our high signal-to-noise average spectra to study the atmosphericparameters of the sdb star, and find that nitrogen and iron have abundancesclose to solar values, while helium, carbon, oxygen and silicon areunderabundant relative to the solar mixture.  we use the full kepler q06--q17 lightcurve to extract 132 significantpulsation frequencies. period-spacing relations and multiplet splittings allowus to identify the modal degree l for the majority of the modes. using theg-mode multiplet splittings we constrain the internal rotation period at thebase of the envelope to 46-48d as a first seismic result for this star. the fewp-mode splittings may point at a slightly longer rotation period further out inthe envelope of the star.  from mode-visibility considerations we derive that the inclination of therotation axis of the sdb in kic7668647 must be around ~60 degrees.  furthermore, we find strong evidence for a few multiplets indicative ofdegree 3 &lt;= l &lt;= 8, which is another novelty in sdb-star observations madepossible by kepler.

1409.4357	two candidate brown dwarf companions around core helium-burning stars	hot subdwarf stars of spectral type b (sdbs) are evolved, core helium-burningobjects. the formation of those objects is puzzling, because the progenitorstar has to lose almost its entire hydrogen envelope in the red-giant phase.binary interactions have been invoked, but single sdbs exist as well. we reportthe discovery of two close hot subdwarf binaries with small radial velocityamplitudes. follow-up photometry revealed reflection effects originating fromcool irradiated companions, but no eclipses. the lower mass limits for thecompanions of cpd-64$^{\circ}$481 ($0.048\,m_{\rm \odot}$) and phl\,457($0.027\,m_{\rm \odot}$) are significantly below the stellar mass limit. hencethey could be brown dwarfs unless the inclination is unfavourable. two verysimilar systems have already been reported. the probability that none of themis a brown dwarf is very small, 0.02%. hence we provide further evidence thatsubstellar companions with masses that low are able to eject a common envelopeand form an sdb star. furthermore, we find that the properties of the observedsample of hot subdwarfs in reflection effect binaries is consistent with ascenario where single sdbs can still be formed via common envelope events, buttheir low-mass substellar companions do not survive.

0804.1282	binary sdb stars with massive compact companions	the masses of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars and blackholes are fundamental to astrophysics, but very difficult to measure. wepresent the results of an analysis of subluminous b (sdb) stars in close binarysystems with unseen compact companions to derive their masses and clarify theirnature. radial velocity curves were obtained from time resolved spectroscopy.the atmospheric parameters were determined in a quantitative spectral analysis.based on high resolution spectra we were able to measure the projectedrotational velocity of the stars with high accuracy. in the distribution ofprojected rotational velocities signs of tidal locking with the companions arevisible. by detecting ellipsoidal variations in the lightcurve of an sdb binarywe were able to show that subdwarf binaries with orbital periods up to 0.6 dare most likely synchronized. in this case, the inclination angles andcompanion masses of the binaries can be tightly constrained. five invisiblecompanions have masses that are compatible with that of normal white dwarfs orlate type main sequence stars. however, four sdbs have compact companionsmassive enough to be heavy white dwarfs (&gt;1 msun), neutron stars or even blackholes. such a high fraction of massive compact companions is not expected fromcurrent models of binary evolution.

0804.1287	metal abundances of subdwarf b stars from spy - a pattern emerges	the formation of sdbs is still puzzling, as is the chemical composition oftheir atmospheres. while helium and other light elements are depleted relativeto solar values, heavy elements are highly enriched. diffusion processes in thehot, radiative atmosphere of these stars are the most likely explanation.although several attempts were made, it was not yet possible to model all theobserved features of sdb atmospheres. a setback of most prior studies was thesmall sample size. we present a detailed abundance analysis of 68 sdbs. fromhigh resolution spectra obtained with the vlt/uves instrument in the course ofthe eso supernova progenitor survey (spy) we measured elemental abundances ofup to 24 different ions per star. a general trend of enrichment was found withincreasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. the lighter elementslike carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted irrespective of the temperature.although there is considerable scatter from one star to another, the generalabundance patterns in most sdbs are similar. an interplay between gravitationalsettling, radiative levitation and weak winds is most likely responsible. about6 % of the analysed stars show an enrichment in carbon and helium which cannotbe explained in the framework of diffusion alone. nuclear processed materialmust have been transported to the surface. the late hot-flasher scenario mayprovide a possible explanation for this effect.

1501.03692	hot subdwarf binaries from the muchfuss project - analysis of 12 new  systems and a study of the short-period binary population	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims at finding hot subdwarf stars with massive compactcompanions like massive white dwarfs (m&gt;1.0 m$_\odot$), neutron stars, orstellar-mass black holes. we present orbital and atmospheric parameters and putconstraints on the nature of the companions of 12 close hot subdwarf b star(sdb) binaries found in the course of the muchfuss project. the systems showperiods between 0.14 and 7.4 days. three systems most likely have white dwarfcompanions. sdss j083006.17+475150.3 is likely to be a rare example of alow-mass helium-core white dwarf. sdss j095101.28+034757.0 shows an excess inthe infrared that probably originates from a third companion in a wide orbit.sdss j113241.58-063652.8 is the first helium deficient sdo star with aconfirmed close companion. this study brings to 142 the number of sdb binarieswith orbital periods of less than 30 days and with measured mass functions. wepresent an analysis of the minimum companion mass distribution and show that itis bimodal. one peak around 0.1 m$_\odot$ corresponds to the low-mass mainsequence and substellar companions. the other peak around 0.4 m$_\odot$corresponds to the white dwarf companions. the derived masses for the whitedwarf companions are significantly lower than the average mass for singlecarbon-oxygen white dwarfs. in a t$_{\rm eff}$-log(g) diagram of sdb+dmcompanions, we find signs that the sdb components are more massive than therest of the sample. the full sample was compared to the known population ofextremely low-mass white dwarf binaries as well as short-period white dwarfswith main sequence companions. both samples show a significantly differentcompanion mass distribution. we calculate merger timescales and timescales whenthe companion will fill its roche lobe and the system evolves into acataclysmic variable.

1502.04086	the catalogue of radial velocity variable hot subluminous stars from the  muchfuss project	the project massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars fromsdss (muchfuss) aims to find sdbs with compact companions like massive whitedwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. here we provide classifications,atmospheric parameters and a complete radial velocity (rv) catalogue containing1914 single measurements for an sample of 177 hot subluminous stars discoveredbased on sdss dr7. 110 stars show significant rv variability, while 67 qualifyas candidates. we constrain the fraction of close massive compact companions{of hydrogen-rich hot subdwarfs} in our sample to be smaller than $\sim1.3\%$,which is already close to the theoretical predictions. however, the samplemight still contain such binaries with longer periods exceeding $\sim8\,{\rmd}$. we detect a mismatch between the $\delta rv_{\rm max}$-distribution of thesdb and the more evolved sdob and sdo stars, which challenges our understandingof their evolutionary connection. furthermore, irregular rv variations ofunknown origin with amplitudes of up to $\sim180\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ ontimescales of years, days and even hours have been detected in some he-sdostars. they might be connected to irregular photometric variations in somecases.

1502.05520	the enigmatic he-sdb pulsator ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116: new insights from  the vlt	the intermediate helium subdwarf b star ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116 is a uniqueobject showing extremely peculiar atmospheric abundances as well as long-periodpulsations that cannot be explained in terms of the usual opacity mechanism.one hypothesis invoked was that a strong magnetic field may be responsible. wediscredit this possibility on the basis of fors2 spectro-polarimetry, whichallows us to rule out a mean longitudinal magnetic field down to 300 g.  using the same data, we derive the atmospheric parameters for lsiv$-$14$^\circ$116 to be $t_{\rm eff}$ = 35,150$\pm$111 k, $\log{g}$ =5.88$\pm$0.02 and $\log{n(\rm he)/n(\rm h)}$ = $-$0.62$\pm$0.01. the highsurface gravity in particular is at odds with the theory that lsiv$-$14$^\circ$116 has not yet settled onto the helium main sequence, and thatthe pulsations are excited by an $\epsilon$ mechanism acting on thehelium-burning shells present after the main helium flash.  archival uves spectroscopy reveals ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116 to have a radialvelocity of 149.1$\pm$2.1 km/s. running a full kinematic analysis, we find thatit is on a retrograde orbit around the galactic centre, with a galactic radialvelocity component $u$=13.23$\pm$8.28 km/s and a galactic rotational velocitycomponent $v$=$-$55.56$\pm$22.13 km/s. this implies that ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116belongs to the halo population, an intriguing discovery.

1503.01625	hot subdwarfs - small stars marking important events in stellar  evolution	hot subdwarfs are considered to be the compact helium cores of red giants,which lost almost their entire hydrogen envelope. what causes this enormousmass loss is still unclear. binary interactions are invoked and a significantfraction of the hot subdwarf population is indeed found in close binaries. in alarge project we search for the close binary sdbs with the most and the leastmassive companions. significantly enhancing the known sample of close binarysdbs we performed the first comprehensive study of this population. triggeredby the discovery of two sdb binaries with close brown dwarf companions in thecourse of this project, we were able to show that the interaction of stars withsubstellar companions is an important channel to form sdb stars. finally, wediscovered a unique and very compact binary system consisting of an sdb and amassive white dwarf, which qualifies as progenitor candidate for a supernovatype ia. in addition to that, we could connect those explosions to the class ofhypervelocity hot subdwarf stars, which we consider as the surviving companionsof such events. being the stripped cores of red giants, hot subdwarfs turnedout to be important markers of peculiar events in stellar evolution ranging allthe way from star-planet interactions to the progenitors of stellar explosionsused to measure the expansion of our universe.

1503.04164	candidate hypervelocity stars of spectral type g and k revisited	hypervelocity stars (hvs) move so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy.when they were first discovered in 2005, dynamical ejection from thesupermassive black hole (smbh) in the galactic centre (gc) was suggested astheir origin. the two dozen hvss known today are young massive b stars, mostlyof 3-4 solar masses. recently, 20 hvs candidates of low mass were discovered inthe segue g and k dwarf sample, but none of them originates from the gc. weembarked on a kinematic analysis of the segue hvs candidate sample using thefull 6d phase space information based on new proper motion measurements. theirorbital properties can then be derived by tracing back their trajectories indifferent mass models of our galaxy. we present the results for 14 candidatehvss, for which proper motion measurements were possible. significantly lowerproper motions than found in the previous study were derived. considering threedifferent galactic mass models we find that all stars are bound to the galaxy.we confirm that the stars do not originate from the gc. the distribution oftheir proper motions and radial velocities is consistent with predictions forrunaway stars ejected from the galactic disk by the binary supernova mechanism.however, their kinematics are also consistent with old disk membership.moreover, most stars have rather low metallicities and strong $\alpha$-elementenrichment as typical for thick disk and halo stars, whereas the metallicity ofthe three most metal-rich stars could possibly indicate that they are runawaystars from the thin disk. one star shows halo kinematics.

1506.01861	optical spectroscopy of candidate alpha persei white dwarfs	as part of an investigation into the high mass end of the initial mass-finalmass relation we performed a search for new white dwarf members of the nearby(172.4 pc), young (80-90 myr) $\alpha$ persei open star cluster. thephotometric and astrometric search using the ukirt infrared deep sky survey andsupercosmos sky surveys discovered 14 new white dwarf candidates. we haveobtained medium resolution optical spectra of the brightest 11 candidates usingthe william herschel telescope and confirmed that while 7 are da white dwarfs,3 are db white dwarfs and one is an sdob star, only three have cooling ageswithin the cluster age, and from their position on the initial mass-final massrelation, it is likely none are cluster members. this result is disappointing,as recent work on the cluster mass function suggests that there should be atleast one white dwarf member, even at this young age. it may be that any whitedwarf members of $\alpha$ per are hidden within binary systems, as is the casein the hyades cluster, however the lack of high mass stars within the clusteralso makes this seem unlikely. one alternative is that a significant level ofdetection incompleteness in the legacy optical image survey data at thisgalactic latitude has caused some white dwarf members to be overlooked. if thisis the case, gaia will find them.
