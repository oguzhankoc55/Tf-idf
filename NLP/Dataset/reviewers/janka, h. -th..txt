0908.3474	three-dimensional simulations of mixing instabilities in supernova  explosions	we present the first three-dimensional (3d) simulations of the large-scalemixing that takes place in the shock-heated stellar layers ejected in theexplosion of a 15.5 solar-mass blue supergiant star. the outgoing supernovashock is followed from its launch by neutrino heating until it breaks out fromthe stellar surface more than two hours after the core collapse. violentconvective overturn in the post-shock layer causes the explosion to start withsignificant asphericity, which triggers the growth of rayleigh-taylor (rt)instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star. deep inwardmixing of hydrogen (h) is found as well as fast-moving, metal-rich clumpspenetrating with high velocities far into the h-envelope of the star asobserved, e.g., in the case of sn 1987a. also individual clumps containing asizeable fraction of the ejected iron-group elements (up to several 0.001 solarmasses) are obtained in some models. the metal core of the progenitor ispartially turned over with ni-dominated fingers overtaking oxygen-rich bulletsand both ni and o moving well ahead of the material from the carbon layer.comparing with corresponding 2d (axially symmetric) calculations, we determinethe growth of the rt fingers to be faster, the deceleration of the densemetal-carrying clumps in the he and h layers to be reduced, the asymptoticclump velocities in the h-shell to be higher (up to ~4500 km/s for theconsidered progenitor and an explosion energy of 10^{51} ergs, instead of &lt;2000km/s in 2d), and the outward radial mixing of heavy elements and inward mixingof hydrogen to be more efficient in 3d than in 2d. we present a simple argumentthat explains these results as a consequence of the different action of dragforces on moving objects in the two geometries.

0910.5169	discriminating strange star mergers from neutron star mergers by  gravitational-wave measurements	we perform three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of thecoalescence of strange stars (sss) and explore the possibility to decide on thestrange matter hypothesis by means of gravitational-wave (gw) measurements.selfbinding of strange quark matter (sqm) and the generally more compact starsyield features that clearly distinguish ss from neutron star (ns) mergers, e.g.hampering tidal disruption during the plunge of quark stars. furthermore,instead of forming dilute halos around the remnant as in the case of nsmergers, the coalescence of sss results in a differentially rotatinghypermassive object with a sharp surface layer surrounded by a geometricallythin, clumpy high-density sqm disk. we also investigate the importance ofincluding non-zero temperature equations of state (eoss) in ns and ss mergersimulations. in both cases we find a crucial sensitivity of the dynamics andoutcome of the coalescence to thermal effects, which, e.g., determine the outerremnant structure and the delay time of the dense remnant core to black holecollapse. for comparing and classifying the gw signals, we use a number ofcharacteristic quantities like the maximum frequency during inspiral or thedominant frequency of oscillations of the postmerger remnant. in general, thesefrequencies are higher for ss mergers. if not, additional features of the gwluminosity spectrum may help to discriminate coalescence events of thedifferent types. future gw measurements may thus help to decide on theexistence of sqm stars.

1001.4841	a new multi-dimensional general relativistic neutrino hydrodynamics code  for core-collapse supernovae. i. method and code tests in spherical symmetry	we present a new general relativistic (gr) code for hydrodynamic supernovasimulations with neutrino transport in spherical and azimuthal symmetry(1d/2d). the code is a combination of the coconut hydro module, which is ariemann-solver based, high-resolution shock-capturing method, and thethree-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport scheme vertex. vertexintegrates the neutrino moment equations with a variable eddington factorclosure computed from a model boltzmann equation and uses the ray-by-ray plusapproximation in 2d, assuming the neutrino distribution to be axially symmetricaround the radial direction, and thus the neutrino flux to be radial. ourspacetime treatment employs the adm 3+1 formalism with the conformal flatnesscondition for the spatial three-metric. this approach is exact in 1d and hasbeen shown to yield very accurate results also for rotational stellar collapse.we introduce new formulations of the energy equation to improve total energyconservation in relativistic and newtonian hydro simulations with eulerianfinite-volume codes. moreover, a modified version of the vertex scheme isdeveloped that simultaneously conserves energy and lepton number with betteraccuracy and higher numerical stability. to verify our code, we conduct aseries of tests, including a detailed comparison with published 1d results forstellar core collapse. long-time simulations of proto-neutron star cooling overseveral seconds both demonstrate the robustness of the new coconut-vertex codeand show the approximate treatment of gr effects by means of an effectivegravitational potential as in prometheus-vertex to be remarkably accurate in1d.

1006.3315	testing approximations of thermal effects in neutron star merger  simulations	we perform three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical calculations ofneutron star mergers to assess the reliability of an approximate treatment ofthermal effects in such simulations by combining an ideal-gas component withzero-temperature, micro-physical equations of state. to this end we compare theresults of simulations that make this approximation to the outcome of modelswith a consistent treatment of thermal effects in the equation of state. inparticular we focus on the implications for observable consequences of mergerevents like the gravitational-wave signal. it is found that the characteristicgravitational-wave oscillation frequencies of the post-merger remnant differ byabout 50 to 250 hz (corresponding to frequency shifts of 2 to 8 per cent)depending on the equation of state and the choice of the characteristic indexof the ideal-gas component. in addition, the delay time to black hole collapseof the merger remnant as well as the amount of matter remaining outside theblack hole after its formation are sensitive to the description of thermaleffects.

1010.0167	hydrodynamical neutron star kicks in three dimensions	using three-dimensional (3d) simulations of neutrino-powered supernovaexplosions we show that the hydrodynamical kick scenario proposed by scheck etal. on the basis of two-dimensional (2d) models can yield large neutron star(ns) recoil velocities also in 3d. although the shock stays relativelyspherical, standing accretion-shock and convective instabilities lead to aglobally asymmetric mass and energy distribution in the postshock layer. ananisotropic momentum distribution of the ejecta is built up only after theexplosion sets in. total momentum conservation implies the acceleration of thens on a timescale of 1-3 seconds, mediated mainly by long-lasting, asymmetricaccretion downdrafts and the anisotropic gravitational pull of largeinhomogeneities in the ejecta. in a limited set of 15 solar-mass models with anexplosion energy of about 10^51 erg this stochastic mechanism is found toproduce kicks from &lt;100 km/s to &gt;500 km/s, and &gt;1000 km/s seem possible. strongrotational flows around the accreting ns do not develop in our collapsing,non-rotating progenitors. the ns spins therefore remain low with estimatedperiods of about 500-1000 ms and no alignment with the kicks.

1106.6301	parametrized 3d models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions: neutrino  emission asymmetries and gravitational-wave signals	time-dependent and direction-dependent neutrino and gravitational-wave (gw)signatures are presented for a set of 3d hydrodynamic models of parametrized,neutrino-driven supernova explosions of non-rotating 15 and 20 solar massstars. we employ an approximate treatment of neutrino transport. due to theexcision of the high-density core of the proto-neutron star and the use of anaxis-free overset grid, the models can be followed from the post-bounceaccretion phase for more than one second without imposing any symmetryrestrictions. gw and neutrino emission exhibit the generic time-dependentfeatures known from 2d models. non-radial hydrodynamic mass motions in theaccretion layer and their interaction with the outer layers of theproto-neutron star together with anisotropic neutrino emission give rise to agw signal with an amplitude of ~5-20 cm and frequencies 100--500 hz. the gwemission from mass motions reaches a maximum before the explosion sets in.afterwards the gw signal exhibits a low-frequency modulation, in some casesdescribing a quasi-monotonic growth, associated with the non-sphericalexpansion of the explosion shock wave and the large-scale anisotropy of theescaping neutrino flow. variations of the mass-quadrupole moment due toconvective activity inside the nascent neutron star contribute a high-frequencycomponent to the gw signal during the post-explosion phase. the gw signalsexhibit strong variability between the two polarizations, different explosionsimulations and different observer directions, and does not possess anytemplate character. the neutrino emission properties show fluctuations over theneutron star surface on spatial and temporal scales that reflect the differenttypes of non-spherical mass motions. the modulation amplitudes of themeasurable neutrino luminosities and mean energies are significantly smallerthan predicted by 2d simulations.

0704.3001	multidimensional supernova simulations with approximative neutrino  transport. ii. convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova  core	by 2d hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state andneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radialhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretionphase of collapsing stellar cores. the convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical rayleigh-taylor mushrooms. however, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. in such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. this phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (sasi). it is shown here that the sasi oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. a rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent ns turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of thesasi is higher. moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the sasi and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (aac), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

1202.0815	a new multi-dimensional general relativistic neutrino hydrodynamics code  for core-collapse supernovae ii. relativistic explosion models of  core-collapse supernovae	we present the first two-dimensional general relativistic (gr) simulations ofstellar core collapse and explosion with the coconut hydrodynamics code incombination with the vertex solver for energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrinotransport, using the extended conformal flatness condition for approximatingthe spacetime metric and a ray-by-ray-plus ansatz to tackle themulti-dimensionality of the transport. for both of the investigated 11.2 and 15solar mass progenitors we obtain successful, though seemingly marginal,neutrino-driven supernova explosions. this outcome and the time evolution ofthe models basically agree with results previously obtained with the prometheushydro solver including an approximative treatment of relativistic effects by amodified newtonian potential. however, gr models exhibit subtle differences inthe neutrinospheric conditions compared to newtonian and pseudo-newtoniansimulations. these differences lead to significantly higher luminosities andmean energies of the radiated electron neutrinos and antineutrinos andtherefore to larger energy-deposition rates and heating efficiencies in thegain layer with favorable consequences for strong non-radial mass motions andultimately for an explosion. moreover, energy transfer to the stellar mediumaround the neutrinospheres through nucleon recoil in scattering reactions ofheavy-lepton neutrinos also enhances the mentioned effects. together withprevious pseudo-newtonian models the presented relativistic calculationssuggest that the treatment of gravity and energy-exchanging neutrinointeractions can make differences of even 50-100% in some quantities and islikely to contribute to a finally successful explosion mechanism on no minorlevel than hydrodynamical differences between different dimensions.

1205.7078	new two-dimensional models of supernova explosions by the  neutrino-heating mechanism: evidence for different instability regimes in  collapsing stellar cores	the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism for core-collapse supernovae in itsmodern flavor relies on the additional support of hydrodynamical instabilitiesin achieving shock revival. two possible candidates, convection and theso-called standing accretion shock instability (sasi), have been proposed forthis role. in this paper, we discuss new successful simulations of supernovaexplosions that shed light on the relative importance of these twoinstabilities. while convection has so far been observed to grow first inself-consistent hydrodynamical models with multi-group neutrino transport, wehere present the first such simulation in which the sasi grows faster while thedevelopment of convection is initially inhibited. we illustrate the features ofthis sasi-dominated regime using an explosion model of a 27 solar massprogenitor, which is contrasted with a convectively-dominated model of an 8.1solar mass progenitor with subsolar metallicity, whose early post-bouncebehavior is more in line with previous 11.2 and 15 solar mass explosion models.we analyze the conditions discriminating between the two different regimes,showing that a high mass-accretion rate and a short advection time-scale areconducive for strong sasi activity. we also briefly discuss some importantfactors for capturing the sasi-driven regime, such as general relativity, theprogenitor structure, a nuclear equation of state leading to a compactproto-neutron star, and the neutrino treatment. finally, we evaluate possibleimplications of our findings for 2d and 3d supernova simulations. our resultsshow that a better understanding of the sasi and convection in the non-linearregime is required.

1210.8148	three-dimensional neutrino-driven supernovae: neutron star kicks, spins,  and asymmetric ejection of nucleosynthesis products	we present 3d simulations of supernova (sn) explosions of nonrotating stars,triggered by the neutrino-heating mechanism with a suitable choice of thecore-neutrino luminosity. our results show that asymmetric mass ejection causedby hydrodynamic instabilities can accelerate the neutron star (ns) up to recoilvelocities of more than 700 km/s by the "gravitational tug-boat mechanism",which is enough to explain most observed pulsar velocities. the associated nsspin periods are about 100 ms to 8 s without any correlation between spin andkick magnitudes or directions. this suggests that faster spins and a possiblespin-kick alignment might require angular momentum in the progenitor core priorto collapse. our simulations for the first time demonstrate a clear correlationbetween the size of the ns kick and anisotropic ejection of heavy elementscreated by explosive burning behind the shock. in the case of large ns kicksthe explosion is significantly stronger opposite to the kick vector. thereforethe bulk of the fe-group elements, in particular nickel, is ejected mostly inlarge clumps against the kick direction. this contrasts with the case of lowrecoil velocity, where the ni-rich lumps are more isotropically distributed.intermediate-mass nuclei heavier than si (like ca and ti) also exhibit asignificant enhancement in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of fast nsmotion, while the distribution of c, o, and ne is not affected, and that of mgonly marginally. mapping the spatial distribution of the heavy elements in snremnants with identified pulsar motion may offer an important diagnostic testof the kick mechanism. different from kick scenarios based on anisotropicneutrino emission, our hydrodynamical acceleration model predicts enhancedejection of fe-group elements and of their nuclear precursors in the directionopposite to the ns recoil.

0712.3000	neutrino oscillation signatures of oxygen-neon-magnesium supernovae	we discuss the flavor conversion of neutrinos from core collapse supernovaethat have oxygen-neon-magnesium (onemg) cores. using the numerically calculatedevolution of the star up to 650 ms post bounce, we find that, for the normalmass hierarchy, the electron neutrino flux in a detector shows signatures oftwo typical features of an onemg-core supernova: a sharp step in the densityprofile at the base of the he shell and a faster shock wave propagationcompared to iron core supernovae. before the shock hits the density step (t ~150 ms), the survival probability of electron neutrinos is about 0.68, incontrast to values of 0.32 or less for an iron core supernova. the passage ofthe shock through the step and its subsequent propagation cause a decrease ofthe survival probability and a decrease of the amplitude of oscillations in theearth, reflecting the transition to a more adiabatic propagation inside thestar. these changes affect the lower energy neutrinos first; they are fasterand more sizable for larger theta_13. they are unique of onemg-core supernovae,and give the possibility to test the speed of the shock wave. the timemodulation of the earth effect and its negative sign at the neutronization peakare the most robust signatures in a detector.

1303.6269	sasi activity in three-dimensional neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of  supernova cores	the relevance of the standing accretion shock instability (sasi) compared toneutrino-driven convection in three-dimensional (3d) supernova-coreenvironments is still highly controversial. studying a 27 msun progenitor, wedemonstrate, for the first time, that violent sasi activity can develop in 3dsimulations with detailed neutrino transport despite the presence ofconvection. this result was obtained with the prometheus-vertex code with thesame sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in 1d and 2d models.while buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass motions in thepostshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with growing amplitude sets in during aphase of shock retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose growth isonly quenched when the infall of the si/sio interface leads to strong shockexpansion in response to a dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. in thephase of large-amplitude sasi sloshing and spiral motions, the postshock layerexhibits nonradial deformation dominated by the lowest-order sphericalharmonics (l=1, m=0,-1,+1) in distinct contrast to the higher multipolestructures associated with neutrino-driven convection. we find that the sasiamplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic energy in 3d can exceedthose of the corresponding 2d case during extended periods of the evolution. wealso perform parametrized 3d simulations of a 25 msun progenitor, using asimplified, gray neutrino transport scheme, an axis-free yin-yang grid, anddifferent amplitudes of random seed perturbations. they confirm the importanceof the sasi for another progenitor, its independence of the choice of sphericalgrid, and its preferred growth for fast accretion flows connected to smallshock radii and compact proto-neutron stars as previously found in 2d setups.

1409.4783	non-radial instabilities and progenitor asphericities in core-collapse  supernovae	since core-collapse supernova simulations still struggle to produce robustneutrino-driven explosions in 3d, it has been proposed that asphericitiescaused by convection in the progenitor might facilitate shock revival byboosting the activity of non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities in thepost-shock region. we investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic2d simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects ofvelocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbationgeometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelasticcondition). as a framework for analysing our results, we introducesemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulentvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturationlimit of non-radial instabilities. the squared turbulent mach number, &lt;ma^2&gt;,reflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosiverunaway occurs for &lt;ma^2&gt;~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the criticalneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1d. in the light of this theory,progenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic massflux onto the shock: differential infall efficiently converts velocityperturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations (delta rho/rho) atthe shock of the order of the initial convective mach number ma. theanisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplifypost-shock turbulence. large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive toshock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically highconvective mach numbers. initial density perturbations in the progenitor areonly of order ma^2 and therefore play a subdominant role.

0805.1848	on the dynamics of proto-neutron star winds and r-process  nucleosynthesis	we study here the formation of heavy r-process nuclei in the high-entropyenvironment of rapidly expanding neutrino-driven winds from compact objects. inparticular, we explore the sensitivity of the element creation in the a&gt;130region to the low-temperature behavior of the outflows. for this purpose weemploy a simplified model of the dynamics and thermodynamical evolution forradiation dominated, adiabatic outflows. it consists of a first stage of fast,exponential cooling, followed by a second phase of slower evolution, eitherassuming constant density and temperature or a power-law decay of thesequantities. these cases are supposed to capture the most relevant effects of astrong deceleration or decreasing acceleration of the transsonic outflows,respectively, e.g. in a wind termination shock caused by the collision with theslower, preceding supernova ejecta. we find that not only the transitiontemperature between the two expansion phases can make a big difference in theformation of the platinum peak, but also the detailed cooling law during thelater phase. unless the transition temperature and corresponding (free neutron)density become too small (t &lt; 2*10^8 k), a lower temperature or fastertemperature decline during this phase allow for a stronger appearance of thethird abundance peak. since the nuclear photodisintegration rates between~2*10^8 k and ~10^9 k are more sensitive to the temperature than the n-capturerates are to the free neutron density, a faster cooling in this temperatureregime shifts the r-process path closer to the n-drip line. with low (gamma,n)-but high beta-decay rates, the r-processing then does not proceed through a(gamma,n)-(n,gamma) equilibrium but through a quasi-equilibrium of(n,gamma)-reactions and beta-decays, as recently also pointed out by wanajo.

astro-ph;0005438	spherically symmetric simulation with boltzmann neutrino transport of  core collapse and post-bounce evolution of a 15 solar mass star	we present a spherically symmetric, newtonian core-collapse simulation of a15 solar mass star with a 1.28 solar mass iron core. the time-, energy-, andangle-dependent transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos was treatedwith a new code which iteratively solves the boltzmann equation and theequations for neutrino number, energy and momentum to order o(v/c) in thevelocity v of the stellar medium. the supernova shock expands to a maximumradius of 350 km instead of only about 240 km as in a comparable calculationwith multi-group flux-limited diffusion (mgfld) by bruenn, mezzacappa, &amp; dineva(1995). this may be explained by stronger neutrino heating due to the moreaccurate transport in our model. nevertheless, after 180 ms of expansion theshock finally recedes to a radius around 250 km (compared to about 170 km inthe mgfld run). the effect of an accurate neutrino transport is helpful, butnot large enough to cause an explosion of the considered 15 solar mass star.therefore postshock convection and/or an enhancement of the core neutrinoluminosity by convection or reduced neutrino opacities in the neutron star seemnecessary for neutrino-driven explosions of such stars. we find an electronfraction y_e &gt; 0.5 in the neutrino-heated matter, which suggests that theoverproduction problem of neutron-rich nuclei with mass numbers around a = 90in exploding models may be absent when a boltzmann solver is used for theelectron neutrino and antineutrino transport.

astro-ph;0008432	conditions for shock revival by neutrino heating in core-collapse  supernovae	energy deposition by neutrinos can rejuvenate the stalled bounce shock andcan provide the energy for the supernova explosion of a massive star. thisneutrino-heating mechanism, however, is not finally accepted or proven as thetrigger of the explosion. part of the problem is that the complexity of thehydrodynamic models often hampers a clear and simple interpretation of theresults. this demands a deeper theoretical understanding of the requirements ofa successful shock revival. a toy model is presented here for discussing theneutrino heating phase analytically by a time-dependent treatment, which allowsone to calculate the radius and velocity of the supernova shock from globalproperties of the gain layer as solutions of an initial value problem. acriterion is derived for the requirements of shock revival. it confirms theexistence of a minimum neutrino luminosity needed for shock expansion, but alsodemonstrates the importance of a sufficiently large mass infall rate to theshock. the possibility of very energetic neutrino-driven explosions seemsexcluded because the total specific energy transferred to nucleons is limitedby about 1e52 ergs per solar mass (about 5 mev per nucleon) and the total massin the gain layer is typically only around 0.1 solar masses. energy transportby convection from the region of maximum heating to radii closer behind theshock is found to support the explosion by reducing the energy loss associatedwith the inward advection of neutrino-heated matter through the gain radius.(abridged)

astro-ph;0202028	supermassive stars: fact or fiction?	supermassive black holes are now realized to exist in the centers of mostgalaxies. the recent discoveries of luminous quasars at redshifts higher than 6require that these black holes were assembled already when the universe wasless than a billion years old. they might originate from the collapse ofsupermassive stars, a scenario which could ensure a sufficiently rapidformation. supermassive stars are dominated by photon pressure and radiate attheir eddington limit, which drives their quasi-static evolution to a finalrelativistic instability. above some critical value of the metallicity, theircollapse can lead to a gigantic explosion, powered by the energy release due tohydrogen burning, but below this critical metallicity their collapse inevitablyends in the formation of a black hole, accompanied by the emission of hugeamounts of energy in the form of neutrinos. although collapsing supermassivestars are the most powerful known burst sources of neutrinos, the associatedconditions do not appear favorable for producing highly relativistic outflowsthat can explain cosmic gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;0212314	explosion mechanisms of massive stars	one of the central problems in supernova theory is the question how massivestars explode. understanding the physical processes that drive the explosion iscrucial for linking the stellar progenitors to the final remnants and forpredicting observable properties like explosion energies, neutron star andblack hole masses, nucleosynthetic yields, explosion anisotropies, and pulsarkicks. here we review different suggestions for the explosion mechanism anddiscuss the constraints that can or cannot be deduced from observations. themost refined and detailed hydrodynamical models are available forneutrino-driven supernova explosions, although the viability of this mechanismhas yet to be demonstrated convincingly. since spherical models do not explode,the hope rests on the helpful effects of convection inside the nascent neutronstar and in the neutrino-heated region behind the stalled shock. we present thefirst two-dimensional simulations of these processes which have been performedwith a boltzmann solver for the neutrino transport and a state-of-the-artdescription of neutrino-matter interactions. our most complete models fail, butconvection brings them encouragingly close to a success. an explosion could beobtained by just a minor modification of the neutrino transport, in which casethe exploding model fulfills important requirements from observations(abridged).

astro-ph;0212316	core collapse and then? the route to massive star explosions	the rapidly growing base of observational data for supernova explosions ofmassive stars demands theoretical explanations. central of these is aself-consistent model for the physical mechanism that provides the energy tostart and drive the disruption of the star. we give arguments why the delayedneutrino-heating mechanism should still be regarded as the standard paradigm toexplain most explosions of massive stars and show how large-scale and evenglobal asymmetries can result as a natural consequence of convective overturnin the neutrino-heating region behind the supernova shock. since the explosionis a threshold phenomenon and depends sensitively on the efficiency of theenergy transfer by neutrinos, even relatively minor differences in numericalsimulations can matter on the secular timescale of the delayed mechanism. toenhance this point, we present some results of recent one- and two-dimensionalcomputations, which we have performed with a boltzmann solver for the neutrinotransport and a state-of-the-art description of neutrino-matter interactions.although our most complete models fail to explode, the simulations demonstratethat one is encouragingly close to the critical threshold because a modestvariation of the neutrino transport in combination with postshock convectionleads to a weak neutrino-driven explosion with properties that fulfillimportant requirements from observations.

astro-ph;0302239	non-spherical core collapse supernovae i. neutrino-driven convection,  rayleigh-taylor instabilities, and the formation and propagation of metal  clumps	two-dimensional simulations of a type ii and a type ib-like supernovaexplosion are presented that encompass shock revival by neutrino heating,neutrino-driven convection, explosive nucleosynthesis, the growth ofrayleigh-taylor instabilities, and the propagation of newly formed metal clumpsthrough the exploding star. in both cases we find very high ni56 velocities of17000 km/s shortly after shock-revival, and a complete fragmentation of theprogenitor's metal core within the first few minutes after core bounce, due tothe growth of rayleigh-taylor instabilities at the si/o and (c+o)/hecomposition interfaces. this leads to the formation of high-velocity,metal-rich clumps which eventually decouple from the flow and moveballistically through the ejecta. maximum final metal velocities of 3500-5500km/s and 1200 km/s are obtained for the type ib model and the type ii model,respectively. the low maximum metal velocities in the type ii model, which aresignificantly smaller than those observed in sn 1987a, are due to the massivehydrogen envelope of the progenitor. the envelope forces the supernova shock todecelerate strongly, leaving behind a reverse shock below the he/h interface,which interacts with the clumps and slows them down significantly. this reverseshock is absent in the type ib-like model. the latter is in fairly goodagreement with observations of type ib supernovae. in addition, in this casethe pattern of clump formation in the ejecta is correlated with the convectivepattern prevailing during the shock-revival phase. this might be used to deduceobservational constraints for the dynamics during this early phase of theevolution, and the role of neutrino heating in initiating the explosion.

astro-ph;0310662	supernova simulations with boltzmann neutrino transport: a comparison of  methods	accurate neutrino transport has been built into spherically symmetricsimulations of stellar core collapse and postbounce evolution. the results ofsuch simulations agree that spherically symmetric models with standardmicrophysical input fail to explode by the delayed, neutrino-driven mechanism.independent groups implemented fundamentally different numerical methods totackle the boltzmann neutrino transport equation. here we present a direct anddetailed comparison of such neutrino radiation-hydrodynamical simulations fortwo codes, agile-boltztran of the oak ridge-basel group and vertex of thegarching group. the former solves the boltzmann equation directly by animplicit, general relativistic discrete angle method on the adaptive grid of aconservative implicit hydrodynamics code with second-order tvd advection. incontrast, the latter couples a variable eddington factor technique with anexplicit, moving-grid, conservative high-order riemann solver with importantrelativistic effects treated by an effective gravitational potential. thepresented study is meant to test both neutrino radiation-hydrodynamicsimplementations and to provide a data basis for comparisons and verificationsof supernova codes to be developed in the future. results are discussed forsimulations of the core collapse and post-bounce evolution of a 13 solar massstar with newtonian gravity and a 15 solar mass star with relativistic gravity.

astro-ph;0402481	non-stationary hyperaccretion of stellar-mass black holes in three  dimensions: torus evolution and neutrino emission	we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution ofselfgravitating, thick accretion discs around hyperaccreting stellar-mass blackholes. the black hole-torus systems are considered to be remnants of compactobject mergers, in which case the disc is not fed by an external mass reservoirand the accretion is non-stationary. our models take into account viscousdissipation, described by an alpha-law, a detailed equation of state for thedisc gas, and an approximate treatment of general relativistic effects on thedisc structure by using a pseudo-newtonian potential for the black holeincluding its possible rotation and spin-up during accretion. magnetic fieldsare ignored. the neutrino emission of the hot disc is treated by aneutrino-trapping scheme, and the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation near thedisc is evaluated in a post-processing step. our simulations show that theneutrino emission and energy deposition by neutrino-antineutrino annihilationincrease sensitively with the disc mass, with the black hole spin in case of adisc in corotation, and in particular with the alpha-viscosity. we find thatfor sufficiently large alpha-viscosity neutrino-antineutrino annihilation canbe a viable energy source for gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;0408439	supernova asymmetries and pulsar kicks -- views on controversial issues	two- and three-dimensional simulations demonstrate that hydrodynamicinstabilities can lead to low-mode (l=1,2) asymmetries of the fluid flow in theneutrino-heated layer behind the supernova shock. this provides a naturalexplanation for aspherical mass ejection and for pulsar recoil velocities evenin excess of 1000 km/s. we propose that the bimodality of the pulsar velocitydistribution might be a consequence of a dominant l=1 mode in case of the fastcomponent, while higher-mode anisotropy characterizes the postshock flow and snejecta during the birth of the slow neutron stars. we argue that the observedlarge asymmetries of supernovae and the measured high velocities of youngpulsars therefore do not imply rapid rotation of the iron core of theprogenitor star, nor do they require strong magnetic fields to play a crucialrole in the explosion. anisotropic neutrino emission from accretion contributesto the neutron star acceleration on a minor level, and pulsar kicks do not makea good case for non-standard neutrino physics in the nascent neutron star.

astro-ph;0412082	exploiting the neutronization burst of a galactic supernova	one of the robust features found in simulations of core-collapse supernovae(sne) is the prompt neutronization burst, i.e. the first $\sim 25$ millisecondsafter bounce when the sn emits with very high luminosity mainly $\nu_e$neutrinos. we examine the dependence of this burst on variations in the inputof current sn models and find that recent improvements of the electron capturerates as well as uncertainties in the nuclear equation of state or a variationof the progenitor mass have only little effect on the signature of theneutronization peak in a megaton water cherenkov detector for differentneutrino mixing schemes. we show that exploiting the time-structure of theneutronization peak allows one to identify the case of a normal mass hierarchyand large 13-mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, where the peak is absent. therobustness of the predicted total event number in the neutronization burstmakes a measurement of the distance to the sn feasible with a precision ofabout 5%, even in the likely case that the sn is optically obscured.

astro-ph;0502161	exploring the relativistic regime with newtonian hydrodynamics: an  improved effective gravitational potential for supernova simulations	we investigate the possibility to approximate relativistic effects inhydrodynamical simulations of stellar core collapse and post-bounce evolutionby using a modified gravitational potential in an otherwise standard newtonianhydrodynamic code. different modifications of the effective relativisticpotential introduced by rampp &amp; janka (2002) are discussed. correspondinghydrostatic solutions are compared with solutions of the tov equations, andhydrodynamic simulations with two different codes are compared with fullyrelativistic results. one code is applied for one- and two-dimensionalcalculations with a simple equation of state, and employs either the modifiedeffective relativistic potential in a newtonian framework or solves the generalrelativistic field equations under the assumption of the conformal flatnesscondition (cfc) for the three-metric. the second code allows for full-scalesupernova runs including a microphysical equation of state and neutrinotransport based on the solution of the boltzmann equation and its momentsequations. we present prescriptions for the effective relativistic potentialfor self-gravitating fluids to be used in newtonian codes, which produceexcellent agreement with fully relativistic solutions in spherical symmetry,leading to significant improvements compared to previously publishedapproximations. moreover, they also approximate qualitatively well relativisticsolutions for models with rotation.

astro-ph;0507099	torus formation in neutron star mergers and well-localized short  gamma-ray bursts	merging neutron stars (nss) are hot candidates for the still enigmaticsources of short gamma-ray bursts (grbs). if the central engines of the hugeenergy release are accreting relic black holes (bhs) of such mergers, it isimportant to understand how the properties of the bh-torus systems, inparticular disc masses and mass and rotation rate of the compact remnant, arelinked to the characterizing parameters of the ns binaries. for this purpose wepresent relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations withconformally flat approximation of the einstein field equations and a physical,non-zero temperature equation of state. thick disc formation is highlighted asa dynamical process caused by angular momentum transfer through tidal torquesduring the merging process of asymmetric systems or in the rapidly spinningtriaxial post-merger object. our simulations support the possibility that thefirst well-localized short and hard grbs 050509b, 050709, 050724, 050813 haveoriginated from ns merger events and are powered by neutrino-antineutrinoannihilation around a relic bh-torus system. using model parameters based onthis assumption, we show that the measured grb energies and durations lead toestimates for the accreted masses and bh mass accretion rates which arecompatible with theoretical expectations. in particular, the low energy outputand short duration of grb 050509b set a very strict upper limit of less than100 ms for the time interval after the merging until the merger remnant hascollapsed to a bh, leaving an accretion torus with a small mass of only about0.01 solar masses. this favors a (nearly) symmetric ns+ns binary with a typicalmass as progenitor system.

astro-ph;0509300	three-dimensional simulations of non-stationary accretion by remnant  black holes of compact object mergers	(abridged) three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with an eulerian ppmcode are presented for the time-dependent evolution of accretion tori aroundnonrotating and rotating stellar-mass black holes (bhs), using apseudo-newtonian gravitational potential to approximate the effects of generalrelativity. the initial configurations are assumed to be remnants of binaryneutron star (ns) or ns+bh mergers and consist of a 4 solar mass bh with variedspin, girded by a torus with a mass between 0.01 and 0.2 solar masses. theevolution of tori without and with physical shear viscosity is simulated, usinga realistic equation of state and following the energy loss and lepton numberchange due to neutrino emission by a neutrino-trapping scheme. thetime-dependent efficiency of converting rest-mass energy to neutrinos is foundto reach 10 percent, the efficiency of converting neutrino energy into apair-photon fireball by neutrino annihilation can reach several percent. therate of the latter process declines with time much less steeply than the totalneutrino luminosity, because the ongoing protonization of the torus ensures arather stable product of neutrino and antineutrino luminosities. the neutrinoemission increases steeply with higher viscosity, larger torus mass, and largerbh spin in corotation with the torus. for rotation rates as expected forpost-merger bhs (a &gt; 0.5) and reasonable values of the alpha viscosity (alpha ~0.1), the considered tori release sufficient energy in neutrinos to account forthe energetics of the well-localized short gamma-ray bursts recently detectedby hete and swift, if collimation is invoked as predicted by hydrodynamic jetsimulations.

astro-ph;0509722	off-axis properties of short gamma-ray bursts	based on recent models of relativistic jet formation by thermal energydeposition around black hole-torus systems, the relation between the on- andoff-axis appearance of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is discussed interms of energetics, duration, average lorentz factor, and probability ofobservation, assuming that the central engines are remnants of binary neutronstar or neutron star-black hole mergers. as a consequence of the interactionwith the torus matter at the jet basis and the subsequent expansion of the jetsinto an extremely low-density environment, the collimated ultrarelativisticoutflows possess flat core profiles with only little variation ofradially-averaged properties, and are bounded by very steep lateral edges.owing to the rapid decrease of the isotropic-equivalent energy near the jetedges, the probability of observing the lateral, lower lorentz factor wings issignificantly reduced and most short grbs should be seen with on-axis-likeproperties. taking into account cosmological and viewing angle effects,theoretical predictions are made for the short-grb distributions with redshiftz, fluence, and isotropic-equivalent energy. the observational data for shortbursts with determined redshifts are found to be compatible with thepredictions only if either the intrinsic grb rate density drops rapidly at z&gt;1,or a large number of events at z&gt;1 are missed, implying that the subenergeticgrb 050509b was an extremely rare low-fluence event with detectable photon fluxonly because of its proximity and shortness. it appears unlikely that grb050509b can be explained as an off-axis event. the detection of short grbs withsmall lorentz factors is statistically disfavored, suggesting a possible reasonfor the absence of soft short bursts in the duration-hardness diagram.

astro-ph;9606181	coalescing neutron stars -- a step towards physical models. ii. neutrino  emission, neutron tori, and gamma-ray bursts	three-dimensional hydrodynamical, newtonian calculations of the coalescenceof equal-mass binary neutron stars are performed, including a physicalhigh-density equation of state and a treatment of the neutrino emission of theheated matter. the total neutrino luminosity climbs to a maximum value of1--$1.5\cdot 10^{53}$~erg/s of which 90--95\% originate from the toroidal gascloud surrounding the very dense core formed after the merging. when theneutrino luminosities are highest, $\nu\bar\nu$-annihilation deposits about0.2--0.3\% of the emitted neutrino energy in the immediate neighborhood of themerger, and the maximum integral energy deposition rate is 3--$4\cdot10^{50}$~erg/s. since the $3\,m_{\odot}$ core of the merged object will mostlikely collapse into a black hole within milliseconds, the energy that can bepumped into a pair-photon fireball is insufficient by a factor of about 1000 toexplain $\gamma$-ray bursts at cosmological distances with an energy of theorder of $10^{51}/(4\pi)$~erg/steradian. analytical estimates show that theadditional energy provided by the annihilation of $\nu\bar\nu$ pairs emittedfrom a possible accretion torus of $\sim 0.1\,m_{\odot}$ around the centralblack hole is still more than a factor of 10 too small, unless focussing of thefireball into a jet-like expansion plays an important role. about$10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$~$m_\odot$ of material lost during the neutron star mergingand swept out from the system in a neutrino-driven wind might be a site fornucleosythesis. aspects of a possible r-processing in these ejecta arediscussed.

astro-ph;9611056	coalescing neutron stars -- gravitational waves from polytropic models	the dynamics, time evolution of the mass distribution, and gravitational wavesignature of coalescing neutron stars described by polytropes are compared withthree simulations published previously: (a) ``run 2'' of zhuge et al. (1994),(b) ``model iii'' of shibata et al. (1992), and (c) ``model a64'' of ruffert etal. (1996). we aim at studying the differences due to the use of differentnumerical methods, different implementations of the gravitational wavebackreaction, and different equations of state. comparison (a) confronts theresults of our grid-based ppm scheme with those from an sph code. we found thatdue to the lower numerical viscosity of the ppm code, the post-mergingoscillations and pulsations could be followed for a longer time and lead tolarger secondary and tertiary maxima of the gravitational wave luminosity. incase (b) two grid based codes with the same backreaction formalism butdiffering hydrodynamic integrators and different numerical resolution arecompared. satisfactory agreement of the amplitude of the gravitational waveluminosity is established, although due to the different initial conditions asmall time delay develops in the onset of the dynamical instability. in (c) wefind that using a polytropic equation of state instead of the high-densityequation of state of lattimer &amp; swesty (1991) does not change the overalldynamical evolution of the merger and yields agreement of the gravitationalwave signature to within 20% accuracy. however, differences of the structureand evolution of the outer layers of the neutron stars are present, which hasimportant implications for questions like mass loss and disk formation duringthe merging of binary neutron stars.

astro-ph;9709012	perspectives of core-collapse supernovae beyond sn 1987a	the observation of neutrinos from supernova 1987a has confirmed thetheoretical conjecture that these particles play a crucial role during thecollapse of the core of a massive star. only one per cent of the energy theycarry away from the newly formed neutron star may account for all the kineticand electromagnetic energy responsible for the spectacular display of thesupernova explosion. however, the neutrinos emitted from the collapsed stellarcore at the center of the explosion couple so weakly to the surrounding matterthat convective processes behind the supernova shock and/or inside the nascentneutron star might be required to increase the efficiency of the energytransfer to the stellar mantle and envelope. the conditions for a successfulexplosion by the neutrino-heating mechanism and the possible importance ofconvection in and around the neutron star are shortly discussed.neutrino-driven explosions turn out to be very sensitive to the parametersdescribing the neutrino emission of the proto-neutron star and to the detailsof the dynamical processes in the collapsed stellar core. therefore uniformexplosions with a well defined energy seem unlikely and type-ii supernovaexplosions do not offer promising perspectives for being useful as standardcandles.

astro-ph;9809280	gamma-ray bursts from accreting black holes in neutron star mergers	by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with a eulerian ppmcode we investigate the formation and the properties of the accretion torusaround the stellar mass black hole which originates from the merging of twoneutron stars. the simulations are performed with four nested cartesian gridswhich allow for both a good resolution near the central black hole and a largecomputational volume. they include the use of a physical equation of state aswell as the neutrino emission from the hot matter of the torus. the gravity ofthe black hole is described with a newtonian and alternatively with apaczynski-wiita potential. in a post-processing step, we evaluate our modelsfor the energy deposition by nu-nubar annihilation around the accretion torus.our models show that nu-nubar annihilation can yield the energy to account forweak, short gamma-ray bursts, if moderate beaming is involved. in fact, thebarrier of the dense baryonic gas of the torus suggests that the low-densitypair-photon-plasma is beamed as axial jets into a fraction 2 delta omega/ (4pi) between 1/100 and 1/10 of the sky, corresponding to opening half-angles ofroughly ten to several tens of degrees. thus gamma-burst energies of10^{50}--10^{51} erg seem within the reach of our models (if the source isinterpreted as radiating isotropically), corresponding to luminosities around10^{51} erg/s for typical burst durations of 0.1--1 s. gravitational capture ofradiation by the black hole, redshift and ray bending do not reduce the jetenergy significantly. effects associated with the kerr character of the rapidlyrotating black hole, however, could increase the gamma-burst energyconsiderably, and effects due to magnetic fields might even be required to getthe energies for long complex gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;9904378	titanium-44: its effective decay rate in young supernova remnants, and  its abundance in cas a	radioactive isotopes such as 44ti offer probably the most direct probe intonucleosynthesis environments in the interior of exploding stars, when theassociated gamma-ray activities in the explosion remnant are detected andtranslated back to the isotopic abundances at the time of the explosion. inthis paper, we assert that the procedure may not necessarily bestraightforward, at least in the case of 44ti, an orbital-electron capturedecay isotope. using the analytic model of mckee and truelove (1995) for youngsupernova remnants, and assuming the existence of overdense 56fe-dominatedclumps that contain also 44ti, we show that a high degree of ionization may becaused by the reverse shock so that the electron-capture rate of 44ti could besignificantly reduced from its laboratory value. when applied to cas a, thisincreases under certain conditions the current 44ti-activity by a factor 1.5 -2.5, which yields a better compatibility between the comptel observation of the1.16 mev line activity associated with the 44ti decay and the sn modelpredictions of the initial 44ti abundance. this possibility is, however,subject to various uncertainties, and in particular to the unknown propertiesand radial distribution of the the clumps in the ejecta.

astro-ph;9908290	black hole - neutron star mergers as central engines of gamma-ray bursts	hydrodynamic simulations of the merger of stellar mass black hole - neutronstar binaries (bh/ns) are compared with mergers of binary neutron stars(ns/ns). the simulations are newtonian, but take into account the emission andbackreaction of gravitational waves. the use of a physical nuclear equation ofstate allows us to include the effects of neutrino emission. for low neutronstar to black hole mass ratios the neutron star transfers mass to the blackhole during a few cycles of orbital decay and subsequent widening beforefinally being disrupted, whereas for ratios near unity the neutron star isalready distroyed during its first approach. a gas mass between about 0.3 andabout 0.7 solar masses is left in an accretion torus around the black hole andradiates neutrinos at a luminosity of several 10^{53} erg/s during an estimatedaccretion time scale of about 0.1 s. the emitted neutrinos and antineutrinosannihilate into electron-positron pairs with efficiencies of 1-3% percent andrates of up to 2*10^{52} erg/s, thus depositing an energy of up to 10^{51} ergabove the poles of the black hole in a region which contains less than 10^{-5}solar masses of baryonic matter. this could allow for relativistic expansionwith lorentz factors around 100 and is sufficient to explain apparent burstluminosities of up to several 10^{53} erg/s for burst durations ofapproximately 0.1-1 s, if the gamma emission is collimated in two moderatelyfocussed jets in a fraction of about 1/100-1/10 of the sky.

astro-ph;9911183	nucleosynthesis and clump formation in a core collapse supernova	high-resolution two-dimensional simulations were performed for the first fiveminutes of the evolution of a core collapse supernova explosion in a 15 solarmass blue supergiant progenitor. the computations start shortly after bounceand include neutrino-matter interactions by using a light-bulb approximationfor the neutrinos, and a treatment of the nucleosynthesis due to explosivesilicon and oxygen burning. we find that newly formed iron-group elements aredistributed throughout the inner half of the helium core by rayleigh-taylorinstabilities at the ni+si/o and c+o/he interfaces, seeded by convectiveoverturn during the early stages of the explosion. fast moving nickel mushroomswith velocities up to about 4000 km/s are observed. this offers a naturalexplanation for the mixing required in light curve and spectral synthesisstudies of type ib explosions. a continuation of the calculations to latertimes, however, indicates that the iron velocities observed in sn 1987 a cannotbe reproduced because of a strong deceleration of the clumps in the dense shellleft behind by the shock at the he/h interface.

0810.3999	nucleosynthesis in electron capture supernovae of agb stars	we examine nucleosynthesis in the electron capture supernovae of progenitoragb stars with an o-ne-mg core (with the initial stellar mass of 8.8 m_\odot).thermodynamic trajectories for the first 810 ms after core bounce are takenfrom a recent state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation. the presentednucleosynthesis results are characterized by a number of distinct features thatare not shared with those of other supernovae from the collapse of stars withiron core (with initial stellar masses of more than 10 m_\odot). first is thesmall amount of 56ni (= 0.002-0.004 m_\odot) in the ejecta, which can be anexplanation for observed properties of faint supernovae such as sne 2008s and1997d. in addition, the large ni/fe ratio is in reasonable agreement with thespectroscopic result of the crab nebula (the relic of sn 1054). second is thelarge production of 64zn, 70ge, light p-nuclei (74se, 78kr, 84sr, and 92mo),and in particular, 90zr, which originates from the low y_e (= 0.46-0.49, thenumber of electrons per nucleon) ejecta. we find, however, that only a 1-2%increase of the minimum y_e moderates the overproduction of 90zr. in contrast,the production of 64zn is fairly robust against a small variation of y_e. thisprovides the upper limit of the occurrence of this type of events to be about30% of all core-collapse supernovae.
