0706.1350	the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies	we identify satellites of isolated galaxies in sdss and examine their angulardistribution. using mock catalogues generated from cosmological n-bodysimulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolatedgalaxies and their satellites must be very strict in order to correctlyidentify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. thecriteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly groupmembers. we refine a set of selection criteria for which the groupcontamination is estimated to be less than 7% and present a catalogue of theresulting sample. the angular distribution of satellites about their host isbiased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for reddisc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colourof the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than itsmorphology. the similar anisotropy measured in this study as in studies thatwere dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are notresponsible for the angular distribution. satellites that are most likely tohave been recently accreted show a tendancy to lie along the same axis as thesurrounding large scale structure. the orientations of isolated early andintermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large scalestructures. we discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution andconsider the implications of our results, critically assessing the respectiveroles played by the orientation of the visible galaxy within its dark matterhalo; anisotropic accretion of satellites from the larger scale environment;and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark mattersubhalo population.

0902.0571	the chemical evolution of globular clusters i. reactive elements and  non-metals	we propose a new chemical evolution model aimed at explaining the chemicalproperties of globular clusters (gc) stars. our model depends upon theexistence of (i) a peculiar pre-enrichment phase in the gc's parent galaxyassociated with very low-metallicity type ii supernovae (sneii), and (ii)localized inhomogeneous enrichment from a single type ia supernova (sneia) andintermediate-mass (4 7msun) asymptotic giant branch (agb) field stars. gcformation is then assumed to take place within this chemically-peculiar region.thus, in our model the first low-mass gc stars to form are those with peculiarabundances (i.e., o-depleted and na-enhanced) while ``normal'' stars (i.e.,o-rich and na depleted) are formed in a second stage when self-pollution fromsneii occurs and the peculiar pollution from the previous phase is dispersed.in this study, we focus on three different gcs: ngc6752, ngc6205 (m13) andngc2808. we demonstrate that, within this framework, a model can be constructedwhich is consistent with (i) the elemental abundance anti-correlations, (ii)isotopic abundance patterns, and (iii) the extreme [o/fe] values observed inngc2808 and m13, without violating the global constraints of approximatelyunimodal [fe/h] and c+n+o.

0902.4002	calibrating an updated sph scheme within gcd+	we adapt a modern scheme of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) to our treen-body/sph galactic chemodynamics code gcd+. the applied scheme includes imple-mentations of the artificial viscosity switch and artificial thermalconductivity pro- posed by morris &amp; monaghan (1997), rosswog &amp; price (2007) andprice (2008), to model discontinuities and kelvin-helmholtz instabilities moreaccurately. we first present hydrodynamics test simulations and contrast theresults to runs undertaken without artificial viscosity switch or thermalconduction. in addition, we also explore the different levels of smoothing byadopting larger or smaller smoothing lengths, i.e. a larger or smaller numberof neighbour particles, nnb. we demonstrate that the new version of gcd+ iscapable of modelling kelvin-helmholtz instabilities to a simi- lar level as themesh code, athena. from the gresho vortex, point-like explosion andself-similar collapse tests, we conclude that setting the smoothing length tokeep the number of neighbour particles as high as nnb~58 is preferable toadopting smaller smoothing lengths. we present our optimised parameter setsfrom the hydrodynamics tests.

0905.4189	galactic chemical evolution in hierarchical formation models - i.  early-type galaxies in the local universe	we study the metallicities and abundance ratios of early-type galaxies incosmological semi-analytic models (sams) within the hierarchical galaxyformation paradigm. to achieve this we implemented a detailed galactic chemicalevolution (gce) model and can now predict abundances of individual elements forthe galaxies in the semi-analytic simulations. this is the first time a samwith feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) has included a chemicalevolution prescription that relaxes the instantaneous recycling approximation.we find that the new models are able to reproduce the observed mass-metallicity(m*-[z/h]) relation and, for the first time in a sam, we reproduce the observedpositive slope of the mass-abundance ratio (m*-[$alpha$/fe]) relation. ourresults indicate that in order to simultaneously match these observations ofearly-type galaxies, the use of both a very mildly top-heavy imf (i.e., with aslope of x=1.15 as opposed to a standard x=1.3), and a lower fraction ofbinaries that explode as type ia supernovae appears to be required. we alsoexamine the rate of supernova explosions in the simulated galaxies. inearly-type (non-star forming) galaxies, our predictions are also consistentwith the observed sne rates. however, in star-forming galaxies, a higherfraction of sn ia binaries than in our preferred model is required to match thedata. if, however, we deviate from the classical model and introduce apopulation of sne ia with very short delay times, our models simultaneouslyproduce a good match to the observed metallicities, abundance ratios and snrates.

0908.2548	are dry mergers dry, moist, or wet?	we present a spectral analysis of a sample of red-sequence galaxiesidentified by van dokkum (2005) as dry merger remnants and ongoing dry mergers.kinematics, stellar population absorption features, and ionisation fromemission lines, are derived. we find that approximately half of the sampleshowing strong tidal features have younger stellar populations than a controlsample at a given velocity dispersion. conversely, galaxies with weak tidaltails and/or ongoing mergers -- with the exception of one galaxy -- do not showthis young component. this seems to indicate that the young stellar populationsobserved in a significant fraction of ellipticals is the consequence of starformation triggered by mergers. this young component is consistent with a light"frosting" of young stars (&lt;2% by mass) superimposed upon a dominant, old (~11gyr), stellar population. in terms of stellar populations, these mergers are,in fact, fairly dry. we found, however, that merger remnants with young stellarpopulations are supported by rotation, contrary to the expectations of a majordry merger. this suggests that the small amount of gas involved has beensufficient to produce a dynamically cold stellar component. half of thegalaxies with strong tidal distortion, however, are slow rotating and havestellar populations compatible with the control sample at a given velocitydispersion. remarkably, none of the galaxies with velocity dispersions inexcess of 250 km/s have a young stellar component, independent of the mergerstage.

0909.4491	chemodynamical analysis of bulge stars for simulated disc galaxies	we analyse the kinematics and chemistry of the bulge stars of two simulateddisc galaxies using our chemodynamical galaxy evolution code gcd+. first wecompare stars that are born inside the galaxy with those that are born outsidethe galaxy and are accreted into the centre of the galaxy. stars that originateoutside of the bulge are accreted into it early in its formation within 3 gyrsso that these stars have high [alpha/fe] as well as having a high total energyreflecting their accretion to the centre of the galaxy. therefore, higher totalenergy is a good indicator for finding accreted stars. the bulges of thesimulated galaxies formed through multiple mergers separated by about a gyr.since [alpha/fe] is sensitive to the first few gyrs of star formation history,stars that formed during mergers at different epochs show different [alpha/fe].we show that the [mg/fe] against star formation time relation can be veryuseful to identify a multiple merger bulge formation scenario, provided thereis sufficiently good age information available. our simulations also show thatstars formed during one of the merger events retain a systematically prograderotation at the final time. this demonstrates that the orbit of the ancientmerger that helped to form the bulge could still remain in the kinematics ofbulge stars.

0911.1801	structure, kinematics, and chemical enrichment patterns after major  gas-rich disc-disc mergers	we used an n-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics algorithm, with a detailedtreatment of star formation, supernovae feedback, and chemical enrichment, toperform eight simulations of mergers between gas-rich disc galaxies. we varythe mass ratio of the progenitors, their rotation axes, and their orbitalparameters and analyze the kinematic, structural, and chemical properties ofthe remnants. six of these simulations result in the formation of a mergerremnant with a disc morphology as a result of the large gas-fraction of theremnants. we show that stars formed during the merger (a sudden starburst occurin our simulation and last for 0.2-0.3 gyr) and those formed after the mergerhave different kinematical and chemical properties. the first ones are locatedin thick disc or the halo. they are partially supported by velocity dispersionand have high [alpha/fe] ratios even at metallicities as high as [fe/h]=-0.5.the former ones -- the young component -- are located in a thin discrotationally supported and have lower [alpha/fe] ratios. the difference in therotational support of both components results in the rotation of the thick disclagging that of the thin disc by as much as a factor of two, as recentlyobserved.we find that, while the kinematic and structural properties of themerger remnant depends strongly upon the orbital parameters of the mergers,there is a remarkable uniformity in the chemical properties of the mergers.this suggests that general conclusions about the chemical signature of gas-richmergers can be drawn.

1012.2127	the dawning of the stream of aquarius in rave	we identify a new, nearby (0.5 &lt; d &lt; 10 kpc) stream in data from the radialvelocity experiment (rave). as the majority of stars in the stream lie in theconstellation of aquarius we name it the aquarius stream. we identify 15members of the stream lying between 30 &lt; l &lt; 75 and -70&lt; b &lt;-50, withheliocentric line-of-sight velocities v_los~-200 km/s. the members are outliersin the radial velocity distribution, and the overdensity is statisticallysignificant when compared to mock samples created with both the besan\c{c}ongalaxy model and newly-developed code galaxia. the metallicity distributionfunction and isochrone fit in the log g - t_eff plane suggest the streamconsists of a 10 gyr old population with [m/h]~-1.0. we explore relations toother streams and substructures, finding the stream cannot be identified withknown structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the galaxy's halo. usinga simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy we account for thelocalization of the stream. we find that the stream is dynamically young andtherefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globularcluster. the aquarius stream is thus a specimen of ongoing hierarchical galaxyformation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.

1103.3796	star formation history of barred disc galaxies	we present the first results of a pilot study aimed at understanding theinfluence of bars on the evolution of galaxy discs through the study of theirstellar content. we examine here the kinematics, star formation history,mass-weighted, luminosity-weighted, and single stellar population (ssp)equivalent ages and metallicities for four galaxies ranging from lenticulars tolate-type spirals. the data employed extends to 2-3 disc scalelengths, withs/n(a)&gt;50. several techniques are explored to derive star formation historiesand ssp-equivalent parameters, each of which are shown to be compatible. wedemostrate that the age-metallicity degeneracy is highly reduced by usingspectral fitting techniques --instead of indices-- to derive these parameters.we found that the majority of the stellar mass in our sample is composed of old(~10 gyr) stars. this is true in the bulge and the disc region, even beyond twodisc scalelengths. in the bulge region, we find that the young, dynamicallycold, structures produced by the presence of the bar (e.g., nuclear discs orrings) are responsible for shaping the bulges' age and metallicity gradients.in the disc region, a larger fraction of young stars is present in the externalparts of the disc compared with the inner disc. the disc growth is, therefore,compatible with a moderate inside-out formation scenario, where the luminosityweighted age changes from ~10 gyrs in the centre, to ~4 gyrs at two discscalelengths, depending upon the galaxy. for two galaxies, we compare themetallicity and age gradients of the disc major axis with that of the bar,finding very important differences. in particular, the stellar population ofthe bar is more similar to the bulge than to the disc, indicating that, atleast in those two galaxies, bars formed long ago and have survived to thepresent day.

1103.6150	metallicity gradients of disc stars for a cosmologically simulated  galaxy	we analyse for the first time the radial abundance gradients of the discstars of a disc galaxy simulated with our three dimensional, fully cosmologicalchemodynamical galaxy evolution code gcd+. we study how [fe/h], [n/o], [o/fe],[mg/fe] and [si/fe] vary with galactocentric radius. for the young stars of thedisc, we found a negative slope for [fe/h] and [n/o] but a positive [o/fe],[mg/fe] and [si/fe] slope with radius. by analysing the star formation rate(sfr) at different radii, we found that the simulated disc contains a greaterfraction of young stars in the outer regions, while the old stars tend to beconcentrated in the inner parts of the disc. this can explain the positive[alpha/fe] gradient as well as the negative [n/o] gradient with radius. thisradial trend is a natural outcome of an inside-out formation of the disc,regardless of its size and can thus explain the recently observed positive[alpha/fe] gradients in the milky way disc open clusters.

1104.2037	disc heating: comparing the milky way with cosmological simulations	we present the analysis of a suite of simulations run with differentparticle-and grid-based cosmological hydrodynamical codes and compare them withobservational data of the milky way. this is the first study to makecomparisons of properties of galaxies simulated with particle and grid-basedcodes. our analysis indicates that there is broad agreement between thesedifferent modelling techniques. we study the velocity dispersion - age relationfor disc stars at z=0 and find that four of the simulations are more consistentwith observations by holmberg et al. (2008) in which the stellar disc appearsto undergo continual/secular heating. two other simulations are in betteragreement with the quillen &amp; garnett (2001) observations that suggest a"saturation" in the heating profile for young stars in the disc. none of thesimulations have thin discs as old as that of the milky way. we also analysethe kinematics of disc stars at the time of their birth for different epochs inthe galaxies' evolution and find that in some simulations old stars are borncold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulationspossess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. the models whichare in better agreement with observations of the milky way's stellar discundergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last majormerger - i.e. once the disc has formed. all of the simulations aresignificantly "hotter" than the milky way disc; on top of the effects ofmergers, we find a "floor" in the dispersion that is related to the underlyingtreatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the lowdensity threshold which such codes use for star formation. this finding hasimportant implications for all studies of disc heating that use hydrodynamicalcodes.

1104.2447	a comparison of galaxy group luminosity functions from semi-analytic  models	semi-analytic models (sams) are currently one of the primary tools with whichto model statistically significant ensembles of galaxies. the underlyingphysical prescriptions inherent to each sam are, in many cases, different fromone another. several sams have been applied to the dark matter merger treesextracted from the millennium run, including those associated with thewell-known munich and durham lineages. we compare the predicted luminositydistributions of galaxy groups using four publicly available sams (de lucia etal. 2006; bower et al. 2006; bertone et al. 2007; font et al. 2008), in orderto explore a galactic environment in which the models have not been explored tothe same degree as they have in the field or in rich clusters. we identify acharacteristic "wiggle" in the group galaxy luminosity function generated usingthe de lucia et al. (2006) sam, that is not present in the durham-based models,consistent to some degree with observations. however, a comparison betweenconditional luminosity functions of groups between the models and observationsof yang et al. (2007) suggest that neither model is a particularly good match.the luminosity function wiggle is interpreted as the result of the two-mode agnfeedback implementation used in the munich models, which itself results inflattened magnitude gap distribution. an associated analysis of the magnitudegap distribution between first- and second-ranked group galaxies shows thatwhile the durham models yield distributions with approximately equal luminosityfirst- and second-ranked galaxies, in agreement with observations, the de luciaet al. models favours the scenario in which the second-ranked galaxy isapproximately one magnitude fainter than the primary,especially when thedynamic range of the mock data is limited to 3 magnitudes.

1105.3691	observational properties of the metal-poor thick disk of the milky way  galaxy and insights into its origins	we have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematicproperties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected fromthe rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to differentiate among thepresent scenarios of the formation of the thick disk. in this paper, we reporton a sample of 214 red giant branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74main-sequence/sub-giant branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment ourprevious sample of only giant stars. we find that the thick disk [alpha/fe]ratios are enhanced, and have little variation (&lt;0.1 dex), in agreement withour previous study. the augmented sample further allows, for the first time,investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, &lt;0.03 +/- 0.02dex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radialgradient and a -0.09 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc vertical gradient in iron abundance. inaddition, we show that the peak of the distribution of orbital eccentricitiesfor our sample agrees better with models in which the stars that comprise thethick disk were formed primarily in the galaxy, with direct accretion of starscontributing little. our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars fromdwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick diskpopulation, but cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thickdisk, such as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of apre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migrationof stars.

1109.1938	the chemical evolution of globular clusters - ii. metals and fluorine	in the first paper in this series, we proposed a new framework in which tomodel the chemical evolution of globular clusters. this model, is predicatedupon the assumption that clusters form within an interstellar medium enrichedlocally by the ejecta of a single type ia supernova and varying numbers ofasymptotic giant branch stars, superimposed on an ambient medium pre-enrichedby low-metallicity type ii supernovae. paper i was concerned with theapplication of this model to the observed abundances of several reactiveelements and so-called non-metals for three classical intermediate-metallicityclusters, with the hallmark of the work being the successful recovery of manyof their well-known elemental and isotopic abundance anomalies. here, we expandupon our initial analysis by (a) applying the model to a much broader range ofmetallicities (from the factor of three explored in paper i, to now, a factorof ~50; i.e., essentially, the full range of galactic globular clusterabundances, and (b) incorporating a broader suite of chemical species,including a number of iron-peak isotopes, heavier alpha-elements, and fluorine.while most empirical globular cluster abundance trends are reproduced, ourmodel would suggest the need for a higher production of ca, si, and cu inlow-metallicity (or so-called "prompt") type ia supernovae than predicted incurrent stellar models in order to reproduce the observed trends in ngc 6752,and a factor of two reduction in carbon production from asymptotic giant branchstars to explain the observed trends between carbon and nitrogen. observationsof heavy-element isotopes produced primarily by type ia supernovae, includingthose of titanium, iron, and nickel, could support/refute unequivocally ourproposed framework. hydrodynamical simulations would be necessary to study itsviability from a dynamical point of view.

1111.5620	halo expansion in cosmological hydro simulations: towards a baryonic  solution of the cusp/core problem in massive spirals	a clear prediction of the cold dark matter model is the existence of cuspydark matter halo density profiles on all mass scales. this is not in agreementwith the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies, challenging on smallscales the otherwise successful cdm paradigm. in this work we employ highresolution cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations to study the effects ofdissipative processes on the inner distribution of dark matter in milky-waylike objects (m~1e12 msun). our simulations include supernova feedback, and theeffects of the radiation pressure of massive stars before they explode assupernovae. the increased stellar feedback results in the expansion of the darkmatter halo instead of contraction with respect to n-body simulations. baryonsare able to erase the dark matter cuspy distribution creating a flat, cored,dark matter density profile in the central several kpc of a massive milky-waylike halo. the profile is well fit by a burkert profile, with fittingparameters consistent with the observations. in addition, we obtain flatrotation curves as well as extended, exponential stellar disk profiles. whilethe stellar disk we obtain is still partially too thick to resemble the mw thindisk, this pilot study shows that there is enough energy available in thebaryonic component to alter the dark matter distribution even in massive discgalaxies, providing a possible solution to the long standing problem of cuspsvs. cores.

1112.1698	magicc haloes: confronting simulations with observations of the  circumgalactic medium at z=0	we explore the circumgalactic medium (cgm) of two simulated star-forminggalaxies with luminosities l ~ 0.1 and 1 l* generated using the smooth particlehydrodynamic code gasoline. these simulations are part of the making galaxiesin a cosmological context (magicc) program in which the stellar feedback istuned to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. for comparison, eachgalaxy was also simulated using a 'lower feedback' (lf) model which hasstrength comparable to other implementations in the literature. the 'magiccfeedback' (mf) model has a higher incidence of massive stars and anapproximately two times higher energy input per supernova. apart from thelow-mass halo using lf, each galaxy exhibits a metal-enriched cgm that extendsto approximately the virial radius. a significant fraction of this gas has beenheated in supernova explosions in the disc and subsequently ejected into thecgm where it is predicted to give rise to substantial o vi absorption. thesimulations do not yet address the question of what happens to the o vi whenthe galaxies stop forming stars. our models also predict a reservoir of cool hi clouds that show strong ly\alpha absorption to several hundred kpc. comparingthese models to recent surveys with the hubble space telescope, we find thatonly the mf models have sufficient o vi and h i gas in the cgm to reproduce theobserved distributions. in separate analyses, these same mf models also showbetter agreement with other galaxy observables (e.g. rotation curves, surfacebrightness profiles and h i gas distribution). we infer that the cgm is thedominant reservoir of baryons for galaxy haloes.

1306.6632	numerical simulations of bubble-induced star formation in dwarf  irregular galaxies with a novel stellar feedback scheme	to study the star formation and feedback mechanism, we simulate the evolutionof an isolated dwarf irregular galaxy (dirr) in a fixed dark matter halo,similar in size to wlm, using a new stellar feedback scheme. we use the newversion of our original n-body/smoothed particle chemodynamics code, gcd+,which adopts improved hydrodynamics, metal diffusion between the gas particlesand new modelling of star formation and stellar wind and supernovae (sne)feedback. comparing the simulations with and without stellar feedback effects,we demonstrate that the collisions of bubbles produced by strong feedback caninduce star formation in a more widely spread area. we also demonstrate thatthe metallicity in star forming regions is kept low due to the mixing of themetal-rich bubbles and the metal-poor inter-stellar medium. our simulationsalso suggest that the bubble-induced star formation leads to manycounter-rotating stars. the bubble-induced star formation could be a dominantmechanism to maintain star formation in dirrs, which is different from largerspiral galaxies where the non-axisymmetric structures, such as spiral arms, area main driver of star formation.

0801.2476	simulating the mass-metallicity relation from z=1	we use 112 n-body/hydrodynamical simulations in the standard cold dark matteruniverse, to follow the formation of galaxy-sized halos and investigate thechemical enrichment of both the stellar component and the interstellar mediumof galaxies, with stellar masses larger than 1e9 msun. the resulting chemicalproperties of the simulated galaxies are broadly consistent with theobservations. the predicted relationship between the mean metallicity and thegalaxy stellar mass for both the stellar and the gaseous components at z=0 arein agreement with the relationships observed locally. the predicted scatterabout these relationships, which is traced to the differing merging historiesamongst the simulated galaxies with similar final masses, is similar to thatobserved. the predicted correlations between the total mass and the stellarmass of galaxies in our simulated sample from the present epoch up to z=1 agreewith observed ones. the stellar mass versus metallicity relation and itsassociated scatter are reproduced by the simulations as consequences of theincreasing efficiency of the conversion of gas into stars with stellar mass,and the differing merging histories amongst the galaxies with similar masses.the old ages of simulated low mass galaxies at z=0, and the weak level ofchemical evolution for massive galaxies suggest however that our modeling ofthe supernova feedback may be incomplete, or that other feedback processes havebeen neglected.

0802.1628	the dynamics of subhalos in warm dark matter models	we present a comparison of the properties of substructure halos (subhalos)orbiting within host halos that form in cold dark matter (cdm) and warm darkmatter (wdm) cosmologies. our study focuses on selected properties of thesesubhalos, namely their anisotropic spatial distribution within the hosts; theexistence of a "backsplash'' population; the age-distance relation; the degreeto which they suffer mass loss; and the distribution of relative (infall)velocities with respect to the hosts. we find that the number density ofsubhalos in our wdm model is suppressed relative to that in the cdm model, aswe would expect. interestingly, our analysis reveals that backsplash subhalosexist in both the wdm and cdm models. indeed, there are no statisticallysignificant differences between the spatial distributions of subhalos in thecdm and wdm models. there is evidence that subhalos in the wdm model sufferenhanced mass loss relative to their counterparts in the cdm model, reflectingtheir lower central densities. we note also a tendency for the (infall)velocities of subhalos in the wdm model to be higher than in the cdm model.nevertheless, we conclude that observational tests based on either the spatialdistribution or the kinematics of the subhalo population are unlikely to helpus to differentiate between the cdm model and our adopted wdm model.

0802.1917	on the relation between radial alignment of dark matter subhalos and  host mass in cosmological simulations	we explore the dependence of the radial alignment of subhalos on the mass ofthe host halo they orbit in. as the effect is seen on a broad range of scalesincluding massive clusters as well as galactic systems it only appears naturalto explore this phenomenon by means of cosmological simulations covering thesame range in masses. we have 25 well resolved host dark matter halos at ourdisposal ranging from 10^15 msun/h down to 10^12 msun/h each consisting oforder of a couple of million particles within the virial radius. we observethat subhalos tend to be more spherical than isolated objects. both thedistributions of sphericity and triaxiality of subhalos are gaussiandistributed with peak values of s approx. 0.80 and t approx. 0.56, irrespectiveof host mass. interestingly we note that the radial alignment is independent ofhost halo mass and the distribution of \cos\theta (i.e. the angle between themajor axis e_a of each subhalo and the radius vector of the subhalo in thereference frame of the host) is well fitted by a simple power law p(\cos\theta)proportional to \cos^4\theta with the same fitting parameters for all hosthalos.

1502.00627	simple and accurate modelling of the gravitational potential produced by  thick and thin exponential disks	we present accurate models of the gravitational potential produced by aradially exponential disk mass distribution. the models are produced bycombining three separate miyamoto-nagai disks. such models have been usedpreviously to model the disk of the milky way, but here we extend thisframework to allow its application to disks of any mass, scalelength, and awide range of thickness from infinitely thin to near spherical (ellipticitiesfrom 0 to 0.9). the models have the advantage of simplicity of implementation,and we expect faster run speeds over a double exponential disk treatment. thepotentials are fully analytical, and differentiable at all points. the massdistribution of our models deviates from the radial mass distribution of a pureexponential disk by &lt;0.4% out to 4 disk scalelengths, and &lt;1.9% out to 10 diskscalelengths. we tabulate fitting parameters which facilitate construction ofexponential disks for any scalelength, and a wide range of disk thickness (auser-friendly, web-based interface is also available). our recipe is wellsuited for numerical modelling of the tidal effects of a giant disk galaxy onstar clusters or dwarf galaxies. we consider three worked examples; the milkyway thin and thick disk, and a disky dwarf galaxy.

1509.02537	the sensitivity of harassment to orbit: mass loss from early-type dwarfs  in galaxy clusters	we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of the orbital dependence ofharassment on early-type dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within arealistic, virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance.we find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating theirstellar disks for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. comparing tothe orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, we find that the majorityof the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. wealso study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systemsof early-type dwarfs. we find these are significantly altered only ifharassment is very strong. this suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs inclusters such as virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars orglobular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embeddeddeep within their dark matter halo. we demonstrate that this result is actuallyconsistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite theapparent contradiction. those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar strippingare found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift=0, which mixesthem in with less strongly harassed galaxies. however when placed onphase-space diagrams, strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lowervelocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. this remains true in acosmological simulation, even when halos have a wide range of masses andconcentrations. thus phase-space diagrams may be a useful tool for determiningthe relative likelihood that galaxies have been strongly or weakly harassed.

1510.05504	new quasars behind the magellanic clouds. spectroscopic confirmation of  near-infrared selected candidates	quasi--stellar objects (quasars) located behind nearby galaxies provide anexcellent absolute reference system for astrometric studies, but they aredifficult to identify because of fore- and background contamination. deepwide--field, high angular resolution surveys spanning the entire area of nearbygalaxies are needed to obtain a complete census of such quasars. we embarked ona program to expand the quasar reference system behind the large and the smallmagellanic clouds, the magellanic bridge, and the magellanic stream, connectingthe clouds with the milky way. hundreds of quasar candidates were selectedbased on their near--infrared colors and variability properties from theongoing public eso vista magellanic clouds survey. a subset of 49 objects wasfollowed up with optical spectroscopy. we confirmed the quasar nature of 37objects (34 new identifications), four are low redshift objects, three areprobably stars, and the remaining three lack prominent spectral features for asecure classification; bona fide quasars, judging from their broad absorptionlines are located, as follows: 10 behind the lmc, 13 behind the smc, and 14behind the bridge. the quasars span a redshift range from z~0.5 to z~4.1. uponcompletion the vmc survey is expected to yield a total of ~1500 quasars withy&lt;19.32 mag, j&lt;19.09 mag, and ks&lt;18.04 mag.

1512.04559	origin of the metallicity distribution in the thick disc	aims. using a suite of cosmological chemodynamical disc galaxy simulations,we assess how (a) radial metallicity gradients evolve with scaleheight; (b) thevertical metallicity gradients change through the thick disc; and (c) thevertical gradient of the stellar rotation velocity varies through the disc. wecompare with the milky way to search for analogous trends. methods. we analysefive simulated spiral galaxies with masses comparable to the milky way. thesimulations span a range of star formation and energy feedback strengths andprescriptions, particle- and grid-based hydrodynamical implementations, as wellas initial conditions/assembly history. results. consistently, we find that thesteeper, negative, radial metallicity gradients seen in the mid-plane flattenwith increasing height away from the plane. in simulations with stronger(and/or more spatially-extended) feedback, the negative radial gradientsinvert, becoming positive for heights in excess of 1 kpc. such behaviour isconsistent with that inferred from recent observations. our measurements of thevertical metallicity gradients show no clear correlation with galactocentricradius, and are in good agreement with those observed in the milky way's thickdisc (locally). conclusions. simulations employing stronger/more extendedfeedback prescriptions possess radial and vertical metallicity and kinematicgradients more in line with recent observations. the inverted, positive, radialmetallicity gradients seen in the simulated thick stellar discs originate froma population of younger, more metal-rich, stars formed in-situ, superimposedupon a background population of older migrators from the inner disc; thecontrast provided by the former increases radially, due to the inside-outgrowth of the disc. a similar behaviour may be responsible for the sameflattening seen in the radial gradients with scaleheight in the milky way.

astro-ph;0304036	the galactic inner halo: searching for white dwarfs and measuring the  fundamental galactic constant, vo/ro	we establish an extragalactic, zero-motion frame of reference within thedeepest optical image of a globular star cluster, an hst 123-orbit exposure ofm4 (go 8679, cycle 9). the line of sight beyond m4 (l,b (deg) = 351,16)intersects the inner halo (spheroid) of our galaxy at a tangent-point distanceof 7.6 kpc (for ro = 8 kpc). we isolate these spheroid stars from the clusterbased on their proper motions over the 6-year baseline between these andprevious epoch hst data (go 5461, cycle 4). distant background galaxies arealso found on the same sight line using image-morphology techniques. this fixedreference frame allows us to independently determine the fundamental galacticconstant, vo/ro = 25.3 +/- 2.6 km/s/kpc, thus providing a velocity of the localstandard of rest, v = 202.7 +/- 24.7 km/s for ro = 8.0 +/- 0.5 kpc. secondly,the galaxies allow a direct measurement of m4's absolute proper motion,mu_total = 22.57 +/- 0.76 mas/yr, in excellent agreement with recent studies.the clear separation of galaxies from stars in these deep data also allow us tosearch for inner-halo white dwarfs. we model the conventional galacticcontributions of white dwarfs along our line of sight and predict 7.9 (thindisk), 6.3 (thick disk) and 2.2 (spheroid) objects to the limiting magnitude atwhich we can clearly delineate stars from galaxies (v = 29). an additional 2.5objects are expected from a 20% white dwarf dark halo consisting of 0.5 moobjects, 70% of which are of the da type. after considering the kinematics andmorphology of the objects in our data set, we find the number of white dwarfsto be consistent with the predictions for each of the conventional populations.however, we do not find any evidence for dark halo white dwarfs.

astro-ph;0304320	deriving the metallicity distribution function of galactic systems	the chemical evolution of the milky way is investigated using a dual-phasemetal-enriched infall model in which primordial gas fuels the earliest epoch ofstar formation, followed by the ongoing formation of stars from newly accretedgas. the latest metallicity distribution of local k-dwarfs is reproduced bythis model, which allows the galactic thin disk to form from slightlymetal-enriched gas with alpha-element enhancement. our model predicts ages forthe stellar halo and thin disk of 12.5 and 7.4 gyr, respectively, in agreementwith empirically determined values. the model presented in this paper iscompared with a similar dual-phase infall model from chiappini et al. (2001).we discuss a degeneracy that enables both models to recover the k-dwarfmetallicity distribution while yielding different star formation histories.  the metallicity distribution function (mdf) of k-dwarfs is proposed to bemore directly comparable to chemical evolution model results than the g-dwarfdistribution because lower mass k-dwarfs are less susceptible to stellarevolutionary effects. the k-dwarf mdf should consequently be a better probe ofstar formation history and provide a stronger constraint to chemical evolutionmodels than the widely used g-dwarf mdf. the corrections that should be appliedto a g-dwarf mdf are quantified for the case of the outer halo of ngc 5128.

astro-ph;0305014	simulating a white dwarf-dominated galactic halo	observational evidence has suggested the possibility of a galactic halo whichis dominated by white dwarfs (wds). while debate continues concerning theinterpretation of this evidence, it is clear that an initial mass function(imf) biased heavily toward wd precursors (1 &lt; m/msol &lt; 8), at least in theearly universe, would be necessary in generating such a halo. within theframework of homogeneous, closed-box models of galaxy formation, such biasedimfs lead to an unavoidable overproduction of carbon and nitrogen relative tooxygen (as measured against the abundance patterns in the oldest stars of themilky way). using a three-dimensional tree n-body smoothed particlehydrodynamics code, we study the dynamics and chemical evolution of a galaxywith different imfs. both invariant and metallicity-dependent imfs areconsidered. our variable imf model invokes a wd-precursor-dominated imf formetallicities less than 5% solar (primarily the galactic halo), and thecanonical salpeter imf otherwise (primarily the disk). halo wd densitydistributions and c,n/o abundance patterns are presented. while galactic haloescomprised of ~5% (by mass) of wds are not supported by our simulations, massfractions of ~1-2% cannot be ruled out. this conclusion is consistent with thepresent-day observational constraints.

astro-ph;0311202	anisotropy in the distribution of satellite galaxy orbits	nearby clusters such as virgo and coma possess galaxy distributions whichtend to be aligned with the principal axis of the cluster itself. this has alsobeen confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of some 300 abell clusterswhere the effect has been linked to the dynamical state of the cluster.moreover, the orbits of satellite galaxies in galactic systems like our ownmilky way also demonstrate a high degree of anisotropy - the so-called holmbergeffect, the origin of which has been the subject of debate for more than 30years. this study presents the analysis of cosmological simulations focusing onthe orbits of satellite galaxies within dark matter halos. the apocentres ofthe orbits of these satellites are preferentially found within a cone ofopening angle ~40 around the major axis of the host halo, in accordance withthe observed anisotropy found in galaxy clusters. we do, however, note that alink to the dynamical age of the cluster is not well established as both ouroldest dark matter halos do show a clear anisotropy signal. further analysisconnects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along thefilaments: the orbits are determined rather by the environment of the host halothan some "dynamical selection" during their life within the host's virialradius.

astro-ph;0404255	the evolution of substructure ii: linking dynamics to environment	we present results from a series of high-resolution n-body simulations thatfocus on the formation and evolution of eight dark matter halos, each of ordera million particles within the virial radius. we follow the time evolution ofhundreds of satellite galaxies with unprecedented time resolution, relatingtheir physical properties to the differing halo environmental conditions. theself-consistent cosmological framework in which our analysis was undertakenallows us to explore satellite disruption within live host potentials, anatural complement to earlier work conducted within static potentials. our hosthalos were chosen to sample a variety of formation histories, ages, andtriaxialities; despite their obvious differences, we find striking similaritieswithin the associated substructure populations. namely, all satellite orbitsfollow nearly the same eccentricity distribution with a correlation betweeneccentricity and pericentre. we also find that the destruction rate of thesubstructure population is nearly independent of the mass, age, and triaxialityof the host halo. there are, however, subtle differences in the velocityanisotropy of the satellite distribution. we find that the local velocity biasat all radii is greater than unity for all halos and this increases as we movecloser to the halo centre, where it varies from 1.1 to 1.4. for the globalvelocity bias we find a small but slightly positive bias, although when werestrict the global velocity bias calculation to satellites that have had atleast one orbit, the bias is essentially removed.

(2003) that the milky way satellites are found preferentiallycloser to the galactic centre and simulations underestimate the amount ofcentral substructure, respectively. further, this universal substructureprofile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. boththe halo finder mhf and the halo tracker mht will become part of the opensource mlapm distribution.

astro-ph;0404427	the evolution of substructure iii: the outskirts of clusters	we present an investigation of satellite galaxies in the outskirts of galaxyclusters taken from a series of high-resolution n-body simulations. we focus onthe so-called "backsplash population", i.e. satellite galaxies that once wereinside the virial radius of the host but now reside beyond it. we find thatthis population is significant in number and needs to be appreciated wheninterpreting the various galaxy morphology environmental relationships anddecoupling the degeneracy between nature and nurture. specifically, we findthat approximately half of the galaxies with current clustercentric distance inthe interval 1-2 virial radii of the host are backsplash galaxies which oncepenetrated deep into the cluster potential, with 90% of these entering towithin 50% of the virial radius. these galaxies have undergone significanttidal disruption, loosing on average 40% of their mass. this results in a massfunction for the backsplash population different to those galaxies infallingfor the first time. we further show that these two populations arekinematically distinct and should be observable within existent spectroscopicsurveys.

astro-ph;0405439	is the initial mass function of low surface brightness galaxies  dominated by low mass stars?	the rotation curves of low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies suggest thatthey possess significantly higher mass-to-light (m/l) ratios than their highsurface brightness counterparts, indicating that lsb galaxies may be darkmatter dominated. this interpretation is hampered by the difficulty ofdisentangling the disc and dark halo contributions from the disc dynamics oflsb galaxies. recently, fuchs (2002) has attempted such a disentanglement usingspiral arm density wave and swing amplification theory, allowing an independentmeasurement of the disc mass; this work suggests that lsb discs aresignificantly more massive than previously believed. this would considerablyreduce the amount of matter required in the dark halos in fitting the rotationcurves. interestingly, the high mass-to-light ratios derived for the discsappear inconsistent with standard stellar population synthesis models. in thispaper, we investigate whether the high m/l ratios for the fuchs lsb discs mightbe understood by adopting a very ``bottom heavy'' initial mass function (imf).we find that an imf with a power law exponent of around alpha=3.85 (compared tothe standard salpeter imf, alpha=2.35) is sufficient to explain the unusuallyhigh m/l ratios of the fuchs sample. within the context of the models, the bluecolours ((b-r)_0 &lt; 1.0) of the sample galaxies result from being metal-poor([fe/h] = -1.5 ~ -1.0) and having undergone recent (~1-3 gyr ago) starformation.

astro-ph;0410579	contrasting the chemical evolution of the milky way and andromeda  galaxies	the chemical evolution history of a galaxy hides clues about how it formedand has been changing through time. we have studied the chemical evolutionhistory of the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) to find which are commonfeatures in the chemical evolution of disc galaxies as well as which aregalaxy-dependent. we use a semi-analytic multi-zone chemical evolution model.such models have succeeded in explaining the mean trends of the observedchemical properties in these two local group spiral galaxies with similar massand morphology. our results suggest that while the evolution of the mw and m31shares general similarities, differences in the formation history are requiredto explain the observations in detail. in particular, we found that theobserved higher metallicity in the m31 halo can be explained by either a) ahigher halo star formation efficiency or b) a larger reservoir of infallinghalo gas with a longer halo formation phase. these two different pictures wouldlead to a) a higher [o/fe] at low metallicities or b) younger stellarpopulations in the m31 halo, respectively. both pictures result in a moremassive stellar halo in m31, which suggests a possible correlation between thehalo metallicity and its stellar mass.

astro-ph;0501149	massive elliptical galaxies in x-rays: the role of late gas accretion	we present a new chemical evolution model meant to be a first step in theself-consistent study of both optical and x-ray properties of ellipticalgalaxies. detailed cooling and heating processes in the interstellar medium aretaken into account using a mono-phase one-zone treatment which allows a morereliable modelling of the galactic wind regime with respect to previous work.the model successfully reproduces simultaneously the mass-metallicity,colour-magnitude, the l_x - l_b and the l_x - t relations, as well as theobserved trend of the [mg/fe] ratio as a function of sigma, by adopting theprescriptions of pipino &amp; matteucci (2004) for the gas infall and starformation timescales. we found that a late secondary accretion of gas from theenvironment plays a fundamental role in driving the l_x - l_b and l_x - trelations and can explain their large observational scatter. the irondiscrepancy, namely the too high predicted iron abundance in x-ray haloes ofellipticals compared to observations, still persists. on the other hand, wepredict [o/fe] in the ism which is in good agreement with the most recentobservations. we suggest possible mechanisms acting on a galactic scale whichmay solve the iron discrepancy. in particular, mixing of gas driven by agns maypreserve the gas mass (and thus the x-ray luminosity) while diluting the ironabundance. new predictions for the amounts of iron, oxygen and energy ejectedinto the intracluster medium (icm) are presented and we conclude that type iasupernovae (sne ia) play a fundamental role in the icm enrichment. sne iaactivity, in fact, may power a galactic wind lasting for a considerable amountof the galactic lifetime, even in the case for which the efficiency of energytransfer into the ism per sn ia event is less than unity.

astro-ph;0502231	how concentrated are the haloes of low surface brightness galaxies in  the cold dark matter model?	we investigate whether a correlation exists between the concentration andspin parameters of dark matter haloes forming in lcdm n-body simulations. inparticular, we focus on haloes with virial masses characteristic of the hostsof low surface brightness (lsb) and high surface brightness (hsb) galaxies. ouranalysis demonstrates that concentration and spin are anti-correlated. if weassume that a galaxy disk forms in one of these haloes from baryons thatapproximately conserved angular momentum during their dissipation into therotationally supported disk, then it is possible to estimate the disk's centralsurface density. for an appropriate choice of mass-to-light ratio, we can placeconstraints on the central surface brightness of the disk and hence identifythe analogues of the host haloes of lsb and hsb galaxies. we find that our lsbgalaxy analogues occupy haloes that have lower concentrations than might beexpected based on consideration of the mass-concentration relation for the lcdmcosmology. the distribution of concentrations peaks at c~6, in good agreementwith observational data, although there are important differences between theshapes of the simulated and observationally inferred distributions. thissuggests that lsb galaxies inhabit a biased subsample of the halo population,and that this bias may be an important ingredient for resolving the currentdebate regarding the structure of lsb galaxy dark matter haloes.

astro-ph;0503273	the emergence of the thick disk in a cdm universe ii: colors and  abundance patterns	the recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in diskgalaxies, and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages, means that the formation ofthe thick disk, perhaps more than any other component, holds the key tounravelling the evolution of the milky way, and indeed all disk galaxies. inpaper i, we proposed that the thick disk was formed in an epoch of gas richmergers, at high redshift. this hypothesis was based on comparing n-body/sphsimulations to a variety of galactic and extragalactic observations, includingstellar kinematics, ages and chemical properties.here examine our thick diskformation scenario in light of the most recent observations of extragalacticthick disks. in agreement, our simulted thick disks are old and relativelymetal rich, with v-i colors that do not vary significantly with distance fromthe plane. further, we show that our proposal results in an enhancement ofalpha-elements in thick disk stars as compared with thin disk stars, consistentwith observations of the relevant populations of the milky way. we also findthat our scenario naturally leads to the formation of an old metal weak stellarhalo population with high alpha-element abundances.

astro-ph;0507380	the importance of interactions for mass loss from satellite galaxies in  cold dark matter haloes	we investigate the importance of interactions between dark mattersubstructures for the mass loss they suffer whilst orbiting within a sample ofhigh resolution galaxy cluster mass cold dark matter haloes formed incosmological n-body simulations. we have defined a quantitative measure thatgauges the degree to which interactions are responsible for mass loss fromsubstructures. this measure indicates that interactions are more prominent inyounger systems when compared to older more relaxed systems. we show that thisis due to the increased number of encounters a satellite experiences and ahigher mass fraction in satellites. this is in spite of the uniformity in thedistributions of relative distances and velocities of encounters betweensubstructures within the different host systems in our sample. using a simplemodel to relate the net force felt by a single satellite to the mass loss itsuffers, we show that interactions with other satellites account for ~30% ofthe total mass loss experienced over its lifetime. the relation between the ageof the host and the importance of interactions increases the scatter about thismean value from ~25% for the oldest to ~45% for the youngest system we havestudied. we conclude that satellite interactions play a vital role in theevolution of substructure in dark matter halos and that a significant fractionof the tidally stripped material can be attributed to these interactions.

astro-ph;0602394	machos in dark matter haloes	using eight dark matter haloes extracted from fully-self consistentcosmological n-body simulations, we perform microlensing experiments. ahypothetical observer is placed at a distance of 8.5 kpc from the centre of thehalo measuring optical depths, event durations and event rates towards thedirection of the large magellanic cloud. we simulate 1600 microlensingexperiments for each halo. assuming that the whole halo consists of machos, f =1.0, and a single macho mass is m_m = 1.0 msun, the simulations yield meanvalues of tau = 4.7^{+5.0}_{-2.2} 10^{-7} and gamma = 1.6^{+1.3}_{-0.6} 10^{-6}events/star/year. we find that triaxiality and substructure can have majoreffects on the measured values so that tau and gamma values of up to threetimes the mean can be found. if we fit our values of tau and gamma to the machocollaboration observations (alcock et al. 2000), we find f =0.23^{+0.15}_{-0.13} and m_m = 0.44^{+0.24}_{-0.16}. five out of the eighthaloes under investigation produce f and m_m values mainly concentrated withinthese bounds.

astro-ph;0612163	the spatial distribution of the galactic first stars i: high-resolution  n-body approach	we study the spatial distribution of galactic metal-free stars by combiningan extremely high-resolution (7.8 x 10^5 solar masses per particle) cold darkmatter n-body simulation of the milky-way with a semi-analytic model of metalenrichment. this approach allows us to resolve halos with virial temperaturesdown to the 10^4k atomic cooling limit, and it is sufficiently flexible to makea number of robust conclusions, despite the extremely uncertain properties ofthe first stars. galactic metal-free stars are formed over a large redshiftrange, which peaks at z~10, but continues down to z~5, contributing stars atwide range of galactocentric radii. stars containing only metals generated byprimordial stars are similarly widespread. neither changing the efficiency ofmetal dispersal by two orders of magnitude, nor drastically changing theapproximations in our semi-analytical model can affect these result. thus, ifthey have sufficiently long lifetimes, a significant number of stars formed ininitially primordial star clusters should be found in the nearby galactic haloregardless of the specifics of metal-free star formation. observations of metalabundances in galactic halo stars should be taken as directly constraining theproperties of primordial stars, and the lack of metal-free halo stars todayshould be taken as strongly suggesting a 0.8 solar mass lower limit on theprimordial initial mass function.

astro-ph;0612259	the spatial distribution of the galactic first stars ii: sph approach	we use cosmological, chemo-dynamical, smoothed particle hydrodynamicalsimulations of milky-way-analogue galaxies to find the expected present-daydistributions of both metal-free stars that formed from primordial gas and theoldest star populations. we find that metal-free stars continue to form untilz~4 in halos that are chemically isolated and located far away from the biggestprogenitor of the final system. as a result, if the population iii initial massfunction allows stars with low enough mass to survive until z=0 (&lt; 0.8 msol),they would be distributed throughout the galactic halo. on the other hand, theoldest stars form in halos that collapsed close to the highest density peak ofthe final system, and at z=0 they are located preferentially in the centralregion of the galaxy, i.e., in the bulge. according to our models, these trendsare not sensitive to the merger histories of the disk galaxies or theimplementation of supernova feedback. furthermore, these full hydrodynamicsresults are consistent with our n-body results in paper i, and lend furtherweight to the conclusion that surveys of low-metallicity stars in the galactichalo can be used to directly constrain the properties of primordial stars. inparticular, they suggest that the current lack of detections of metal-freestars implies that their lifetimes were shorter than a hubble time, placingconstraints on the metal-free initial mass function.

astro-ph;9410031	on the influence of supernova remnant thermal energy in powering  galactic winds	the fundamental tenet of the classical supernovae-driven wind model ofelliptical galaxies is that the residual thermal energy of all supernovaeremnants (snrs) provide sufficient energy to overcome the binding energy of theremaining interstellar gas, thereby driving a global galactic wind. were-examine model predictions of this epoch of wind ejection t_gw, highlightinga heretofore underappreciated sensitivity to the adopted remnant thermal energyformalism, and illustrating cases in which previous work may have substantiallyoverestimated t_gw. arguments based upon chemical evolution alone, put forth toreject the hypothesis of dark matter distributions similar to the luminouscomponent in spheroids, are shown to be tenuous. finally, the predictedenrichment of intracluster gas during the wind phase of cluster ellipticals,and its relation to the selected snr interior thermal energy evolutionaryscheme, is addressed. despite the success of previous wind models, our resultsstill call into question the correctness of the simple analytical approach usedthus far, and imply that a more appropriate technique should be adopted in thefuture.

astro-ph;9503057	chemical abundances in clusters of galaxies	we study the origin of iron and alpha-elements (o, mg, si) in clusters ofgalaxies. in particular, we discuss the [o/fe] ratio and the ironmass-to-luminosity ratio in the intracluster medium (icm) and their link to thechemical and dynamical evolution of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. weadopt a detailed model of galactic evolution incorporating the development ofsupernovae- driven galactic winds which pollute the icm with enriched ejecta.we demonstrate \it quantitatively \rm the crucial dependence upon the assumedstellar initial mass function in determining the evolution of the mass andabundances ratios of heavy elements in typical model icms. we show thatcompletely opposite behaviours of [alpha/fe] ratios (\ie positive versusnegative ratios) can be obtained by varying the initial mass function withoutaltering the classic assumptions regarding type ia supernovae progenitors ortheir nucleosynthesis. our results indicate that models incorporating somewhatflatter-than-salpeter initial mass functions (ie x approx 1, as opposed tox=1.35) are preferred, provided the intracluster medium iron mass-to-luminosityratio, preliminary [alpha/fe]&gt;0 asca results, and present-day type iasupernovae rates, are to be matched. a simple virgo cluster simulation whichadheres to these constraints shows that approx 70% of the measured icm ironmass has its origin in type ii supernovae, with the remainder being synthesizedin type ia systems.

astro-ph;9706138	supernovae types ia/ii and intracluster medium enrichment	we re-examine the respective roles played by supernovae (sne) types ia and iiin enriching the intracluster medium (icm) of galaxy clusters, in light of therecent downward shift of the asca abundance ratios of alpha-elements to ironfavoured by ishimaru &amp; arimoto (1997, pasj, 49, 1). because of this shift,ishimaru &amp; arimoto conclude that &gt;50% of the icm iron must have originated fromwithin type ia sne progenitors. a point not appreciated in their study, nor inmost previous analyses, is the crucial dependence of such a conclusion upon theadopted massive star physics. employing several alternative type ii sn yieldcompilations, we demonstrate how uncertainties in the treatment of convectionand mass-loss can radically alter our perception of the relative importance oftype ia and ii sne as icm polluters. if mass-loss of the form favoured bymaeder (1992, a&amp;a, 264, 105) or convection of the form favoured by arnett(1996, supernovae and nucleosynthesis) is assumed, the effect upon the oxygenyields would lead us to conclude that type ia sne play no part in polluting theicm, in contradiction with ishimaru &amp; arimoto. apparent dichotomies still exist(e.g. the mean icm neon-to-iron ratio implies a 100% type ii fe origin, whilethe mean sulphur ratio indicates a 100% type ia origin) that cannot bereconciled with the currently available yield tables.

(1998) using thehst/wfpc2. combined with cluster velocities corrected for a cosmological flowmodel, these distances imply a value of the hubble constant of h0 = 69 +/- 4(random) +/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result assumes that the cepheid plrelation is independent of the metallicity of the variable stars; adopting ametallicity correction as in kennicutt et al.

astro-ph;9910501	a database of cepheid distance moduli and trgb, gclf, pnlf and sbf data  useful for distance determinations	we present a compilation of cepheid distance moduli and data for foursecondary distance indicators that employ stars in the old stellar populations:the planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf), the globular clusterluminosity function (gclf), the tip of the red giant branch (trgb), and thesurface brightness fluctuation (sbf) method. the database includes all datapublished as of july 15, 1999. the main strength of this compilation resides inall data being on a consistent and homogeneous system: all cepheid distancesare derived using the same calibration of the period-luminosity relation, thetreatment of errors is consistent for all indicators, measurements which arenot considered reliable are excluded. as such, the database is ideal forinter-comparing any of the distance indicators considered, or for deriving acepheid calibration to any secondary distance indicator. specifically, thedatabase includes: 1) cepheid distances, extinctions and metallicities; 2)apparent magnitudes of the pnlf cutoff; 3) apparent magnitudes and colors ofthe turnover of the gclf (both in the v- and b-bands); 4) apparent magnitudesof the trgb (in the i-band) and v-i colors at and 0.5 magnitudes fainter thanthe trgb; 5) apparent surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes i, k', k_short,and using the f814w filter with the hst/wfpc2. in addition, for every galaxy inthe database we give reddening estimates from dirbe/iras as well as hi maps,j2000 coordinates, hubble and t-type morphological classification, apparenttotal magnitude in b, and systemic velocity.

astro-ph;9912333	has blending compromised cepheid-based determinations of the  extragalactic distance scale?	we examine the suggestion that half of the hst key project- andsandage/saha-observed galaxies have had their distances systematicallyunderestimated, by 0.1-0.3 mag in the distance modulus, due to theunderappreciated influence of stellar profile blending on the wfc chips. thesignature of such an effect would be a systematic trend in (i) the type iasupernovae corrected peak luminosity and (ii) the tully-fisher residuals, withincreasing calibrator distance, and (iii) a differential offset between pc andwfc distance moduli, within the same galaxy. the absence of a trend would beexpected if blending were negligible (as has been inherently assumed in theanalyses of the aforementioned teams). we adopt a functional form for thepredicted influence of blending that is consistent with the models of mochejskaet al. and stanek &amp; udalski, and demonstrate that the expected correlation withdistance predicted by these studies is not supported by the data. we concludethat the cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale has not been severelycompromised by the neglect of blending.

0811.3523	carbon and nitrogen abundances in early-type galaxies	for the first time, we undertake a systematic examination of the nitrogenabundances for a sample of 35 early-type galaxies spanning a range of massesand local environment. the nitrogen-sensitive molecular feature at 3360\aa hasbeen employed in conjunction with a suite of atomic- and molecular-sensitiveindices to provide unique and definitive constraints on the chemical content ofthese systems. by employing nh3360, we are now able to break the carbon,nitrogen, and oxygen degeneracies inherent to the use of the cn-index. wedemonstrate that the nh3360 feature shows little dependency upon the velocitydispersion (our proxy for mass) of the galaxies, contrary to what is seen forcarbon- and magnesium-sensitive indices. at face value, these results are atodds with conclusions drawn previously using indices sensitive to both carbonand nitrogen, such as cyanogen (cn). with the aid of stellar population models,we find that the n/fe ratios in these galaxies are consistent with beingmildly-enhanced with respect to the solar ratio. we also explore the dependenceof these findings upon environment, by analyzing the co-added spectra ofgalaxies in the field and the coma cluster. we confirm the previously founddifferences in carbon abundances between galaxies in low- and high-densityenvironments, while showing that these differences do not seem to exist fornitrogen. we discuss the implications of these findings for the derivation ofthe star formation histories in early-type galaxies, and for the origin ofcarbon and nitrogen, themselves.
