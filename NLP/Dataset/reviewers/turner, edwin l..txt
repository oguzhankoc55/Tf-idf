0902.3461	on the spin-orbit misalignment of the xo-3 exoplanetary system	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 feb. 2transit of the exoplanet xo-3b. the new data show that the planetary orbitalaxis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by hebrardand coworkers. we find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes tobe 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15deg. the significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there areindications of systematic effects. xo-3b is the first exoplanet known to have ahighly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, andas such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration ofmassive planets into close-in orbits. we revisit the statistical analysis ofspin-orbit alignment in hot-jupiter systems. assuming the stellar obliquitiesto be drawn from a single rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of thedistribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. however, it remains the case that a modelrepresenting two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawnfrom a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropicdistribution--is favored over a single rayleigh distribution.

0908.3948	will the large synoptic survey telescope detect extra-solar  planetesimals entering the solar system?	planetesimal formation is a common by-product of the star formation process.taking the dynamical history of the solar system as a guideline -- in which theplanetesimal belts were heavily depleted due to graviational perburbation withthe giant planets -- and assuming similar processes have take place in otherplanetary systems, one would expect the interestellar space to be filled withextra-solar planetesimals. however, not a single one of these objects has beendetected so far entering the solar system, even though it would clearly bedistinguishable from a solar system comet due to its highly hyperbolic orbit.the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) will provide wide coverage maps ofthe sky to a very high sensitivity, ideal to detect moving objects like comets,both active and inactive. in anticipation of these observations, we estimatehow many inactive "interstellar comets" might be detected during the durationof the survey. the calculation takes into account estimates (from observationsand models) of the number density of stars, the amount of solids available toform planetesimals, the frequency of planet and planetesimal formation, theefficiency of planetesimal ejection, and the possible size distribution ofthese small bodies.

1003.4738	the posterior distribution of sin(i) values for exoplanets with m_t  sin(i) determined from radial velocity data	radial velocity (rv) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value ofm_t sin(i) condition (i.e. give information about) not only the planet's truemass m_t but also the value of sin(i) (where i is the orbital inclinationangle). thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observedvalue of m_t sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a uniformdistribution between zero and unity (corresponding to an isotropic idistribution). the actual distribution from which it is drawn depends on theintrinsic distribution of m_t for the exoplanet population being studied. wegive a simple bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several"toy models" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of m_t. theresults show that the effect can be an important one. for example, even forsimple power-law distributions of m_t, the median value of sin(i) in anobserved rv sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 valuefor an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quiteplausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively. over the same range ofindicies, the 95% confidence upper bound on m_t ranges from 4.5 to 400 timeslarger than m_t sin(i), respectively, due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. morecomplex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of m_t yield still morecomplicated and less intuitive $sin(i)$ distributions. in particular, if them_t distribution contains any characteristic mass scale m_c, the sin(i)distribution will depend on the ratio of m_t sin(i) to $m_c$, often in anon-trivial way. our qualitative conclusion is that rv studies of exoplanets,both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)factor as more than a "numerical constant of order unity" with simple and wellunderstood statistical properties.

1006.5492	a comparison of spectroscopic methods for detecting starlight scattered  by transiting hot jupiters, with application to subaru data for hd 209458b  and hd 189733b	the measurement of the light scattered from extrasolar planets informsatmospheric and formation models. with the discovery of many hot jupiterplanets orbiting nearby stars, this motivates the development of robust methodsof characterisation from follow up observations. in this paper we discuss twomethods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems. first, themost widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot jupiters(collier cameron et al.) is investigated for application for typical echellespectra of a transiting planet system, showing that detection requires highsignal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets. secondly a new fourier analysismethod is also presented, which is model-independent and utilises the benefitsof the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems. thisapproach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in fourier spaceby least-squares. the sensitivities of the methods are determined via montecarlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes. we find the fourieranalysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observationsof a well constrained transiting system than the collier cameron et al. method.we apply the fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered bytransiting hot jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of hd209458 and hd 189733. unfortunately we are unable to improve on the previousupper limit of the planet-to-star flux for hd 209458b set by space-basedobservations. a 1{\sigma}upper limit on the planet-to-star flux of hd 189733bis measured in the wavelength range of 558.83-599.56 nm yielding {\epsilon} &lt;4.5 \times 10-4. improvement in the measurement of the upper limit of theplanet-to-star flux of this system, with ground-based capabilities, requiresdata with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and increased stability of thetelescope.

1007.0245	the posterior distribution of sin(i) for exoplanets with m_t sin(i)  determined from radial velocity data	radial velocity (rv) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value ofm_t sin(i) condition (ie. give information about) not only the planet's truemass m_t but also the value of sin(i) for that system (where i is the orbitalinclination angle). thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particularobserved value of m_t sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from adistribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e. the presumptiveprior distribution . rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawndepends on the intrinsic distribution of m_t for the exoplanet population beingstudied. we give a simple bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply itto several "toy models" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution ofm_t. the results show that the effect can be an important one. for example,even for simple power-law distributions of m_t, the median value of sin(i) inan observed rv sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices (alpha) of thepower-law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively. over the same range ofindicies, the 95% confidence interval on m_t varies from 1.002-4.566 (alpha =-2) to 1.13-94.34 (alpha = +1) times larger than m_t sin(i) due to sin(i)uncertainty alone. our qualitative conclusion is that rv studies of exoplanets,both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)factor as more than a "numerical constant of order unity" with simple and wellunderstood statistical properties. we argue that reports of m_t sin(i)determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the correspondingconfidence bounds on m_t at, say, the 95% level based on an explicitly statedassumed form of the true m_t distribution in order to more accurately reflectthe mass uncertainties associated with rv studies.

0704.2420	searching for earth analogues around the nearest stars: the disk  age-metallicity relation and the age distribution in the solar neighbourhood	the chemical composition of earth's atmosphere has undergone substantialevolution over the course of its history. it is possible, even likely, thatterrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;consequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an importantconsideration in designing surveys for earth-analogues. valenti &amp; fischer(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 fgk dwarfs in the solarneighbourhood. using the hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibratepotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars fromthe valenti-fischer dataset. unlike other recent investigations, our analysisshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeitwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. the mean metallicity increases from-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.supplementing the valenti-fischer measurements with literature data to give acomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby fgk dwarfs isbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of thegalactic disk. in striking contrast, most stars known to have planetarycompanions are younger than 5 gyrs; however, stars with planetary companionswithin 0.4 au have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating thatthose systems are stable on timescales of many gyrs. several of the older,lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/fe] ratios, implyingmembership of the thick disk. if the frequency of terrestrial planets is alsocorrelated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetarysystem is likely to be ~3 gyrs. we discuss the implications of this hypothesisin designing searches for earth analogues among the nearby stars.

1102.3625	colors of a second earth ii: effects of clouds on photometric  characterization of earth-like exoplanets	as a test-bed for future investigations of directly imaged terrestrialexoplanets, we present the recovery of the surface components of the earth frommulti-band diurnal light curves obtained with the epoxi spacecraft. we findthat the presence and longitudinal distribution of ocean, soil and vegetationare reasonably well reproduced by fitting the observed color variations with asimplified model composed of a priori known albedo spectra of ocean, soil,vegetation, snow and clouds. the effect of atmosphere, including clouds, onlight scattered from surface components is modeled using a radiative transfercode. the required noise levels for future observations of exoplanets are alsodetermined. our model-dependent approach allows us to infer the presence ofmajor elements of the planet (in the case of the earth, clouds and ocean) withobservations having s/n $\gtrsim 10$ in most cases and with high confidence ifs/n $\gtrsim 20$. in addition, s/n $\gtrsim 100$ enables us to detect thepresence of components other than ocean and clouds in a fairlymodel-independent way. degradation of our inversion procedure produced by cloudcover is also quantified. while cloud cover significantly dilutes the magnitudeof color variations compared to the cloudless case, the pattern of colorchanges remains. therefore, the possibility of investigating surface featuresthrough light curve fitting remains even for exoplanets with cloud coversimilar to the earth's.

1107.3835	bayesian analysis of the astrobiological implications of life's early  emergence on earth	life arose on earth sometime in the first few hundred million years after theyoung planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-basedorganisms on its surface. the early emergence of life on earth has been takenas evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting fromyoung-earth-like conditions. we revisit this argument quantitatively in abayesian statistical framework. by constructing a simple model of theprobability of abiogenesis, we calculate a bayesian estimate of its posteriorprobability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in earth's historyand that, billions of years later, curious creatures noted this fact andconsidered its implications. we find that, given only this very limitedempirical information, the choice of bayesian prior for the abiogenesisprobability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posteriorprobability. although terrestrial life's early emergence provides evidence thatlife might be common in the universe if early-earth-like conditions are, theevidence is inconclusive and indeed is consistent with an arbitrarily lowintrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors.finding a single case of life arising independently of our lineage (on earth,elsewhere in the solar system, or on an extrasolar planet) would provide muchstronger evidence that abiogenesis is not extremely rare in the universe.

1110.6181	detection technique for artificially-illuminated objects in the outer  solar system and beyond	existing and planned optical telescopes and surveys can detectartificially-illuminated objects comparable in total brightness to a majorterrestrial city out to the outskirts of the solar system. orbital parametersof kuiper belt objects (kbos) are routinely measured to exquisite precisions of&lt;10^{-3}. here we propose to measure the variation of the observed flux f fromsuch objects as a function of their changing orbital distances d.sunlight-illuminated objects will show a logarithmic slope alpha=(dlogf/dlogd)=-4 whereas artificially-illuminated objects should exhibit alpha=-2. plannedsurveys using the proposed lsst will provide superb data that would allowmeasurement of alpha for thousands of kbos. if objects with alpha=-2 are found,follow-up observations can measure their spectra to determine if they areilluminated by artificial lighting. the search can be extended beyond the solarsystem with future generations of telescopes on the ground and in space, whichwould be capable of detecting phase modulation due to very strong artificialillumination on the night-side of planets as they orbit their parent stars.

0711.2304	a technique for detecting starlight scattered from transiting extrasolar  planets with application to hd 209458b	we present a new technique for detecting scattered starlight from transiting,close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (cegps) that has the virtues ofsimplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. given a series ofstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goalis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative tothe component coming directly from the star. we use two complementarystrategies, both of which rely on the predictable doppler shifts of bothcomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and manyexposures. in the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrumthat are free of direct absorption lines and add them after doppler-shiftinginto the planetary frame. in the second strategy, we compare the distributionof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. bothstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled dopplershifts are applied to the spectral segments. as an illustrative test case, weapply our technique to spectra of hd 209458 taken when the planet was nearopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. thiscorresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase functionof a lambert sphere. although the result is not statistically significant, theachieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is basedare very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scatteredlight from transiting cegp systems.

1209.4418	on the direct imaging of tidally heated exomoons	we demonstrate the ability of existing and planned telescopes, on the groundand in space, to directly image tidally heated exomoons orbiting gas-giantexoplanets. tidally heated exomoons can plausibly be far more luminous thantheir host exoplanet and as much as 0.1% as bright as the system's stellarprimary if it is a low mass star. because emission from exomoons can be poweredby tidal forces, they can shine brightly at arbitrarily large separations fromthe system's stellar primary with temperatures of several hundreds degreeskelvin or even higher in extreme cases. furthermore, these high temperaturescan occur in systems that are billions of years old. tidally heated exomoonsmay thus be far easier targets for direct imaging studies than giant exoplanetswhich must be both young and at a large projected separation from their primaryto be accessible to current generation direct imaging studies. for example, the(warm) spitzer space telescope and the next generation of ground basedinstruments could detect an exomoon roughly the size of the earth at atemperature ~600k and a distance ~5 parsecs. future mid-infrared spacetelescopes, such as jwst and spica, will be capable of directly imaging tidallyheated exomoons around the nearest two dozen stars with brightness temperature&gt;300k and r&gt;1r_earth orbiting at &gt;12au from the primary star at a 5sigmaconfidence level in a 10,000 second integration. in addition it is possiblethat some of the exoplanets which have already been directly imaged areactually tidally heated exomoons or blends of such objects with hot youngplanets. if such exomoons exist and are sufficiently common (i.e. nearby), itmay well be far easier to directly image an exomoon with surface conditionsthat allow the existence of liquid water than it will be to resolve anearth-like planet in the classical habitable zone of its primary.

1212.6379	variability of water and oxygen absorption bands in the disk-integrated  spectra of the earth	we study the variability of major atmospheric absorption features in thedisk-integrated spectra of the earth with future application to earth-analogsin mind, concentrating on the diurnal timescale. we first analyze observationsof the earth provided by the epoxi mission, and find 5-20% fractional variationof the absorption depths of h2o and o2 bands, two molecules that have majorsignatures in the observed range. from a correlation analysis with the cloudmap data from the earth observing satellite (eos), we find that their variationpattern is primarily due to the uneven cloud cover distribution. in order toaccount for the observed variation quantitatively, we consider a simple opaquecloud model, which assumes that the clouds totally block the spectral influenceof the atmosphere below the cloud layer, equivalent to assuming that theincident light is completely scattered at the cloud top level. the model isreasonably successful, and reproduces the epoxi data from the pixel-level eoscloud/water vapor data. a difference in the diurnal variability patterns of h2oand o2 bands is ascribed to the differing vertical and horizontal distributionof those molecular species in the atmosphere. on the earth, the inhomogeneousdistribution of atmospheric water vapor is due to the existence of its exchangewith liquid and solid phases of h2o on the planet's surface on a timescaleshort compared to atmospheric mixing times. if such differences in variabilitypatterns were detected in spectra of earth-analogs, it would provide theinformation on the inhomogeneous composition of their atmospheres.

1306.0581	the seeds direct imaging survey for planets and scattered dust emission  in debris disk systems	debris disks around young main-sequence stars often have gaps and cavitieswhich for a long time have been interpreted as possibly being caused byplanets. in recent years, several giant planet discoveries have been made insystems hosting disks of precisely this nature, further implying thatinteractions with planets could be a common cause of such disk structures. aspart of the seeds high-contrast imaging survey, we are surveying a populationof debris disk-hosting stars with gaps and cavities implied by their spectralenergy distributions, in order to attempt to spatially resolve the disk as wellas to detect any planets that may be responsible for the disk structure. herewe report on intermediate results from this survey. five debris disks have beenspatially resolved, and a number of faint point sources have been discovered,most of which have been tested for common proper motion, which in each case hasexcluded physical companionship with the target stars. from the detectionlimits of the 50 targets that have been observed, we find that beta pic b-likeplanets (~10 mjup planets around g--a-type stars) near the gap edges are lessfrequent than 15--30%, implying that if giant planets are the dominant cause ofthese wide (27 au on average) gaps, they are generally less massive than betapic b.

1404.2552	the exoplanet orbital eccentricity - multiplicity relation and the solar  system	the known population of exoplanets exhibits a much wider range of orbitaleccentricities than solar system planets and has a much higher averageeccentricity. these facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that thesolar system is an atypical member of the overall population of planetarysystems. we report here on a strong anti-correlation of orbital eccentricitywith multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among catalogued radialvelocity (rv) systems. the mean, median and rough distribution ofeccentricities of solar system planets fits an extrapolation of thisanti-correlation to the eight planet case rather precisely despite the factthat no more than 2 solar system planets would be detectable with rv datacomparable to that in the exoplanet sample. moreover, even if regarded as asingle or double planetary system, the solar system lies in a reasonablyheavily populated region of eccentricity-multiplicity space. thus, the solarsystem is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect toeccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. specifically, asthe multiplicity of a system increases the eccentricity decreases roughly as apower law of index -1.20. a simple and plausible but ad hoc and model-dependentinterpretation of this relationship implies that approximately 80% of the oneplanet and 25% of the two planet systems in our sample have additional, as yetundiscovered, members but that systems of higher observed multiplicity arelargely complete (i.e., relatively rarely contain additional undiscoveredplanets). if low eccentricities indeed favor high multiplicities, habitabilitymay be more common in systems with a larger number of planets.

1404.5335	a statistical analysis of seeds and other high-contrast exoplanet  surveys: massive planets or low-mass brown dwarfs?	we conduct a statistical analysis of a combined sample of direct imagingdata, totalling nearly 250 stars. the stars cover a wide range of ages andspectral types, and include five detections ($\kappa$ and b, two $\sim$60m$_{\rm j}$ brown dwarf companions in the pleiades, pz tel b, and cd$-$352722b). for some analyses we add a currently unpublished set of seedsobservations, including the detections gj 504b and gj 758b. we conduct auniform, bayesian analysis of all stellar ages using both membership in akinematic moving group and activity/rotation age indicators. we then present anew statistical method for computing the likelihood of a substellardistribution function. by performing most of the integrals analytically, weachieve an enormous speedup over brute-force monte carlo. we use this method toplace upper limits on the maximum semimajor axis of the distribution functionderived from radial-velocity planets, finding model-dependent values of$\sim$30--100 au. finally, we model the entire substellar sample, from massivebrown dwarfs to a theoretically motivated cutoff at $\sim$5 m$_{\rm jup}$, witha single power law distribution. we find that $p(m, a) \propto m^{-0.65\pm0.60}a^{-0.85\pm0.39}$ (1$\sigma$ errors) provides an adequate fit to our data, with1.0--3.1\% (68\% confidence) of stars hosting 5--70 $m_{\rm jup}$ companionsbetween 10 and 100 au. this suggests that many of the directly imagedexoplanets known, including most (if not all) of the low-mass companions in oursample, formed by fragmentation in a cloud or disk, and represent the low-masstail of the brown dwarfs.

1409.1390	surface geometry of protoplanetary disks inferred from near-infrared  imaging polarimetry	we present a new method of analysis for determining the surface geometry offive protoplanetary disks observed with near-infrared imaging polarimetry usingsubaru-hiciao. using as inputs the observed distribution of polarized intensity(pi), disk inclination, assumed properties for dust scattering, and otherreasonable approximations, we calculate a differential equation to derive thesurface geometry. this equation is numerically integrated along the distancefrom the star at a given position angle. we show that, using theseapproximations, the local maxima in the pi distribution of spiral arms (sao206462, mwc 758) and rings (2mass j16042165-2130284, pds 70) are associatedwith local concave-up structures on the disk surface. we also show that theobserved presence of an inner gap in scattered light still allows thepossibility of a disk surface that is parallel to the light path from the star,or a disk that is shadowed by structures in the inner radii. our analysis forrings does not show the presence of a vertical inner wall as often assumed instudies of disks with an inner gap. finally, we summarize the implications ofspiral and ring structures as potential signatures of ongoing planet formation.

1409.8386	indications of m-dwarf deficits in the halo and thick disk of the galaxy	we compared the number of faint stars detected in deep survey fields with thecurrent stellar distribution model of the galaxy and found that the detectednumber in the h band is significantly smaller than the predicted number. thisindicates that m-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and thethick disk. we used archived data of several surveys in both the north andsouth field of goods (great observatories origins deep survey), mods ingoods-n, and ers and candels in goods-s. the number density of m-dwarfs in thehalo has to be 20+/-13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order forthe detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the h band to match withthe predicted value from the model. in the thick disk, the number density ofm-dwarfs must be reduced (52+/-13%) or the scale height must be decreased (~600pc). alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can besignificantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainlyconsists of faint m-dwarfs. our results imply that the m-dwarf population inregions distant from the galactic plane is significantly smaller thanpreviously thought. we then discussed the implications this has on thesuitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faintstars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fit numberdensities.

1502.07090	viscoelastic models of tidally heated exomoons	tidal heating of exomoons may play a key role in their habitability, sincethe elevated temperature can melt the ice on the body even without significantsolar radiation. the possibility of life is intensely studied on solar systemmoons such as europa or enceladus, where the surface ice layer covers tidallyheated water ocean. tidal forces may be even stronger in extrasolar systems,depending on the properties of the moon and its orbit. for studying the tidallyheated surface temperature of exomoons, we used a viscoelastic model for thefirst time. this model is more realistic than the widely used, so-called fixedq models, because it takes into account the temperature dependency of the tidalheat flux, and the melting of the inner material. with the use of this model weintroduced the circumplanetary tidal temperate zone (ttz), that stronglydepends on the orbital period of the moon, and less on its radius. we comparedthe results with the fixed q model and investigated the statistical volume ofthe ttz using both models. we have found that the viscoelastic model predicts2.8 times more exomoons in the ttz with orbital periods between 0.1 and 3.5days than the fixed q model for plausible distributions of physical and orbitalparameters. the viscoelastic model gives more promising results in terms ofhabitability, because the inner melting of the body moderates the surfacetemperature, acting like a thermostat.

1507.03014	near-ir polarized scattered light imagery of the doar 28 transitional  disk	we present the first spatially resolved polarized scattered light h-banddetection of the doar 28 transitional disk. our two epochs of imagery detectthe scattered light disk from our effective inner working angle of 0.10" (13au) out to 0.50" (65 au). this inner working angle is interior to the locationof the system's gap inferred by previous studies using sed modeling (15 au). wedetected a candidate point source companion 1.08" northwest of the system;however, our second epoch of imagery strongly suggests that this object is abackground star. we constructed a grid of monte carlo radiative transfer modelsof the system, and our best fit models utilize a modestly inclined (50 deg),0.01 msun disk that has a partially depleted inner gap from the dustsublimation radius out to ~8 au. subtracting this best fit, axi-symmetric modelfrom our polarized intensity data reveals evidence for two small asymmetries inthe disk, which could be attributable to variety of mechanisms.

0806.0032	on the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets from radial velocity  surveys	we investigate the estimation of orbital parameters by least-$\chi^2$keplerian fits to radial velocity (rv) data using synthetic data sets. we findthat while the fitted period is fairly accurate, the best-fit eccentricity and$m_p\sin i$ are systematically biased upward from the true values for lowsignal-to-noise ratio $k/\sigma\lesssim 3$ and moderate number of observations$n_{\rm obs}\lesssim 60$, leading to a suppression of the number of nearlycircular orbits. assuming intrinsic distributions of orbital parameters, wegenerate a large number of mock rv data sets and study the selection effect onthe eccentricity distribution. we find the overall detection efficiency onlymildly decreases with eccentricity. this is because although high eccentricityorbits are more difficult to sample, they also have larger rv amplitudes forfixed planet mass and orbital semi-major axis. thus the primary source ofuncertainties in the eccentricity distribution comes from biases in keplerianfits to detections with low-amplitude and/or small $n_{\rm obs}$, rather thanfrom selection effects. our results suggest that the abundance oflow-eccentricity exoplanets may be underestimated in the current sample and weurge caution in interpreting the eccentricity distributions of low-amplitudedetections in future rv samples.

astro-ph;0106099	empirical constraints on alternative gravity theories from gravitational  lensing	if it is hypothesised that there is no dark matter then some alternativegravitational theory must take the place of general relativity (gr) on thelargest scales. dynamical measurements can be used to investigate the nature ofsuch a theory, but only where there is visible matter. gravitational lensing ispotentially a more powerful probe as it can be used to measure deflections farfrom the deflector, and, for sufficiently large separations, allow it to betreated as a point-mass. microlensing within the local group does not yetprovide any interesting constraints, as only images formed close to thedeflectors are appreciably magnified, but stacking of multiple light-curves andobservations of microlensing on cosmological scales may be able to discriminatebetween gr and non-dark matter theories. galaxy-galaxy lensing is likely to bean even more powerful probe of gravity, with the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) commissioning data used here to constrain the deflection law of galaxiesto be a(r) propto r^(0.1 +/- 0.1) for impact parameters in the range 50 kpc &lt; r&lt; 1 mpc. together with observations of flat rotation curves, these resultsimply that, in any gravitational theory, photons must experience (close to)twice the deflection of massive particles moving at the speed of light (atleast on these physical scales). the full sdss data-set will also be sensitiveto asymmetry in the lensing signal and variation of the deflection law withgalaxy type. a detection of either of these effects would represent anindependent confirmation that galaxies are dark matter-dominated; converselyazimuthal symmetry of the shear signal would rule out the typically ellipsoidalhaloes predicted by most simulations of structure formation.

astro-ph;0106100	gravitational lensing in modified newtonian dynamics	modified newtonian dynamics (mond) is an alternative theory of gravity thataims to explain large-scale dynamics without recourse to any form of darkmatter. however the theory is incomplete, lacking a relativistic counterpart,and so makes no definite predictions about gravitational lensing. the mostobvious form that mondian lensing might take is that photons experience twicethe deflection of massive particles moving at the speed of light, as in generalrelativity (gr). in such a theory there is no general thin-lens approximation(although one can be made for spherically-symmetric deflectors), but thethree-dimensional acceleration of photons is in the same direction as therelativistic acceleration would be. in regimes where the deflector canreasonably be approximated as a single point-mass (specifically low-opticaldepth microlensing and weak galaxy-galaxy lensing), this naive formulation isconsistent with observations. forthcoming galaxy-galaxy lensing data and thepossibility of cosmological microlensing have the potential to distinguishunambiguously between gr and mond. some tests can also be performed withextended deflectors, for example by using surface brightness measurements oflens galaxies to model quasar lenses, although the breakdown of the thin-lensapproximation allows an extra degree of freedom. nonetheless, it seems unlikelythat simple ellipsoidal galaxies can explain both constraints. further, thelow-density universe implied by mond must be completely dominated by thecosmological constant (to fit microwave background observations), and suchmodels are at odds with the low frequency of quasar lenses. these conflictsmight be resolved by a fully consistent relativistic extension to mond; thealternative is that mond is not an accurate description of the universe.

astro-ph;0112119	strong gravitational lensing time delay statistics and the density  profile of dark halos	the distribution of differential time delays \delta t between images producedby strong gravitational lensing contains information on the mass distributionsin the lensing objects as well as on cosmological parameters such as h_0. wederive an explicit expression for the conditional probability distributionfunction of time delays p(\delta t|\theta), given an image separation betweenmultiple images \theta, and related statistics. we consider lensing halosdescribed by the singular isothermal sphere (sis) approximation and by itsgeneralization as proposed by navarro, frenk, &amp; white (nfw) which has a densityprofile \rho \propto r^{-\alpha} in the innermost region. the time delaydistribution is very sensitive to these profiles; steeper inner slopes tend toproduce larger time delays. for example, if h_0=70 km/s/mpc, a\lambda-dominated cosmology and a source redshift z_s=1.27 are assumed, lenseswith \theta=5'' produce a time delay of \delta t[yr]=1.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9},0.39^{+0.37}_{-0.22}, 0.15^{+0.11}_{-0.09}, and 0.071^{+0.054}_{-0.038} (50%confidence interval), for sis, generalized nfw with \alpha=1.5, \alpha=1.0, and\alpha=0.5, respectively. at a fixed image separation, the time delay isdetermined by the difference in the lensing potential between the position ofthe two images, which typically occur at different impact parameters. althoughthe values of \delta t are proportional to the inverse of h_0, p(\deltat|\theta) is rather insensitive to all other cosmological model parameters,source redshifts, magnification biases and so on. a knowledge of p(\deltat|\theta) will also be useful in designing the observing program of futurelarge scale synoptic variability surveys and for evaluating possible selectionbiases operating against large splitting lens systems.

astro-ph;0210107	gravitational lensing magnification and time delay statistics for  distant supernovae	strong gravitational lensing of distant supernovae (sne), particularly typeia's, has some exploitable properties not available when other sorts ofcosmologically distant sources are lensed. one such property is that the``standard candle'' nature of the sn at peak brightness allows a directdetermination of the lensing magnification factor for each well observed image.another is that the duration of an sn event is of the same order as thedifferential time delays between the various lens images. the comparable timescales of the photometric event and the time delay invite a variety ofapplications, including high precision measurements of the delay and thetargeting of especially interesting phases of the explosion for intensiveobservation when they appear in trailing images. as an initial exploration ofthese possibilities we present calculations of sn lensing statistics in a``concordance cosmology''. we emphasize magnification and time delay effects.plausible sn surveys, such as the proposed snap space mission, would discoverseveral to some tens of strongly lensed sne ia per year, and at least a few ofthese will be at redshifts well beyond those that would be accessible viaunlensed events. the total number of such anomalously high redshift sne ia willbe a useful test of high redshift star formation models. sn surveys of finiteduration will, of course, miss the appearance of some images; we quantify thisselection bias. finally, we investigate how well the appearance of trailingimages can be predicted based on various amounts of available information onthe lensing event. knowledge of the magnification factor for the leading imagemakes it possible to predict the appearance of a trailing image relativelyaccurately if the lens redshift is also known.

astro-ph;0503302	vegetation's red edge: a possible spectroscopic biosignature of  extraterrestrial plants	earth's deciduous plants have a sharp order-of-magnitude increase in leafreflectance between approximately 700 and 750 nm wavelength. this strongreflectance of earth's vegetation suggests that surface biosignatures withsharp spectral features might be detectable in the spectrum of scattered lightfrom a spatially unresolved extrasolar terrestrial planet. we assess thepotential of earth's step-function-like spectroscopic feature, referred to asthe "red edge", as a tool for astrobiology. we review the basic characteristicsand physical origin of the red edge and summarize its use in astronomy: earlyspectroscopic efforts to search for vegetation on mars and recent reports ofdetection of the red edge in the spectrum of earthshine (i.e., the spatiallyintegrated scattered light spectrum of earth). we present earthshineobservations from apache point observatory to emphasize that time variabilityis key to detecting weak surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge.we briefly discuss the evolutionary advantages of vegetation's red edgereflectance, and speculate that while extraterrestrial "light harvestingorganisms" have no compelling reason to display the exact same red edge featureas terrestrial vegetation, they might have similar spectroscopic features atdifferent wavelengths than terrestrial vegetation. this implies that futureterrestrial-planet-characterizing space missions should obtain data that allowtime-varying, sharp spectral features at unknown wavelengths to be identified.we caution that some mineral reflectance edges are similar in slope andstrength to vegetation's red edge (albeit at different wavelengths); if anextrasolar planet reflectance edge is detected care must be taken with itsinterpretation.

astro-ph;0504540	subaru hds transmission spectroscopy of the transiting extrasolar planet  hd 209458b	we have searched for absorption in several common atomic species due to theatmosphere or exosphere of the transiting extrasolar planet hd 209458b, usinghigh precision optical spectra obtained with the subaru high dispersionspectrograph (hds). previously we reported an upper limit on h alpha absorptionof 0.1% (3 sigma) within a 5.1\aa band. using the same procedure, we now reportupper limits on absorption due to the optical transitions of na d, li, h alpha,h beta, h gamma, fe, and ca. the 3 sigma upper limit for each transition isapproximately 1% within a 0.3\aa band (the core of the line), and a few tenthsof a per cent within a 2\aa band (the full line width). the wide-band resultsare close to the expected limit due to photon-counting (poisson) statistics,although in the narrow-band case we have encountered unexplained systematicerrors at a few times the poisson level. these results are consistent with allpreviously reported detections and upper limits, but are significantly moresensitive.

astro-ph;0504555	measurement of spin-orbit alignment in an extrasolar planetary system	we determine the stellar, planetary, and orbital properties of the transitingplanetary system hd 209458, through a joint analysis of high-precision radialvelocities, photometry, and timing of the secondary eclipse. of primaryinterest is the strong detection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, thealteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occultspart of the rotating surface of the star. we develop a new technique formodeling this effect, and use it to determine the inclination of the planetaryorbit relative to the apparent stellar equator [lambda = (-4.4 +/- 1.4)degrees], and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star [v*sin(i) = (4.70+/- 0.16) km/s]. the uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by anorder of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by queloz andcollaborators. the small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of theplanet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidalcoplanarization is larger than the age of the star. our determination ofv*sin(i) is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolatedfrom other broadening mechanisms.

astro-ph;0509389	near-infrared photometric monitoring of a pre-main-sequence object kh  15d	an extensive photometric monitoring of kh 15d, an enigmatic variable in theyoung star cluster ngc 2264, has been conducted. simultaneous and accuratenear-infrared (jhks-bands) photometry is presented between 2003 december and2005 march covering most of the variable phase. the infrared variability ischaracterized by large-amplitude and long-lasting eclipse, as observed atoptical. the period of variability is 48.3 +/- 0.2 days, the maximumphotometric amplitude of variability is ~4.2 mag, and the eclipse duration is\~0.5 in phase units. these are consistent with the most recent period,amplitude, and duration at optical. the blueing of the j-h color (~0.16 mag)during the eclipse, which has been suggested before, is unambiguouslyconfirmed; a similar blueing at h-ks is less clear but is probably present at asimilar level. the overall shape of the jhks light curves is very similar tothe optical one, including a fair time-symmetry and a less stable flux duringthe eclipse with a slight hump near the zero phase. most of these variabilityfeatures of kh 15d observed at near-infrared wavelengths can be explained withthe recent model employing an eclipse by the inclined, precessing disk and anouter scattering region around a pre-main-sequence binary.

astro-ph;0605571	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. i. candidate selection  algorithm	we present an algorithm for selecting an uniform sample of gravitationallylensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2) quasars brighter thani=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the sdss. our algorithmuses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small-and large-separation lenses, respectively. our selection algorithm only relieson parameters that the sdss standard image processing pipeline generates,allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. the algorithm has beentested against simulated sdss images, which adopt distributions of field andquasar parameters taken from the real sdss data as input. furthermore, we takedifferential reddening into account. we find that our selection algorithm isalmost complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5. thealgorithm selects both double and quadruple lenses. at a separation of 2'',doubles and quads are selected with similar completeness, and above (below) 2''the selection of quads is better (worse) than for doubles. our morphologicalselection identifies a non-negligible fraction of single quasars: to removethese we fit images of candidates with a model of two point sources and rejectthose with unusually small image separations and/or large magnitude differencesbetween the two point sources. we estimate the efficiency of our selectionalgorithm to be at least 8% at image separations smaller than 2'', comparableto that of radio surveys. the efficiency declines as the image separationincreases, because of larger contamination from stars. we also present themagnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation,which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.

astro-ph;0607098	the effect of fir emission from sdss galaxies on the sfd galactic  extinction map	we compare the most successful and widely used map of galactic dustextinction, provided by schlegel, finkbeiner &amp; davis (1998; hereafter sfd), tothe galaxy number counts in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)photometric/spectroscopic dr4 sample. we divide the sdss survey area into 69disjoint subregions according to the dust extinction provided by sfd andcompare the surface number density of galaxies in each subregion. as expected,the galaxy surface number density decreases with increasing extinction but onlyfor sfd extinction values above about 0.1 to 0.2 magnitudes (depending on theband). at lower values of the sfd extinction, we find that the sky surfacedensity of galaxies increases with increasing extinction, precisely theopposite of the effect expected from galactic dust. we suggest that the farinfrared (fir) brightness of the sky in regions of true low dust extinction issignificantly ``contaminated'' by the fir emission from background galaxies. weshow that such an explanation is both qualitatively and quantitativelyconsistent with the available data. based on this interpretation we concludethat systematic errors in the sfd extinction map due to extragalactic firemission are quite small, of order hundredths of a magnitude, but neverthelessstatistically detectable.

astro-ph;9405014	galaxy mergers and gravitational lens statistics	we investigate the impact of hierarchical galaxy merging on the statistics ofgravitational lensing of distant sources. since no definite theoreticalpredictions for the merging history of luminous galaxies exist, we adopt aparametrized prescription, which allows us to adjust the expected number ofpieces comprising a typical present galaxy at z=0.65. the existence of globalparameter relations for elliptical galaxies and constraints on the evolution ofthe phase space density in dissipationless mergers, allow us to limit thepossible evolution of galaxy lens properties under merging.  we draw two lessons from implementing this lens evolution into statisticallens calculations: (1) the total optical depth to multiple imaging (e.g. ofquasars) is quite insensitive to merging. (2) merging leads to a smaller meanseparation of observed multiple images. because merging does not reducedrastically the expected lensing frequency it cannot make $\lambda$-dominatedcosmologies compatible with the existing lensing observations. a comparisonwith the data from the hst snapshot survey shows that models with little or noevolution of the lens population are statistically favored over strong mergingscenarios. the specific merging scenario proposed by toomre (1977) can berejected (95\% level) by such a comparison. some versions of the scenarioproposed by broadhurst, ellis \&amp; glazebrook (1992), are statisticallyacceptable.

astro-ph;9610162	a robust determination of the time delay in 0957+561a,b and a  measurement of the global value of hubble's constant	photometric monitoring of the gravitational lens system 0957+561a,b in the gand r bands with the apache point observatory (apo) 3.5 m telescope during 1996shows a sharp g band event in the trailing (b) image light curve at the precisetime predicted from the observation of an event during 1995 in the leading (a)image with a delay of 415 days. this success confirms the "short delay," andthe lack of any feature at a delay near 540 days rejects the "long delay" forthis system, resolving a long-standing controversy. a series of statisticalanalyses of our light curve data yield a best fit delay of 417 +/- 3 days (95%confidence interval). recent improvements in the modeling of the lens system(consisting of a galaxy and cluster) allow us to derive a value of the global(at z = 0.36) value of hubble's constant h_0 using refsdal's method, a simpleand direct distance determination based on securely understood physics andgeometry. the result is h_0 = 63 +/- 12 km/s/mpc (for omega = 1) where this 95%confidence interval is dominated by remaining lens model uncertainties.

astro-ph;9610233	through a lens darkly: evidence for dusty gravitational lenses	foreground galaxies that amplify the light from background quasars may alsodim that light if the galaxies contain enough dust. extinction by dust inlenses could hide the large number of lensed systems predicted for a flatuniverse with a large value of the cosmological constant $\lambda$. we look forone signature of dust, namely reddening, by examining optical-infrared colorsof gravitationally lensed images of quasars. we find that the lensed systemsidentified in radio and infrared searches have redder optical-ir colors thanoptically selected ones. this could be due to a bias against selecting reddened(hence extincted) quasars in the optical surveys, or due to the differences inthe intrinsic colors of optical and radio quasars. comparison of theradio-selected lensed and unlensed quasars shows that the lensed ones haveredder colors. we therefore conclude that at least part of the color differencebetween the two lens samples is due to dust.  from the color difference between lensed and unlensed radio quasars (andassuming galactic extinction law) we can reconcile a large cosmologicalconstant ($\lambda=0.9$) with the number of lensed systems observed in fluxlimited optical surveys. these results substantially weaken the strongestconstraint on cosmological scenarios that invoke a non-zero cosmologicalconstant to explain age discrepancy problems, satisfy predictions ofinflationary models of the early universe and play a role in large scalestructure formation models. they also raise the prospect of using gravitationallenses to study the interstellar medium in high redshift galaxies.

astro-ph;9708014	implications of cosmic microwave background anisotropies for large scale  variations in hubble's constant	low amplitude (linear regime) cosmic density fluctuations lead to spatialvariations in the locally measurable value of $h_0$ (denoted as $h_l$),$\delta_h \equiv (h_l-h_0)/h_0$, which are of order 3-6% (95% confidenceinterval) in a sphere of 200$ h^{-1}$mpc in diameter, and of order 1-2% in asphere of 400$ h^{-1}$mpc in diameter, for three currently viable structureformation models (tilted cdm, $\lambda$cdm, and open cdm) as normalized by the4 year cobe dmr data. however, the true matter distribution power spectrum maydiffer from any of the currently viable models. for example, it may containsharp features which have escaped detection so far. the measured cmb dipolevelocity (the galaxy's peculiar velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame)provides additional constraints on the probability distribution of $\delta_h$that supplement our limited knowledge of the power spectrum. for a matter powerspectrum which consists of the smooth power spectrum of a viable cosmologicalmodel plus a delta-function bump, we find that given the cmb dipole velocity,the 95% cl upper limit of $|\delta_h|$ increases approximately by a factor oftwo, but the probability distribution of $\delta_h$ is non-gaussian, withincreased probability at small $\delta_h$ compared to gaussian. abandoningmodel power spectra entirely, we find that the observed cmb dipole velocityalone provides a very robust limit, $\sqrt{&lt; \delta_h^2 &gt;_r} &lt;10.5h^{-1}{mpc}/r$ at 95% cl, in a sphere of radius $r$, for an arbitrary powerspectrum. thus, variations between currently available local measures of $h_0$and its true global value of a few to several percent are to be expected anddifferences as large as 10% are possible based on our current knowledge of thecmb anisotropies.

astro-ph;9802352	the near-infrared galaxy counts anomaly: local underdensity or strong  evolution?	we analyze bright-end (k = 10 -17) galaxy counts from a number ofnear-infrared galaxy surveys. all studies available as of mid-1997, consideredindividually or collectively, show that the observed near-infrared galaxynumber counts at low magnitudes are inconsistent with a simple no-evolutionmodel. we examine evolutionary effects and a local underdensity model aspossible causes of this effect. we find that the data are fit by either afactor of 1.7 - 2.4 deficiency of galaxies out to a redshift of z = 0.10 -0.23, depending on the k corrections and evolution (e-) corrections used andthe adopted values of the schechter luminosity function parameters, or byunexpectedly strong low redshift evolution in the k-band, leading to(e+k)-corrections at z= 0.5 that are as much as 60% larger than acceptedvalues. the former possibility would imply that the local expansion rate onscales of several hundred mpc exceeds the global value of h_0 by up to 30% andthat the amplitude of very large scale density fluctuations is far larger thanexpected in any current cosmogonic scenario. the latter possibility would meanthat even the apparently most secure aspects of our understanding of galaxyevolution and spectral energy distributions are seriously flawed.

astro-ph;9804195	a catalog of color-based redshift estimates for z &lt;~ 4 galaxies in the  hubble deep field	we derive simple empirical color-redshift relations for $z\la 4$ galaxies inthe hubble deep field (hdf) using a linear function of three photometric colors($u-b$, $b-v$, $v-i$). the dispersion between the estimated redshifts and thespectroscopically observed ones is small for relations derived in severalseparate color regimes; the dispersions range from $\sigma_z\simeq 0.03$ to 0.1for $z\la 2$ galaxies, and from $\sigma_z\simeq 0.14$ to 0.25 for $z\ga 2 $galaxies. we apply the color-redshift relations to the hdf photometric catalogand obtain estimated redshifts that are consistent with those derived fromspectral template fitting methods. the advantage of these color-redshiftrelations is that they are simple and easy to use and do not depend on theassumption of any particular spectral templates; they provide model independentredshift estimates for $z\la 4$ galaxies using only multi-band photometry, andthey apply to about 90% of all galaxies. we provide a color-based estimatedredshift catalog of hdf galaxies to $z\la 4$. we use the estimated redshifts toinvestigate the redshift distribution of galaxies in the hdf; we find peaks inthe redshift distribution that suggest large-scale clustering of galaxies to atleast $z\sim 1$ and that are consistent with those identified in spectroscopicprobes of the hdf.

astro-ph;9804251	an x-ray microlensing test of au-scale accretion disk structure in  q2237+0305	the innermost regions of quasars can be resolved by a gravitational-lens{\lq}telescope{\rq} on scales down to a few au. for the purpose, x-rayobservations are most preferable, because x-rays originating from the innermostregions, can be selectively amplified by microlensing due to the so-called`caustic crossing'. if detected, x-ray variations will constrain the size ofthe x-ray emitting region down to a few au. the maximum attainable resolutiondepends mainly on the monitoring intervals of lens events, which should be muchshorter than the crossing time. on the basis of this idea, we performenumerical simulations of microlensing of an optically-thick, standard-type diskas well as an optically-thin, advection-dominated accretion flow (adaf).calculated spectral variations and light curves show distinct behaviors,depending on the photon energy. x-ray radiation which is produced in opticallythin region, exhibits intensity variation over a few tens of days. in contrast,optical-uv fluxes, which are likely to come from optically thick region,exhibit more gradual light changes, which is consistent with the microlensingevents so far observed in q2237+0305.  currently, q2237+0305 is being monitored in the optical range at apache pointobservatory. simultaneous multi-wavelength observations by x-ray sattelites(e.g., asca, axaf, xmm) as well as hst at the moment of a microlens eventenable us to reveal an au scale structure of the central accretion disk aroundblack hole.
