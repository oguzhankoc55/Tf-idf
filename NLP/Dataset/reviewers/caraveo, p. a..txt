0706.3194	phase resolved spectroscopy of the vela pulsar with xmm-newton	the ~10^4 y old vela pulsar represents the bridge between the young crab-likeand the middle-aged rotation powered pulsars. its multiwavelength behaviour isdue to the superposition of different spectral components. we take advantage ofthe unprecedented harvest of photons collected by xmm-newton to assess the velapulsar spectral shape and to study the pulsar spectrum as a function of itsrotational phase. as for the middle-aged pulsars geminga, psr b0656+14 and psrb1055-52 (the "three musketeers"), the phase-integrated spectrum of vela iswell described by a three-component model, consisting of two blackbodies(t_bb1=(1.06+/-0.03)x10^6 k, r_bb1=5.1+/-0.3 km, t_bb2=(2.16+/-0.06)x10^6 k,r_bb2=0.73+/-0.08 km) plus a power-law (gamma=2.2+/-0.3). the relativecontributions of the three components are seen to vary as a function of thepulsar rotational phase. the two blackbodies have a shallow 7-9% modulation.the cooler blackbody, possibly related to the bulk of the neutron star surface,has a complex modulation, with two peaks per period, separated by ~0.35 inphase, the radio pulse occurring exactly in between. the hotter blackbody,possibly originating from a hot polar region, has a nearly sinusoidalmodulation, with a single, broad maximum aligned with the second peak of thecooler blackbody, trailing the radio pulse by ~0.15 in phase. the non thermalcomponent, magnetospheric in origin, is present only during 20% of the pulsarphase and appears to be opposite to the radio pulse. xmm-newton phase-resolvedspectroscopy unveils the link between the thermally emitting surface of theneutron star and its charge-filled magnetosphere, probing emission geometry asa function of the pulsar rotation. this is a fundamental piece of informationfor future 3-dimensional modeling of the pulsar magnetosphere.

0904.3825	a deep xmm-newton serendipitous survey of a middle-latitude area. ii.  new deeper x-ray and optical observations	the radio-quiet neutron star 1e1207.4-5209 has been the target of severalxmm-newton observations, with a total exposure of ~350 ks. the source islocated at intermediate galactic latitude (b~10 degrees), i.e. in a sky regionwith an extremely interesting mix of both galactic and extra-galactic x-raysources. the aim of our work is to investigate the properties of both theintermediate-latitude galactic and extra-galactic x-ray source populations inthe 1e1207.4-5209 field. we performed a coherent analysis of the wholexmm-newton observation data set to build a catalogue of serendipitous x-raysources detected with high confidence and to derive information on the sourceflux, spectra, and time variability. in addition, we performed a completemulti-band (ubvri) optical coverage of the field with the wide field imager(wfi) of the eso/mpg 2.2m telescope (la silla) to search for candidate opticalcounterparts to the x-ray sources, down to a v-band limiting magnitude of~24.5. we detected a total of 144 serendipitous x-ray sources. thanks to therefined x-ray positions and to the wfi observations, we found candidate opticalcounterparts for most of the x-ray sources in our compilation. for most of thebrightest ones we proposed a likely classification based on both the x-rayspectra and the optical colours. our results indicate that at intermediategalactic latitude the x-ray source population is dominated by theextra-galactic component, but with a significant contribution from the galacticcomponent in the soft energy band, below 2 kev.

0904.4776	deep optical observations of the central x-ray source in the puppis a  supernova remnant	x-ray observations reveiled a group of radio-silent isolated neutron stars(inss) at the centre of young supernova remnants (snrs), dubbed central compactobjects or ccos, with properties different from those of classicalrotation-powered pulsars. in at least three cases, evidence points towards ccosbeing low-magnetized inss, born with slow rotation periods, and possiblyaccreting from a debris disc of material formed out of the supernova event.understanding the origin of the diversity of the ccos can shed light onsupernova explosion and neutron star formation models. optical/infrared (ir)observations are crucial to test different cco interpretations. the aim of ourwork is to perform a deep optical investigation of the cco rx j0822.0-4300 inthe puppis a snr, one of the most poorly understood in the cco family. by usingas a reference the chandra x-ray coordinates of rx j0822.0-4300, we performeddeep optical observations in the b, v and i bands with the very large telescope(vlt). we found no candidate optical counterpart within 3 sigma of the computedchandra x-ray position down to 5 sigma limits of b~27.2, v~26.9, and i~25.6,the deepest obtained in the optical band for this source. these limits confirmthe non-detection of a companion brighter than an m5 dwarf. at the same time,they do not constrain optical emission from the neutron star surface, whileemission from the magnetosphere would require a spectral break in theoptical/ir.

0707.0937	vlt observations of the central compact object in the vela jr. supernova  remnant	x-ray observations have unveiled the existence of enigmatic point-likesources at the center of young (a few kyrs) supernova remnants. these sources,known as central compact objects (ccos), are thought to be neutron starsproduced by the supernova explosion, although their x-ray phenomenology makesthem markedly different from all the other young neutron stars discovered sofar.the aim of this work is to search for the optical/ir counterpart of thevela junior cco and to understand the nature of the associated halpha nebuladiscovered by pellizzoni et al. (2002).}{we have used deep optical (r band) andir (j,h,ks bands) observations recently performed by our group with the eso vltto obtain the first deep, high resolution images of the field with the goal ofresolving the nebula structure and pinpointing a point-like source possiblyassociated with the neutron star.our r-band image shows that both the nebula'sflux and its structure are very similar to the halpha ones, suggesting that thenebula spectrum is dominated by pure halpha line emission. however, the nebulais not detected in our ir observations, whick makes it impossible to toconstrain its spectrum. a faint point-like object (j&gt;22.6, h~21.6, ks ~ 21.4)compatible with the neutron star's chandra x-ray position is detected in our irimages (h and ks) but not in the optical one (r &gt; 25.6), where it is buried bythe nebula background. the nebula is most likely a bow-shock produced by theneutron star motion through the ism or, alternatively, a photo-ionizationnebula powered by uv radiation from a hot neutron star.

0707.2036	the optical spectrum of the vela pulsar	our knowledge of the optical spectra of isolated neutron stars (inss) islimited by their intrinsic faintness. among the fourteen optically identifiedinss, medium resolution spectra have been obtained only for a handful ofobjects. no spectrum has been published yet for the vela pulsar (psr b0833-45),the third brightest (v=23.6) ins with an optical counterpart. opticalmulti-band photometry underlines a flat continuum.in this work we present thefirst optical spectroscopy observations of the vela pulsar, performed in the4000-11000 a spectral range.our observations have been performed at the eso vltusing the fors2 instrument. the spectrum of the vela pulsar is characterized bya flat power-law (alpha = -0.04 +/- 0.04), which compares well with the valuesobtained from broad-band photometry. this confirms, once more, that the opticalemission of vela is entirely of magnetospheric origin. the comparison betweenthe optical spectral indeces of rotation-powered inss does not show evidencefor a spectral evolution suggesting that, as in the x-rays, the ins aging doesnot affect the spectral properties of the magnetospheric emission. at the sametime, the optical spectral indeces are found to be nearly always flatter thenthe x-rays ones, clearly suggesting a general spectral turnover at lowerenergies.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1003.0786	hst/wfpc2 observations of the lmc pulsar psr b0540-69	the study of the younger, and brighter, pulsars is important to understandthe optical emission properties of isolated neutron stars. psrb0540-69, thesecond brightest (v~22) optical pulsar, is obviously a very interesting targetfor these investigations. the aim of this work is threefold: constraining thepulsar proper motion and its velocity on the plane of the sky through opticalastrometry, obtaining a more precise characterisation of the pulsar opticalspectral energy distribution (sed) through a consistent set of multi-band,high-resolution, imaging photometry observations, measuring the pulsar opticalphase-averaged linear polarisation, for which only a preliminary and uncertainmeasurement was obtained so far from ground-based observations. we performedhigh-resolution observations of psrb0540-69 with the wfpc2 aboard the hst, inboth direct imaging and polarimetry modes. from multi-epoch astrometry we set a3sigma upper limit of 1 mas/yr on the pulsar proper motion, implying atransverse velocity &lt;250 km/s at the 50 kpc lmc distance. moreover, wedetermined the pulsar absolute position with an unprecedented accuracy of 70mas. from multi-band photometry we characterised the pulsar power-law spectrumand we derived the most accurate measurement of the spectral index(0.70+/-0.07) which indicates a spectral turnover between the optical and x-raybands. finally, from polarimetry we obtained a new measurement of the pulsarphase-averaged polarisation degree (16+/-4%),consistent with magnetospheremodels depending on the actual intrinsic polarisation degree and depolarisationfactor, and we found that the polarisation vector (22+/-12deg position angle)is possibly aligned with the semi-major axis of the pulsar-wind nebula and withthe apparent proper motion direction of its bright emission knot.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1108.0501	the radio/gamma-ray connection in active galactic nuclei in the era of  the fermi large area telescope	we present a detailed statistical analysis of the correlation between radioand gamma-ray emission of the active galactic nuclei (agn) detected by fermiduring its first year of operation, with the largest datasets ever used forthis purpose. we use both archival interferometric 8.4 ghz data (from the vlaand atca, for the full sample of 599 sources) and concurrent single-dish 15 ghzmeasurements from the owens valley radio observatory (ovro, for a sub sample of199 objects). our unprecedentedly large sample permits us to assess with highaccuracy the statistical significance of the correlation, using asurrogate-data method designed to simultaneously account for common-distancebias and the effect of a limited dynamical range in the observed quantities. wefind that the statistical significance of a positive correlation between the cmradio and the broad band (e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray energy flux is very high for thewhole agn sample, with a probability &lt;1e-7 for the correlation appearing bychance. using the ovro data, we find that concurrent data improve thesignificance of the correlation from 1.6e-6 to 9.0e-8. our large sample sizeallows us to study the dependence of correlation strength and significance onspecific source types and gamma-ray energy band. we find that the correlationis very significant (chance probability &lt;1e-7) for both fsrqs and bl lacsseparately; a dependence of the correlation strength on the consideredgamma-ray energy band is also present, but additional data will be necessary toconstrain its significance.

1111.0523	discovery of nine gamma-ray pulsars in fermi-lat data using a new blind  search method	we report the discovery of nine previously unknown gamma-ray pulsars in ablind search of data from the fermi large area telescope (lat). the pulsarswere found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed fordetecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars.designed to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to khz frequencies, the newmethod is computationally efficient, and incorporates several advances,including a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency,frequency derivative and sky location) and the use of photon probabilityweights. the nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 hz, andcharacteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 myr. two of them, psrs j1803-2149and j2111+4606, are young and energetic galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down powerabove 6e35 erg/s and ages below 100 kyr). the seven remaining pulsars, psrsj0106+4855, j0622+3749, j1620-4927, j1746-3239, j2028+3332, j2030+4415,j2139+4716, are older and less energetic; two of them are located at highergalactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 10 deg). psr j0106+4855 has the largestcharacteristic age (3 myr) and the smallest surface magnetic field (2e11 g) ofall lat blind-search pulsars. psr j2139+4716 has the lowest spin-down power(3e33 erg/s) among all non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars ever found. despiteextensive multi-frequency observations, only psr j0106+4855 has detectablepulsations in the radio band. the other eight pulsars belong to the increasingpopulation of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1112.4602	a time-variable, phase-dependent emission line in the x-ray spectrum of  the isolated neutron star rx j0822-4300	rx j0822-4300 is the central compact object associated with the puppis asupernova remnant. previous x-ray observations suggested rx j0822-4300 to be ayoung neutron star with a weak dipole field and a peculiar surface temperaturedistribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures andsizes. an emission line at 0.8 kev was also detected. we performed a very deep(130 ks) observation with xmm-newton, which allowed us to study in detail thephase-resolved properties of rx j0822-4300. our new data confirm the existenceof a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen inthe `soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the lineof sight. surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older onesyields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can bemodelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 kev in 2001 to ~0.73kev in 2009--2010. the line could be generated via cyclotron scattering ofthermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - itcould originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. in any case, avariation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the lineemitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1403.3849	light-curve modelling constraints on the obliquities and aspect angles  of the young fermi pulsars	in more than four years of observation the large area telescope on board thefermi satellite has identified pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission from more than 80young pulsars, providing light curves with high statistics. fitting theobservations with geometrical models can provide estimates of the magneticobliquity $\alpha$ and aspect angle $\zeta$, yielding estimates of theradiation beaming factor and luminosity. using $\gamma$-ray emission geometries(polar cap, slot gap, outer gap, one pole caustic) and radio emission geometry,we fit $\gamma$-ray light curves for 76 young pulsars and we jointly fit their$\gamma$-ray plus radio light curves when possible. we find that a joint radioplus $\gamma$-ray fit strategy is important to obtain ($\alpha$, $\zeta$)estimates that can explain simultaneous radio and $\gamma$-ray emission. theintermediate-to-high altitude magnetosphere models, slot gap, outer gap, andone pole caustic, are favoured in explaining the observations. we find noevolution of $\alpha$ on a time scale of a million years. for all emissiongeometries our derived $\gamma$-ray beaming factors are generally less than oneand do not significantly evolve with the spin-down power. a more pronouncedbeaming factor vs. spin-down power correlation is observed for slot gap modeland radio-quiet pulsars and for the outer gap model and radio-loud pulsars. forall models, the correlation between $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spin-down poweris consistent with a square root dependence. the $\gamma$-ray luminositiesobtained by using our beaming factors not exceed the spin-down power. thissuggests that assuming a beaming factor of one for all objects, as done inother studies, likely overestimates the real values. the data show a relationbetween the pulsar spectral characteristics and the width of the acceleratorgap that is consistent with the theoretical prediction for the slot gap model.

1508.00779	psr j1906+0722: an elusive gamma-ray pulsar	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0722, a gamma-ray pulsar detected aspart of a blind survey of unidentified fermi large area telescope (lat) sourcesbeing carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, einstein@home.this newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significantremaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in thesecond fermi-lat source catalog (2fgl) and was among the top ten mostsignificant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3fgl). psrj1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of$8.9$ hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. in 2009 august it suffered one of the largest glitchesdetected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar islikely radio-quiet. an off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from thelocation of psr j1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearbysource, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboringsupernova remnant and a molecular cloud. we discuss possible effects which mayhave hindered the detection of psr j1906+0722 in previous searches and describethe methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. we alsodemonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0107282	the distance to the vela pulsar gauged with hst parallax oservations	the distance to the vela pulsar (psr b0833-45) has been traditionally assumedto be 500 pc. although affected by a significant uncertainty, this value stuckto both the pulsar and the snr. in an effort to obtain a model free distancemeasurement, we have applied high resolution astrometry to the pulsar v~23.6optical counterpart. using a set of five hst/wfpc2 observations, we haveobtained the first optical measurement of the annual parallax of the velapulsar. the parallax turns out to be 3.4 +/- 0.7 mas, implying a distance of294(-50;+76) pc, i.e. a value significantly lower than previously believed.this affects the estimate of the pulsar absolute luminosity and of its emissionefficiency at various wavelengths and confirms the exceptionally high value ofthe n_e towards the vela pulsar. finally, the complete parallax data baseallows for a better measurement of the vela pulsar proper motion(mu_alpha(cos(delta))=-37.2 +/- 1.2 mas/yr; mu_delta=28.2 +/- 1.3 mas/yr aftercorrecting for the peculiar motion of the sun) which, at the parallax distance,implies a transverse velocity of ~65 km/s. moreover, the proper motion positionangle appears specially well aligned with the axis of symmetry of the x-raynebula as seen by chandra. such an alignment allows to assess the spacevelocity of the vela pulsar to be ~81 km/s.

astro-ph;0202268	hst observations rule out the association between cir x-1 and snr  g321.9-0.3	cir x-1 is one of the most intriguing galactic x-ray sources. it is a ~16.6days variable x/radio source, a type-i x-ray burster and a qpo emitter. inspite of an uncertain optical counterpart classification, all these propertiesidentify the source as an lmxb. the morphology of the surrounding radio nebulahas suggested an association with the nearby (~25 arcmin) snr g321.9-0.3,implying that cir x-1 is a runaway binary originated from the supernovaexplosion 10^5 years ago. to investigate this hypothesis, we carried out aproper motion measurement of the cir x-1 m ~19 optical counterpart using a setof hst/wfc and wfpc2 observations taken ~8.6 years apart. we obtained a 3 sigmaupper limit of ~5 mas/yr on the source proper motion. since the runawayhypothesis would have implied a proper motion due north ranging between 15 and75 mas/yr, depending on the actual age of the snr, our result definitivelyrules out the association between cir x-1 and snr g321.9-0.3.

astro-ph;0207296	pulse phase variations of the x-ray spectral features in the radio-quiet  neutron star 1e 1207-5209	we present the results of an xmm-newton observation of the radio-quiet x-raypulsar 1e 1207-5209 located at the center of the shell-like supernova remnantg296.5+10.0. the x-ray spectrum is characterized by the presence of twophase-dependent absorption lines at energies ~0.7 kev and ~1.4 kev. moreover,these broad spectral features have significant substructure, suggesting thatthey are due to the blending of several narrower lines. we interpret suchfeatures as evidence for an atmosphere containing metals and a magnetic fieldvalue of a few 10^12 g, consistent with the observed spin-down ratep_dot=(1.98+/-0.83)*10^(-14) s/s. since 1e 1207-5209 is the only x-ray emittingpulsar showing evidence of such features, we tentatively link them to theunique combination of age and energetics that characterize this object. wesuggest that a young age and a low level of magnetospheric activity arefavorable conditions for the detection of atomic spectral features from metalsin neutron star atmospheres, which would be either blanketed by a thin layer ofaccreted hydrogen in older objects or masked by non-thermal processes in youngenergetic pulsars.

astro-ph;0305540	search for the optical counterpart of the vela pulsar x-ray nebula	observations of the vela pulsar region with the chandra x-ray observatoryhave revealed the fine structure of its synchrotron pulsar-wind nebula (pwn),which showed an overall similarity with the crab pwn. however, contrary to thecrab, no firm detection of the vela pwn in optical has been reported yet. tosearch for the optical counterpart of the x-ray pwn, we analyzed deep opticalobservations performed with different telescopes. we compared the opticalimages with those obtained with the chandra acis to search for extendedemission patterns which could be identified as counterparts of the x-ray nebulaelements. although some features are seen in the optical images, we find nocorrelation with the x-ray structure. thus, we conclude that the diffuseoptical emission is more likely associated with filaments in the host vela snr.the derived upper limits on the optical flux from the pwn are compatibile,within the uncertainties, with the values expected on the basis of theextrapolations of the x-ray data.

astro-ph;0306189	discovery of x-ray cyclotron absorption lines measures the magnetic  field of an isolated neutron star	isolated neutron stars are higly magnetized, fast rotating end points ofstellar evolution. they are now becoming directly observable through x-rayastronomy, owing to their high surface temperatures. in particular, features intheir x-ray spectra could reveal the presence of atmospheres, or gauge theirunknown magnetic fields through the cyclotron process, as in the classic caseof x-ray binaries. all isolated neutron stars spectra observed so far, however,appear as featureless thermal continua. the unique exception is 1e 1207.4-5209.in its spectrum, previous observations had detected two deep absorptionfeatures, still too undefined for any unambiguous interpretation. here wereport on a much longer x-ray observation, in which the star's spectrum showsthree distinct features, regularly spaced at 0.7, 1.4 and 2.1 kev, plus afourth, lower significance one, at 2.8 kev. such features vary in phase withthe star rotation. cyclotron resonant absorption is their logicalinterpretation, yielding a magnetic field strenght of 8x10^10 gauss in the caseof electrons. this is the first direct measure of an isolated neutron starmagnetic field.

astro-ph;0412662	on the polar caps of the 3 musketeers	xmm-newton observations of psr b0656+14, psr b1055-52 and geminga havesubstantially increased the statistics available for these three isolatedneutron stars, so apparently similar to deserve the nickname of "threemusketeers" (becker &amp; truemper, 1997). here we shall take advantage of the epicstatistics to perform phase resolved spectroscopy for all three objects. thephase-averaged spectrum of the three musketeers is best described by a threecomponent model. this includes two blackbody components, a cooler one, possiblyoriginating from the bulk of the star surface, and a hotter one, coming from asmaller portion of the star surface (a "hot spot"), plus a power law. therelative contributions of the three components are seen to vary as a functionof phase, as the stars' rotation bring into view different emitting regions.the hot spots, which have very different apparent dimensions (in spite of thesimilarity of the three neutron stars polar cap radii) are responsible for thebulk of the phase variation. the amplitude of the observed phase modulation isalso markedly different for the three sources. another striking aspect of ourphase-resolved phenomenology is the apparent lack of any common phasealignement between the observed modulation patterns for the two blackbodycomponents. they are seen to vary in phase in the case of psr b1055-52, but inanti-phase in the case of psr b0656+14. these findings do not support standardand simplistic models of neutron star magnetic field configuration and surfacetemperature distribution.

astro-ph;0505261	xmm-newton and vlt observations of the afterglow of grb040827	the field of the gamma-ray burst grb 040827 was observed with xmm-newton andwith the eso/vlt starting ~6 and ~12 hours after the burst, respectively. afading x-ray afterglow is clearly detected with the xmm-newton/epic instrument,with a time decay t^(-delta), with delta=1.41+/-0.10. its spectrum is welldescribed by a power law (photon index gamma=2.3+/-0.1) affected by anabsorption largely exceeding (by a factor ~5) the expected galactic one,requiring the contribution of an intrinsic, redshifted absorber. in theoptical/nir range, the afterglow emission was observed in the ks band, as aweak source superimposed to the host galaxy, with magnitude ks=19.44+/-0.13 (12hours after the grb, contribution from the host subtracted); in other bands theflux is dominated by the host galaxy. coupling constraints derived from x-rayspectral fitting and from photometry of the host, we estimated a gas columndensity in the range (0.4-2.6)x10^22 cm^-2 in the grb host galaxy, likelylocated at a redshift 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.7. grb 040827 stands out as the best example ofan x-ray afterglow with intrinsic absorption.

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

0810.3804	chandra astrometry sets a tight upper limit to the proper motion of sgr  1900+14	the soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) sgr 1900+14 lies a few arcminutes outsidethe edge of the shell supernova remnant (snr) g42.8+0.6. a physical associationbetween the two systems has been proposed - for this and other sgr-snr pairs -based on the expectation of high space velocities for sgrs in the framework ofthe magnetar model. the large angular separation between the sgr and the snrcenter, coupled with the young age of the system, suggest a test of theassociation with a proper motion measurement. we used a set of threechandra/acis observations of the field spanning 5 years to perform accuraterelative astrometry in order to measure the possible angular displacement ofthe sgr as a function of time. our investigation sets a 3-sigma upper limit of70 mas/yr to the overall proper motion of the sgr. such a value argues againstan association of sgr 1900+14 with g42.8+0.6 and adds further support to themounting evidence for an origin of the sgr within a nearby, compact cluster ofmassive stars.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.
