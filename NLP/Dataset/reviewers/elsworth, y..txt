0902.4427	efficient pseudo-global fitting for helioseismic data	mode fitting or "peak-bagging" is an important procedure in helioseismologyallowing one to determine the various mode parameters of solar oscillations.here we describe a way of reducing the systematic bias in the fits of certainmode parameters that are seen when using "local" fitting techniques to analysethe sun-as-a-star p-mode power spectrum. to do this we have developed a new"pseudo-global" fitting algorithm designed to gain the advantages of fittingthe entire power spectrum, but without the problems involved in fitting a modelincorporating many hundreds of parameters.  we have performed a comparative analysis between the local and pseudo-globalpeak-bagging techniques by fitting the "limit" profiles of simulatedhelioseismic data. results show that for asymmetric modes the traditionalfitting technique returns systematically biased estimates of the centralfrequency parameter. this bias is significantly reduced when employing thepseudo-global routine. similarly, we show that estimates of the backgroundreturned from the pseudo-global routine match the input values much moreclosely than the estimates from the local fitting method.  we have also used the two fitting techniques to analyse a set of real solardata collected by the global oscillations at low frequencies (golf) instrumenton board the esa/nasa solar and heliospheric observatory (soho) spacecraft.similar differences between the estimated frequencies returned by the twotechniques are seen when fitting both the real and simulated data. we show thatthe background fits returned by the pseudo-global routine more closely matchthe estimate of the background one can infer from interpolating between fits tothe high and low frequency ends of the p-mode power spectrum.

0904.4122	new aspects of doppler imaging in sun-as-a-star observations	birmingham solar oscillations network (bison) instruments use resonantscattering spectrometers to make unresolved doppler velocity observations ofthe sun. unresolved measurements are not homogenous across the solar disc andso the observed data do not represent a uniform average over the entiresurface. the influence on the inhomogeneity of the solar rotation and limbdarkening has been considered previously (brookes et al. 1978a) and is wellunderstood. here we consider a further effect that originates from theinstrumentation itself. the intensity of light observed from a particularregion on the solar disc is dependent on the distance between that region onthe image of the solar disc formed in the instrument and the detector. themajority of bison instruments have two detectors positioned on opposite sidesof the image of the solar disc and the observations made by each detector areweighted towards differing regions of the disc. therefore the visibility andamplitudes of the solar oscillations and the realization of the solar noiseobserved by each detector will differ. we find that the modelled bias issensitive to many different parameters such as the width of solar absorptionlines, the strength of the magnetic field in the resonant scatteringspectrometer, the orientation of the sun's rotation axis, the size of the imageobserved by the instrument and the optical depth in the vapour cell. we findthat the modelled results best match the observations when the optical depth atthe centre of the vapour cell is 0.55. the inhomogeneous weighting means that a`velocity offset' is introduced into unresolved doppler velocity observationsof the sun, which varies with time, and so has an impact on the long-termstability of the observations.

0904.4126	pseudo-global fitting of gapped helioseismic data	mode fitting or "peak-bagging" is an important procedure in helioseismologyallowing one to determine the various mode parameters of solar oscillations. wehave recently developed a new "pseudo-global" fitting algorithm as a way ofreducing the systematic bias in the fits of certain mode parameters that areseen when using "local" fitting techniques to analyse "sun-as-a-star" p-modedata. this new algorithm has been designed specifically to gain the advantagesof fitting the entire power spectrum, while retaining the efficiency of localfitting techniques.  using simulated data with a full fill we have previously shown that thepseudo-global routine reduces the bias in estimates of the frequencies andasymmetries and in the estimates of the solar background when compared with atraditional fitting technique. here we present results that show that thepseudo-global routine is also effective in reducing bias in the parameterestimates when the time-series has significant gaps. as such we are now able toemploy the routine in order to fit ground based helioseismic data such as thatcollected by the birmingham solar oscillations network (bison).

0905.1722	mode lifetimes of stellar oscillations - implications for  asteroseismology	successful inference from asteroseismology relies on at least two things:that the oscillations in the stars have amplitudes large enough to be clearlyobservable; and that the oscillations themselves be stable enough to enableprecise measurements of mode frequencies and other parameters. solar-like pmodes are damped by convection, and hence the stability of the modes depends onthe lifetime.  we seek a simple scaling relation between the mean lifetime of the mostprominent solar-like p modes in stars, and the fundamental stellar parameters.  we base our search for a relation on use of stellar equilibrium and pulsationcomputations of a grid of stellar models, and the first asteroseismic resultson lifetimes of main-sequence, sub-giant and red-giant stars.  we find that the mean lifetimes of all three classes of solar-like starsscale like $t_{\rm eff}^{-4}$ (where $t_{\rm eff}$ is the effectivetemperature). when this relation is combined with the well-known scalingrelation of kjeldsen &amp; bedding (1995) for mode amplitudes observed innarrow-band intensity observations, we obtain the unexpected result that theheight (the maximum power spectral density) of mode peaks in the frequencypower spectrum scales as $g^{-2}$ (where $g$ is the surface gravity). as it isthe mode height (and not the amplitude) that fixes the s/n at which the modescan be measured, and as $g$ changes only slowly along the main sequence, thissuggests that stars cooler than the sun might be as good targets forasteroseismology as their hotter counterparts. when observations are insteadmade in doppler velocity, our results imply that mode height then does increasewith increasing effective temperature.

0906.5441	sounding stellar cycles with kepler - i. strategy for selecting targets	the long-term monitoring and high photometric precision of the keplersatellite will provide a unique opportunity to sound the stellar cycles of manysolar-type stars using asteroseismology. this can be achieved by studyingperiodic changes in the amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillation modesobserved in these stars. by comparing these measurements with conventionalground-based chromospheric activity indices, we can improve our understandingof the relationship between chromospheric changes and those taking place deepin the interior throughout the stellar activity cycle. in addition,asteroseismic measurements of the convection zone depth and differentialrotation may help us determine whether stellar cycles are driven at the top orat the base of the convection zone. in this paper, we analyze the precisionthat will be possible using kepler to measure stellar cycles, convection zonedepths, and differential rotation. based on this analysis, we describe astrategy for selecting specific targets to be observed by the keplerasteroseismic investigation for the full length of the mission, to optimizetheir suitability for probing stellar cycles in a wide variety of solar-typestars.

0907.2855	corrections of sun-as-a-star p-mode frequencies for effects of the solar  cycle	solar p-mode frequencies vary with solar activity. it is important to takethis into account when comparing the frequencies observed from epochs that spandifferent regions of the solar cycle. we present details of how to correctobserved p-mode frequencies for the effects of the solar cycle. we describethree types of correction. the first allows mode frequencies to be corrected toa nominal activity level, such as the canonical quiet-sun level. the secondaccounts for the effect on the observed mode frequencies, powers, and dampingrates of the continually varying solar cycle and is pertinent to frequenciesobtained from very long data sets. the third corrects for sun-as-a-starobservations not seeing all components of the modes. suitable combinations ofthe three correction procedures allow the frequencies obtained from differentsets of data to be compared and enable activity-independent inversions of thesolar interior. as an example of how to apply the corrections we describe thoseused to produce a set of definitive sun-as-a-star frequencies.

0907.3417	is the current lack of solar activity only skin deep?	the sun is a variable star whose magnetic activity and total irradiance varyon a timescale of approximately 11 years. the current activity minimum hasattracted considerable interest because of its unusual duration and depth. thisraises the question: what might be happening beneath the surface where themagnetic activity ultimately originates? the surface activity can be linked tothe conditions in the solar interior by the observation and analysis of thefrequencies of the sun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes.these seismic frequencies respond to changes in activity and are probes ofconditions within the sun. the birmingham solar-oscillations network (bison)has made measurements of p-mode frequencies over the last three solar activitycycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual andextended solar minimum. we show that the bison data reveal significantvariations of the p-mode frequencies during the current minimum. this is inmarked contrast to the surface activity observations, which show littlevariation over the same period. the level of the minimum is significantlydeeper in the p-mode frequencies than in the surface observations. we observe aquasi-biennial signal in the p-mode frequencies, which has not previously beenobserved at mid- and low-activity levels. the stark differences in the behaviorof the frequencies and the surface activity measures point to activity-relatedprocesses occurring in the solar interior, which are yet to reach the surface,where they may be attenuated.

0910.0848	the quest for the solar g modes	solar gravity modes (or g modes) -- oscillations of the solar interior forwhich buoyancy acts as the restoring force -- have the potential to provideunprecedented inference on the structure and dynamics of the solar core,inference that is not possible with the well observed acoustic modes (or pmodes). the high amplitude of the g-mode eigenfunctions in the core and theevanesence of the modes in the convection zone make the modes particularlysensitive to the physical and dynamical conditions in the core. owing to theexistence of the convection zone, the g modes have very low amplitudes atphotospheric levels, which makes the modes extremely hard to detect. in thispaper, we review the current state of play regarding attempts to detect gmodes. we review the theory of g modes, including theoretical estimation of theg-mode frequencies, amplitudes and damping rates. then we go on to discuss thetechniques that have been used to try to detect g modes. we review results inthe literature, and finish by looking to the future, and the potential advancesthat can be made -- from both data and data-analysis perspectives -- to giveunambiguous detections of individual g modes. the review ends by concludingthat, at the time of writing, there is indeed a consensus amongst the authorsthat there is currently no undisputed detection of solar g modes.

1004.3151	acoustic power absorption and enhancement generated by slow and fast mhd  waves	we used long duration, high quality, unresolved (sun-as-a star) observationscollected by the ground based network bison and by the instruments golf andvirgo on board the esa/nasa soho satellite to search for solar-cycle-relatedchanges in mode characteristics in velocity and continuum intensity for thefrequency range between 2.5mhz &lt; nu &lt; 6.8mhz. over the ascending phase of solarcycle 23 we found a suppression in the p-mode amplitudes both in the velocityand intensity data between 2.5mhz &lt;nu&lt; 4.5mhz with a maximum suppression forfrequencies in the range between 2.5mhz &lt;nu&lt; 3.5mhz. the size of the amplitudesuppression is 13+-2 per cent for the velocity and 9+-2 per cent for theintensity observations. over the range 4.5mhz &lt;nu&lt; 5.5mhz the findings hintwithin the errors to a null change both in the velocity and intensityamplitudes. at still higher frequencies, in the so called high-frequencyinterference peaks (hips) between 5.8mhz &lt;nu &lt; 6.8mhz, we found an enhancementin the velocity amplitudes with the maximum 36+-7 per cent occurring for 6.3mhz&lt;nu&lt; 6.8mhz. however, in intensity observations we found a rather smallerenhancement of about 5+-2 per cent in the same interval. there is evidence thatthe frequency dependence of solar-cycle velocity amplitude changes isconsistent with the theory behind the mode conversion of acoustic waves in anon-vertical magnetic field, but there are some problems with the intensitydata, which may be due to the height in the solar atmosphere at which the virgodata are taken.

1006.4284	oscillation mode lifetimes of red giants observed during the initial and  first anticentre long run of corot	long timeseries of data increase the frequency resolution in the powerspectrum. this allows for resolving stochastically excited modes with long modelifetimes, as well as features that are close together in frequency. the corotfields observed during the initial run and second long run partly overlap, andstars in this overlapping field observed in both runs are used to createtimeseries with a longer timespan than available from the individual runs. weaim to measure the mode lifetimes of red giants and compare them withtheoretical predictions. we also investigate the dependence of the modelifetimes on frequency and the degree of the oscillation modes. we performsimulations to investigate the influence of the gap in the data between theinitial and second long run, the total length of the run and thesignal-to-noise ratio on the measured mode lifetime. this provides us with acorrection factor to apply to the mode lifetimes measured from a maximumlikelihood fit to the oscillation frequencies. we find that the length of thetimeseries, the signal-to-noise ratio and possible gaps do have anon-negligible effect on the measurements of the mode lifetime ofstochastically excited oscillation modes, but that we can correct for it. forthe four stars for which we can perform a fit of the oscillation frequencies,we find that the mode lifetimes depend on frequency and on degree of the mode,which is in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1109.2595	frequency dependence of the large frequency separation of solar-like  oscillators: influence of the helium second-ionization zone	the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive orders in a star is approximately proportional to the square rootof its mean density. to determine the large frequency separation as accuratelyas possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders isoften used. it is, however, known that the large frequency separation varieswith frequency in a second order effect. from observations it has been shownthat this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars thanit is for red-giant stars. here we use yrec models to verify and explain thisobservational result. we find that for stars with r &gt; 8 rsun the effect of thehelium second ionisation zone is relatively small. for these stars the deeplocation of the he ii zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a fewlarge separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to therelatively weak and extended he ii layer, causing a shallow wide depression inthe first adiabatic exponent. for less evolved stars the he ii zone is locatedcloser to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depressionin the first adiabatic exponent. this causes frequency modulations withrelatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducinga relatively large frequency modulation. additionally, we find that for lessevolved stars the he ii zone is stronger and more localised for more massivestars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude ofthe frequency modulation.

1110.0980	characterization of the power excess of solar-like oscillations in red  giants with kepler	we aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in kepler redgiants, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing theseparameters. from these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties ofred giant oscillations. various different methods were compared in order tovalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. for consistency, asingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevantglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of thebackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of thepower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility ofnon-radial modes. a method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillationspectrum. the comparison of the different methods has shown the important roleof the way the background is modelled. the convergence reached by thecollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning theoscillation power excess. we obtain several scaling relations, and identify theinfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. the effect of heliumburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strongmass-radius relation for clump stars. we find that none of the amplitudescaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observedmode amplitudes of red giant stars. in parallel, the degree-dependent modevisibility exhibits important variations. both effects seem related to thesignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. a familyof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties areanalyzed.

1111.2492	quasi-biennial variations in helioseismic frequencies: can the source of  the variation be localized?	we investigate the spherical harmonic degree (l) dependence of the "seismic"quasi-biennial oscillation (qbo) observed in low-degree solar p-modefrequencies, using sun-as-a-star birmingham solar oscillations network (bison)data. the amplitude of the seismic qbo is modulated by the 11-yr solar cycle,with the amplitude of the signal being largest at solar maximum. the amplitudeof the signal is noticeably larger for the l=2 and 3 modes than for the l=0 and1 modes. the seismic qbo shows some frequency dependence but this dependence isnot as strong as observed in the 11-yr solar cycle. these results areconsistent with the seismic qbo having its origins in shallow layers of theinterior (one possibility being the bottom of the shear layer extending 5percent below the solar surface). under this scenario the magnetic fluxresponsible for the seismic qbo is brought to the surface (where its influenceon the p modes is stronger) by buoyant flux from the 11-yr cycle, the strongcomponent of which is observed at predominantly low-latitudes. as the l=2 and 3modes are much more sensitive to equatorial latitudes than the l=0 and 1 modesthe influence of the 11-yr cycle on the seismic qbo is more visible in l=2 and3 mode frequencies. our results imply that close to solar maximum the maininfluence of the seismic qbo occurs at low latitudes (&lt;45 degrees), which iswhere the strong component of the 11-yr solar cycle resides. to isolate thelatitudinal dependence of the seismic qbo from the 11-yr solar cycle we mustconsider epochs when the 11-yr solar cycle is weak. however, away from solarmaximum, the amplitude of the seismic qbo is weak making the latitudinaldependence hard to constrain.

1203.0689	probing the core structure and evolution of red giants using  gravity-dominated mixed modes observed with kepler	we report for the first time a parametric fit to the pattern of the \ell = 1mixed modes in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identifygravity-dominated mixed modes. with these modes, which share thecharacteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directlythe helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. we proposetwo ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequenciesof the mixed modes. firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describethe main features of the mode bumping. alternatively, a quasi-asymptoticmixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations andthe stellar interior structure. we used period \'echelle diagrams to emphasizethe detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. the asymptotic relation formixed modes is confirmed. it allows us to measure the gravity-mode periodspacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. the identification of thegravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of allmajor peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequencesfor the true identification of \ell = 3 modes, of \ell = 2 mixed modes, for themode widths and amplitudes, and for the \ell = 1 rotational splittings. theaccurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effectiveprobe of the inner, g-mode cavity. the derived value of the couplingcoefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clumpstars. this provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region thatsurrounds the helium core. core contraction as red giants ascend the red giantbranch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as afunction of the mean large separation.

1206.3312	seismic evidence for a rapidly rotating core in a lower-giant-branch  star observed with kepler	rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and theevolution of stars. however, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport instars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account instellar models. to achieve a better understanding of these processes, wedesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,which until very recently were restricted to the sun. in this paper, we reportthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in thecore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giantkic7341231, which was observed during one year with the kepler spacecraft. byperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show thatits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able todetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. we then find astellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismicproperties of the star. we use this model to perform inversions of the internalrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of thestar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. this will shednew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. inparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angularmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, whichcould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed overthe last decades.

1207.0615	solar-like oscillations in red giants observed with \textit{kepler}:  influence of increased timespan on global oscillation parameters	the length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the kepler satelliteanalysed here span 19 months. kepler provides the longest continuous timeseriescurrently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increasedtimespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. we find that ingeneral a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary toobtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95%of the stars, but this does depend on &lt;dnu&gt;. in a statistical sense the quoteduncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of theobtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to beoverestimated for results of longer runs. furthermore, the differentdefinitions of the global parameters used in the different methods havenon-negligible effects on the obtained values. additionally, we show that thereis a correlation between nu_max and the flux variance. we conclude that longertimeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes(from ~60% in 50 day runs to &gt; 95% in 400 day runs with a slight methoddependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters.the trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longertimeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the medianabsolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). this work showsthat global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long datasets- using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state ofthe stars.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1209.3336	spin down of the core rotation in red giants	the space mission kepler provides us with long and uninterrupted photometrictime series of red giants. we are now able to probe the rotational behaviour intheir deep interiors using the observations of mixed modes. we aim to measurethe rotational splittings in red giants and to derive scaling relations forrotation related to seismic and fundamental stellar parameters. we havedeveloped a dedicated method for automated measurements of the rotationalsplittings in a large number of red giants. ensemble asteroseismology, namelythe examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of theirevolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. we havemeasured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. we havealso shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. under theassumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, weobserve a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giantbranch. alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump starscompared to the red giant branch. we also show that, at fixed stellar radius,the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. ensembleasteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: ourinterpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusionthat the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giantphase. the slow-down occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. thisspinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured inwhite dwarfs

0712.2931	distortion of the p-mode peak profiles by the solar-cycle frequency  shifts: do we need to worry?	we seek to address whether solar-cycle frequency shifts of the sun's low-l pmodes `distort' the underlying shapes of the mode peaks, when those peaks areobserved in power frequency spectra made from data spanning large fractions, ormore, of the cycle period. we present analytical descriptions of the expectedprofiles, and validate the predictions through use of artificial seismictimeseries data, in which temporal variations of the oscillator frequencies areintroduced. our main finding is that for the sun-like frequency shifts thedistortion of the asymmetrical lorentzian-like profiles is very small, but alsojust detectible. our analysis indicates that by fitting modes to the usuallorentzian-like models -- which do not allow for the distortion -- rather thannew models we derive, there is a bias in the mode height and linewidthparameters that is comparable in size to the observational uncertainties givenby multi-year datasets. bias in the frequency parameter gives much less causefor worry, being over an order of magnitude smaller than the correspondingfrequency uncertainties. the distortion discussed in this paper may need to beconsidered when multi-year sun-like asteroseismic datasets are analyzed onstars showing strong activity cycles.

1305.6586	asteroseismic surface gravity for evolved stars	context: asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance indetermining spectroscopic stellar parameters. the independent log(g) value fromasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis toreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. since 2012, a combined analysisof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing fora large survey with sdss/apogee and kepler. therefore, knowledge of anypotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is nowbecoming important. aims: the seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is thefrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). here, we investigate theinfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)values. the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive radial orders (dnu) is often used as an additional constraint forthe determination of log(g). additionally, we checked the influence of smallcorrections applied to dnu on the derived values of log(g). methods we usemethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and dnutogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derivelog(g). results: we find that different approaches to derive oscillationparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases forred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. these biases are well within the quoteduncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). corrections suggested in the literature tothe dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). however somewhatunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the orderof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar referencevalues are used.

1306.4323	tests of the asymptotic large frequency separation of acoustic  oscillations in solar-type and red giant stars	asteroseismology, i.e. the study of the internal structures of stars viatheir global oscillations, is a valuable tool to obtain stellar parameters suchas mass, radius, surface gravity and mean density. these parameters can beobtained using certain scaling relations which are based on an asymptoticapproximation. usually the observed oscillation parameters are assumed tofollow these scaling relations. recently, it has been questioned whether thisis a valid approach, i.e., whether the order of the observed oscillation modesare high enough to be approximated with an asymptotic theory. in this work weuse stellar models to investigate whether the differences between observableoscillation parameters and their asymptotic estimates are indeed significant.we compute the asymptotic values directly from the stellar models and derivethe observable values from adiabatic pulsation calculations of the same models.we find that the extent to which the atmosphere is included in the models is akey parameter. considering a larger extension of the atmosphere beyond thephotosphere reduces the difference between the asymptotic and observable valuesof the large frequency separation. therefore, we conclude that the currentlysuggested discrepancies in the scaling relations might have been overestimated.hence, based on the results presented here we believe that the suggestions ofmosser et al. (2013) should not be followed without careful consideration.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

0802.1418	the visibility of low-frequency solar acoustic modes	we make predictions of the detectability of low-frequency p modes. estimatesof the powers and damping times of these low-frequency modes are found byextrapolating the observed powers and widths of higher-frequency modes withlarge observed signal-to-noise ratios. the extrapolations predict that thelow-frequency modes will have small signal-to-noise ratios and narrow widths ina frequency-power spectrum. monte carlo simulations were then performed wheretimeseries containing mode signals and normally distributed gaussian noise wereproduced. the mode signals were simulated to have the powers and damping timespredicted by the extrapolations. various statistical tests were then performedon the frequency-amplitude spectra formed from these timeseries to investigatethe fraction of spectra in which the modes could be detected. the results ofthese simulations were then compared to the number of p-modes candidatesobserved in real sun-as-a-star data at low frequencies. the fraction ofsimulated spectra in which modes were detected decreases rapidly as thefrequency of modes decreases and so the fraction of simulations in which thelow-frequency modes were detected was very small. however, increasing thesignal-to-noise (s/n) ratio of the low-frequency modes by a factor of 2 abovethe extrapolated values led to significantly more detections. therefore effortsshould continue to further improve the quality of solar data that is currentlyavailable.

1402.2480	prospects for detecting asteroseismic binaries in kepler data	asteroseismology may in principle be used to detect unresolved stellar binarysystems comprised of solar-type stars and/or red giants. this novel methodrelies on the detection of the presence of two solar-like oscillation spectrain the frequency spectrum of a single lightcurve. here, we make predictions ofthe numbers of systems that may be detectable in data already collected by thenasa kepler mission. our predictions, which are based upon trilegal and bisepssimulations of the kepler field of view, indicate that as many as 200 or more``asteroseismic binaries'' may be detectable in this manner. most of thesebinaries should be comprised of two he-core-burning red giants. owing largelyto the limited numbers of targets with the requisite short-cadence kepler data,we expect only a small number of detected binaries containing solar-type stars.the predicted yield of detections is sensitive to the assumed initial massratio distribution of the binary components and therefore represents asensitive calibration of the much debated initial mass ratio distribution nearmass ratio unity.

1403.7045	prospects for asteroseismic inference on the envelope helium abundance  in red giant stars	regions of rapid variation in the internal structure of a star are oftenreferred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodicsignature in the frequencies of p modes. here we examine the localizeddisturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branchand clump stars. more specifically, we determine how accurately and preciselythe parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillationfrequencies of stellar models. we use models produced by three differentgeneration codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution alongthe red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances.we discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accuratelydetermine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. thedetermined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencieswere found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabaticexponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge ofthe second ionization zone of helium. finally, we consider whether this methodcan be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. although adefinite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction wouldbe difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly differenthelium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameterscan be reduced. however, application of our methodology could be useful fordistinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globularclusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances havebeen observed.

1405.0160	bison data preparation: a correction for differential extinction and the  weighted averaging of contemporaneous data	the birmingham solar oscillations network (bison) has provided high-qualityhigh-cadence observations from as far back in time as 1978. these data must becalibrated from the raw observations into radial velocity and the quality ofthe calibration has a large impact on the signal-to-noise ratio of the finaltime series. the aim of this work is to maximise the potential science that canbe performed with the bison data set by optimising the calibration procedure.to achieve better levels of signal-to-noise ratio we perform two key steps inthe calibration process: we attempt a correction for terrestrial atmosphericdifferential extinction; and the resulting improvement in the calibrationallows us to perform weighted averaging of contemporaneous data from differentbison stations. the improvements listed produce significant improvement in thesignal-to-noise ratio of the bison frequency-power spectrum across allfrequency ranges. the reduction of noise in the power spectrum will allowfuture work to provide greater constraint on changes in the oscillationspectrum with solar activity. in addition, the analysis of the low-frequencyregion suggests we have achieved a noise level that may allow us to improveestimates of the upper limit of g-mode amplitudes.

1409.0696	super-nyquist asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators with kepler and  k2 - expanding the asteroseismic cohort at the base of the red-giant branch	we consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the"super-nyquist" regime of long-cadence (lc) kepler photometry, i.e., above theassociated nyquist frequency of approximately 283 {\mu}hz. targets of interestare cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red-giantbranch. these stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (sc)data, since the associated sc nyquist frequency lies well above the frequenciesof the detectable oscillations. however, the number of available sc targetslots is quite limited. this imposes a severe restriction on the size of theensemble available for sc asteroseismic study.we find that archival kepler lcdata from the nominal mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies oftargets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as approximately 500{\mu}hz, i.e., about 1.75- times the lc nyquist frequency. the frequencydetection threshold for the shorter-duration science campaigns of there-purposed kepler mission, k2, is lower. the maximum threshold will probablylie somewhere between approximately 400 and 450 {\mu}hz. the potential toexploit the archival kepler and k2 lc data in this manner opens the door toincreasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red-gianttargets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitationsimposed by the small number of sc slots.we estimate that around 400 suchtargets are now available for study in the kepler lc archive. that number couldpotentially be a lot higher for k2, since there will be a new target list foreach of its campaigns.

1409.7949	on the asymptotic acoustic-mode phase in red-giant stars and its  dependence on evolutionary state	asteroseismic investigations based on the wealth of data now available,inparticular from the corot and kepler missions, require a good understanding ofthe relation between the observed quantities and the properties of theunderlying stellar structure. kallinger et al. 2012 found a relation betweentheir determination of the asymptotic phase of radial oscillations in evolvedstars and the evolutionary state, separating ascending-branch red giants fromhelium-burning stars in the `red clump'. here we provide a detailed analysis ofthis relation, which is found to derive from differences between these twoclasses of stars in the thermodynamic state of the convective envelope. thereis potential for distinguishing red giants and clump stars based on the phasedetermined from observations that are too short to allow distinction based ondetermination of the period spacing for mixed modes. the analysis of the phasemay also point to a better understanding of the potential for using thehelium-ionization-induced acoustic glitch to determine the helium abundance inthe envelopes of these stars.

1411.1082	mixed modes in red giants: a window on stellar evolution	the detection of oscillations with a mixed character in subgiants and redgiants allows us to probe the physical conditions in their cores. with thesemixed modes, we aim at determining seismic markers of stellar evolution. keplerasteroseismic data were selected to map various evolutionary stages and stellarmasses. seismic evolutionary tracks were then drawn with the combination of thefrequency and period spacings. we measured the asymptotic period spacing formore than 1170 stars at various evolutionary stages. this allows us to monitorstellar evolution from the main sequence to the asymptotic giant branch anddraw seismic evolutionary tracks. we present clear quantified asteroseismicdefinitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, inparticular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giantbranch, and the end of the horizontal branch.the seismic information is soprecise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models.the quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling,especially for studying the energy transport in the helium-burning core or forspecifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giantbranches. modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to bein the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting thesecondary clump, or stars that could be in the blue-loop stage.

1505.07280	helium signature in red giant oscillation patterns observed by kepler	the space-borne missions corot and kepler have provided a large amount ofprecise photometric data. among the stars observed, red giants show a richoscillation pattern that allows their precise characterization. long-durationobservations allow for investigating the fine structure of this oscillationpattern. a common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giantstars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotictheory. this pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern,describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. we aim to investigate thedeviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them interms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium. we also show howthis seismic signature depends on stellar evolution. we measured thefrequencies of radial modes with a maximum likelihood estimator method, then weidentified a modulation corresponding to the departure from the universaloscillation pattern. we identify the modulation component of the radial modefrequency spacings in more than five hundred red giants. the variation in themodulation that we observe at different evolutionary states brings newconstraints on the interior models for these stars. we also derive an updatedform of the universal pattern that accounts for the modulation and provideshighly precise radial frequencies.

1511.06160	internal rotation of the red-giant star kic 4448777 by means of  asteroseismic inversion	in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the earlyred-giant star kic 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of thedipole mixed modes obtained from {\it kepler} observations. in order toovercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods toextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. we find not onlythat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversionresults generated for other red giants (deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but wealso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core witha spatial resolution of $\delta r=0.001r$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharpdiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (deheuvels et al. 2014). theresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity ofabout $\langle\omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nhz and provide evidence for anangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part ofthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize therotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. theangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burningshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reachingan average value in the convective envelope of$\langle\omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nhz. hence, the core in kic~4448777 isrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficientto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the densecore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiativeregion and in the convective envelope.

astro-ph;9702105	solar internal sound speed as inferred from combined bison and lowl  oscillation frequencies	observations of the sun with the lowl instrument provide a homogeneous set ofsolar p-mode frequencies from low to intermediate degree which allows one todetermine the structure of much of the solar interior avoiding systematicerrors that are introduced when different data sets are combined, i.e.,principally the effects of solar cycle changes on the frequencies.unfortunately, the lowl data set contains very few of the lowest-degree modes,which are essential for determining reliably the structure of the solar core -in addition, these lowest-degree data have fairly large associateduncertainties. however, observations made by the birmingham solar-oscillationsnetwork (bison) in integrated sunlight provide high-accuracy measurements of alarge number of low-degree modes. in this paper we demonstrate that thelow-degree mode set of the lowl data can be successfully combined with the moreaccurate bison data, provided the observations are contemporaneous for thosefrequencies where the solar-cycle-induced effects are important. we show thatthis leads to a factor-of-two decrease in the error on the inferred sound speedin the solar core. we find that the solar sound speed is higher than in solarmodels for r &lt; 0.2rsun. the density of the solar core is, however, lower thanthat in solar models.

0810.5022	excitation and damping of p-mode oscillations of alpha cen b	this paper presents an analysis of observational data on the p-mode spectrumof the star alpha cen b and a comparison with theoretical computations of thestochastic excitation and damping of the modes. we find that at frequencies &gt;4500 micro-hz, the model damping rates appear to be too weak to explain theobserved shape of the power spectral density of alpha cen b. the conclusionrests on the assumption that most of the disagreement is due to problemsmodelling the damping rates, not the excitation rates, of the modes. thisassumption is supported by a parallel analysis of bison sun-as-a-star data, forwhich it is possible to use analysis of very long timeseries to place tightconstraints on the assumption. the bison analysis shows that there is a similarhigh-frequency disagreement between theory and observation in the sun.  we demonstrate that by using suitable comparisons of theory and observationit is possible to make inference on the dependence of the p-mode linewidths onfrequency, without directly measuring those linewidths, even though the alphacen b dataset is only a few nights long. use of independent measures from aprevious study of the alpha cen b linewidths in two parts of its spectrum alsoallows us to calibrate our linewidth estimates for the star. the resultingcalibrated linewidth curve looks similar to a frequency-scaled version of itssolar cousin, with the scaling factor equal to the ratio of the respectiveacoustic cut-off frequencies of the two stars. the ratio of the frequencies atwhich the onset of high-frequency problems is seen in both stars is also givenapproximately by the same scaling factor.
