0902.1755	radio emission from supernova remnants: implications for post-shock  magnetic field amplification and the magnetic fields of galaxies	using observations from the literature, we show that the non-thermal radioluminosity (l) of supernova remnants (snrs) is a strong function of the averagegas surface density (sigma) of the galaxy in which the remnants reside, fromnormal spirals to luminous starbursts. we combine a simple theory for electroncooling in snrs with the observed radio luminosities to estimate the remnantmagnetic field strength (b_snr): the correlation between l and sigma impliesthat b_snr also increases with sigma. we explore two interpretations of thiscorrelation: (1) b_snr is generated by post-shock magnetic field amplification,with b_snr^2 proportional to sigma and (2) b_snr results from shock-compressionof the ambient ism magnetic field (b_ism), with b_ism being larger in densergalaxies. we find that shock compression is, on average, sufficient to producethe observed radio emission from snrs in the densest starbursts; amplificationof post-shock magnetic fields is not required. by contrast, in normal spiralspost-shock field amplification (by a factor of a few - 10) is consistent withthe data; we find tentative evidence that both the alfven speed and the ratioof b_snr^2 to the post-shock pressure ("epsilon_b") are constant in snrs fromgalaxy to galaxy. we discuss observational tests that can be used todistinguish between these two interpretations of the radio luminosities ofsnrs. regardless of which is correct, the radio emission from snrs provides anupper limit to b_ism that is independent of the minimum energy assumption. forthe densest starbursts, the ism magnetic energy density is below that requiredfor hydrostatic equilibrium; thus magnetic fields are not dynamically importanton the largest scales in starbursts, in contrast with spiral galaxies like ourown. this dichotomy may have implications for galactic dynamo theory.

0903.2479	compact high-redshift galaxies are the cores of the most massive  present-day spheroids	observations suggest that effective radii of high-z massive spheroids are asmuch as a factor ~6 smaller than low-z galaxies of comparable mass. given theapparent absence of low-z counterparts, this has often been interpreted asindicating that the high density, compact red galaxies must be 'puffed up' bysome mechanism. we compare the ensemble of high-z observations with largesamples of well-observed low-z ellipticals. at the same physical radii, thestellar surface mass densities of low and high-z systems are comparable.moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift iscomparable to or larger than that observed at z&gt;1-2, consistent with thecontinuous buildup of spheroids over this time. the entire population ofcompact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density coresof present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density fromz=2 to z=0. the primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus theobserved low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather thanthe high-density material in high-z spheroids). such low-density material mayeither (1) assemble at z&lt;2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z&gt;2.mock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations donot yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the lowsurface density 'wings' (if present). thus, if the high-z galaxies resemble themost massive systems today, their inferred effective radii could beunder-estimated by factors ~2-4. this difference arises because massive systemsat low redshift are not well-fit by single sersic profiles. we discussimplications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution.

0903.3949	the small scatter in bh-host correlations &amp; the case for self-regulated  bh growth	supermassive black holes (bhs) obey tight scaling relations between theirmass and their host galaxy properties such as total stellar mass, velocitydispersion, and potential well depth. this has led to the development ofself-regulated models for bh growth, in which feedback from the central bhhalts its own growth upon reaching a critical threshold. however, models havealso been proposed in which feedback plays no role: so long as a fixed fractionof the host gas supply is accreted, relations like those observed can bereproduced. here, we argue that the scatter in the observed bh-hostcorrelations, and its run with scale, presents a demanding constraint on anymodel for these correlations, and that it favors self-regulated models of bhgrowth. we show that the scatter in the stellar mass fraction within a radius rin observed ellipticals and spheroids increases strongly at small r. at fixedtotal stellar mass (or host velocity dispersion), on very small scales near thebh radius of influence, there is an order-of-magnitude scatter in the amount ofgas that must have entered and formed stars. in short, the bh appears to 'knowmore' about the global host galaxy potential on large scales than the stars andgas supply on small scales. this is predicted in self-regulated models;however, models where there is no feedback would generically predictorder-of-magnitude scatter in the bh-host correlations. likewise, models inwhich the bh feedback in the 'bright' mode does not regulate the growth of thebh itself, but sets the stellar mass of the galaxy by inducing star formationor blowing out a mass in gas much larger than the galaxy stellar mass, aredifficult to reconcile with the scatter on small scales.

0906.5358	the disruption of giant molecular clouds by radiation pressure and the  efficiency of star formation in galaxies	star formation is slow, in the sense that the gas consumption time is muchlonger than the dynamical time. it is also inefficient; essentially all starformation in local galaxies takes place in giant molecular clouds (gmcs), butthe fraction of a gmc converted to stars is very small, ~5%. in the mostluminous starbursts, the gmc lifetime is shorter than the main sequencelifetime of even the most massive stars, so that supernovae can play no role ingmc disruption. we investigate the disruption of gmcs across a wide range ofgalaxies, from normal spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into accountthe effects of hii gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, andradiation pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight ondust grains. in the milky way, we find that a combination of three mechanisms,jets, hii gas pressure, and radiation pressure, disrupts the clouds. in morerapidly star forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at high-redshift,ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and submillimeter galaxies, radiationpressure dominates natal cloud distribution. we predict the presence of 10-20clusters with masses ~10^7 msun in local ulirgs such as arp 220 and a similarnumber of clusters with m_* ~ 10^8 msun in high redshift clump galaxies;submillimeter galaxies will have even more massive clusters. we find that themass fraction of a gmc that ends up in stars is an increasing function of thegas surface density of a galaxy, reaching ~35% in the most luminous starbursts.furthermore, the disruption of bubbles by radiation pressure stirs theinterstellar medium to velocities of ~10 km/s in normal galaxies and to ~100km/s in ulirgs like arp 220, consistent with observations. thus, radiationpressure may play a dominant role in the ism of star-forming galaxies.

0908.4088	a maximum stellar surface density in dense stellar systems	we compile observations of the surface mass density profiles of dense stellarsystems, including globular clusters in the milky way and nearby galaxies,massive star clusters in nearby starbursts, nuclear star clusters in dwarfspheroidals and late-type disks, ultra-compact dwarfs, and galaxy spheroidsspanning the range from low-mass cusp bulges and ellipticals to massive coreellipticals. we show that in all cases the maximum stellar surface densityattained in the central regions of these systems is similar, sigma_max ~ 10^11m_sun/kpc^2 (~20 g/cm^2), despite the fact that the systems span 7 orders ofmagnitude in total stellar mass m_star, 5 in effective radius r_e, and have awide range in effective surface density m_star/r_e^2. the surface density limitis reached on a wide variety of physical scales in different systems and isthus not a limit on three-dimensional stellar density. given the very differentformation mechanisms involved in these different classes of objects, we arguethat a single piece of physics likely determines sigma_max. the radiationfields and winds produced by massive stars can have a significant influence onthe formation of both star clusters and galaxies, while neither supernovae norblack hole accretion are important in star cluster formation. we thus concludethat feedback from massive stars likely accounts for the observed sigma_max,plausibly because star formation reaches an eddington-like flux that regulatesthe growth of these diverse systems. this suggests that current models ofgalaxy formation, which focus on feedback from supernovae and active galacticnuclei, are missing a crucial ingredient.

1004.3290	massive star forming regions in the galaxy using the spitzer glimpse  survey	we examine the thirteen most luminous sources in the wmap free-free map usingthe spitzer glimpse and msx surveys to identify massive star formation regions,emitting one-third of the galactic free-free luminosity. we identify starforming regions by a combination of bubble morphology in 8 $\micronm$ (pah)emission and radio recombination line radial velocities. we find 40 starforming regions associated with our wmap sources, and determine uniquedistances to 31. we interpret the bubbles as evidence for radial expansion. theradial velocity distribution for each source allows us to measure the intrinsicspeed of a region's expansion. this speed is consistent with the size and ageof the bubbles. the high free-free luminosities, combined with negligiblesynchrotron emission, demonstrate that the bubbles are not driven bysupernovae. the kinetic energy of the largest bubbles is a substantial fractionof that measured in the older superbubbles found by heiles. we find that theenergy injected into the ism by our bubbles is similar to that required tomaintain the turbulent motion in the gas disk inside 8 kpc. we report a numberof new star forming regions powered by massive ($\textrm{m}_{*} &gt; 10^4\textrm{m}_\sun$) star clusters. we measure the scale height of the galactic ostars to be $h_{\textrm{*}} = 35 \pm 5 \pc$. we determine an empiricalrelationship between the pah and free-free emission of the form$f_{\textrm{pah}} \propto f^2_{\textrm{ff}}$. finally, we find that the bubblegeometry is more consistent with a spherical shell rather than a flatteneddisk.

1005.4419	radiation pressure from massive star clusters as a launching mechanism  for super-galactic winds	galactic outflows of low ionization, cool gas are ubiquitous in localstarburst galaxies, and in the majority of galaxies at high redshift. how thesecool outflows arise is still in question. hot gas from supernovae has long beensuspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendencyto destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. we propose a modificationof the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.  star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, thebulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. we showthat, for l* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with m&gt;10^6 m_sunis able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circularvelocity of the disk galaxy. this cool gas can travel above the galactic diskin less than 2 myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.once above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, andsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, whichdrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. because theradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gasis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction ifthey do eventually encounter hot gas. therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,radiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. we identify thesecluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. another implication ofour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, areable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. wefind that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cooloutflows will be launched to be ~0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreementwith observations.

1007.3270	star formation efficiencies and lifetimes of giant molecular clouds in  the milky way	we use a sample of the 13 most luminous wmap galactic free-free sources,responsible for 33% of the free- free emission of the milky way, to investigatestar formation. the sample contains 40 star forming complexes; we combine thissample with giant molecular cloud (gmc) catalogs in the literature, to identifythe host gmcs of 32 of the complexes. we estimate the star formation efficiencyepsilon_gmc and star formation rate per free-fall time epsilon_ff. we find thatepsilon_gmc ranges from 0.002 to 0.2, with an ionizing luminosity-weightedaverage epsilon_gmc = 0.08, compared to the galactic average = 0.005. turningto the star formation rate per free-fall time, we find values that range up toepsilon_ff = 1. weighting by ionizing luminosity, we find an average ofepsilon_ff = 0.16 - 0.24 depending on the estimate of the age of the system.once again, this is much larger than the galaxy-wide average value epsilon_ff =0.008. we show that the lifetimes of giant molecular clouds at the mean massfound in our sample is 17 plus or minus 4 myr, about two free-fall times. thegmcs hosting the most luminous clusters are being disrupted by those clusters.accordingly, we interpret the range in epsilon_ff as the result of atime-variable star formation rate; the rate of star formation increases withthe age of the host molecular cloud, until the stars disrupt the cloud. theseresults are inconsistent with the notion that the star formation rate in milkyway gmcs is determined by the properties of supersonic turbulence

1008.3397	low-ionization line emission from starburst galaxies: a new probe of  galactic-scale outflows	we study the kinematically narrow, low-ionization line emission from abright, starburst galaxy at z = 0.69 using slit spectroscopy obtained withkeck/lris. the spectrum reveals strong absorption in mgii and feii resonancetransitions with doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gasoutflow. emission in mgii near and redward of systemic velocity, in concertwith the observed absorption, yields a p cygni-like line profile similar tothose observed in the ly alpha transition in lyman break galaxies. further, themgii emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond theemission from stars and hii regions within the galaxy. assuming the emissionhas a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gasextends to distances &gt; ~7 kpc. we also detect several narrow feii*fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising fromenergy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. wesuggest that the mgii and feii* emission is generated by photon scattering inthe observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic predictionof outflows. these observations provide the first direct constraints on theminimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy.estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact ofoutflows in driving galaxy evolution.

1101.4940	self-regulated star formation in galaxies via momentum input from  massive stars	feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in shapingthe galaxy mass function, the structure of the interstellar medium (ism), andthe low efficiency of star formation, but the exact form of the feedback isuncertain. in this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novelnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum impartedto the ism by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. we employ a realisticcooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to &lt;100k, sothat the ism becomes highly inhomogeneous. despite this, our simulated galaxiesreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses toform giant molecular clouds (gmcs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,stellar feedback disperses the gmcs, repopulating the diffuse ism. thiscollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of smc-like dwarfs, themilky-way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. the simulated global star formationefficiencies are consistent with the observed kennicutt-schmidt relation.moreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numericallyimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and densityscaling. this is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, starformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very densegas available for forming stars. in contrast, in simulations without stellarfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-inducedturbulence, the ism experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. inthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceedobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,demonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of starformation in galaxies.

1104.0011	broadband transmission spectroscopy of the super-earth gj 1214b suggests  a low mean molecular weight atmosphere	we used wircam on cfht to observe four transits of the super-earth gj 1214bin the near-infrared. for each transit we observed in two bandsnearly-simultaneously by rapidly switching the wircam filter wheel back andforth for the duration of the observations. by combining all our j-band (~1.25microns) observations we find a transit depth in this band of 1.338\pm0.013% -a value consistent with the optical transit depth reported by charbonneau andcollaborators. however, our best-fit combined ks-band (~2.15 microns) transitdepth is deeper: 1.438\pm0.019%. formally our ks-band transits are deeper thanthe j-band transits observed simultaneously by a factor of 1.072\pm0.018 - a4-sigma discrepancy. the most straightforward explanation for our deeperks-band depth is a spectral absorption feature from the limb of the atmosphereof the planet; for the spectral absorption feature to be this prominent theatmosphere of gj 1214b must have a large scale height and a low mean molecularweight. that is, it would have to be hydrogen/helium dominated and this planetwould be better described as a mini-neptune. however, recently publishedobservations from 0.78 - 1.0 microns, by bean and collaborators, show a lack ofspectral features and transit depths consistent with those obtained bycharbonneau and collaborators. the most likely atmospheric composition for gj1214b that arises from combining all these observations is less clear; if theatmosphere of gj 1214b is hydrogen/helium dominated then it must have either ahaze layer that is obscuring transit depth differences at shorter wavelengths,or significantly different spectral features than current models predict. ourobservations disfavour a water-world composition, but such a composition willremain a possibility until observations reconfirm our deeper ks-band transitdepth or detect features at other wavelengths.

1106.3083	star formation in massive clusters via bondi accretion	essentially all stars form in giant molecular clouds (gmcs). however, insidegmcs, most of the gas does not participate in star formation; rather, densergas accumulates in clumps in the gmc, with the bulk of the stars in a given gmcforming in a few of the most massive clumps. in the milky way, these clumpshave masses $m_{\rm cl}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$ of the gmc, radii $r_{\rm cl}\sim 1$pc, and free-fall times $\tau_{\rm cl} \sim 2\times 10^5\yr$. we showthat clumps inside giant molecular clouds should accrete at a modified bondiaccretion rate, which depends on clump mass as $\dot m_{\rm cl}\sim m_{\rmcl}^{5/4}$. this rate is initially rather slow, usually slower than the initialstar formation rate inside the clump (we adopt the common assumption thatinside the clump, $\dot m_*=\epsilon_{\rm ff} m_{\rm cl}/\tau_{\rm cl}$, with$\epsilon_{\rm ff} \approx 0.017$). however, after $\sim 2$ gmc free-fall times$\tau_{\rm gmc}$, the clump accretion rate accelerates rapidly; formally, theclump can accrete the entire gmc in $\sim 3\tau_{\rm gmc}$. at the same time,the star formation rate accelerates, tracking the bondi accretion rate. if thegmc is disrupted by feedback from the largest clump, half the stars in thatclump form in the final $\taug$ before the gmc is disrupted. the theorypredicts that the distribution of effective star formation rates, measured pergmc free-fall time, is broad, ranging from $\sim 0.001$ up to 0.1 or larger andthat the mass spectrum of star clusters is flatter than that of clumps,consistent with observations.

1110.4636	the structure of the interstellar medium of star forming galaxies	we present numerical methods for including stellar feedback in galaxy-scalesimulations. we include heating by sne (i &amp; ii), gas recycling andshock-heating from o-star &amp; agb winds, hii photoionization, and radiationpressure from stellar photons. the energetics and time-dependence are takendirectly from stellar evolution models. we implement these in simulations withpc-scale resolution, modeling galaxies from smc-like dwarfs and mw analogues tomassive z~2 starburst disks. absent feedback, gas cools and collapses withoutlimit. with feedback, the ism reaches a multi-phase steady state in which gmcscontinuously form, disperse, and re-form. our primary results include: (1) starforming galaxies generically self-regulate at toomre q~1. most of the volume isin diffuse hot gas with most of the mass in dense gmc complexes. the phasestructure and gas mass at high densities are much more sensitive probes ofstellar feedback physics than integrated quantities (toomre q or gas velocitydispersion). (2) different feedback mechanisms act on different scales:radiation &amp; hii pressure are critical to prevent runaway collapse of dense gasin gmcs. sne and stellar winds dominate the dynamics of volume-filling hot gas;however this primarily vents out of the disk. (3) the galaxy-averaged sfr isdetermined by feedback. for given feedback efficiency, restricting starformation to molecular gas or modifying the cooling function has little effect;but changing feedback mechanisms directly translates to shifts off thekennicutt-schmidt relation. (4) self-gravity leads to marginally-bound gmcswith an ~m^-2 mass function with a cutoff at the jeans mass; they live a fewdynamical times before being disrupted by stellar feedback and turn ~1-10% oftheir mass into stars (increasing from dwarfs through starburst galaxies).low-mass gmcs are preferentially unbound.

1110.4638	stellar feedback in galaxies and the origin of galaxy-scale winds	feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in drivinggalactic super-winds that enrich the igm and shape the galaxy mass function andmass-metallicity relation. in previous papers, we introduced new numericalmethods for implementing stellar feedback on sub-gmc through galactic scales ingalaxy simulations. this includes radiation pressure (uv through ir), sne(type-i &amp; ii), stellar winds ('fast' o-star through 'slow' agb winds), and hiiphotoionization. here, we show that these feedback mechanisms drive galacticwinds with outflow rates as high as ~10-20 times the galaxy sfr. themass-loading efficiency (wind mass loss rate divided by sfr) scales inverselywith circular velocity, consistent with momentum-conservation expectations. westudy the contributions of each feedback mechanism to galactic winds in a rangeof galaxy models, from smc-like dwarfs &amp; mw-analogues to z~2 clumpy disks. inmassive, gas-rich systems (local starbursts and high-z galaxies), radiationpressure dominates the wind generation. for mw-like spirals and dwarf galaxiesthe gas densities are much lower, and shock-heated gas from sne and stellarwinds dominates production of large-scale outflows. in all models, however,winds have a multi-phase structure that depends on interactions betweenmultiple feedback mechanisms operating on different spatial &amp; time scales: anysingle mechanism fails to reproduce the winds observed. we provide fittingfunctions for wind mass-loading and velocities as a function of galaxyproperties, for use in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. thesediffer from typically-adopted formulae with explicit dependence on gas surfacedensity that can be very important in both low-density dwarf galaxies andhigh-density gas-rich galaxies.

1110.6655	on the dynamics and tidal dissipation rate of the white dwarf in 4u  1820-30	it has been suggested that the 170 day period in the light curve of the lowmass x-ray binary 4u 1820-30 arises from the presence of a third body with alarge inclination to the binary orbit. we show that this long period motionarises if the system is librating around the stable fixed point in a kozairesonance. we demonstrate that mass transfer drives the system toward thisfixed point, and calculate, both analytically and via numerical integrations,that the period of libration is of order 170 days when the mutual inclinationis near the kozai critical value. the non-zero eccentricity of the binary,combined with tidal dissipation, implies that the rate of change of the binaryperiod would be slower than, or even of opposite sign to, that implied bystandard mass transfer models. if the 170 day period results from libration,then, contrary to appearances, the orbital period of the inner binary isincreasing with time; in that case, (e/0.009)^2q/k_2 &gt; 2.5 x 10^9, where k_2 =0.01 is the tidal love number and e = 0.009 is the fiducial eccentricity of theinner binary. it appears unlikely that the observed negative period derivativeresults from the smaller than expected (but positive) value of \dot p combinedwith the previously suggested acceleration of the system in the gravitationalfield of the host globular cluster ngc 6624. the discrepancy between theobserved and expected period derivative requires further investigation.

1111.6591	stellar feedback &amp; bulge formation in clumpy disks	we use numerical simulations of isolated galaxies to study the effects ofstellar feedback on the formation and evolution of giant star-forming gas'clumps' in high-redshift, gas-rich galaxies. such galactic disks are unstableto the formation of bound gas-rich clumps whose properties initially dependonly on global disk properties, not the microphysics of feedback. insimulations without stellar feedback, clumps turn an order-unity fraction oftheir mass into stars and sink to the center, forming a large bulge and kickingmost of the stars out into a much more extended stellar envelope. by contrast,strong radiative stellar feedback disrupts even the most massive clumps afterthey turn ~10-20% of their mass into stars, in a timescale of ~10-100 myr,ejecting some material into a super-wind and recycling the rest of the gas intothe diffuse ism. this suppresses the bulge formation rate by direct 'clumpcoalescence' by a factor of several. however, the galactic disks do undergosignificant internal evolution in the absence of mergers: clumps form anddisrupt continuously and torque gas to the galactic center. the resultingevolution is qualitatively similar to bar/spiral evolution in simulations witha more homogeneous ism.

1206.1525	a giant metrewave radio telescope/chandra view of iras 09104+4109: a  type 2 qso in a cooling flow	iras 09104+4109 is a rare example of a dust enshrouded type 2 qso in thecentre of a cool-core galaxy cluster. previous observations of this z=0.44system showed that as well as powering the hyper-luminous infrared emission ofthe cluster-central galaxy, the qso is associated with a double-lobed radiosource. however, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between thejets and ionised optical emission suggested that the orientation of the qso hadrecently changed. we use a combination of new, multi-band giant metrewave radiotelescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are nolonger powered by the qso, and estimate their age to be 120-160 myr. this is inagreement with the ~70-200 myr age previously estimated for star-formation inthe galaxy. previously unpublished very long baseline array data reveal a 200pc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely alignedwith the current qso axis and may represent a more recent period of jetactivity. these results suggest that the realignment of the qso, the cessationof jet activity, and the onset of rapid star-formation may have been caused bya gas-rich galaxy merger. a chandra x-ray observation confirms the presence ofcavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required toinflate them to be ~7.7x10^60 erg. the mechanical power of the jets issufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided they areefficiently coupled to the intra-cluster medium (icm). we find no evidence ofdirect radiative heating and conclude that the qso either lacks the radiativeluminosity to heat the icm, or that it requires longer than 100-200 myr tosignificantly impact its environment.

1210.4562	dark matter substructure detection using spatially resolved spectroscopy  of lensed dusty galaxies	we investigate how strong lensing of dusty, star-forming galaxies byforeground galaxies can be used as a probe of dark matter halo substructure. wefind that spatially resolved spectroscopy of lensed sources allows dramaticimprovements to measurements of lens parameters. in particular we find thatmodeling of the full, three-dimensional (angular position and radial velocity)data can significantly facilitate substructure detection, increasing thesensitivity of observables to lower mass subhalos. we carry out simulations oflensed dusty sources observed by early alma (cycle 1) and use a fisher matrixanalysis to study the parameter degeneracies and mass detection limits of thismethod. we find that, even with conservative assumptions, it is possible todetect galactic dark matter subhalos of ~ 10^8 m_{\odot} with high significancein most lensed dsfgs. specifically, we find that in typical dsfg lenses, thereis a ~ 55 % probability of detecting a substructure with m&gt;10^8 m_{\odot} withmore than 5 sigma detection significance in each lens, if the abundance ofsubstructure is consistent with previous lensing results. the full alma array,with its significantly enhanced sensitivity and resolution, should improvethese estimates considerably. given the sample of ~100 lenses provided bysurveys like the south pole telescope, our understanding of dark mattersubstructure in typical galaxy halos is poised to improve dramatically over thenext few years.

1301.0841	resolving the generation of starburst winds in galaxy mergers	we study galaxy super-winds driven in major mergers, using pc-resolutionsimulations with detailed models for stellar feedback that canself-consistently follow the formation/destruction of gmcs and generation ofwinds. the models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densitiesin gmcs, and gas recycling and feedback from sne (i&amp;ii), stellar winds, andradiation pressure. we study mergers of systems from smc-like dwarfs and milkyway analogues to z~2 starburst disks. multi-phase super-winds are generated inall passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 m_sun/yr. however, the windmass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by sfr) is similar to that inisolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxyproperties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of themerger. winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build upcomplex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at arange of radii. the winds have complex velocity and phase structure, withmaterial at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,ionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedbackmechanisms. these simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-inducedstarbursts. but despite large mass-loading factors (&gt;~10) in the winds, thepeak sfrs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations. wind accelerationdoes not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum andform stars, while blowing out gas that would not have participated in thestarburst in the first place. considerable wind material is not unbound, andfalls back on the disk at later times post-merger, leading to higherpost-starburst sfrs in the presence of stellar feedback. this may require agnfeedback to explain galaxy quenching.

1301.4500	accretion does not drive the turbulence in galactic disks	rapid accretion of cold gas plays a crucial role in getting gas intogalaxies. it has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrowstreams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas,dynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. in cosmological simulations,however, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect ofaccretion from internal instabilities and mergers. moreover, in mostcosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the ism arisingfrom stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannotgenerate ism turbulence. in this paper we therefore test the effects of coldstreams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxydisks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include orexclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates,velocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. we find: (1)turbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without thecold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets thedisk. (2) in runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow hasessentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formationrates (sfrs) that are far too large. (3) disks in runs with feedback and coldflows have higher sfrs, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) becauseflows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonantresponses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (bulge formation viainstabilities is not accelerated). (5) however, flows can thicken the disk bydirect contribution of out-of-plane streams. we conclude that while inflows arecritical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angularmomentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects ongalaxies.

1303.0285	the meaning and consequences of star formation criteria in galaxy models  with resolved stellar feedback	we consider the effects of different star formation criteria on galacticscales, in high-resolution simulations with explicitly resolved gmcs andstellar feedback. we compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the localvirial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to highdensity in a free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) amolecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a jeans-instabilityrequirement, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times,and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. we consider these both mw-like andhigh-density (starburst) galaxies. with feedback present, all models produceidentical integrated star formation rates (sfrs), in agreement with thekennicutt relation. without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessivesfrs. this is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the sf law.however, the spatial and density distribution of sf depend strongly on the sfcriteria. because cooling rates are generally fast and gas is turbulent,criteria (4)-(7) are 'weak' and spread sf uniformly over the disk (abovedensities n~0.01-0.1 cm^-3). a molecular criterion (3) localizes to higherdensities, but still a wide range; for z z_solar, it is similar to a densitythreshold at n~1 cm^-3 (well below mean densities in the mw center orstarbursts). fixed density thresholds (2) can always select the highestdensities, but must be adjusted for simulation resolution and galaxyproperties; the same threshold that works in a mw-like simulation will selectnearly all gas in a starburst. binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively selectthe largest over-densities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, andautomatically predict clustered sf. we argue that this sf model is mostphysically-motivated and presents significant numerical advantages inlarge-dynamic range simulations.

1303.6286	what controls star formation in the central 500 pc of the galaxy?	the star formation rate (sfr) in the central molecular zone (cmz, i.e. thecentral 500 pc) of the milky way is lower by a factor of &gt;10 than expected forthe substantial amount of dense gas it contains, which challenges current starformation theories. in this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms couldbe responsible. on scales larger than the disc scale height, the low sfr isfound to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secularinstabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the galactic bar.the cmz is marginally toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highlytoomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensationrate of self-gravitating clouds. on small scales, we find that the sfr in thecmz may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to thehigh turbulent pressure. the existence of a universal density threshold forstar formation is ruled out. the hi-h$_2$ phase transition of hydrogen, thetidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavyinitial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressurefeedback also cannot individually explain the low sfr. we propose aself-consistent cycle of star formation in the cmz, in which the effects ofseveral different processes combine to inhibit star formation. therate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas towards collapse - oncestar formation is initiated it proceeds at a normal rate. the ubiquity of starformation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central sfr should be a commonphenomenon in other galaxies. we discuss the implications for galactic-scalestar formation and supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results tothe star formation conditions in other extreme environments.

1304.6405	scattered emission from z~1 galactic outflows	mapping mg ii resonance emission scattered by galactic winds offers a meansto determine the spatial extent and density of the warm outflow. usingkeck/lris spectroscopy, we have resolved scattered mg ii emission to the eastof 32016857, a star-forming galaxy at z =0.9392 with an outflow. the mg iiemission from this galaxy exhibits a p-cygni profile, extends further than boththe continuum and [o ii] emission along the eastern side of the slit, and has aconstant doppler shift along the slit which does not follow the velocitygradient of the nebular [o ii] emission. using the sobolev approximation, wederive the density of mg+ ions at a radius of 12 to 18 kpc in the outflow. wemodel the ionization correction and find that much of the outflowing mg is inmg++. we estimate that the total mass flux could be as large as 330 - 500 solarmasses per year, with the largest uncertainties coming from the depletion of mgonto grains and the clumpiness of the warm outflow. we show that confining thewarm clouds with a hot wind reduces the estimated mass flux of the warm outflowand indicates amass-loading factor near unity in the warm phase alone. based onthe high blue luminosities that distinguish 32016857 and tkrs 4389, describedby rubin et al. 2011, from other galaxies with p-cygni emission, we suggestthat, as sensitivity to diffuse emission improves, scattering halos may proveto be a generic property of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

1305.2191	on wd-wd mergers in triple systems: the role of kozai resonance with  tidal friction	white dwarf-white dwarf (wd-wd) mergers may lead to type ia supernovaeevents. thompson (2011) suggested that many such binaries are produced inhierarchical triple systems. the tertiary induces eccentricity oscillations inthe inner binary via the kozai-lidov mechanism, driving the binary to higheccentricities, and significantly reducing the gravitational wave mergertimescale (t_gw) over a broad range of parameter space. here, we investigatethe role of tidal forces in these systems. we show that tidal effects areimportant in the regime of moderately high initial relative inclination betweenthe inner binary and the outer tertiary. for 85 &lt; i_0 &lt; 90 degrees (prograde)and 97 &lt; i_0 &lt; 102 degrees (retrograde), tides combine with gw radiation todramatically decrease t_gw. in the regime of high inclinations between 91 &lt; i_0&lt; 96 degrees, the inner binary likely suffers a direct collision, as in thework of katz &amp; dong (2012) and tidal effects do not play an important role.

1308.3674	black hole triple dynamics: breakdown of the orbit average approximation  and implications for gravitational wave detections	coalescing black hole (bh) binaries forming in the dense core of globularclusters (gcs) are expected to be one the brightest sources of gravitationalwave (gw) radiation for the next generation of ground-based laserinterferometers. favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the kozairesonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,typically another bh, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner bh binaryeccentricity. in this paper we perform high precision n-body simulations of thelong term evolution of hierarchical bh triples and investigate the conditionsthat lead to the merging of the bh binary and the way it might become anobservable source of gw radiation. we find that the secular orbit averagetreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamicsof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer bh on a highly inclinedorbit at a moderate distance. during the high eccentricity phase of a kozaicycle the torque due to the outer bh can drive the binary to extremely largeeccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. this occurs beforerelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary gwsignal to reach large gw frequencies (&gt;~10 hz) at high eccentricities. we showthat ~50 % of coalescing bh binaries driven by the kozai mechanism in gcs willhave eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10 % of them being extremelyeccentric, (1-e)&lt;~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band of groundbased laser interferometers. this implies that a large fraction of such gwsources could be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used foranalysis of gw detectors data. the efficient detection of all coalescing bhbinaries in gcs will therefore require template banks of eccentric inspiralwaveforms for matched-filtering and dedicated search strategies.

1310.1099	hot galactic winds constrained by the x-ray luminosities of galaxies	galactic superwinds may be driven by very hot outflows generated byoverlapping supernovae within the host galaxy. we use the chevalier &amp; clegg(cc85) wind model and the observed correlation between x-ray luminosities ofgalaxies and their sfrs to constrain the mass loss rates (\dot{m}_hot) across awide range of star formation rates (sfrs), from dwarf starbursts toultra-luminous infrared galaxies. we show that for fixed thermalizationefficiency and mass loading rate, the x-ray luminosity of the hot wind scalesas l_x ~ sfr^2, significantly steeper than is observed for star-forminggalaxies: l_x ~ sfr. using this difference we constrain the mass-loading andthermalization efficiency of hot galactic winds. for reasonable values of thethermalization efficiency (&lt;~ 1) and for sfr &gt;~ 10 m_sun/yr we find that\dot{m}_hot/sfr &lt;~ 1, significantly lower than required by integratedconstraints on the efficiency of stellar feedback in galaxies, and potentiallytoo low to explain observations of winds from rapidly star-forming galaxies. inaddition, we highlight the fact that heavily mass-loaded winds cannot bedescribed by the adiabatic cc85 model because they become strongly radiative.

1310.5721	detection of warm and diffuse baryons in large scale structure from the  cross-correlation of gravitational lensing and the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich  effect	we report the first detection of a correlation between gravitational lensingby large scale structure and the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect. usingthe mass map from the canada france hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens)and a newly-constructed tsz map from planck, we measure a non-zero correlationbetween the two maps out to one degree angular separation on the sky, with anoverall significance of 6 sigma. the tsz maps are formed in a manner thatremoves primary cosmic microwave background fluctuations and minimizes residualcontamination by galactic and extragalactic dust emission, and by co lineemission. we perform numerous tests to show that our measurement is immune tothese residual contaminants. the resulting correlation function is consistentwith the existence of a warm baryonic gas tracing the large scale structurewith a bias b_gas. given the shape of the lensing kernel, our signalsensitivity peaks at a redshift z~0.4, where half a degree separation on thesky corresponds to a physical scale of ~10 mpc. the amplitude of the signalconstrains the product (b_gas/1)(t_e / 0.1 kev)(n_e / 1 m^-3)=2.01\pm 0.31\pm0.21, at redshift zero. our study suggests that a substantial fraction of the"missing" baryons in the universe may reside in a low density warm plasma thattraces dark matter.

1403.1874	radiation feedback in ulirgs: are photons movers and shakers?	we use our variable eddington tensor (vet) radiation hydrodynamics code toperform two-dimensional simulations to study the impact of radiation forces onatmospheres composed of dust and gas. our setup closely follows that ofkrumholz &amp; thompson, assuming that dust and gas are well-coupled and that theradiation field is characterized by blackbodies with temperatures &gt;~ 80 k, asmight be found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. in agreement with previouswork, we find that rayleigh-taylor instabilities develop in radiation supportedatmospheres, leading to inhomogeneities that limit momentum exchange betweenradiation and dusty gas, and eventually providing a near balance of theradiation and gravitational forces. however, the evolution of the velocity andspatial distributions of the gas differs significantly from previous work,which utilized a less accurate flux-limited diffusion (fld) method. our vetsimulations show continuous net acceleration of the gas, with no steady-statereached by the end of the simulation. in contrast, fld results show little netacceleration of the gas and settle in to a quasi-steady, turbulent state withlow velocity dispersion. the discrepancies result primarily from the inabilityof fld to properly model the variation of the radiation field around structuresthat are less than a few optical depths across. we conclude that radiationfeedback remains a viable mechanism for driving high-mach number turbulence. wediscuss implications for observed systems and global numerical simulations offeedback, but more realistic setups are needed to make robust observationalpredictions and assess the prospect of launching outflows with radiation.

1405.2342	secular effects of tidal damping in compact planetary systems	we describe the long-term evolution of compact systems of terrestrialplanets, using a set of simulations that match the statistical properties ofthe observed exoplanet distribution. the evolution is driven by tidaldissipation in the planetary interiors, but the systems evolve as a whole dueto secular gravitational interactions. we find that, for earth-like dissipationlevels, planetary orbits can be circularised out to periods of order 100 days,an order of magnitude larger than is possible for single planets. the resultingdistribution of eccentricities is a qualitative match to that inferred fromtransit timing variations, with a minority of non-zero eccentricitiesmaintained by particular secular configurations. the coupling of the tidal andsecular processes enhance the inward migration of the innermost planets inthese systems, and can drive them to short orbital periods. resonantinteractions of both the mean motion and secular variety are observed, althoughthe interactions are not strong enough to drive systemic instability in mostcases. however, we demonstrate that these systems can easily be driven unstableif coupled to giant planets on longer period orbits.

1406.4148	time varying dynamical star formation rate	we present numerical evidence of dynamic star formation in which the accretedstellar mass grows superlinearly with time, roughly as $t^2$. we performsimulations of star formation in self-gravitating hydrodynamic andmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulence that is continuously driven. by turning theself-gravity of the gas in the simulations on or off, we demonstrate thatself-gravity is the dominant physical effect setting the mass accretion rate atearly times before feedback effects take over, contrary to theories ofturbulence-regulated star formation. we find that gravitational collapsesteepens the density profile around stars, generating the power-law tail onwhat is otherwise a lognormal density probability distribution function.furthermore, we find turbulent velocity profiles to flatten inside collapsingregions, altering the size-linewidth relation. this local flattening reflectsenhancements of turbulent velocity on small scales, as verified by changes tothe velocity power spectra. our results indicate that gas self-gravitydynamically alters both density and velocity structures in clouds, giving riseto a time-varying star formation rate. we find that a substantial fraction ofthe gas that forms stars arrives via low density flows, as opposed to accretingthrough high density filaments.

1406.5206	dynamics of dusty radiation pressure driven shells and clouds: fast  outflows from galaxies, star clusters, massive stars, and agn	it is typically assumed that radiation pressure driven winds are acceleratedto an asymptotic velocity of v ~ v_esc, where v_esc is the escape velocity fromthe central source. we note that this is not the case for dusty shells andclouds. instead, if the shell or cloud is initially optically-thick to the uvemission from the source of luminosity l, then there is a significant boost inv that reflects the integral of the momentum absorbed as it is accelerated. forshells reaching a generalized eddington limit, we show that v ~ (4r_uv l/m_shc)^1/2, in both point-mass and isothermal-sphere potentials, where r_uv is theradius where the shell becomes optically-thin to uv photons, and m_sh is themass of the shell. the asymptotic velocity significantly exceeds v_esc fortypical parameters, and can explain the ~1000-2000km/s outflows observed fromrapidly star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei if the surroundinghalo has low gas density. similarly fast outflows from massive stars can beaccelerated on few - 10^3 yr timescales. these results carry over to cloudsthat subtend only a small fraction of the solid angle from the source ofradiation and that expand as a consequence of their internal sound speed. wefurther consider the dynamics of shells that sweep up a dense circumstellar orcircumgalactic medium. we calculate the "momentum ratio" mdot v/(l/c) in theshell limit and show that it can only significantly exceed ~2 if the effectiveoptical depth of the shell to re-radiated fir photons is much larger thanunity. we discuss simple prescriptions for the properties of galactic outflowsfor use in large-scale cosmological simulations. we also briefly discussapplications to the dusty ejection episodes of massive stars, the disruption ofgiant molecular clouds, and agn.

1501.03155	gusty, gaseous flows of fire: galactic winds in cosmological simulations  with explicit stellar feedback	we present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the fire(feedback in realistic environments) simulations. this suite of hydrodynamiccosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of star-forming giantmolecular clouds to $z=0$, and features an explicit stellar feedback model onsmall scales. our simulations reveal that high redshift galaxies undergo burstsof star formation followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflows that ejectmuch of the ism and temporarily suppress star formation. at low redshift,however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to l*-progenitors developstable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formationthat does not drive outflows far into the halo. mass-loading factors for windsin l*-progenitors are $\eta \approx 10$ at high redshift, but decrease to $\eta\ll 1$ at low redshift. although lower values of $\eta$ are expected as halosgrow in mass over time, we show that the strong suppression of outflows withdecreasing redshift cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. circumgalacticoutflow velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically rangebetween one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. much of theejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the circumgalacticmedium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel further star formation.however, a fraction of the gas that leaves the virial radius through galacticwinds is never regained, causing most halos with mass $m_h \le 10^{12}m_{\odot}$ to be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by $z=0$.

1503.07880	the difficulty of getting high escape fractions of ionizing photons from  high-redshift galaxies: a view from the fire cosmological simulations	we present a series of high-resolution (20-2000 msun, 0.1-4 pc) cosmologicalzoom-in simulations at z~6 from the feedback in realistic environment (fire)project. these simulations cover halo masses 10^9-10^11 msun and rest-frameultraviolet magnitude muv = -9 to -19. these simulations include explicitmodels of the multi-phase ism, star formation, and stellar feedback, whichproduce reasonable galaxy properties at z = 0-6. we post-process the snapshotswith a radiative transfer code to evaluate the escape fraction (fesc) ofhydrogen ionizing photons. we find that the instantaneous fesc has large timevariability (0.01%-20%), while the time-averaged fesc over long time-scalesgenerally remains ~5%, considerably lower than the estimate in manyreionization models. we find no strong dependence of fesc on galaxy mass orredshift. in our simulations, the intrinsic ionizing photon budgets aredominated by stellar populations younger than 3 myr, which tend to be buried indense birth clouds. the escaping photons mostly come from populations between3-10 myr, whose birth clouds have been largely cleared by stellar feedback.however, these populations only contribute a small fraction of intrinsicionizing photon budgets according to standard stellar population models. weshow that fesc can be boosted to high values, if stellar populations older than3 myr produce more ionizing photons than standard stellar population models (asmotivated by, e.g., models including binaries). by contrast, runaway stars withvelocities suggested by observations can enhance fesc by only a small fraction.we show that "sub-grid" star formation models, which do not explicitly resolvestar formation in dense clouds with n &gt;&gt; 1 cm^-3, will dramaticallyover-predict fesc.

astro-ph;0105425	transport of magnetic fields in convective, accreting supernova cores	we consider the amplification and transport of a magnetic field in thecollapsed core of a massive star, including both the region between theneutrinosphere and the shock, and the central, opaque core. an analyticalargument explains why rapid convective overturns persist within a newly formedneutron star for roughly 10 seconds ($&gt; 10^3$ overturns), consistent withrecent numerical models. a dynamical balance between turbulent and magneticstresses within this convective layer corresponds to flux densities in excessof $10^{15}$g. material accreting onto the core is heated by neutrinos and alsobecomes strongly convective. we compare the expected magnetic stresses in thisconvective `gain layer' with those deep inside the neutron core.  buoyant motions of magnetized fluid are greatly aided by the intense neutrinoflux. we calculate the transport rate through a medium containing free neutronsprotons, and electrons, in the limiting cases of degenerate or non-degeneratenucleons. fields stronger than $\sim 10^{13}$ g are able to rise through theouter degenerate layers of the neutron core during the last stages ofkelvin-helmholtz cooling (up to 10 seconds post-collapse), even though theselayers have become stable to convection. we also find the equilibrium shape ofa thin magnetic flux rope in the dense hydrostatic atmosphere of the neutronstar, along with the critical separation of the footpoints above which the ropeundergoes unlimited expansion against gravity. the implications of theseresults for pulsar magnetism are summarized, and applied to the case of latefallback over the first 1,000-10,000 s of the life of a neutron star

astro-ph;0107414	hst stis observations of pg 0946+301: the highest quality uv spectrum of  a balqso	we describe deep (40 orbits) hst/stis observations of the balqso pg 0946+301and make them available to the community. these observations are the major partof a multi-wavelength campaign on this object aimed at determining theionization equilibrium and abundances (iea) in broad absorption line (bal)qsos. we present simple template fits to the entire data set, which yield firmidentifications for more than two dozen bals from 18 ions and give lower limitsfor the ionic column densities. we find that the outflow's metalicity isconsistent with being solar, while the abundance ratio of phosphorus to othermetals is at least ten times solar. these findings are based on diagnosticsthat are not sensitive to saturation and partial covering effects in the bals,which considerably weakened previous claims for enhanced metalicity. ampleevidence for these effects is seen in the spectrum. we also discuss severaloptions for extracting tighter iea constraints in future analyses, and presentthe significant temporal changes which are detected between these spectra andthose taken by the hst/fos in 1992.

astro-ph;0204254	hot settling accretion flow onto a spinning black hole	we study the structure and properties of hot mhd accretion onto a kerr blackhole. in such a system, the hole is magnetically coupled to the inflowing gasand exerts a torque onto the accretion flow. a hot settling flow can formaround the hole and transport the angular momentum outward, to the outer edgeof the flow. unlike other hot flows, such as advection- andconvection-dominated flows and inflow-outflow solutions (adafs, cdafs, andadios), the properties of the hot settling flow are determined by the spin ofthe central black hole, but are insensitive to the mass accretion rate.therefore, it may be possible to identify rapidly spinning bhs simply fromtheir broad-band spectra.  observationally, the hot settling flow around a kerr hole is somewhat similarto other hot flows in that they all have hard, power-law spectra and relativelylow luminosities. thus, most black hole candidates in the low/hard and,perhaps, intermediate x-ray state may potentially accrete via the hot settlingflow. however, a settling flow will be somewhat more luminous thanadafs/cdafs/adios, will exhibit high variability in x-rays, and may haverelativistic jets. this suggests that galactic microquasars and active galacticnuclei may be powered by hot settling flows. we identify several galactic x-raysources as the best candidates.

astro-ph;0208123	x-ray versus optical observations of active galactic nuclei: evidence  for large grains?	recently, maiolino et al. (2001a, a&amp;a, 365, 28) constructed a sample ofactive galactic nuclei for which both the reddening e(b-v) and the columndensity n_h to the nucleus could be determined. for most of the galaxies intheir sample, they found that e(b-v)/n_h is substantially smaller than for thediffuse ism of our galaxy. they asserted that either the dust-to-gas ratio islower than in the galaxy or that the grains are so large that they do notextinct or redden efficiently in the optical. we show that there is nosystematic increase in e(b-v) with n_h for the maiolino et al. (2001a)galaxies, which suggests that the x-ray absorption and optical extinction occurin distinct media.  maiolino et al. (2001b, a&amp;a, 365, 37) suggested that the observed lines ofsight for the maiolino et al. (2001a) galaxies pass through the ``torus'' thatobscures the broad line region and nuclear continuum in seyfert 2 galaxies andargued that the torus grains are larger than galactic grains. there is noreason to believe that the lines of sight for these galaxies pass through thetorus, since the observed column densities are lower than those typicallyobserved in seyfert 2 galaxies. we suggest instead that the x-ray absorptionoccurs in material located off the torus and/or accretion disk while theoptical extinction occurs in material located beyond the torus. the x-rayabsorbing material could either be dust-free or could contain large grains thatdo not extinct efficently in the optical. there is no conclusive evidence thatthe grains in active galactic nuclei are systematically larger than those inthe diffuse ism of our galaxy.

astro-ph;0309805	on the flux of extra-solar dust in earth's atmosphere	micron size extrasolar dust particles have been convincingly detected bysatellites. larger extrasolar meteoroids (5-35 microns) have most likely beendetected by ground based radar at arecibo and new zealand. we present estimatesof the minimum detectable particle sizes and collecting areas for both radarsystems. we show that particles larger than about 10 microns can propagate fortens of parsecs through the interstellar medium, opening up the possibilitythat ground based radar systems can detect agb stars, young stellar objectssuch as t tauri stars, and debris disks around vega-like stars. we provideanalytical and numerical estimates of the ejection velocity in the case of adebris disk interacting with a jupiter mass planet. we provide rough estimatesof the flux of large micrometeoroids from all three classes of sources. currentradar systems are unlikely to detect significant numbers of meteors from debrisdisks such as beta pictoris. however, we suggest improvements to radar systemsthat should allow for the detection of multiple examples of all three classes.

astro-ph;0406070	on the maximum luminosity of galaxies and their central black holes:  feedback from momentum-driven winds	we investigate large-scale galactic winds driven by momentum deposition.momentum injection is provided by (1) radiation pressure produced by thecontinuum absorption and scattering of uv photons on dust grains and (2)supernovae. uv radiation can be produced by a starburst or agn activity. weargue that momentum-driven winds are an efficient mechanism for feedback duringthe formation of galaxies. we show that above a limiting luminosity, momentumdeposition from star formation can expel a significant fraction of the gas in agalaxy. the limiting, eddington-like luminosity is $l_{\rm m}\simeq(4f_g c/g)\sigma^4$, where $\sigma$ is the galaxy velocity dispersion and $f_g$ is thegas fraction. a starburst that attains $l_{\rm m}$ moderates its star formationrate and its luminosity does not increase significantly further. we argue thatellipticals attain this limit during their growth at $z \gtrsim 1$ and thatthis is the origin of the faber-jackson relation. we show that lyman breakgalaxies and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies have luminosities near $l_{\rmm}$. star formation is unlikely to efficiently remove gas from very smallscales in galactic nuclei, i.e., scales much smaller than that of a nuclearstarburst. this gas is available to fuel a central black hole (bh). we arguethat a bh clears gas out of its galactic nucleus when the luminosity of the bhitself reaches $\approx l_{\rm m}$. this shuts off the fuel supply to the bhand may also terminate star formation in the surrounding galaxy. as a result,the bh mass is fixed to be $m_{\rm bh}\simeq (f_g \kappa_{\rm es}/\pig^2)\sigma^4$, where $\kappa_{\rm es}$ is the electron scattering opacity. thislimit is in accord with the observed $m_{\rm bh}-\sigma$ relation.

astro-ph;0503579	modeling the resonant planetary system gj876	the two planets about the star gj 876 appear to have undergone extensivemigration from their point of origin in the protoplanetary disk -- both becauseof their close proximity to the star (30 and 60 day orbital periods) andbecause of their occupying three stable orbital resonances at the 2:1mean-motion commensurability. the resonances were most likely established byconverging differential migration of the planets leading to capture into theresonances. a problem with this scenario is that continued migration of thesystem while it is trapped in the resonances leads to orbital eccentricitiesthat rapidly exceed the observational upper limits of e_1 = 0.31 and e_2 =0.05. as seen in forced 3-body simulations, lower eccentricities would persistduring migration only for an applied eccentricity damping.  here we explore the evolution of the gj 876 system using two-dimensionalhydrodynamical simulations that include viscous heating and radiative effects.we find that a hydrodynamic evolution within the resonance, where only theouter planet interacts with the disk, always rapidly leads to large values ofeccentricities that exceed those observed.  only if mass is removed from the disk on a time scale of the order of themigration time scale (before there has been extensive migration after capture),as might occur for photoevaporation in the late phases of planet formation, canwe end up with eccentricities that are consistent with the observations.

astro-ph;0509271	oxygen from the lambda 7774 high-excitation triplet in open cluster  dwarfs: hyades	oxygen abundances have been derived from the near-ir, high-excitation lambda7774 o i triplet in high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 45 hyadesdwarfs using standard one dimensional, plane-parallel lte models. effectivetemperatures of the stellar sample range from 4319-6301 k, and the derivedrelative o abundances as a function of t_eff evince a trichotomous morphology.at t_eff &gt; 6100 k, there is evidence of an increase in the o abundances withincreasing t_eff, consistent with non-lte (nlte) predictions. at intermediatet_eff (5450 &lt; t_eff &lt; 6100 k), the o abundances are flat, and star-to-starvalues are in good agreement, having a mean value of [o/h] = +0.25 +/- 0.02;however, systematic errors at the ~0.10 dex level might exist. the o abundancesfor stars with t_eff &lt; 5450 k show a striking increase with decreasing t_eff,in stark contrast to expectations and canonical nlte calculations. the coolhyades triplet results are compared to those recently reported for dwarfs inthe pleiades cluster and the uma moving group; qualitative differences betweenthe trends observed in these stellar aggregates point to a possible age-relateddiminution of triplet abundance trends in cool open cluster dwarfs.correlations with age-related phenomena, i.e., chromospheric activity andphotospheric spots, faculae, and/or plages, are investigated. no correlationwith ca ii h+k chromospheric activity indicators is observed. multi-componentlte ``toy'' models have been constructed in order to simulate photospherictemperature inhomogeneities that could arise from the presence of starspots,and we demonstrate that photospheric spots are a plausible source of thetriplet trends among the cool dwarfs.

astro-ph;0601626	magnetic fields in starburst galaxies and the origin of the fir-radio  correlation	we estimate minimum energy magnetic fields (b_min) for a sample of galaxieswith measured gas surface densities, spanning from normal spirals tostarbursts. we show that the ratio of the minimum energy magnetic pressure tothe total pressure in the ism decreases substantially with increasing surfacedensity; for arp 220 this ratio is ~10^-4. therefore, if the minimum energyestimate is applicable, magnetic fields in starbursts are dynamically weakcompared to gravity, in contrast to normal spiral galaxies. we argue, however,that rapid cooling of relativistic electrons in starbursts invalidates theminimum energy estimate. we critically assess a number of independentconstraints on the magnetic field strength in starbursts. in particular, weargue that the existence of the fir-radio correlation implies that thesynchrotron cooling timescale for cosmic ray electrons is much shorter thantheir escape time from the galactic disk; this in turn implies that the truemagnetic field in starbursts is significantly larger than b_min. the strongestargument against such large fields is that one might expect starbursts to havesteep radio spectra indicative of strong synchrotron cooling, which is notobserved. we show, however, that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses canflatten the nonthermal spectra of starburst galaxies even in the presence ofrapid cooling, providing much better agreement with observed spectra. wefurther demonstrate that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses are likely to beimportant in shaping the radio spectra of most starbursts at ghz frequencies,thereby preserving the linearity of the fir-radio correlation. we thus concludethat magnetic fields in starbursts are significantly larger than b_min. wehighlight several observations that can test this conclusion.

astro-ph;0603068	giant planet accretion and migration: surviving the type i regime	in the standard model of gas giant planet formation, a large solid core (~ 10times the earth's mass) forms first, then accretes its massive envelope (100 ormore earth masses) of gas. however, inward planet migration due togravitational interaction with the proto-stellar gas disk poses a difficulty inthis model. core-sized bodies undergo rapid "type i" migration; for typicalparameters their migration timescale is much shorter than their accretiontimescale. how, then, do growing cores avoid spiraling into the central starbefore they ever get the chance to become gas giants? here, we present a simplemodel of core formation in a gas disk which is viscously evolving. as the diskdissipates, accretion and migration timescales eventually become comparable. ifthis happens while there is still enough gas left in the disk to supply ajovian atmosphere, then a window of opportunity for gas giant formation opens.we examine under what circumstances this happens, and thus, what predictionsour model makes about the link between proto-stellar disk properties and thelikelihood of forming giant planets.

astro-ph;0609213	the ionization state of sodium in galactic winds	roughly 80% of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) show blue shiftedabsorption in the resonance lines of neutral sodium, indicating that cool windsare common in such objects, as shown by rupke et al and by martin. the neutralsodium (nai) columns indicated by these absorption lines are ~10^{13}-3x10^{14}/cm^2, while the bolometric luminosity varies by a factor ofonly four. we show that the gas in ulirg outflows is likely to be inphotoionization equilibrium. the very small ulirg sample of goldader et al.demonstrates that the ratio of ultraviolet flux to far infrared flux varies bya factor $\sim100$ from object to object. while the goldader sample does notoverlap with those of rupke et al. and martin, we show that such a largevariation in ultraviolet flux will produce a similar variation in the column ofneutral sodium for a fixed mass flux and density. however, if the cold gas isin pressure equilibrium with a hot outflow with a mass loss rate similar to thestar formation rate, the range of ionization state is significantly smaller.measurements of the uv flux for objects in the martin and rupke et al. catalogswill definitively determine if photoionization effects are responsible for thewide variation seen in the sodium columns. if they are, a determination of thegas density and mass loss rate in the cool winds will follow, with attendantimprovements in our understanding of wind driving mechanisms and of the effectsof galaxies on their surroundings.

0811.0006	atmospheric escape from hot jupiters	photoionization heating from uv radiation incident on the atmospheres of hotjupiters may drive planetary mass loss. we construct a model of escape thatincludes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, andpressure confinement by the host star wind. we show that mass loss takes theform of a hydrodynamic ("parker") wind, emitted from the planet's daysideduring lulls in the stellar wind. when dayside winds are suppressed by theconfining action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there issufficient horizontal transport of heat. a hot jupiter loses mass at maximumrates of ~2 x 10^12 g/s during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and ~2x10^10 g/s during the star's main sequence lifetime, for total maximum lossesof ~0.06% and ~0.6% of the planet's mass, respectively. for uv fluxes f_uv &lt;10^4 erg/cm^2/s, the mass loss rate is approximately energy-limited and isproportional to f_uv^0.9. for larger uv fluxes, such as those typical of ttauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force the mass loss rateto increase more slowly as f_uv^0.6. dayside winds are quenched during the ttauri phase because of confinement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. weconclude that while uv radiation can indeed drive winds from hot jupiters, suchwinds cannot significantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionarystage. they can, however, produce observable signatures. candidates forexplaining why the lyman-alpha photons of hd 209458 are absorbed atdoppler-shifted velocities of +/- 100 km/s include charge-exchange in the shockbetween the planetary and stellar winds.
