hep-th;0607039	holomorphic generating functions for invariants counting coherent  sheaves on calabi-yau 3-folds	let x be a calabi-yau 3-fold, t=d^b(coh(x)) the derived category of coherentsheaves on x, and stab(t) the complex manifold of bridgeland stabilityconditions z on t. it is conjectured that one can define rational numbersj^a(z) for z in stab(t) and a in the numerical grothendieck group k(t)generalizing donaldson-thomas invariants, which `count' z-semistable (complexesof) coherent sheaves on x in class a, and whose transformation law under changeof z is known.  this paper explains how to combine such invariants j^a(z), if they exist,into a family of holomorphic generating functions f^a:stab(t) --&gt; c.surprisingly, requiring the f^a to be continuous and holomorphic determinesthem essentially uniquely, and implies they satisfy a p.d.e., which can beinterpreted as the flatness of a connection over stab(t) with values in aninfinite-dimensional lie algebra l.  the author believes that underlying this mathematics there should be some newphysics, in string theory and mirror symmetry. string theorists are invited towork out and explain this new physics.

hep-th;9907013	on counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres	we attempt to define a new invariant i of (almost) calabi-yau 3-folds m, bycounting special lagrangian rational homology 3-spheres n in m in each3-homology class, with a certain weight w(n) depending on the topology of n.this is motivated by the gromov-witten invariants of a symplectic manifold,which count the j-holomorphic curves in each 2-homology class.  in order for this invariant to be interesting, it should either be unchangedby deformations of the underlying (almost) calabi-yau structure, or elsetransform according to some rigid set of rules as the periods of the almostcalabi-yau structure pass through some topologically determined hypersurfacesin the cohomology of m.  as we deform the underlying almost calabi-yau 3-fold, the collection ofspecial lagrangian homology 3-spheres only change when they become singular.thus, to determine the stability of the invariant under deformations we needknow about the singular behaviour of special lagrangian 3-folds, which is notwell understood.  we describe two kinds of singular behaviour of special lagrangian 3-folds,and derive identities on the weight function w(n) for i to be unchanged ortransform well under them. the weight function w(n)=|h_1(n,z)| satisfies theseidentities. we conjecture that an invariant i defined with this weight isindependent of the kahler class, and changes in certain ways as the holomorphic3-form passes through some real hypersurfaces in h^3(m,c).  finally we consider connections with string theory. we argue that ourinvariant i counts isolated 3-branes, and that it should play a part in themirror symmetry story for calabi-yau 3-folds.

math;0008155	constructing special lagrangian m-folds in c^m by evolving quadrics	this is the second in a series of papers constructing explicit examples ofspecial lagrangian submanifolds in c^m. the first paper was math.dg/0008021,which studied special lagrangian m-folds with large symmetry groups. the thirdis math.dg/0010036, which uses ideas from this paper to construct families ofspecial lagrangian 3-folds in c^3.  this paper describes a construction of special lagrangian m-folds in c^mwhich are fibred by (m-1)-submanifolds which are quadrics in lagrangian planesr^m in c^m. generically they have only discrete symmetry groups. some of ourexamples have been previously constructed by lawlor and harvey, using differentmethods.  the principal motivation for these papers is to lay the foundations for thestudy of singularities of compact special lagrangian m-folds in calabi-yaum-folds. understanding such singularities will be important in resolving thesyz conjecture on mirror symmetry of calabi-yau 3-folds. the special lagrangianm-folds in c^m we construct here include many cones on s^a x s^b x s^1 fora+b=m-2, which are local models for singularities of special lagrangian m-foldsin calabi-yau m-folds.

math;0010036	evolution equations for special lagrangian 3-folds in c^3	this is the third in a series of papers constructing explicit examples ofspecial lagrangian submanifolds in c^m. the previous paper in the series,math.dg/0008155, defined the idea of evolution data, which includes an(m-1)-submanifold p in r^n, and constructed a family of special lagrangianm-folds n in c^m, which are swept out by the image of p under a 1-parameterfamily of linear or affine maps phi_t : r^n -&gt; c^m, satisfying a first-ordero.d.e. in t.  in this paper we use the same idea to construct special lagrangian 3-folds inc^3. we find a 1-1 correspondence between sets of evolution data with m=3 andhomogeneous symplectic 2-manifolds p. this enables us to write down severalinteresting sets of evolution data, and so to construct corresponding familiesof special lagrangian 3-folds in c^3.  our main results are a number of new families of special lagrangian 3-foldsin c^3, which we write very explicitly in parametric form. generically theseare nonsingular as immersed 3-submanifolds, and diffeomorphic to r^3 or s^1 xr^2. some of the 3-folds are singular, and we describe their singularities,which we believe are of a new kind.  we hope these 3-folds will be helpful in understanding singularities ofcompact special lagrangian 3-folds in calabi-yau 3-folds. this will beimportant in resolving the syz conjecture in mirror symmetry.

math;0010079	a theory of quaternionic algebra, with applications to hypercomplex  geometry	in this paper we introduce a new algebraic device, which enables us to treatthe quaternions as though they were a commutative field. this is of interestboth for its own sake, and because it can be applied to develop an "algebraicgeometry" of noncompact hypercomplex manifolds.  the basic building blocks of the theory are ah modules, which should bethought of "vector spaces" over the quaternions. an ah-module is a left moduleover the quaternions h, together with a real vector subspace. there are naturalconcepts of linear map and tensor product of ah-modules, which have many of theproperties of linear maps and tensor products of vector spaces. however, thedefinition of tensor product of ah-modules is strange and has some unexpectedproperties.  let m be a hypercomplex manifold. then there is a natural class of h-valued"q-holomorphic functions" on m, satisfying a quaternionic analogue of thecauchy-riemann equations, which are analogues of holomorphic functions oncomplex manifolds. the vector space of q-holomorphic functions a on m is anah-module.  now some pairs of q-holomorphic functions can be multiplied together to getanother q-holomorphic function, but other pairs cannot. so a has a kind ofpartial algebra structure. it turns out that this structure can be very neatlydescribed using the quaternionic tensor product and ah-morphisms, and that ahas the structure of an "h-algebra", a quaternionic analogue of commutativealgebra.

math;0011179	singularities of special lagrangian fibrations and the syz conjecture	the syz conjecture explains mirror symmetry between mirror calabi-yau 3-foldsm,m' in terms of special lagrangian fibrations f : m --&gt; b and f' : m' --&gt; bover the same base b, whose fibres are dual 3-tori, except for singular fibres.  one of the main problems in proving the syz conjecture (or even in findingthe right statement of it) is that the singularities of special lagrangian3-folds and fibrations are poorly understood. this paper studies thesingularities of special lagrangian fibrations.  our main rigorous results are the construction of examples of speciallagrangian fibrations on open subsets of c^3. the simplest are givenexplicitly, and the rest are constructed using analytic existence results fromthe author's three papers math.dg/0111324, math.dg/0111326, math.dg/0204343 onu(1)-invariant special lagrangian 3-folds in c^3.  we then argue, without full proofs, that some features of our examples shouldalso hold for special lagrangian fibrations f : m --&gt; b of (almost) calabi-yau3-folds, especially in the generic case. in particular, f will not be smoothbut only piecewise-smooth, and the discriminant (set of singular fibres) of fwill be of codimension 1 in b, and will typically be composed of 'ribbons'.finally we draw some conclusions on the syz conjecture, which contradict somestronger statements of it.

math;0101249	special lagrangian 3-folds and integrable systems	this is the sixth in a series of papers constructing examples of speciallagrangian m-folds in c^m. we present a construction of special lagrangiancones in c^3 involving two commuting o.d.e.s, motivated by the first two papersof the series. then we generalize it to a construction of non-conical speciallagrangian 3-folds in c^3 involving three commuting o.d.e.s.  now special lagrangian cones in c^3 are linked to the theory of harmonic mapsand integrable systems. harmonic maps from a riemann surface into complexprojective space cp^n are an integrable system, and can be studied andclassified using loop group techniques. if n is a special lagrangian cone inc^3, then n is the cone on the image of a conformal harmonic map \psi : s --&gt;s^5 for some riemann surface s, and the projection of \psi to cp^2 is alsoconformal harmonic.  our examples of special lagrangian cones in c^3 yield conformal harmonic maps\psi : r^2 --&gt; cp^2. we work through the integrable systems theory for theseexamples, showing that they are superconformal of finite type, and calculatingtheir harmonic sequences, toda and tzitzeica solutions, algebra of polynomialkilling fields and spectral curves. we also study the double periodicityconditions for \psi, and so find families of superconformal tori in cp^2.  we finish by asking whether our more general construction of speciallagrangian 3-folds can also be derived from a higher-dimensional integrablesystem, and whether the special lagrangian equations themselves are in somesense integrable.

0910.3518	on manifolds with corners	manifolds without boundary, and manifolds with boundary, are universallyknown in differential geometry, but manifolds with corners (locally modelled on[0,\infty)^k x r^{n-k}) have received comparatively little attention. the basicdefinitions in the subject are not agreed upon, there are several inequivalentdefinitions in use of manifolds with corners, of boundary, and of smooth map,depending on the applications in mind.  we present a theory of manifolds with corners which includes a new notion ofsmooth map f : x --&gt; y. compared to other definitions, our theory has theadvantage of giving a category man^c of manifolds with corners which isparticularly well behaved as a category: it has products and direct products,boundaries behave in a functorial way, and there are simple conditions for theexistence of fibre products x x_z y in man^c.  our theory is tailored to future applications in symplectic geometry, and ispart of a project to describe the geometric structure on moduli spaces ofj-holomorphic curves in a new way. but we have written it as a separate paperas we believe it is of independent interest.

1211.3259	symmetries and stabilization for sheaves of vanishing cycles	let $u$ be a smooth $\mathbb c$-scheme, $f:u\to\mathbb a^1$ a regularfunction, and $x=$crit$(f)$ the critical locus, as a $\mathbb c$-subscheme of$u$. then one can define the "perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles" $pv_{u,f}$, aperverse sheaf on $x$.  this paper proves four main results:  (a) suppose $\phi:u\to u$ is an isomorphism with $f\circ\phi=f$ and$\phi\vert_x=$id$_x$. then $\phi$ induces an isomorphism $\phi_*:pv_{u,f}\topv_{u,f}$. we show that $\phi_*$ is multiplication by det$(d\phi\vert_x)=1$ or$-1$.  (b) $pv_{u,f}$ depends up to canonical isomorphism only on $x^{(3)},f^{(3)}$,for $x^{(3)}$ the third-order thickening of $x$ in $u$, and$f^{(3)}=f\vert_{x^{(3)}}:x^{(3)}\to\mathbb a^1$.  (c) if $u,v$ are smooth $\mathbb c$-schemes, $f:u\to\mathbb a^1$,$g:v\to\mathbb a^1$ are regular, $x=$crit$(f)$, $y=$crit$(g)$, and $\phi:u\tov$ is an embedding with $f=g\circ\phi$ and $\phi\vert_x:x\to y$ an isomorphism,there is a natural isomorphism$\theta_\phi:pv_{u,f}\to\phi\vert_x^*(pv_{v,g})\otimes_{\mathbb z_2}p_\phi$,for $p_\phi$ a natural principal $\mathbb z_2$-bundle on $x$.  (d) if $(x,s)$ is an oriented d-critical locus in the sense of joycearxiv:1304.4508, there is a natural perverse sheaf $p_{x,s}$ on $x$, such thatif $(x,s)$ is locally modelled on crit$(f:u\to\mathbb a^1)$ then $p_{x,s}$ islocally modelled on $pv_{u,f}$.  we also generalize our results to replace $u,x$ by complex analytic spaces,and $pv_{u,f}$ by $\mathcal d$-modules, or mixed hodge modules. we discussapplications of (d) to categorifying donaldson-thomas invariants of calabi-yau3-folds, and to defining a 'fukaya category' of lagrangians in a complexsymplectic manifold using perverse sheaves.  this is the third in a series of papers arxiv:1304.4508, arxiv:1305.6302,arxiv:1305.6428, arxiv:1312.0090, arxiv:1403.2403, arxiv:1404.1329,arxiv:1504.00690.

1304.4508	a classical model for derived critical loci	let $f:u\to{\mathbb a}^1$ be a regular function on a smooth scheme $u$ over afield $\mathbb k$. pantev, toen, vaquie and vezzosi (arxiv:1111.3209,arxiv:1109.5213) define the "derived critical locus" crit$(f)$, an example of anew class of spaces in derived algebraic geometry, which they call"$-1$-shifted symplectic derived schemes".  they show that intersections of algebraic lagrangians in a smooth symplectic$\mathbb k$-scheme, and stable moduli schemes of coherent sheaves on acalabi-yau 3-fold over $\mathbb k$, are also $-1$-shifted symplectic derivedschemes. thus, their theory may have applications in algebraic symplecticgeometry, and in donaldson-thomas theory of calabi-yau 3-folds.  this paper defines and studies a new class of spaces we call "algebraicd-critical loci", which should be regarded as classical truncations of$-1$-shifted symplectic derived schemes. they are simpler than their derivedanalogues. we also give a complex analytic version of the theory, "complexanalytic d-critical loci", and an extension to artin stacks, "d-criticalstacks".  in the sequels arxiv:1305.6302, arxiv:1211.3259, arxiv:1305.6428,arxiv:1312.0090 we will define truncation functors from $-1$-shifted symplecticderived schemes or stacks to algebraic d-critical loci or d-critical stacks,and we will apply d-critical loci to motivic and categorified donaldson-thomastheory, and to intersections of (derived) complex lagrangians in complexsymplectic manifolds. we will show that the important structures one wants toassociate to a derived critical locus -- virtual cycles, perverse sheaves andmixed hodge modules of vanishing cycles, and motivic milnor fibres -- can bedefined for oriented d-critical loci and oriented d-critical stacks.

1305.6302	a 'darboux theorem' for derived schemes with shifted symplectic  structure	we prove a 'darboux theorem' for derived schemes with symplectic forms ofdegree $k&lt;0$, in the sense of pantev, toen, vaquie and vezzosi arxiv:1111.3209.more precisely, we show that a derived scheme $x$ with symplectic form $\omega$of degree $k$ is locally equivalent to (spec $a,\omega'$) for spec $a$ anaffine derived scheme whose cdga $a$ has darboux-like coordinates in which thesymplectic form $\omega'$ is standard, and the differential in $a$ is given bypoisson bracket with a hamiltonian function $h$ in $a$ of degree $k+1$.  when $k=-1$, this implies that a $-1$-shifted symplectic derived scheme$(x,\omega)$ is zariski locally equivalent to the derived critical locuscrit$(h)$ of a regular function $h:u\to{\mathbb a}^1$ on a smooth scheme $u$.we use this to show that the underlying classical scheme of $x$ has thestructure of an 'algebraic d-critical locus', in the sense of joycearxiv:1304.4508.  in the sequels arxiv:1211.3259, arxiv:1305.6428, arxiv:1312.0090,arxiv:1504.00690, 1506.04024 we will discuss applications of these results tocategorified and motivic donaldson-thomas theory of calabi-yau 3-folds, and todefining new donaldson-thomas type invariants of calabi-yau 4-folds, and todefining 'fukaya categories' of lagrangians in algebraic symplectic manifoldsusing perverse sheaves, and we will extend the results of this paper andarxiv:1211.3259, arxiv:1305.6428 from (derived) schemes to (derived) artinstacks, and to give local descriptions of lagrangians in $k$-shifted symplecticderived schemes.  bouaziz and grojnowski arxiv:1309.2197 independently prove a similar 'darbouxtheorem'.

1305.6428	on motivic vanishing cycles of critical loci	let $u$ be a smooth scheme over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb k$ ofcharacteristic zero and $f:u\to{\mathbb a}^1$ a regular function, and write$x=$crit$(f)$, as a closed subscheme of $u$. the motivic vanishing cycle$mf_{u,f}^\phi$ is an element of the $\hat\mu$-equivariant motivic grothendieckring ${\mathcal m}^{\hat\mu}_x$ defined by denef and loeser math.ag/0006050 andlooijenga math.ag/0006220, and used in kontsevich and soibelman's theory ofmotivic donaldson-thomas invariants, arxiv:0811.2435.  we prove three main results:  (a) $mf_{u,f}^\phi$ depends only on the third-order thickenings$u^{(3)},f^{(3)}$ of $u,f$.  (b) if $v$ is another smooth scheme, $g:v\to{\mathbb a}^1$ is regular,$y=$crit$(g)$, and $\phi:u\to v$ is an embedding with $f=g\circ\phi$ and$\phi\vert_x:x\to y$ an isomorphism, then $\phi\vert_x^*(mf_{v,g}^\phi)$ equals$mf_{u,f}^\phi$ "twisted" by a motive associated to a principal ${\mathbbz}_2$-bundle defined using $\phi$, where now we work in a quotient ring$\bar{\mathcal m}^{\hat\mu}_x$ of ${\mathcal m}^{\hat\mu}_x$.  (c) if $(x,s)$ is an "oriented algebraic d-critical locus" in the sense ofjoyce arxiv:1304.4508, there is a natural motive $mf_{x,s} \in\bar{\mathcalm}^{\hat\mu}_x$, such that if $(x,s)$ is locally modelled oncrit$(f:u\to{\mathbb a}^1)$, then $mf_{x,s}$ is locally modelled on$mf_{u,f}^\phi$.  using results from arxiv:1305.6302, these imply the existence of naturalmotives on moduli schemes of coherent sheaves on a calabi-yau 3-fold equippedwith "orientation data", as required in kontsevich and soibelman's motivicdonaldson-thomas theory arxiv:0811.2435, and on intersections of orientedlagrangians in an algebraic symplectic manifold.  this paper is an analogue for motives of results on perverse sheaves ofvanishing cycles proved in arxiv:1211.3259. we extend this paper to artinstacks in arxiv:1312.0090.

1312.0090	a 'darboux theorem' for shifted symplectic structures on derived artin  stacks, with applications	this is the fifth in a series arxiv:1304.4508, arxiv:1305,6302,arxiv:1211.3259, arxiv:1305.6428 on the '$k$-shifted symplectic derivedalgebraic geometry' of pantev, toen, vaquie and vezzosi, arxiv:1111.3209. thispaper extends the previous three from (derived) schemes to (derived) artinstacks. we prove four main results:  (a) if $(x,\omega)$ is a $k$-shifted symplectic derived artin stack for $k&lt;0$in the sense of arxiv:1111.3209, then near each $x\in x$ we can find a'minimal' smooth atlas $\varphi:u\to x$ with $u$ an affine derived scheme, suchthat $(u,\varphi^*(\omega))$ may be written explicitly in coordinates in astandard 'darboux form'.  (b) if $(x,\omega)$ is a $-1$-shifted symplectic derived artin stack and $x'$the underlying classical artin stack, then $x'$ extends naturally to a'd-critical stack' $(x',s)$ in the sense of arxiv:1304.4508.  (c) if $(x,s)$ is an oriented d-critical stack, we can define a naturalperverse sheaf $p^\bullet_{x,s}$ on $x$, such that whenever $t$ is a scheme and$t:t\to x$ is smooth of relative dimension $n$, then $t$ is locally modelled ona critical locus crit$(f:u\to{\mathbb a}^1)$ for $u$ smooth, and$t^*(p^\bullet_{x,s})[n]$ is locally modelled on the perverse sheaf ofvanishing cycles $pv_{u,f}^\bullet$ of $f$.  (d) if $(x,s)$ is a finite type oriented d-critical stack, we can define anatural motive $mf_{x,s}$ in a ring of motives $\bar{\mathcalm}^{st,\hat\mu}_x$ on $x$, such that whenever $t$ is a finite type scheme and$t:t\to x$ is smooth of dimension $n$, then $t$ is locally modelled on acritical locus crit$(f:u\to{\mathbb a}^1)$ for $u$ smooth, and ${\mathbbl}^{-n/2}\odot t^*(mf_{x,s})$ is locally modelled on the motivic vanishingcycle $mf^{mot,\phi}_{u,f}$ of $f$ in $\bar{\mathcal m}^{st,\hat\mu}_t$.  our results have applications to categorified and motivic extensions ofdonaldson-thomas theory of calabi-yau 3-folds

1401.4949	conjectures on bridgeland stability for fukaya categories of calabi-yau  manifolds, special lagrangians, and lagrangian mean curvature flow	let $m$ be a calabi-yau $m$-fold, and consider compact, graded lagrangians$l$ in $m$. thomas and yau math.dg/0104196, math.dg/0104197 conjectured thatthere should be a notion of "stability" for such $l$, and that if $l$ is stablethen lagrangian mean curvature flow $\{l^t:t\in[0,\infty)\}$ with $l^0=l$should exist for all time, and $l^\infty=\lim_{t\to\infty}l^t$ should be theunique special lagrangian in the hamiltonian isotopy class of $l$. this paperis an attempt to update the thomas-yau conjectures, and discuss related issues.  it is a folklore conjecture that there exists a bridgeland stabilitycondition $(z,\mathcal p)$ on the derived fukaya category $d^b\mathcal f(m)$ of$m$, such that an isomorphism class in $d^b\mathcal f(m)$ is $(z,\mathcalp)$-semistable if (and possibly only if) it contains a special lagrangian,which must then be unique.  we conjecture that if $(l,e,b)$ is an object in an enlarged version of$d^b\mathcal f(m)$, where $l$ is a compact, graded lagrangian in $m$ (possiblyimmersed, or with "stable singularities"), $e\to m$ a rank one local system,and $b$ a bounding cochain for $(l,e)$ in lagrangian floer cohomology, thenthere is a unique family $\{(l^t,e^t,b^t):t\in[0,\infty)\}$ such that$(l^0,e^0,b^0)=(l,e,b)$, and $(l^t,e^t,b^t)\cong(l,e,b)$ in $d^b\mathcal f(m)$for all $t$, and $\{l^t:t\in[0,\infty)\}$ satisfies lagrangian mcf withsurgeries at singular times $t_1,t_2,\dots,$ and in graded lagrangian integralcurrents we have $\lim_{t\to\infty}l^t=l_1+\cdots+l_n$, where $l_j$ is aspecial lagrangian integral current of phase $e^{i\pi\phi_j}$ for$\phi_1&gt;\cdots&gt;\phi_n$, and $(l_1,\phi_1),\ldots,(l_n,\phi_n)$ correspond tothe decomposition of $(l,e,b)$ into $(z,\mathcal p)$-semistable objects.  we also give detailed conjectures on the nature of the singularities oflagrangian mcf that occur at the finite singular times $t_1,t_2,\ldots.$

1404.0271	uniqueness results for special lagrangians and lagrangian mean curvature  flow expanders in c^m	we prove two main results:  (a) suppose $l$ is a closed, embedded, exact special lagrangian $m$-fold in${\mathbb c}^m$ for $m\ge 3$ asymptotic at infinity to the union$\pi_1\cup\pi_2$ of two transverse special lagrangian planes $\pi_1,\pi_2$ in${\mathbb c}^m$. then $l$ is one of the explicit 'lawlor neck' family ofexamples found by lawlor (invent. math. 95, 1989).  (b) suppose $l$ is a closed, embedded, exact lagrangian mean curvature flowexpander in ${\mathbb c}^m$ for $m\ge 3$ asymptotic at infinity to the union$\pi_1\cup\pi_2$ of two transverse lagrangian planes $\pi_1,\pi_2$ in ${\mathbbc}^m$. then $l$ is one of the explicit family of examples found by joyce, leeand tsui, arxiv:0801.3721.  if instead $l$ is immersed rather than embedded, the only extra possibilityin (a),(b) is $l=\pi_1\cup\pi_2$.  our methods, which are new and can probably be used to prove other similaruniqueness theorems, involve $j$-holomorphic curves, lagrangian floercohomology, and fukaya categories from symplectic topology. when $m=2$, (a) iseasy to prove using hyperkahler geometry, and (b) is proved by lotay and neves,arxiv:1208.2729.

0803.0717	immersed lagrangian floer theory	let (m,w) be a compact symplectic manifold, and l a compact, embeddedlagrangian submanifold in m. fukaya, oh, ohta and ono construct lagrangianfloer cohomology for such m,l, yielding groups hf^*(l,b;\lambda) for onelagrangian or hf^*((l,b),(l',b');\lambda) for two, where b,b' are choices ofbounding cochains, and exist if and only if l,l' have unobstructed floercohomology. these are independent of choices up to canonical isomorphism, andhave important invariance properties under hamiltonian equivalence. floercohomology groups are the morphism groups in the derived fukaya category of(m,w), and so are an essential part of the homological mirror symmetryconjecture of kontsevich.  the goal of this paper is to extend all this to immersed lagrangians l in mwith immersion i : l --&gt; m, with transverse self-intersections. in the embeddedcase, floer cohomology hf^*(l,b;\lambda) is a modified, 'quantized' version ofcohomology h^*(l;\lambda) over the novikov ring \lambda. in our immersed case,hf^*(l,b;\lambda) turns out to be a quantized version of the sum ofh^*(l;\lambda) with a \lambda-module spanned by pairs (p,q) for p,q distinctpoints of l with i(p)=i(q) in m.  the theory becomes simpler and more powerful for graded lagrangians incalabi-yau manifolds, when we can work over a smaller novikov ring\lambda_{cy}. the proofs involve associating a gapped filtered a-infinityalgebra over \lambda or \lambda_{cy} to i : l --&gt; m, which is independent ofnearly all choices up to canonical homotopy equivalence, and is built using aseries of finite approximations called a_{n,0} algebras for n=0,1,2,...

1510.07444	kuranishi spaces as a 2-category	this is a survey of the author's in-progress book arxiv:1409.6908. 'kuranishispaces' were introduced in the work of fukaya, oh, ohta and ono in symplecticgeometry (see e.g. arxiv:1503.07631), as the geometric structure on modulispaces of $j$-holomorphic curves. we propose a new definition of kuranishispace, which has the nice property that they form a 2-category $\bf kur$. thusthe homotopy category ho$({\bf kur})$ is an ordinary category of kuranishispaces.  any fukaya-oh-ohta-ono (fooo) kuranishi space $\bf x$ can be made into acompact kuranishi space $\bf x'$ uniquely up to equivalence in $\bf kur$ (thatis, up to isomorphism in ho$({\bf kur})$), and conversely any compact kuranishispace $\bf x'$ comes from some (nonunique) fooo kuranishi space $\bf x$. sofooo kuranishi spaces are equivalent to ours at one level, but our definitionhas better categorical properties. the same holds for mcduff and wehrheim's'kuranishi atlases' in arxiv:1508.01556.  using results of yang on polyfolds and kuranishi spaces surveyed inarxiv:1510.06849, a compact topological space $x$ with a 'polyfold fredholmstructure' in the sense of hofer, wysocki and zehnder (see e.g.arxiv:1407.3185) can be made into a kuranishi space $\bf x$ uniquely up toequivalence in $\bf kur$.  our kuranishi spaces are based on the author's theory of derived differentialgeometry (see e.g. arxiv:1206.4207), the study of classes of derived manifoldsand orbifolds that we call 'd-manifolds' and 'd-orbifolds'. there is anequivalence of 2-categories ${\bf kur}\simeq{\bf dorb}$, where $\bf dorb$ isthe 2-category of d-orbifolds. so kuranishi spaces are really a form of derivedorbifold.  we discuss the differential geometry of kuranishi spaces, and the author'sprogramme for applying these ideas in symplectic geometry.

0810.5645	a theory of generalized donaldson-thomas invariants	let x be a calabi-yau 3-fold over c. the donaldson-thomas invariants of x areintegers dt^a(t) which count stable sheaves with chern character a on x, withrespect to a gieseker stability condition t. they are defined only for cherncharacters a for which there are no strictly semistable sheaves on x. they havethe good property that they are unchanged under deformations of x. theirbehaviour under change of stability condition t was not understood until now.  this book defines and studies a generalization of donaldson-thomasinvariants. our new invariants \bar{dt}^a(t) are rational numbers, defined forall chern characters a, and are equal to dt^a(t) if there are no strictlysemistable sheaves in class a. they are deformation-invariant, and have a knowntransformation law under change of stability condition.  to prove all this we study the local structure of the moduli stack m ofcoherent sheaves on x. we show that an atlas for m may be written locally ascrit(f) for f a holomorphic function on a complex manifold, and use this todeduce identities on the behrend function of m.  we compute our invariants in examples, and make a conjecture about theirintegrality properties. we extend the theory to abelian categories ofrepresentations of a quiver with relations coming from a superpotential, andconnect our ideas with szendroi's "noncommutative donaldson-thomas invariants"and work by reineke and others.  this book is surveyed in the paper arxiv:0910.0105.
