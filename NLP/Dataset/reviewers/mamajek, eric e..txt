0902.3197	"an era of precision astrophysics: connecting stars, galaxies and the  universe," an astro2010 science white paper	abridged: the golden age of astrophysics is upon us with both granddiscoveries (extra-solar planets, dark matter, dark energy) and precisioncosmology. fundamental understanding of the working of stars and galaxies iswithin reach, thanks to newly available precision measurements. we highlightthe importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.  distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change ourperception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the heliocentricmodel was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.  distance measurements are directly related to the history &amp; fate of the uni-verse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. the 1stmethod is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi-nosities (distances) are accurately known. the 2nd method relies on cosmolo-gical methods. to 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse h_0.  as stressed by the previous decadal report, "the fundamental goal of ...astrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ...formed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be." these questions canbe answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) galactic archeology: adetailed reconstruction of the formation history of the milky way and otherlocal group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the milky way and the age ofthe universe, and 3) h_0 and concordance cosmology.  these goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from theproposed sim-lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. theresults of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellarastrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics.

0904.1047	how accurately can we age-date solar-type dwarfs using activity/rotation  diagnostics?	it is well established that activity and rotation diminishes during the lifeof sun-like main sequence (~f7-k2v) stars. indeed, the evolution of rotationand activity among these stars appears to be so deterministic that theirrotation/activity diagnostics are often utilized as estimators of stellar age.a primary motivation for the recent interest in improving the ages ofsolar-type field dwarfs is in understanding the evolution of debris disks andplanetary systems. reliable isochronal age-dating for field, solar-type mainsequence stars is very difficult given the observational uncertainties andmulti-gyr timescales for significant structural evolution. observationally,significant databases of activity/rotation diagnostics exist for fieldsolar-type field dwarfs (mainly from chromospheric and x-ray activity surveys).but how well can we empirically age-date solar-type field stars usingactivity/rotation diagnostics? here i summarize some recent results for f7-k2dwarfs from an analysis by mamajek &amp; hillenbrand (2008), including an improved"gyrochronology" [period(color, age)] calibration, improved chromospheric(r'_hk and x-ray (log lx/lbol) activity vs. rotation (via rossby number)relations, and a chromospheric vs. x-ray activity relation that spans fourorders of magnitude in log lx/lbol. combining these relations, one can producepredicted chromospheric and x-ray activity isochrones as a function of colorand age for solar type dwarfs.

0906.5011	initial conditions of planet formation: lifetimes of primordial disks	the statistical properties of circumstellar disks around young stars areimportant for constraining theoretical models for the formation and earlyevolution of planetary systems. in this brief review, i survey the literaturerelated to ground-based and spitzer-based infrared (ir) studies of youngstellar clusters, with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution ofprimordial (``protoplanetary'') disks through spectroscopic and photometricdiagnostics. the available data demonstrate that the fraction of young starswith optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopicevidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decaywith characteristic time ~2.5 myr (half-life = 1.7 myr). large ir surveys of~2-5 myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatterin the observed disk fractions as a function of age. recent spitzer surveyshave found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass andenvironment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density).perhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars, the diskfraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from ~1 myrfor &gt;1.3 msun stars to ~3 myr for &lt;0.08 msun brown dwarfs. the exponentialdecay function may provide a useful empirical formalism for estimating veryrough ages for yso populations and for modeling the effects of disk-locking onthe angular momentum of young stars.

0909.4124	debris disks in the upper scorpius ob association	we present mips 24um and 70um photometry for 205 members of the upperscorpius ob association. these data are combined with published mips photometryfor 15 additional association members to assess the frequency of circumstellardisks around 5 myr old stars with spectral types between b0 and m5. twelvestars have a detectable 70um excess, each of which also has a detectable 24umexcess. a total of 54 stars are identified with a 24um excess more than 32%above the stellar photosphere. the mips observations reveal 19 excess sources-- 8 a/f/g stars and 11 k/m stars -- that were not previously identified withan 8um or 16um excess. the lack of short-wavelength emission and the weak 24umexcess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants ofoptically thick primordial disks with inner holes. despite the wide range ofluminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excesscharacteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbitalradii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size withspectral type. the results for upper sco are compared to similar photometricsurveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission.after considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effectsof stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude ofthe 24um excess around f-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 myr asfound by previous studies, but at &lt; 2.6 sigma confidence. for b7-a9 and g0-k5stars, any variations in the observed 24um excess emission over this age rangeare significant at less than 2 sigma confidence.

0911.5028	discovery of a faint companion to alcor using mmt/ao 5 $\mu$m imaging	we report the detection of a faint stellar companion to the famous nearby a5vstar alcor (80 uma). the companion has m-band ($\lambda$ = 4.8 $\mu$m)magnitude 8.8 and projected separation 1".11 (28 au) from alcor. the companionis most likely a low-mass ($\sim$0.3 \msun) active star which is responsiblefor alcor's x-ray emission detected by rosat (l$_{\rm x}$ $\simeq$ 10$^{28.3}$erg/s). alcor is a nuclear member of the ursa major star cluster (uma; d$\simeq$ 25 pc, age $\simeq$ 0.5 gyr), and has been occasionally mentioned as apossible distant (709") companion of the stellar quadruple mizar ($\zeta$ uma).comparing the revised hipparcos proper motion for alcor with the mean motionfor other uma nuclear members shows that alcor has a peculiar velocity of 1.1km/s, which is comparable to the predicted velocity amplitude induced by thenewly-discovered companion ($\sim$1 km/s). using a precise dynamical parallaxfor mizar and the revised hipparcos parallax for alcor, we find that mizar andalcor are physically separated by 0.36 $\pm$ 0.19 pc (74 $\pm$ 39 kau; minimum18 kau), and their velocity vectors are marginally consistent ($\chi^2$probability 6%). given their close proximity and concordant motions we suggestthat the mizar quadruple and the alcor binary be together considered the 2ndclosest stellar sextuplet. the addition of mizar-alcor to the census of stellarmultiples with six or more components effectively doubles the local density ofsuch systems within the local volume (d $&lt;$ 40 pc).

1003.3447	the enigmatic young low-mass variable twa 30	twa 30 is a remarkable young (7+/-3 myr), low-mass (0.12+/-0.04 msun),late-type star (m5+/-1) residing 42+/-2 pc away from the sun in the tw hydraeassociation. it shows strong outflow spectral signatures such as [s ii], [o i],[o ii], [o iii], and mg i], while exhibiting weak halpha emission (-6.8+/-1.2angstroms). emission lines of [s ii] and [o i] are common to t tauri starsstill residing in their natal molecular clouds, while [o iii] and mg i]emission lines are incredibly rare in this same population; in the case of twa30, these latter lines may arise from new outflow material colliding into olderoutflow fronts. the weak halpha emission and small radial velocity shifts ofline emission relative to the stellar frame of rest (generally &lt;=10 km/s)suggest that the disk is viewed close to edge-on and that the stellar axis maybe inclined to the disk, similar to the aa tau system, based on its temporalchanges in emission/absorption line strengths/profiles and variable reddening(a_v=1.5-9.0). the strong li absorption (0.61+/-0.13 angstroms) and commonkinematics with members of the twa confirm its age and membership to theassociation. given the properties of this system such as its proximity, lowmass, remarkable outflow signatures, variability, and edge-on configuration,this system is a unique case study at a critical time in disk evolution andplanet-building processes.

1009.5722	clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs: fire spectroscopy of ross 458c	condensate clouds are a salient feature of l dwarf atmospheres, but have beenassumed to play little role in shaping the spectra of the coldest t-type browndwarfs. here we report evidence of condensate opacity in the near-infraredspectrum of the brown dwarf candidate ross 458c, obtained with the folded-portinfrared echellette (fire) spectrograph at the magellan telescopes. these dataverify the low-temperature nature of this source, indicating a t8 spectralclassification, log lbol/lsun = -5.62+/-0.03, teff = 650+/-25 k, and a mass ator below the deuterium burning limit. the data also reveal enhanced emission atk-band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity,reflecting the properties of the ross 458 system (age = 150-800 myr, [fe/h] =+0.2 to +0.3). we present fits of fire data for ross 458c, the t9 dwarf ulasj133553.45+113005.2, and the blue t7.5 dwarf sdss j141624.08+134826.7b, tocloudless and cloudy spectral models from saumon &amp; marley. for ross 458c weconfirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperaturediffers depending on the presence (635 [+25,-35] k) or absence (760 [+70,-45]k) of cloud extinction. ulas j1335+1130 and sdss j1416+1348b have similartemperatures (595 [+25,-45] k), but distinct surface gravities (log g = 4.0-4.5cgs versus 5.0-5.5 cgs) and metallicities ([m/h] ~ +0.2 versus -0.2). in allthree cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data,significantly so for ross 458c. these results indicate that clouds are animportant opacity source in the spectra of young cold t dwarfs, and should beconsidered when characterizing the spectra of planetary-mass objects in youngclusters and directly-imaged exoplanets. the characteristics of ross 458csuggest it could itself be regarded as a planet, albeit one whose cosmogonydoes not conform with current planet formation theories.

0709.0456	an improbable solution to the underluminosity of 2m1207b: a hot  protoplanet collision afterglow	we introduce an alternative hypothesis to explain the very low luminosity ofthe cool (l-type) companion to the ~25 m_jup ~8 myr-old brown dwarf 2m1207a.recently, mohanty et al. (2007) found that effective temperature estimates for2m1207b (1600 +- 100 k) are grossly inconsistent with its lying on the sameisochrone as the primary, being a factor of ~10 underluminous at all bandsbetween i (0.8 um) and l' (3.6 um). mohanty et al. explain this discrepency bysuggesting that 2m1207b is an 8 m_jup object surrounded by an edge-on diskcomprised of large dust grains producing 2.5^m of achromatic extinction. weoffer an alternative explanation: the apparent flux reflects the actual sourceluminosity. given the temperature, we infer a small radius (~49,000 km), andfor a range of plausible densities, we estimate a mass &lt; m_jup. we suggest that2m1207b is a hot protoplanet collision afterglow and show that the radiativetimescale for such an object is &gt;~1% the age of the system. if our hypothesisis correct, the surface gravity of 2m1207b should be an order of magnitudelower than predicted by mohanty et al.

1101.4231	juvenile ultracool dwarfs	juvenile ultracool dwarfs are late spectral type objects (later than ~m6)with ages between 10 myr and several 100 myr. their age-related properties lieintermediate between very low mass objects in nearby star-forming regions (ages1-5 myr) and field stars and brown dwarfs that are members of the diskpopulation (ages 1-5 gyr). kinematic associations of nearby young stars withages from ~10-100 myr provide sources for juvenile ultracool dwarfs. the lowestmass confirmed members of these groups are late-m dwarfs. several apparentlyyoung l dwarfs and a few t dwarfs are known, but they have not beenkinematically associated with any groups. normalizing the field imf to the highmass population of these groups suggests that more low mass (mainly late-m andpossibly l dwarf) members have yet to be found. the lowest mass members ofthese groups, along with low mass companions to known young stars, providebenchmark objects with which spectroscopic age indicators for juvenileultracool dwarfs can be calibrated and evaluated. in this proceeding, wesummarize currently used methods for identifying juvenile ultracool dwarfs anddiscuss the appropriateness and reliability of the most commonly used ageindicators.

1109.4634	the stellar activity-rotation relationship and the evolution of stellar  dynamos	we present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with x-ray luminositiesand rotation periods. this is used to study the relationship between rotationand stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time.from an unbiased subset of this sample the power law slope of the unsaturatedregime, l_x / l_bol = ro^\beta, is fit as \beta = -2.70 +/- 0.13. this isinconsistent with the canonical \beta=-2 slope to a confidence of 5 sigma, andargues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. from a simplescaling analysis this implies \delta\omega / \omega = \omega^0.7, i.e. thedifferential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down.super-saturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and itsparametric dependencies are explored. significant correlations are found withboth the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theoryproviding a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. weestimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation andsuper-saturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. late f-typestars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straightfrom super-saturated to unsaturated x-ray emission. the theoretical thresholdfor coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empiricalsaturation threshold (ro &lt; 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. instead wesuggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars withsaturated coronal emission. this is supported by a correlation between theempirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition betweenconvective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.

(1997) reliedon a combination of isochronal age plus youth indicators for the k4v commonproper motion system tw psa. tw psa is 1.96 deg away from fomalhaut, and wasfirst proposed as a companion by luyten (1938), but the physicality of thebinarity is worth testing with modern data. i demonstrate that tw psa isunequivocally a physical stellar companion to fomalhaut, with true separation0.280+0.019-0.012 pc (57.4+3.9-2.5 kau) and sharing velocities within 0.1+-0.5km/s -- consistent with being a bound system. hence, tw psa should beconsidered "fomalhaut b". combining modern hr diagram constraints with foursets of evolutionary tracks, and assuming the star was born with protosolarcomposition, i estimate a new isochronal age for fomalhaut of 450+-40 myr andmass of 1.92+-0.02 msun. various stellar youth diagnostics are re-examined fortw psa. the star's rotation, x-ray emission, and li abundances are consistentwith approximate ages of 410, 380, and 360 myr, respectively, yielding aweighted mean age of 400+-70 myr. combining the independent ages, i estimate amean age for the fomalhaut-tw psa binary of 440+-40 myr. the older age impliesthat substellar companions of a given mass are approximately one magnitudefainter at ir wavelengths than previously assumed.

1210.1616	accurate geodetic coordinates for observatories on cerro tololo and  cerro pachon	as the 50th anniversary of the cerro tololo inter-american observatory (ctio)draws near, the author was surprised to learn that the published latitude andlongitude for ctio in the astronomical almanac and iraf observatory databaseappears to differ from modern gps-measured geodetic positions by nearly akilometer. surely, the position for ctio could not be in error after fivedecades? the source of the discrepancy appears to be due to the ~30" differencebetween the astronomical and geodetic positions -- a systematic effect due tovertical deflection first reported by harrington, mintz blanco, &amp; blanco(1972). since the astronomical position is not necessarily the desired quantityfor some calculations, and since the number of facilities on cerro tololo andneighboring cerro pachon has grown considerably over the years, i decided tomeasure accurate geodetic positions for all of the observatories and someselect landmarks on the two peaks using gps and google earth. both sets ofmeasurements were inter-compared, and externally compared to a high accuracygeodetic position for a nasa space geodesy program survey monument on tololo. iconclude that google earth can currently be used to determine absolute geodeticpositions (i.e. compared to gps) accurate to roughly +-0.15" (+-5 m) inlatitude and longitude without correction, or approximately +-0".10 (+-3 m)with correction. i tabulate final geodetic and geocentric positions on thewgs-84 coordinate system for all astronomical observatories on cerro tololo andcerro pachon with accuracy +-0".1 (+-3 m). one surprise is that an oft-citedposition for lsst is in error by 9.4 km and the quoted elevation is in error by500 m.

1301.5036	a kine-chemical investigation of the ab dor moving group "stream"	the ab dor moving group consists of a "nucleus" of ~10 stars at d ~ 20 pc,along with dozens of purported "stream" members distributed across the sky. weperform a chemical and kinematic analysis of a subsample of ab dor stream starsto test whether they constitute a physical stellar group. we use the nemogalactic kinematic code to investigate the orbits of the stream members, andperform a chemical abundance analysis using high resolution spectra taken withthe magellan clay 6.5-m telescope. using a chi^2 test with the measuredabundances for 10 different elements, we find that only half of the purportedab dor stream members could possibly constitute a statistically chemicallyhomogeneous sample. some stream members with 3d velocities were hundreds ofparsecs from the ab dor nucleus ~10^8 yr ago, and hence were unlikely to sharea common origin. we conclude that the published lists of ab dor moving groupstream members are unlikely to represent the dispersed remnant of a single starformation episode. a subsample of the stream stars appears to be bothstatistically chemically homogeneous and in the vicinity of the ab dor nucleusat birth. their mean metallicity is [fe/h] = 0.02 +/- 0.02 dex, which weconsider representative for the ab dor group. finally, we report a strong lowerlimit on the age of the ab dor nucleus of &gt;110 myr based on the pre-mscontraction times for k-type members which have reached the main sequence.

1307.2657	intrinsic colors, temperatures, and bolometric corrections of pre-main  sequence stars	we present an analysis of the intrinsic colors and temperatures of 5-30 myrold pre-main sequence (pre-ms) stars using the f0 through m9 type members ofnearby, negligibly reddened groups: eta cha cluster, tw hydra association, betapic moving group, and tucana-horologium association. to check the consistencyof spectral types from the literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52nearby pre-ms stars with spectral types f3 through m4 using optical spectrataken with the smarts 1.5-m telescope. combining these new types with publishedspectral types, and photometry from the literature (johnson-cousins bvic, 2massjhks and wise w1, w2, w3, and w4), we derive a new empirical spectraltype-color sequence for 5-30 myr old pre-ms stars. colors for pre-ms starsmatch dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectraltypes and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. we estimate effectivetemperatures (teff) and bolometric corrections (bcs) for our pre-ms star samplethrough comparing their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using thebt-settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. we derive a new teff and bc scalefor pre-ms stars, which should be a more appropriate match for t tauri starsthan often-adopted dwarf star scales. while our new teff scale for pre-ms starsis within ~100 k of dwarfs at a given spectral type for stars &lt;g5, for g5through k6, the pre-ms stars are ~250 k cooler than their main sequencecounterparts. lastly, we present (1) a modern teff, optical/ir color, andbolometric correction sequence for o9v-m9v ms stars based on an extensiveliterature survey, (2) a revised q-method relation for dereddening ubvphotometry of ob-type stars, and (3) introduce two candidate spectral standardstars as representatives of spectral types k8v and k9v.

1309.3372	the kappa andromedae system: new constraints on the companion mass,  system age &amp; further multiplicity	kappa andromedae is a b9ivn star at 52 pc for which a faint substellarcompanion separated by 55 au was recently announced. in this work, we presentthe first spectrum of the companion, "kappa and b," using the project 1640high-contrast imaging platform. comparison of our low-resolution yjh-bandspectra to empirical brown dwarf spectra suggests an early-l spectral type.fitting synthetic spectra from phoenix model atmospheres to our observedspectrum allows us to constrain the effective temperature to ~2000k, as well asplace constraints on the companion surface gravity. further, we use previouslyreported log(g) and effective temperature measurements of the host star toargue that the kappa and system has an isochronal age of 220 +/- 100 myr, olderthan the 30 myr age reported previously. this interpretation of an older age iscorroborated by the photometric properties of kappa and b, which appear to bemarginally inconsistent with other 10-100 myr low-gravity l-dwarfs for thespectral type range we derive. in addition, we use keck aperture maskinginterferometry combined with published radial velocity measurements to rule outthe existence of any tight stellar companions to kappa and a that might beresponsible for the system's overluminosity. further, we show that luminosityenhancements due to a nearly "pole-on" viewing angle coupled with extremelyrapid rotation is unlikely. kappa and a is thus consistent with its slightlyevolved luminosity class (iv) and we propose here that kappa and, with arevised age of 220 +/- 100 myr, is an interloper to the 30 myr columbaassociation with which it was previously associated. the photometric andspectroscopic evidence for kappa and b combined with our re-assesment of thesystem age implies a substellar companion mass of 50^{+16}_{-13} jupitermasses, consistent with a brown dwarf rather than a planetary mass companion.

1311.7024	ages of young stars	determining the sequence of events in the formation of stars and planetarysystems and their time-scales is essential for understanding those processes,yet establishing ages is fundamentally difficult because we lack directindicators. in this review we discuss the age challenge for young stars,specifically those less than ~100 myr old. most age determination methods thatwe discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used toestimate the age of individual objects. a reliable age scale is establishedabove 20 myr from measurement of the lithium depletion boundary (ldb) in youngclusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the uppermain sequence and the main sequence turn-off -- if modest core convection androtation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. other availablemethods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placingstars in hertzsprung-russell diagrams, pulsations and seismology, surfacegravity measurement, rotation and activity, and lithium abundance. we revieweach of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. below ~20myr, both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situationis confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute agesyet exist. the lack of absolute age calibration below 20 myr should be borne inmind when considering the lifetimes of protostellar phases and circumstellarmaterial.

1502.04410	detecting the oldest geodynamo and attendant shielding from the solar  wind: implications for habitability	the onset and nature of the earliest geomagnetic field is important forunderstanding the evolution of the core, atmosphere and life on earth. a recordof the early geodynamo is preserved in ancient silicate crystals containingminute magnetic inclusions. these data indicate the presence of a geodynamoduring the paleoarchean, between 3.4 and 3.45 billion years ago. while themagnetic field sheltered earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoffof the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modernextreme solar storms. these conditions suggest that intense radiation from theyoung sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young earth by promoting lossof volatiles, including water. such effects would have been more pronounced ifthe field were absent or very weak prior to 3.45 billion years ago, assuggested by some models of lower mantle evolution. the frontier is thus tryingto obtain geomagnetic field records that are &gt;&gt;3.45 billion-years-old, as wellas constraining solar wind pressure for these times. in this review we suggestpathways for constraining these parameters and the attendant history of earth'sdeep interior, hydrosphere and atmosphere. in particular, we discuss newestimates for solar wind pressure for the first 700 million years of earthhistory, the competing effects of magnetic shielding versus solar ioncollection, and bounds on the detection level of a geodynamo imposed by thepresence of external fields. we also discuss the prospects for constraininghadean-paleoarchean magnetic field strength using paleointensity analyses ofzircons.

1509.00007	direct exoplanet detection with binary differential imaging	binaries are typically excluded from direct imaging exoplanet surveys.however, the recent findings of kepler and radial velocity programs show thatplanets can and do form in binary systems. here, we suggest that visualbinaries offer unique advantages for direct imaging. we show that binarydifferential imaging (bdi), whereby two stars are imaged simultaneously at thesame wavelength within the isoplanatic patch at high strehl ratio, offersimproved point spread function (psf) subtraction that can result in increasedsensitivity to planets close to each star. we demonstrate this by observing ayoung visual binary separated by 4\asec ~with magao/clio-2 at 3.9 \microns,where the strehl ratio is high, the isoplanatic patch is large, and giantplanets are bright. comparing bdi to angular differential imaging (adi), wefind that bdi's 5$\sigma$ contrast is \about 0.5 mags better than adi's within\about 1\asec ~for the particular binary we observed. because planets typicallyreside close to their host stars, bdi is a promising technique for discoveringexoplanets in stellar systems that are often ignored. bdi is also 2-4$\times$more efficient than adi and classical reference psf subtraction, since planetscan be detected around both the target and psf reference simultaneously. we arecurrently exploiting this technique in a new magao survey for giant planets in140 young nearby visual binaries. bdi on a space-based telescope would not belimited by isoplanatism effects and would therefore be an even more powerfultool for imaging and discovering planets.

astro-ph;0005583	the eta chamaeleontis cluster: origin in the sco-cen ob association	a young, nearby compact aggregate of x-ray emitting pre-main sequence starswas recently discovered in the vicinity of eta cha (b8v). in this paper, wefurther investigate this cluster: its membership, its environs and origins.rosat hri x-ray data for the cluster's t tauri stars show high levels ofmagnetic activity and variability. the cluster has an anomalous x-rayluminosity function compared to other young clusters, deficient in stars withlow, but detectable x-ray luminosities. this suggests that many low-massmembers have escaped the surveyed core region. photographic photometry from theusno-a2.0 catalog indicates that additional, x-ray-quiet members exist in thecluster core region. the components of the eclipsing binary rs cha, previouslymodeled in the literature as post-ms with discordant ages, are shown to beconsistent with being coeval pre-ms stars. we compute the galactic motion ofthe cluster from hipparcos data, and compare it to other young stars andassociations in the fourth galactic quadrant. the kinematic study shows thatthe eta cha cluster, the tw hya association, and a new group near epsilon cha,probably originated near the giant molecular cloud complex that formed the twooldest subgroups of the sco-cen ob association roughly 10-15 myr ago. theirdispersal is consistent with the velocity dispersions seen in giant molecularclouds. a large h i filament and dust lane located near eta cha has beenidentified as part of a superbubble formed by sco-cen ob winds and supernovaremnants. the passage of the superbubble may have terminated star-formation inthe eta cha cluster and dispersed its natal molecular gas.

astro-ph;0201489	a disrupted circumstellar torus inside eta carinae's homunculus nebula	we present thermal infrared images of the bipolar nebula surrounding etacarinae at six wavelengths from 4.8 to 24.5 microns. these were obtained withthe mirac3 camera system at the magellan observatory. our images reveal newintricate structure in the bright core of the nebula, allowing us tore-evaluate interpretations of morphology seen in images with lower resolution.complex structures in the core might not arise from a pair of overlapping ringsor a cool (110 k) and very massive dust torus, as has been suggested recently.instead, it seems more likely that the arcs and compact knots comprise a warm(350 k) disrupted torus at the intersection of the larger polar lobes. some ofthe arcs appear to break out of the inner core region, and may be associatedwith equatorial features seen in optical images. the torus could have beendisrupted by a post-eruption stellar wind, or by ejecta from the great eruptionitself if the torus existed before that event. kinematic data are required torule out either possibility.

astro-ph;0205417	post-t tauri stars in the nearest ob association	we present results of a spectroscopic survey of x-ray- and propermotion-selected samples of late-type stars in the lower cen-cru (lcc) and uppercen-lup (ucl) subgroups of the nearest ob association: sco-cen. the primarygoals of the survey are to determine the star-formation history of the obsubgroups, and to assess the frequency of accreting stars in a sample dominatedby ``post-t tauri'' pre-ms stars. we investigate two samples: (1) act and trcproper motion candidates with x-ray counterparts in the rosat all-sky surveybsc, and (2) g and k-type hipparcos candidate members (de zeeuw et al. 1999).we obtained optical spectra of 130 candidates with the mssso 2.3-m dbs. pre-msstars were identified by (1) strong li 6707a absorption, (2) subgiant surfacegravities, (3) proper motions consistent with sco-cen membership, and (4) hrdpositions consistent with being pre-ms. we demonstrate that measuring thegravity-sensitive band-ratio of sr ii 4077a to fe i 4071a is a valuable meansof discriminating pre-ms and zams stars. depending on the choice ofevolutionary tracks, we find the mean pre-ms ages to range between 17-23 myr(lcc), and 15-22 myr (ucl). accounting for observational uncertainties, itappears that 95% of the low-mass star-formation in each subgroup occurred inless than 8 myr (lcc) and 12 myr (ucl). we find main sequence turn-off ages forhipparcos b-type members to be 16+-1 myr (lcc) and 17+-1 myr (ucl). contrary toprevious findings, it appears that lcc is coeval with, or slightly older than,ucl. only 1 out of 110 (0.9^+2.1_-0.8 %) pre-ms solar-type stars in the samplewith ages of 13+-1 (s.e.)+-6 (1sigma) myr and masses of 1.3+-0.2 msun showsboth enhanced halpha emission and a k-band excess indicative of accretion froma truncated circumstellar disk.

astro-ph;0305209	solar-type post-t tauri stars in the nearest ob subgroups	i discuss results from the recent spectroscopic survey for solar-type pre-msstars in the lower centaurus-crux (lcc) and upper centaurus-lupus (ucl) obsubgroups by mamajek, meyer, &amp; liebert (2002, aj, 124, 1670). lcc and ucl aresubgroups of the sco-cen ob association, and the two nearest ob subgroups tothe sun. in the entire survey of 110 pre-main sequence stars, there exists onlyone classical t tauri star (pds 66), implying that only ~1% of ~1 msun starsare still accreting at age 13$\pm$7 (1$\sigma$) myr. accounting forobservational errors, the hrd placement of the pre-ms stars is consistent withthe bulk of star-formation taking place within 5-10 myr. in this contribution,i estimate conservative upper limits to the intrinsic velocity dispersions ofthe post-t tauri stars in the lcc and ucl subgroups (&lt;1.6 km/s and &lt;2.2 km/s,respectively; 95% cl) using monte-carlo simulations of tycho-2 proper motionsfor candidate subgroup members. i also demonstrate that a new ob subgrouprecently proposed to exist in chamaeleon probably does not.

astro-ph;0308496	an adaptive optics survey of m6.0-m7.5 stars: discovery of three very  low mass binary systems including two probable hyades members	a survey of 30 nearby m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs with ks&lt;12 mag utilizing the hokupa'aadaptive optics system at the gemini north telescope has discovered 3 newbinary systems. all 3 systems have separations between 0.12-0.29 arcsec (3-10au) with similar mass ratios (q&gt;0.8, delta ks&lt;0.7). this result gives furthersupport to the suggestion that wide (a&gt;20 au) very low mass (m_{tot}&lt;0.185m_sun) binary systems are exceedingly rare or perhaps even non-existant. thesemimajor axis distribution of these systems peaks at ~5 au, tighter than moremassive m and g binary distributions which have a broad peak at separations of\~30 au. we find a sensitivity-corrected binary fraction in the range of5_{-2}^{+4}% for m6.0-m7.5 stars with separations a&gt;3 au. this binary frequencyis less than the ~32% measured among early m dwarfs over the same separationrange. two of the low-mass binaries are probable hyades open cluster membersbased on proper motions, cluster membership probabilities, radial velocities,and near-ir photometry. lp415-20 has the distinction of being the tightest (3.6au) multiple system ever spatially resolved in the cluster and the companionsof lp415-20 and lp475-855 are among the least massive objects ever resolved inthe hyades with estimated masses of 0.081_{-0.010}^{+0.009} and0.082_{-0.009}^{+0.009} m_{\sun}.

astro-ph;0405271	constraining the lifetime of circumstellar disks in the terrestrial  planet zone: a mid-ir survey of the 30-myr-old tucana-horologium association	we have conducted an n-band survey of 14 young stars in the ~30 myr-oldtucana-horologium association to search for evidence of warm, circumstellardust disks. using the mirac-blinc camera on the magellan i (baade) 6.5-mtelescope, we find that none of the stars have a statistically significantn-band excess compared to the predicted stellar photospheric flux. using threedifferent sets of assumptions, this null result rules out the existence of thefollowing around these post-t tauri stars: (a) optically-thick disks with innerhole radii of ~&lt;0.1 au, (b) optically-thin disks with masses of &gt;10^{-6}m_earth (in ~1-micron-sized grains) within ~&lt;10 au of these stars, (c)scaled-up analogs of the solar system zodiacal dust cloud with &gt;4000x theemitting area. our survey was sensitive to dust disks in the terrestrial planetzone with fractional luminosity of log(l_{dust}/l_{star}) ~ 10^{-2.9}, yet nonewere found. combined with results from previous surveys, these data suggestthat circumstellar dust disks become so optically-thin as to be undetectable atn-band before age ~20 myr. we also present n-band photometry for severalmembers of other young associations and a subsample of targets that will beobserved with spitzer space telescope by the formation and evolution ofplanetary systems (feps) legacy science program. lastly, we present an absolutecalibration of mirac-blinc for four filters (l, n, 11.6, and q_s) on thecohen-walker-witteborn system.

astro-ph;0506434	formation and evolution of planetary systems: cold outer disks  associated with sun-like stars	we present the discovery of debris systems around three solar mass starsbased upon observations performed with the spitzer space telescope as part of alegacy science program, ``the formation and evolution of planetary systems''(feps). we also confirm the presence of debris around two other stars. all thestars exhibit infrared emission in excess of the expected photospheres in the70 micron band, but are consistent with photospheric emission at &lt;= 33 micron.this restricts the maximum temperature of debris in equilibrium with thestellar radiation to t &lt; 70 k. we find that these sources are relatively old inthe feps sample, in the age range 0.7 - 3 gyr. based on models of the spectralenergy distributions, we suggest that these debris systems represent materialsgenerated by collisions of planetesimal belts. we speculate on the nature ofthese systems through comparisons to our own kuiper belt, and on the likelyplanet(s) responsible for stirring the system and ultimately releasing dustthrough collisions. we further report observations of a nearby star hd 13974 (d=11 pc) that is indistinguishable from a bare photosphere at both 24 micron and70 micron. the observations place strong upper limits on the presence of anycold dust in this nearby system (l_ir/l_* &lt; 10^{-5.2}).

astro-ph;0507416	a moving cluster distance to the exoplanet 2m1207 b in the tw hya  association	a candidate extrasolar planet companion to the young brown dwarf 2masswj1207334-393254 (2m1207) was recently discovered by chauvin et al. they findthat 2m1207 b's temperature and luminosity are consistent with being a young,\~5 m_jupiter planet. the 2m1207 system is purported to be a member of the twhya association (twa), and situated ~70 pc away. using a revised space motionvector for twa, and improved proper motion for 2m1207, i use the moving clustermethod to estimate the distance to the 2m1207 system and other twa members. thederived distance for 2m1207 (53+-6 pc) forces the brown dwarf and planet to behalf as luminous as previously thought. the inferred masses for 2m 1207 a and bdecrease to ~21 m_jup and ~3-4 m_jup, respectively, with the mass of b beingwell below the observed tip of the planetary mass function and the theoreticaldeuterium-burning limit. after removing probable lower centaurus-crux (lcc)members from the twa sample, as well as the probable non-member twa 22, theremaining twa members are found to have distances of 49 +- 3(s.e.m.) +-12(1sigma) pc, and an internal 1d velocity dispersion of 0.8(+0.3,-0.2) km/s.there is weak evidence that the twa is expanding, and the data are consistentwith a lower limit on the expansion age of 10 myr (95% confidence).

astro-ph;0609048	a distributed population of low mass pre-main sequence stars near the  taurus molecular clouds	we present a drift scan survey covering a ~5 deg by 50 deg region toward thesouthern portion of the taurus-auriga molecular cloud. data taken in the b,r,ifilters with the quest-2 camera on the palomar 48-inch telescope were combinedwith 2mass near-infrared photometry to select candidate young stars. follow-upoptical spectroscopy of 190 candidates led to identification of 42 new low masspre-main sequence stars with spectral types m4-m8, of which approximately halfexhibit surface gravity signatures similar to known taurus stars while theother half exhibit surface gravity signatures similar to members of thesomewhat older upper sco, tw hya and beta pic associations. the pre-mainsequence stars are spread over ~35 deg, and many are located well outside ofpreviously explored regions. from assessment of the spatial and proper motiondistributions, we argue that the new pre-main sequence stars identified farfrom the clouds cannot have originated from the vicinity of the 1-2 myr-oldsubclusters which contain the bulk of the identified taurus members, butinstead represent a newly-identified area of recent star-formation near theclouds.

astro-ph;0609064	a new nearby candidate star cluster in ophiuchus at d = 170 pc	the recent discoveries of nearby star clusters and associations within a fewhundred pc of the sun, as well as the order of magnitude difference in theformation rates of the embedded and open cluster populations, suggests thatadditional poor stellar groups are likely to be found at surprisingly closedistances to the sun. here i describe a new nearby stellar aggregate found byvirtue of the parallel proper motions, similar trigonometric parallaxes, andconsistent color-magnitude distribution of its early-type members. the 120myr-old group lies in ophiuchus at $d$ $\simeq$ 170 pc, with its most massivemember being the 4th-magnitude post-ms b8ii-iii star $\mu$ oph. the group mayhave escaped previous notice due to its non-negligible extinction ($a_v$$\simeq$ 0.9 mag). if the group was born with a normal initial mass function,and the nine b- and a-type systems represent a complete system ofintermediate-mass stars, then the original population was probably of order$\sim$200 systems. the age and space motion of the new cluster are very similarto those of the pleiades, $\alpha$ per cluster, and ab dor moving group,suggesting that these aggregates may have formed in the same star-formingcomplex some $\sim10^8$ yr ago.

astro-ph;0609141	spitzer 24 micron observations of open cluster ic 2391 and debris disk  evolution of fgk stars	we present 24 micron spitzer/mips photometric observations of the ~50 myropen cluster ic 2391. thirty-four cluster members ranging in spectral type fromb3-m5 were observed in the central square degree of the cluster. excessesindicative of debris disks were discovered around 1 a star, 6 fgk stars, andpossibly 1 m dwarf. for the cluster members observed to their photosphericlimit, we find a debris disk frequency of 10 (-3,+17)% for b-a stars and 31(-9,+13)% for fgk stars using a 15% relative excess threshold. relative to amodel of decaying excess frequency, the frequency of debris disks around a-typestars appears marginally low for the cluster's age while that of fgk starsappears consistent. scenarios that may qualitatively explain this result areexamined. we conclude that planetesimal activity in the terrestrial region offgk stars is common in the first ~50 myr and decays on timescales of ~100 myr.despite luminosity differences, debris disk evolution does not appear to dependstrongly on stellar mass.

astro-ph;0609372	evidence for mass-dependent circumstellar disk evolution in the 5  myr-old upper scorpius ob association	we present 4.5, 8, and 16um photometry from the spitzer space telescope for204 stars in the upper scorpius ob association. the data are used toinvestigate the frequency and properties of circumstellar disks around starswith masses between ~ 0.1 and 20 msun at an age of ~ 5 myr. we identify 35stars that have emission at 8um or 16um in excess of the stellar photosphere.the lower mass stars (~ 0.1-1.2 msun) appear surrounded by primordial opticallythick disks based on the excess emission characteristics. stars more massivethan ~ 1.8 msun have lower fractional excess luminosities suggesting that theinner ~ 10 au of the disk has been largely depleted of primordial material.none of the g and f stars (~ 1.2-1.8 msun) in our sample have an infraredexcess at wavelengths &lt;= 16um. these results indicate that the mechanisms fordispersing primordial optically thick disks operate less efficiently on averagefor low mass stars, and that longer time scales are available for the buildupof planetary systems in the terrestrial zone for stars with masses &lt; 1 msun.

0810.1003	formation and evolution of planetary systems (feps): properties of  debris dust around solar-type stars	we present spitzer photometric (irac and mips) and spectroscopic (irs lowresolution) observations for 314 stars in the formation and evolution ofplanetary systems (feps) legacy program. these data are used to investigate theproperties and evolution of circumstellar dust around solar-type stars spanningages from approximately 3 myr to 3 gyr. we identify 46 sources that exhibitexcess infrared emission above the stellar photosphere at 24um, and 21 sourceswith excesses at 70um. five sources with an infrared excess havecharacteristics of optically thick primordial disks, while the remainingsources have properties akin to debris systems. the fraction of systemsexhibiting a 24um excess greater than 10.2% above the photosphere is 15% forages &lt; 300 myr and declines to 2.7% for older ages. the upper envelope to the70um fractional luminosity appears to decline over a similar age range. thecharacteristic temperature of the debris inferred from the irs spectra rangebetween 60 and 180 k, with evidence for the presence of cooler dust to accountfor the strength of the 70um excess emission. no strong correlation is foundbetween dust temperature and stellar age. comparison of the observational datawith disk models containing a power-law distribution of silicate grains suggestthat the typical inner disk radius is &gt; 10 au. although the interpretation isnot unique, the lack of excess emission shortwards of 16um and the relativelyflat distribution of the 24um excess for ages &lt;300~myr is consistent withsteady-state collisional models.
