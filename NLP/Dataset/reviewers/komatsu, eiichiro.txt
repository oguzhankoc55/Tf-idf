0706.1801	mass-to-light ratio of ly-alpha emitters: implications of ly-alpha  surveys at redshifts z=5.7, 6.5, 7, and 8.8	using a simple method to interpret the luminosity function of ly-alphaemitters, we explore properties of ly-alpha emitters from 5.7 &lt; z &lt; 8.8 withvarious assumptions about metallicity and stellar mass spectra. we constrain amass-to-'observed' light ratio, m_h/l_band. for narrow-band surveys, l_band issimply related to the intrinsic ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction ofly-alpha photons, alpha_esc. the mass-to-'bolometric light', m_h/l_bol, canalso be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. theinferred m_h/l_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum.we find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of ly-alpha emittersfrom 5.7 &lt; z &lt; 7: (m_h/l_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26,and 9-17 for z=0, 1/50, and 1 z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'dutycycle' of ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulativeluminosity function. only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. therefore,ly-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies m_h/l_bol ~0.1-1 with a smaller ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (m_h/l_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction ofly-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1. we find noevidence for the end of reionization in the luminosity functions of ly-alphaemitters discovered in the current ly-alpha surveys, including recent discoveryof one ly-alpha emitter at z=7. the data are consistent with no evolution ofintrinsic properties of ly-alpha emitters or neutral fraction in theintergalactic medium up to z=7. no detection of sources at z=8.8 does not yielda significant constraint yet. we also show that the lack of detection at z=8.8does not rule out the high-z galaxies being the origin of the excess nirb.

0903.0894	cmb anisotropies at second order iii: bispectrum from products of the  first-order perturbations	we calculate the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)temperature anisotropies induced by the second-order fluctuations in theboltzmann equation. in this paper, which is one of a series of papers on thenumerical calculation of the bispectrum from the second-order fluctuations, weconsider the terms that are products of the first-order perturbations, andleave intrinsically second-order terms and perturbations in the recombinationhistory to the subsequent papers. we show that the bispectrum has the maximumsignal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordialbispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of thefirst-order terms in position space. however, detailed calculations show thattheir shapes are sufficiently different: the cross-correlation coefficientreaches 0.5 at the maximum multipole of l_{max}~ 200, and then weakens to 0.3at l_{max}~ 2000. the differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acousticoscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not beingscale-invariant. this implies that the contamination of the primordialbispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of thefirst-order terms) is small. the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the productsof the first-order terms is ~ 0.4 at l_{max}~ 2000 for a full-sky, cosmicvariance limited experiment. we therefore conclude that the products of thefirst-order terms may be safely ignored in the analysis of the future cmbexperiments. the expected contamination of the local-form f_{nl} isf^{local}_{nl}~ 0.9 at l_{max}~ 200, and f^{local}_{nl}~ 0.5 at l_{max}~ 2000.

0903.2669	third-order perturbation theory with non-linear pressure	we calculate the non-linear matter power spectrum using the 3rd-orderperturbation theory without ignoring the pressure gradient term. we consider asemi-realistic system consisting of two matter components with and withoutpressure, and both are expanded into the 3rd order in perturbations in aself-consistent manner, for the first time. while the pressured component maybe identified with baryons or neutrinos, in this paper we mainly explore thephysics of the non-linear pressure effect using a toy model in which the jeanslength does not depend on time, i.e., the sound speed decreases as 1/a^{1/2},where a is the scale factor. the linear analysis shows that the power spectrumbelow the so-called filtering scale is suppressed relative to the powerspectrum of the cold dark matter. our non-linear calculation shows that theactual filtering scale for a given sound speed is smaller than the linearfiltering scale by a factor depending on the redshift and the jeans length. a~40% change is common, and our results suggest that, when applied to baryons,the temperature of the inter-galactic medium inferred from the filtering scaleobserved in the flux power spectrum of lyman-alpha forests would beunderestimated by a factor of two, if one used the linear filtering scale tointerpret the data. the filtering mass, which is proportional to the filteringscale cubed, can also be significantly smaller than the linear theoryprediction especially at low redshift, where the actual filtering mass can besmaller than the linear prediction by a factor of three. finally, when appliedto neutrinos, we find that neutrino perturbations deviate significantly fromlinear perturbations even below the free-streaming scales, and thus neutrinoscannot be treated as linear perturbations.

0904.0497	primordial non-gaussianity, scale-dependent bias, and the bispectrum of  galaxies	we calculate the bispectrum, b_g(k_1,k_2,k_3), fourier transform of thethree-point function of density peaks (e.g., galaxies), using two differentmethods: the matarrese-lucchin-bonometto formula and the locality of galaxybias. the bispectrum of peaks is not only sensitive to that of the underlyingmatter density fluctuations, but also to the four-point function. for aphysically-motivated, local form of primordial non-gaussianity in the curvatureperturbation, we show that the galaxy bispectrum contains five physicallydistinct pieces: (i) non-linear gravitational evolution, (ii) non-linear galaxybias, (iii) f_nl, (iv) f_nl^2, and (v) \gnl. while (i), (ii), and a part of(iii) have been derived in the literature, (iv) and (v) are derived in thispaper for the first time. our finding suggests that the galaxy bispectrum ismore sensitive to f_nl than previously recognized, and is also sensitive to anew term, g_nl. for a more general form of local-type non-gaussianity, thecoefficient \fnl^2 can be interpreted as \tau_nl, which allows us to testmulti-field inflation models. the usual terms from gaussian initial conditions,have the smallest signals in the squeezed configurations, while the others havethe largest signals; thus, we can distinguish them easily. we cannot interpretthe effects of f_nl on b_g(k_1,k_2,k_3) as a scale-dependent bias, and thusreplacing the linear bias in the galaxy bispectrum with the scale-dependentbias known for the power spectrum results in an incorrect prediction. as theimportance of primordial non-gaussianity relative to the non-linear gravityevolution and galaxy bias increases toward higher redshifts, galaxy surveysprobing a high-redshift universe are particularly useful for probing theprimordial non-gaussianity.

0906.4552	the cosmic near infrared background ii: fluctuations	the near infrared background (nirb) is one of a few methods that can be usedto observe the redshifted light from early stars at a redshift of six andabove. fluctuations of the nirb can provide information on the firststructures, such as halos and their surrounding ionized regions in the igm. wecombine, for the first time, n-body simulations, radiative transfer code, andanalytic calculations of luminosity of early structures to predict the angularpower spectrum (c_l) of fluctuations in the nirb. we study the effects ofvarious assumptions about the stellar mass, the initial mass spectrum of stars,metallicity, the star formation efficiency (f_*), the escape fraction ofionizing photons (f_esc), and the star formation timescale (t_sf), on theamplitude as well as the shape of c_l. the power spectrum of nirb fluctuationsis maximized when f_* is the largest (as c_l ~ (f_*)^2) and f_esc is thesmallest. a significant uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of c_l existsdue to our lack of knowledge of t_sf of these galaxies, which is equivalent toour lack of knowledge of the mass-to-light ratio. we do not see a turnover inthe nirb angular power spectrum of the halo contribution and explain this asthe effect of high levels of non-linear bias. this is partly due to our choiceof the minimum mass of halos contributing to nirb, and a smaller minimum mass,which has a smaller non-linear bias, may still exhibit a turn over. therefore,both the amplitude and shape of the nirb power spectrum provide importantinformation regarding the nature of sources contributing to the cosmicreionization. the angular power spectrum of the igm, in most cases, is muchsmaller than the halo angular power spectrum. in addition, low levels of theobserved mean background intensity tend to rule out high values of f_* &gt; 0.2.

1002.3615	cosmic shears should not be measured in conventional ways	a long standing problem in weak lensing is about how to construct cosmicshear estimators from galaxy images. conventional methods average over a singlequantity per galaxy to estimate each shear component. we show that any suchshear estimators must reduce to a highly nonlinear form when the galaxy imageis described by three parameters (pure ellipse), even in the absence of thepoint spread function (psf). in the presence of the psf, we argue that thisclass of shear estimators do not likely exist. alternatively, we propose a newway of measuring the cosmic shear: instead of averaging over a single valuefrom each galaxy, we average over two numbers, and then take the ratio toestimate the shear component. in particular, the two numbers correspond to thenumerator and denominators which generate the quadrupole moments of the galaxyimage in fourier space, as proposed in zhang (2008). this yields astatistically unbiased estimate of the shear component. consequently,measurements of the n-point spatial correlations of the shear fields shouldalso be modified: one needs to take the ratio of two correlation functions toget the desired, unbiased shear correlation.

1003.0939	bullet cluster: a challenge to lcdm cosmology	to quantify how rare the bullet-cluster-like high-velocity merging systemsare in the standard lcdm cosmology, we use a large-volume 27 (gpc/h)^3 micesimulation to calculate the distribution of infall velocities of subclustersaround massive main clusters. the infall-velocity distribution is given at(1-3)r_{200} of the main cluster (where r_{200} is similar to the virialradius), and thus it gives the distribution of realistic initial velocities ofsubclusters just before collision. these velocities can be compared with theinitial velocities used by the non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of1e0657-56 in the literature. the latest parameter search carried out recentlyby mastropietro and burkert showed that the initial velocity of 3000 km/s atabout 2r_{200} is required to explain the observed shock velocity, x-raybrightness ratio of the main and subcluster, and displacement of the x-raypeaks from the mass peaks. we show that such a high infall velocity at 2r_{200}is incompatible with the prediction of a lcdm model: the probability of finding3000 km/s in (2-3)r_{200} is between 3.3x10^{-11} and 3.6x10^{-9}. it isconcluded that the existence of 1e0657-56 is incompatible with the predictionof a lcdm model, unless a lower infall velocity solution for 1e0657-56 with &lt;1800 km/s at 2r_{200} is found.

1009.3530	effects of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation on the energy  spectrum of the extragalactic gamma-ray background	we calculate the effects of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation crosssections on the intensity of the extragalactic gamma-ray background. ourformalism does not assume a locally thermal distribution of dark matterparticles in phase space, and is valid for arbitrary velocity-dependentannihilation. as concrete examples, we calculate the effects of p-waveannihilation (with the $v$-weighted cross section of $\sigma v=a+bv^2$) on themean intensity of extragalactic gamma rays produced in cosmological dark matterhalos. this velocity variation makes the shape of the energy spectrum harder,but this change in the shape is too small to see unless $b/a\agt 10^6$. whilewe find no such models in the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetricstandard model (mssm), we show that it is possible to find $b/a\agt 10^6$ inthe extension mssm$\otimes u(1)_{b-l}$. however, we find that the most dominanteffect of the p-wave annihilation is the suppression of the amplitude of thegamma-ray background. a non-zero $b$ at the dark matter freeze-out epochrequires a smaller value of $a$ in order for the relic density constraint to besatisfied, suppressing the amplitude by a factor as low as $10^{-6}$ for athermal relic. non-thermal relics will have weaker amplitude suppression. asanother velocity-dependent effect, we calculate the spectrum for s-waveannihilation into fermions enhanced by the attractive sommerfeld effect.resonances associated with this effect result in significantly enhancedintensities, with a slightly softer energy spectrum.

1112.2064	the cosmic near infrared background iii: fluctuations, reionization and  the effects of minimum mass and self-regulation	current observations suggest that the universe was reionized sometime beforez~6. one way to observe this epoch of the universe is through the near infraredbackground (nirb), which contains information about galaxies which may be toofaint to be observed individually. we calculate the angular power spectrum(c_l) of the nirb fluctuations caused by the distribution of these galaxies.assuming a complete subtraction of any post-reionization component, c_l will bedominated by galaxies responsible for completing reionization (e.g., z~6). theshape of c_l at high l is sensitive to the amount of non-linear bias of darkmatter halos hosting galaxies. as the non-linear bias depends on the mass ofthese halos, we can use the shape of c_l to infer typical masses of dark matterhalos responsible for completing reionization. we extend our previous study byusing a higher-resolution n-body simulation, which can resolve halos down to10^8 m_sun. we also include improved radiative transfer, which allows for thesuppression of star formation in small-mass halos due to photo-ionizationheating. as the non-linear bias enhances the dark-matter-halo power spectrum onsmall scales, we find that c_l is steeper for the case with a completesuppression of small sources or partial suppression of star formation in smallhalos (the minimum galaxy mass is m_min=10^9 m_sun in ionized regions andm_min=10^8 m_sun in neutral regions) than the case in which these small haloswere unsuppressed. in all cases, we do not see a turn-over toward high l in theshape of l^2 c_l.

1204.4241	scale-dependent bias of galaxies and mu-type distortion of the cosmic  microwave background spectrum from single-field inflation with a modified  initial state	we investigate the phenomenological consequences of a modification of theinitial state of a single inflationary field. while single-field inflation withthe standard bunch-davies initial vacuum state does not generally produce ameasurable three-point function (bispectrum) in the squeezed configuration,allowing for a non-standard initial state produces an exception. here, wecalculate the signature of an initial state modification in single-fieldslow-roll inflation in both the scale-dependent bias of the large-scalestructure (lss) and mu-type distortion in the black-body spectrum of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb). we parametrize the initial state modifications andidentify certain choices of parameters as natural, though we also note somefine-tuned choices that can yield a larger bispectrum. in both cases, weobserve a distinctive k^-3 signature in lss (as opposed to k^-2 for thelocal-form). as a non-zero bispectrum in the squeezed configuration correlatesa long-wavelength mode with two short-wavelength modes, it induces acorrelation between the cmb temperature anisotropy on large scales with thetemperature-anisotropy-squared on very small scales; this correlation persistsas the small-scale anisotropy-squared is processed into mu-type distortions.while the local-form mu-distortion turns out to be too small to detect in thenear future, a modified initial vacuum state enhances the signal by a largefactor owing to an extra factor of k_1/k. for example, a proposedabsolutely-calibrated experiment, pixie, is expected to detect this correlationwith a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, for an occupation number of about0.5 in the observable modes. relatively calibrated experiments such as planckand litebird should also be able to measure this effect, provided that therelative calibration between different frequencies meets the requiredprecision.

1208.1073	{\delta}n formalism	precise understanding of nonlinear evolution of cosmological perturbationsduring inflation is necessary for the correct interpretation of measurements ofnon-gaussian correlations in the cosmic microwave background and thelarge-scale structure of the universe. the "{\delta}n formalism" is a popularand powerful technique for computing non-linear evolution of cosmologicalperturbations on large scales. in particular, it enables us to compute thecurvature perturbation, {\zeta}, on large scales without actually solvingperturbed field equations. however, people often wonder why this is the case.in order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed hamiltonian constraintand matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice ofcoordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.we find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by ahomogeneous and isotropic friedmann-lema\^itre-robertson-walker metric; and (2)on large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore theshift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations togij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric. while the first condition has to be assumeda priori, the second condition can be met when (3) the anisotropic stressbecomes negligible on large scales. however, in order to explicitly show thatthe second condition follows from the third condition, one has to usegravitational field equations, and thus this statement may depend on thedetails of theory of gravitation. finally, as the {\delta}n formalism uses onlythe hamiltonian constraint and matter-field equations, it does not a priorirespect the momentum constraint. we show that the violation of the momentumconstraint only yields a decaying mode solution for {\zeta}, and the violationvanishes when the slow-roll conditions are satisfied.

0711.3442	gravitational inflaton decay and the hierarchy problem	we study implications of the large-n species solution to the hierarchyproblem, proposed by g. dvali, for reheating of the universe after inflation.dvali's proposal contains additional n~10^{32} z_2-conserved quantum fieldsbeyond the standard model particles with mass ~1 tev, which weaken gravity by afactor of 1/n, and thus explain the hierarchy between the plank scale and theelectroweak scale. we show that, in this scenario, the decay rates of inflatonfields through gravitational decay channels are enhanced by a factor of n, andthus they decay into n species of the quantum fields very efficiently, in thelimit that quantum gravity effects are unimportant for the gravitational decayrate. in order not to over-reheat the universe, inflaton mass, vacuumexpectation value of inflaton, or non-minimal gravitational coupling should betightly fine-tuned. our conclusion holds even when the gravitational decay isprohibited by some symmetry of the theory; the universe may still beover-reheated via annihilation of inflatons, if the number density of inflatonquanta is greater than the critical value.

1301.3607	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect as a probe of the physics of  cosmic reionization: the effect of self-regulated reionization	we calculate the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) temperature fluctuations induced by the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect from the epoch of reionization (eor). we use detailed n-body+radiativetransfer simulations to follow inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalacticmedium (igm). for the first time we take into account the "self-regulation" ofreionization: star formation in low-mass dwarf galaxies (10^8 m_\sun \lesssim m\lesssim 10^9 m_\sun) or minihalos (10^5 m_\sun \lesssim m \lesssim 10^8m_\sun) is suppressed if these halos form in the regions that were alreadyionized or lyman-werner dissociated. some previous work suggested that theamplitude of the ksz power spectrum from the eor can be described by atwo-parameter family: the epoch of half ionization and the duration ofreionization. however, we argue that this picture applies only to simple formsof the reionization history which are roughly symmetric about thehalf-ionization epoch. in self-regulated reionization, the universe begins tobe ionized early, maintains a low level of ionization for an extended period,and then finishes reionization as soon as high-mass atomically-cooling halosdominate. while inclusion of self-regulation affects the amplitude of the kszpower spectrum only modestly (\sim 10 %), it can change the duration ofreionization by a factor of more than two. we conclude that the simpletwo-parameter family does not capture the effect of a physical, yet complex,reionization history caused by self-regulation. when added to thepost-reionization ksz contribution, our prediction for the total ksz powerspectrum is below the current upper bound from the south pole telescope.therefore, the current upper bound on the ksz effect from the eor is consistentwith our understanding of the physics of reionization.

1301.5901	constraints on the annihilation cross section of dark matter particles  from anisotropies in the diffuse gamma-ray background measured with fermi-lat	annihilation of dark matter particles in cosmological halos (including a haloof the milky way) contributes to the diffuse gamma-ray background (dgrb). asthis contribution will appear anisotropic in the sky, one can use the angularpower spectrum of anisotropies in dgrb to constrain properties of dark matterparticles. by comparing the updated analytic model of the angular powerspectrum of dgrb from dark matter annihilation with the power spectrum recentlymeasured from the 22-month data of fermi large area telescope (lat), we placeupper limits on the annihilation cross section of dark matter particles as afunction of dark matter masses. we find that the current data exclude &lt;\sigmav&gt; &gt;~ 10^{-25} cm^3 s^{-1} for annihilation into b\bar{b} at the dark mattermass of 10 gev, which is a factor of three times larger than the canonicalcross section. the limits are weaker for larger dark matter masses. the limitscan be improved further with more fermi-lat data as well as by using the powerspectrum at lower multipoles (l &lt;~ 150), which are currently not used due to apotential galactic foreground contamination.

1302.3056	signatures of anisotropic sources in the squeezed-limit bispectrum of  the cosmic microwave background	the bispectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in the squeezedconfiguration, in which one wavenumber, $k_3$, is much smaller than the othertwo, $k_3\ll k_1\approx k_2$, plays a special role in constraining the physicsof inflation. in this paper we study a new phenomenological signature in thesqueezed-limit bispectrum: namely, the amplitude of the squeezed-limitbispectrum depends on an angle between ${\bf k}_1$ and ${\bf k}_3$ such that$b_\zeta(k_1, k_2, k_3) \to 2 \sum_l c_l p_l(\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bf k}_3)p_\zeta(k_1)p_\zeta(k_3)$, where $p_l$ are the legendre polynomials. while$c_0$ is related to the usual local-form $f_{\rm nl}$ parameter as $c_0=6f_{\rmnl}/5$, the higher-multipole coefficients, $c_1$, $c_2$, etc., have not beenconstrained by the data. primordial curvature perturbations sourced bylarge-scale magnetic fields generate non-vanishing $c_0$, $c_1$, and $c_2$.inflation models whose action contains a term like $i(\phi)^2 f^2$ generate$c_2=c_0/2$. a recently proposed "solid inflation" model generates $c_2\ggc_0$. a cosmic-variance-limited experiment measuring temperature anisotropy ofthe cosmic microwave background up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2000$ is able to measurethese coefficients down to $\delta c_0=4.4$, $\delta c_1=61$, and $\deltac_2=13$ (68% cl). we also find that $c_0$ and $c_1$, and $c_0$ and $c_2$, arenearly uncorrelated. measurements of these coefficients will open up a newwindow into the physics of inflation such as the existence of vector fieldsduring inflation or non-trivial symmetry structure of inflaton fields. finally,we show that the original form of the suyama-yamaguchi inequality does notapply to the case involving higher-spin fields, but a generalized form does.

1302.5799	removing the isw-lensing bias from the local-form primordial  non-gaussianity estimation	the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect produces a secondary temperatureanisotropy of cmb. the main contribution comes from z&lt;2, where dark energyleads to a decay of potentials. as the same photons are gravitationally lensedby these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of correlation betweenthe isw effect and cmb lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. this isw-lensingbispectrum, whose shape resembles that of the so-called "local-form" primordialbispectrum parametrized by fnl, is known to be the largest contamination offnl. in order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-gaussianity, weneed to remove the isw-lensing bias. in this work, we investigate threedebiasing methods: (i) subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of theisw-lensing bispectrum; (ii) subtraction of a measured isw-lensing bispectrum;and (iii) direct subtraction of an estimated isw signal from an observedtemperature map. one may use an estimation of the isw map from external non-cmbdata or that from the cmb data themselves. as the methods ii and iii are basedon fewer assumptions about the nature of dark energy, they are preferred overthe method i. while the methods i and ii yield unbiased estimates of fnl withcomparable error bars, the method iii yields a biased result when theunderlying primordial fnl is non-zero and the isw map is estimated from alensing potential reconstructed from the observed temperature map. one of thesources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias which is independentof fnl and can be calculated precisely, but other fnl-dependent terms aredifficult to compute reliably. we thus conclude that the method ii is the best,model-independent way to remove the isw-lensing bias of fnl, enabling us totest the physics of inflation with smaller systematic errors.

1306.4157	galaxy redshift surveys with sparse sampling	survey observations of the three-dimensional locations of galaxies are apowerful approach to measure the distribution of matter in the universe, whichcan be used to learn about the nature of dark energy, physics of inflation,neutrino masses, etc. a competitive survey, however, requires a large volume(e.g., vsurvey is roughly 10 gpc3) to be covered, and thus tends to beexpensive. a "sparse sampling" method offers a more affordable solution to thisproblem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, vsurvey, weobserve only a fraction of the volume. the distribution of observed regionsshould be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scalecorresponding to the wavenumber of interest. then one can recover the powerspectrum of galaxies with precision expected for a survey covering a volume ofvsurvey (rather than the volume of the sum of observed regions) with the numberdensity of galaxies given by the total number of observed galaxies divided byvsurvey (rather than the number density of galaxies within an observed region).we find that regularly-spaced sampling yields an unbiased power spectrum withno window function effect, and deviations from regularly-spaced sampling, whichare unavoidable in realistic surveys, introduce calculable window functioneffects and increase the uncertainties of the recovered power spectrum. whilewe discuss the sparse sampling method within the context of the forthcominghobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment, the method is general and can beapplied to other galaxy surveys.

1309.1579	bispectrum from open inflation	we calculate the bispectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, \zeta,generated during "open inflation." inflation occurs inside a bubble nucleatedvia quantum tunneling from the background false vacuum state. our universelives inside the bubble, which can be described as afriedman-lema\^itre-robertson-walker (flrw) universe with negative spatialcurvature, undergoing slow-roll inflation. we pay special attention to theissue of an initial state for quantum fluctuations. a "vacuum state" defined bya positive-frequency mode in de sitter space charted by open coordinates isdifferent from the euclidean vacuum (which is equivalent to the so-called"bunch-davies vacuum"). quantum tunneling then modifies the initial state awayfrom the original euclidean vacuum. while most of the previous study onmodifications of the initial quantum state introduces, by hand, an initial timeat which the quantum state is modified as well as the form of the modification,an effective initial time naturally emerges and the form is fixed by quantumtunneling in open inflation models. therefore, open inflation enables aself-consistent computation of the effect of a modified initial state on thebispectrum. we find a term which goes as &lt;\zeta_{k_1} \zeta_{k_2} \zeta_{k_3}&gt;\propto 1/k_1^2k_3^4 in the so-called squeezed configurations, k_3\llk_1\approx k_2, in agreement with the previous study. the bispectrum in theexact folded limit, e.g., k_1=k_2+k_3, is also enhanced and remains finite.however, these terms are exponentially suppressed when the wavelength of \zetais smaller than the curvature radius of the universe. the leading-orderbispectrum is equal to the usual one from single-field slow-roll inflation; theterms specific for open inflation arise only in the sub-leading order when thewavelength of \zeta is smaller than the curvature radius.

1309.7994	constraining primordial magnetic fields with distortions of the  black-body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background: pre- and  post-decoupling contributions	observational limits on $y$- and $\mu$-type distortions can constrainproperties of magnetic fields in the early universe. for a gaussian, random,and non-helical field, $\mu$ and $y$ are calculated a function of thepresent-day strength of the field, $b_0$, smoothed over a certain gaussianwidth, $k_c^{-1}$, and spectral index, $n_b$, defined by $p_b(k)\proptok^{n_b}$. for $n_b=-2.9$ and $k_c^{-1}=1 {\rm mpc}$, the cobe/firas limit on$\mu$ yields $b_0&lt;40$ ng, whereas the projected pixie limit on $\mu$ wouldyield $b_0&lt;0.8$ ng. for non-scale-invariant spectra, constraints can bestronger. for $b_0=1$ ng with $k_c^{-1}=1 {\rm mpc}$, the cobe/firas limit on$\mu$ excludes a wide range of spectral indices given by $n_b&gt;-2.6$. afterdecoupling, energy dissipation is due to ambipolar diffusion and decaying mhdturbulence, creating a $y$-type distortion. the distortion is completelydominated by decaying mhd turbulence, and is of order $y\approx 10^{-7}$ for afew ng field smoothed over the damping scale at the decoupling epoch,$k_{d,dec}\approx 290 (b_0/1 {\rm ng})^{-1} {\rm mpc}^{-1}$. this contributionis as large as those of the known contributions such as reionization andvirialized objects at lower redshifts. the projected pixie limit on $y$ wouldexclude $b_0&gt;1.0$ and 0.6 ng for $n_b=-2.9$ and -2.3, respectively, and$b_0&gt;0.6$ ng for $n_b\geq 2$. the current limits on the optical depth tothomson scattering restrict the predicted $y$-type distortion to be $y\lesssim10^{-8}$.

1312.5221	signatures of anisotropic sources in the trispectrum of the cosmic  microwave background	soft limits of $n$-point correlation functions, in which one wavenumber ismuch smaller than the others, play a special role in constraining the physicsof inflation. anisotropic sources such as a vector field during inflationgenerate distinct angular dependence in all these correlators. in this paper wefocus on the four-point correlator (the trispectrum $t$). we adopt aparametrization motivated by models in which the inflaton $\phi$ is coupled toa vector field through a $i^2 \left( \phi \right) f^2$ interaction, namely$t_{\zeta}({\bf k}_1, {\bf k}_2, {\bf k}_3, {\bf k}_4) \equiv \sum_n d_n [p_n(\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bf k}_3) + p_n(\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bfk}_{12}) + p_n(\hat{\bf k}_3 \cdot \hat{\bf k}_{12}) ] p_{\zeta}(k_1)p_{\zeta}(k_3) p_\zeta(k_{12}) + (23~{\rm perm})$, where $p_n$ denotes thelegendre polynomials. this shape is enhanced when the wavenumbers of thediagonals of the quadrilateral are much smaller than the sides, ${\bf k}_i$.the coefficient of the isotropic part, $d_0$, is equal to $\tau_{\rm nl}/6$discussed in the literature. a $i^2 \left( \phi \right) f^2$ interactiongenerates $d_2 = 2 d_0$ which is, in turn, related to the quadrupole modulationparameter of the power spectrum, $g_*$, as $d_2 \approx 14 |g_*| n^2$ with $n\approx 60$. we show that $d_0$ and $d_2$ can be equally well-constrained: theexpected $68 \%$ cl error bars on these coefficients from acosmic-variance-limited experiment measuring temperature anisotropy of thecosmic microwave background up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2000$ are $\delta d_2 \approx4 \delta d_0 = 105$. therefore, we can reach $|g_*|=10^{-3}$ by measuring theangle-dependent trispectrum. the current upper limit on $\tau_{\rm nl}$ fromthe ${\it planck}$ temperature maps yields $|g_*|&lt;0.02$ ($95 \%$ cl).

1401.7657	analytical model for non-thermal pressure in galaxy clusters	non-thermal pressure in the intracluster gas has been found ubiquitously innumerical simulations, and observed indirectly. in this paper we develop ananalytical model for intracluster non-thermal pressure in the virial region ofrelaxed clusters. we write down and solve a first-order differential equationdescribing the evolution of non-thermal velocity dispersion. this equation isbased on insights gained from observations, numerical simulations, and theoryof turbulence. the non-thermal energy is sourced, in a self-similar fashion, bythe mass growth of clusters via mergers and accretion, and dissipates with atime-scale determined by the turnover time of the largest turbulence eddies.our model predicts a radial profile of non-thermal pressure for relaxedclusters. the non-thermal fraction increases with radius, redshift, and clustermass, in agreement with numerical simulations. the radial dependence is due toa rapid increase of the dissipation time-scale with radii, and the mass andredshift dependence comes from the mass growth history. combing our model forthe non-thermal fraction with the komatsu-seljak model for the total pressure,we obtain thermal pressure profiles, and compute the hydrostatic mass bias. wefind typically 10% bias for the hydrostatic mass enclosed within $r_{500}$.

1403.3411	position-dependent power spectrum of the large-scale structure: a novel  method to measure the squeezed-limit bispectrum	the influence of large-scale density fluctuations on structure formation onsmall scales is described by the three-point correlation function (bispectrum)in the so-called "squeezed configurations," in which one wavenumber, say $k_3$,is much smaller than the other two, i.e., $k_3\ll k_1\approx k_2$. thisbispectrum is generated by non-linear gravitational evolution and possibly alsoby inflationary physics. in this paper, we use this fact to show that thebispectrum in the squeezed configurations can be measured without employingthree-point function estimators. specifically, we use the "position-dependentpower spectrum," i.e., the power spectrum measured in smaller subvolumes of thesurvey (or simulation box), and correlate it with the mean overdensity of thecorresponding subvolume. this correlation directly measures an integral of thebispectrum dominated by the squeezed configurations. measuring this correlationis only slightly more complex than measuring the power spectrum itself, andsidesteps the considerable complexity of the full bispectrum estimation. we usecosmological $n$-body simulations of collisionless particles with gaussianinitial conditions to show that the measured correlation between theposition-dependent power spectrum and the long-wavelength overdensity agreeswith the theoretical expectation. the position-dependent power spectrum thusprovides a new, efficient, and promising way to measure the squeezed-limitbispectrum from large-scale structure observations such as galaxy redshiftsurveys.

1407.4291	bayesian evidence of non-standard inflation: isocurvature perturbations  and running spectral index	bayesian model comparison penalizes models with more free parameters that areallowed to vary over a wide range, and thus offers the most robust method todecide whether some given data require new parameters. in this paper, we ask asimple question: do current cosmological data require extensions of thesimplest single-field inflation models? specifically, we calculate the bayesianevidence of a totally anti-correlated isocurvature perturbation and a runningspectral index of the scalar curvature perturbation. these parameters aremotivated by recent claims that the observed temperature anisotropy of thecosmic microwave background on large angular scales is too low to be compatiblewith the simplest inflation models. both a subdominant, anti-correlated colddark matter isocurvature component and a negative running index succeed inlowering the large-scale temperature power spectrum. we show that theintroduction of isocurvature perturbations is disfavored, whereas that of therunning spectral index is only moderately favored, even when the bicep2 dataare included in the analysis without any foreground subtraction.

1408.3832	analytical model for non-thermal pressure in galaxy clusters - ii.  comparison with cosmological hydrodynamics simulation	turbulent gas motion inside galaxy clusters provides a non-negligiblenon-thermal pressure support to the intracluster gas. if not corrected, itleads to a systematic bias in the estimation of cluster masses from x-ray andsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, andaffects interpretation of measurements of the sz power spectrum andobservations of cluster outskirts from ongoing and upcoming large clustersurveys. recently, shi &amp; komatsu developed an analytical model for predictingthe radius, mass, and redshift dependence of the non-thermal pressurecontributed by the kinetic random motions of intracluster gas sourced by thecluster mass growth. in this paper, we compare the predictions of thisanalytical model to a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation.as different mass growth histories result in different non-thermal pressure, weperform the comparison on 65 simulated galaxy clusters on a cluster-by-clusterbasis. we find an excellent agreement between the modelled and simulatednon-thermal pressure profiles. our results open up the possibility of using theanalytical model to correct the systematic bias in the mass estimation ofgalaxy clusters. we also discuss tests of the physical picture underlying theevolution of intracluster non-thermal gas motions, as well as a way to furtherimprove the analytical modeling, which may help achieve a unified understandingof non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters.

1410.7770	measuring angular diameter distances of strong gravitational lenses	the distance-redshift relation plays a fundamental role in constrainingcosmological models. in this paper, we show that measurements of positions andtime delays of strongly lensed images of a background galaxy, as well as thoseof the velocity dispersion and mass profile of a lens galaxy, can be combinedto extract the angular diameter distance of the lens galaxy. physically, as thevelocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential ($gm/r$)and a mass ($gm$) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physicalsize ($r$) of the lens. comparing the physical size with the image positions ofa lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. a mismatchbetween the exact locations at which these measurements are made can becorrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. we expand on theoriginal idea put forward by paraficz and hjorth, who analyzed singularisothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law sphericalmass density profile, an external convergence, and an anisotropic velocitydispersion. we find that the effect of external convergence cancels out whendividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements. we derive aformula for the uncertainty in the angular diameter distance in terms of theuncertainties in the observables. as an application, we use two existing stronglens systems, b1608+656 ($z_{\rm l}=0.6304$) and rxj1131$-$1231 ($z_{\rml}=0.295$), to show that the uncertainty in the inferred angular diameterdistances is dominated by that in the velocity dispersion, $\sigma^2$, and itsanisotropy. we find that the current data on these systems should yield about16% uncertainty in $d_a$ per object. this improves to 13% when we measure$\sigma^2$ at the so-called sweet-spot radius. achieving 7% is possible if wecan determine $\sigma^2$ with 5% precision.

1411.5489	anisotropic inflation reexamined: upper bound on broken rotational  invariance during inflation	the presence of a light vector field coupled to a scalar field duringinflation makes a distinct prediction: the observed correlation functions ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) become statistically anisotropic. westudy the implications of the current bound on statistical anisotropy derivedfrom the planck 2013 cmb temperature data for such a model. the previouscalculations based on the attractor solution indicate that the magnitude ofanisotropy in the power spectrum is proportional to $n^2$, where $n$ is thenumber of $e$-folds of inflation counted from the end of inflation. in thispaper, we show that the attractor solution is not compatible with the currentbound, and derive new predictions using another branch of anisotropicinflation. in addition, we improve upon the calculation of the mode function ofperturbations by including the leading-order slow-roll corrections. we findthat the anisotropy is roughly proportional to$[2(\varepsilon_h+4\eta_h)/3-4(c-1)]^{-2}$, where $\varepsilon_h$ and $\eta_h$are the usual slow-roll parameters and $c$ is the parameter in the model,regardless of the form of potential of an inflaton field. the bound from planckimplies that breaking of rotational invariance during inflation (characterizedby the background homogeneous shear divided by the hubble rate) is limited tobe less than ${\cal o}(10^{-9})$. this bound is many orders of magnitudesmaller than the amplitude of breaking of time translation invariance, which isobserved to be ${\cal o}(10^{-2})$.

0805.4238	extracting angular diameter distance and expansion rate of the universe  from two-dimensional galaxy power spectrum at high redshifts: baryon acoustic  oscillation fitting versus full modeling	we present a method for extracting the angular diameter distances, $d_a$, andthe expansion rates, $h$, of the universe from the {\it two-dimensional} baryonacoustic oscillations (bao) in the galaxy power spectrum. our method buildsupon the existing algorithm called the "fit-and-extract" (fitex) method, whichallows one to extract only $d_a^2/h$ from a spherically averagedone-dimensional power spectrum. we develop the fitex-2d method, an extension ofthe fitex method, to include the two-dimensional information, which allows usto extract $d_a$ and $h$ simultaneously. we test the fitex-2d method using themillennium simulation as well as simplified monte carlo simulations with abigger volume. the baos, however, contain only a limited amount of information.we show that the full modeling, including the overall shape of the powerspectrum, yields much better determinations of $d_a$ and $h$, hence the darkenergy equation of state parameters such as $w_0$ and $w_a$, than the bao-onlyanalysis by more than a factor of two, provided that non-linear effects areunder control.

astro-ph;0005036	acoustic signatures in the primary microwave background bispectrum	if the primordial fluctuations are non-gaussian, then this non-gaussianitywill be apparent in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) sky. with theirsensitive all-sky observation, map and planck satellites should be able todetect weak non-gaussianity in the cmb sky. on large angular scale, there is asimple relationship between the cmb temperature and the primordial curvatureperturbation. on smaller scales; however, the radiation transfer functionbecomes more complex. in this paper, we present the angular bispectrum of theprimary cmb anisotropy that uses the full transfer function. we find that thebispectrum has a series of acoustic peaks that change a sign, and a period ofacoustic oscillations is twice as long as that of the angular power spectrum.using a single non-linear coupling parameter to characterize the amplitude ofthe bispectrum, we estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for cobe, map,and planck experiments. we find that the detection of the primary bispectrum byany kind of experiments should be problematic for the simple slow-rollinflationary scenarios. we compare the sensitivity of the primary bispectrum tothe primary skewness and conclude that when we can compute the predicted formof the bispectrum, it becomes a ``matched filter'' for detecting thenon-gaussianity in the data, and much more powerful tool than the skewness. wealso show that map and planck can separate the primary bispectrum from varioussecondary bispectra on the basis of the shape difference. the primary cmbbispectrum is a test of the inflationary scenario, and also a probe of thenon-linear physics in the very early universe.

astro-ph;0012196	cmb anisotropy from spatial correlations of clusters of galaxies	the sz effect from clusters of galaxies is a dominant source of secondary cmbanisotropy in the low-redshift universe. we present analytic predictions forthe cmb power spectrum from massive halos arising from the sz effect. sincehalos are discrete, the power spectrum consists of a poisson and a correlationterm. the latter is always smaller than the former, which is dominated bynearby bright rich clusters. in practice however, those bright clusters areeasy to indentify and can thus be subtracted from the map. after thissubtraction, the correlation term dominates degree-scale fluctuations over thepoisson term, as the main contribution to the correlation term comes fromdistant clusters. we find that the correlation term is detectable by planckexperiment. since the degree scale spectrum is quite insensitive to the highlyuncertain core structures of halos, our predictions are robust on these scales.measuring the correlation term on degree scales thus cleanly probes theclustering of distant halos. this has not been measured yet, mainly becauseoptical and x-ray surveys are not sufficiently sensitive to include suchdistant clusters and groups. our analytic predictions are also compared toadiabatic hydrodynamic simulations. the agreement is remarkably good, down toten arcminutes scales, indicating that our predictions are robust for theplanck experiment. below ten arcminute scales, where the details of the corestructure dominates the power spectrum, our analytic and simulated predictionsmight fail. in the near future, interferometer and bolometer array experimentswill measure the sz power spectrum down to arcminutes scales, and yield newinsight into the physics of the intrahalo medium.

astro-ph;0012197	the cosmic microwave background bispectrum as a test of the physics of  inflation and probe of the astrophysics of the low-redshift universe	why is non-gaussianity interesting? one of generic predictions frominflationary scenarios is that primordial fluctuations are exactly gaussian inlinear order; however, the non-linearity in the inflation will produce weaknon-gaussianity. thus, measuring the non-gaussianity in the cosmic microwavebackground radiation anisotropy is a probe of the non-linear physics in thevery early universe. since the angular three point function is zero for thegaussian field, it is sensitive to the non-gaussianity. we predict its harmonictransform counterpart, the angular {\it bispectrum}, down to arcminutes angularscales, including the full effect of the radiation transfer function. we findthat even the planck experiment cannot detect the primary bispectrum from theinflation, as long as the single field slow-roll inflation is right.non-linearities in the low redshift universe also produce the non-gaussianity.we find that secondary bispectra are detectable by both map and planckexperiments. the secondary bispectra probe the non-linear physics of thelow-redshift universe. although this could be a contaminant to the primarysignal, map and planck experiments are found to be able to separate the primaryfrom secondary effects well. we present a tentative comparison of the primarybispectrum to the published cobe 4 year bispectrum. the data put a weakconstraint on the parameter, and the constraint would become much tighter whenwe use all modes available in the cobe data, and certainly forthcomingsatellite experiments. as a conclusion, the bispectrum is a key measure toconfirm or destroy the simple inflationary scenario in non-linear order thatseems quite successful in linear order.

astro-ph;0106151	universal gas density and temperature profile	we present an analytic approach to predict gas density and temperatureprofiles in dark matter haloes. we assume that the gas density profile tracesthe dark matter density profile in outer parts of the haloes, as suggested bymany hydrodynamic simulations. under this assumption, the hydrostaticequilibrium uniquely fixes the two free parameters in the model, themass-temperature normalization and the polytropic index, that determine thetemperature profile. this enables us to predict a universal gas profile fromany universal dark matter profile. our results show that gas tracing darkmatter in the outer parts of the haloes is inconsistent with gas beingisothermal; on the contrary, it requires temperature to decrease slowly withradius, in agreement with observations. we compare our predictions for x-raysurface brightness profiles of the haloes and the mass-temperature relationwith observations. we find that they are generally in a good agreement. wecompare the universal profile with the beta profile and find that, although thebeta profile gives a reasonable fit to our predicted profiles, the deviationfrom it can explain many of the observed trends, once we take into account theobservational selection effects. our model predicts that the mass-temperaturerelation does not follow the self-similar relation because of themass-dependent halo concentration. we also predict surface brightness profilesof the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. we find that fitted to the beta profilethe core radii and beta inferred from the sz effect are systematically largerthan those from the x-ray measurement.

astro-ph;0107605	measurement of the cosmic microwave background bispectrum on the cobe  dmr sky maps	we measure the angular bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)radiation anisotropy from the cobe differential microwave radiometer (dmr)four-year sky maps. the angular bispectrum is the harmonic transform of thethree-point correlation function, analogous to the angular power spectrum, theharmonic transform of the two-point correlation function. first, we studystatistical properties of the bispectrum and the normalized bispectrum. we findthe latter more useful for statistical analysis; the distribution of thenormalized bispectrum is very much gaussian, while the bare bispectrumdistribution is highly non-gaussian. then, we measure 466 modes of thenormalized bispectrum, all independent combinations of three-pointconfigurations up to a maximum multipole of 20, the mode corresponding to thedmr beam size. by measuring 10 times as many modes as the sum of previous work,we test gaussianity of the dmr maps. we compare the data with the simulatedgaussian realizations, finding no significant detection of the normalizedbispectrum on the mode-by-mode basis. we also find that the previously reporteddetection of the normalized bispectrum is consistent with a statisticalfluctuation. by fitting a theoretical prediction to the data for the primarycmb bispectrum, which is motivated by slow-roll inflation, we put a weakconstraint on a parameter characterizing non-linearity in inflation.simultaneously fitting the foreground bispectra estimated from interstellardust and synchrotron template maps shows that neither dust nor synchrotronemissions significantly contribute to the bispectrum at high galactic latitude.we conclude that the dmr map is consistent with gaussianity.

astro-ph;0205468	the sunyaev-zel'dovich angular power spectrum as a probe of cosmological  parameters	the angular power spectrum of the sz effect, c_l, is a powerful probe ofcosmology. it is easier to detect than individual clusters in the field, isinsensitive to observational selection effects and does not require acalibration between cluster mass and flux, reducing the systematic errors whichdominate the cluster-counting constraints. it receives a dominant contributionfrom cluster region between 20-40% of the virial radius and is thus insensitiveto the poorly known gas physics in the cluster centre, such as cooling or(pre)heating. in this paper we derive a refined analytic prediction for c_lusing the universal gas-density and temperature profile and the dark-matterhalo mass function. the predicted c_l has no free parameters and fits all ofthe published hydrodynamic simulation results to better than a factor of twoaround l=3000. we find that c_l scales as (sigma_8)^7 times (omega_b h)^2 andis almost independent of all of the other cosmological parameters. this differsfrom the local cluster abundance studies, which give a relation between sigma_8and omega_m. we also compute the covariance matrix of c_l using the halo modeland find a good agreement relative to the simulations. we estimate how well wecan determine sigma_8 with sampling-variance-limited observations and find thatfor a several-square-degree survey with 1-2 arcminute resolution one should beable to determine sigma_8 to within a few percent, with the remaininguncertainty dominated by theoretical modelling. if the recent excess of the cmbpower on small scales reported by the cbi experiment is due to the sz effect,then we find sigma_8(omega_b h/0.029)^0.3 = 1.04 +- 0.12 at the 95% confidencelevel (statistical) and with a residual 10% systematic (theoretical)uncertainty.

astro-ph;0206039	the pursuit of non-gaussian fluctuations in the cosmic microwave  background	we present theoretical and observational studies of non-gaussian fluctuationsin cmb, by using the angular bispectrum and trispectrum. we predict the primaryangular bispectrum from inflation, and forecast how well we can measure theprimordial non-gaussian signal. in addition to that, secondary anisotropysources in the low-redshift universe also produce non-gaussianity, so doforeground emissions from extragalactic or interstellar microwave sources. westudy how well we can measure these non-gaussian signals, including theprimordial signal. we find that slow-roll inflation produces too smallbispectrum to be detected by any experiments; thus, any detection stronglyconstrains this class of models. we also find that the secondary bispectrumfrom coupling between the sz effect and the weak lensing effect, and theforeground bispectrum from extragalactic point sources, give detectablenon-gaussian signals on small angular scales. we test gaussianity of the cobedmr sky maps, by measuring all the modes of the angular bispectrum down to thedmr beam size. we find no significant signal of the bispectrum. we also findthat the previously reported detection of the bispectrum is consistent with astatistical fluctuation. by fitting the theoretical prediction to the data forthe primary bispectrum, we put a constraint on non-linearity in inflation. weconclude that the angular bispectrum finds no significant non-gaussian signalsin the dmr data. we present the first measurement of the angular trispectrum onthe dmr sky maps, further testing gaussianity of the dmr data. we find nosignificant non-gaussian signals in the trispectrum. therefore, the angularbispectrum and trispectrum show that the dmr sky map is comfortably consistentwith gaussianity.

astro-ph;0508174	the cosmic near infrared background: remnant light from early stars	the redshifted ultraviolet light from early stars at z ~ 10 contributes tothe cosmic near infrared background. we present detailed calculations of itsspectrum with various assumptions about metallicity and mass spectrum of earlystars. we show that if the near infrared background has a stellar origin,metal-free stars are not the only explanation of the excess near infraredbackground; stars with metals (e.g. z=1/50 z_sun) can produce the same amountof background intensity as the metal-free stars. we quantitatively show thatthe predicted average intensity at 1-2 microns is essentially determined by theefficiency of nuclear burning in stars, which is not very sensitive tometallicity. we predict \nu i_\nu / \dot{\rho}_* ~ 4-8 nw m^-2 sr^-1, where\dot{\rho_*} is the mean star formation rate at z=7-15 (in units of m_sun yr^-1mpc^-3) for stars more massive than 5 m_sun. on the other hand, since we havevery little knowledge about the form of mass spectrum of early stars,uncertainty in the average intensity due to the mass spectrum could be large.an accurate determination of the near infrared background allows us to probeformation history of early stars, which is difficult to constrain by othermeans. while the star formation rate at z=7-15 inferred from the current datais significantly higher than the local rate at z&lt;5, it does not rule out thestellar origin of the cosmic near infrared background. in addition, we showthat a reasonable initial mass function, coupled with this star formation rate,does not over-produce metals in the universe in most cases, and may produce aslittle as less than 1 % of the metals observed in the universe today.

astro-ph;0512010	the cosmic reionization history as revealed by the cmb doppler--21-cm  correlation	we show that the epoch(s) of reionization when the ionization fraction of theuniverse is about half can be determined by correlating cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) temperature maps with 21-cm line maps at degree scales ($l\sim100$). during reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces thedoppler anisotropy of the cmb, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogeninduce the 21-cm line anisotropy. in our simplified model of inhomogeneousreionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas anegative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlationprovides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained bypresently. the signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 mpc^-1) wherelinear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionizationis averaged out. since the doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) inredshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.furthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,especially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: thisis analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the cmb being moreimmune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. therefore, weargue that the doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detectedsignals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides thestrongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin. we show thatthe square kilometer array can easily measure the predicted correlation signalfor 1~year of survey observation.

astro-ph;0512217	anisotropy of the cosmic gamma-ray background from dark matter  annihilation	high-energy photons from dark matter annihilation contribute to the cosmicgamma-ray background (cgb). since dark matter particles are weakly interacting,annihilation can happen only in high density regions such as dark matter halos.the precise shape of the energy spectrum of cgb depends on the nature of darkmatter particles, as well as the cosmological evolution of dark matter halos.in order to discriminate between the signals from dark matter annihilation andother astrophysical sources, however, the information from the energy spectrummay not be sufficient. we show that dark matter annihilation also produces acharacteristic anisotropy of the cgb, which provides a powerful tool fortesting the origin. we develop the formalism based on a halo model approach tocalculate the three-dimensional power spectrum of dark matter clumping, whichdetermines the power spectrum of annihilation signals. we show that thesensitivity of future gamma-ray detectors such as glast should allow us tomeasure the angular power spectrum of cgb anisotropy, if dark matter particlesare supersymmetric neutralinos and they account for most of the observed meanintensity of cgb in gev region. on the other hand, if dark matter has arelatively small mass, and accounts for most of the cgb in mev region, then thefuture advanced compton telescope should be able to measure the anisotropy inmev region. as the intensity of photons from annihilation is proportional tothe density squared, we show that the predicted shape of the angular powerspectrum of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation is different from that dueto other astrophysical sources such as blazars. therefore, the angular powerspectrum of the cgb provides a smoking-gun signature of dark matterannihilation.

astro-ph;0512374	cosmology with high-redshift galaxy survey: neutrino mass and inflation	(abridged) high-z galaxy redshift surveys open up exciting possibilities forprecision determinations of neutrino masses and inflationary models. the high-zsurveys are more useful for cosmology than low-z ones owing to much weakernon-linearities in matter clustering, redshift-space distortion and galaxybias. we can then utilize the two-dimensional information of the linear powerspectrum in angular and redshift space to measure the scale-dependentsuppression of matter clustering due to neutrino free-streaming as well as theshape of the primordial power spectrum. to illustrate capabilities of high-zsurveys for constraining neutrino masses and the primordial power spectrum, wecompare three future redshift surveys covering 300 square degrees at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2,2&lt;z&lt;4, and 3.5&lt;z&lt;6.5. we find that, combined with the cosmic microwavebackground data expected from the planck satellite, these surveys allowprecision determination of the total neutrino mass with the projected errors ofsigma(m_nu)=0.059, 0.043, and 0.025 ev, respectively, thus yielding a positivedetection of the neutrino mass rather than an upper limit, as sigma(m_nu) issmaller than the lower limits to the neutrino masses implied from the neutrinooscillation experiments. the accuracies of constraining the tilt and runningindex of the primordial power spectrum, sigma(n_s)=(3.8, 3.7, 3.0)x10^-3, andsigma(alpha_s)=(5.9, 5.7, 2.4)x10^-3, respectively, are smaller than thecurrent uncertainties by more than an order of magnitude, which will allow usto discriminate between candidate inflationary models. in particular, the erroron alpha_s from the highest redshift survey is not very far away from theprediction of a class of simple inflationary models driven by a massive scalarfield with self-coupling, alpha_s=-(0.8-1.2)x10^-3.

astro-ph;0602099	angular trispectrum of cmb temperature anisotropy from primordial  non-gaussianity with the full radiation transfer function	we calculate the cosmic microwave background (cmb) angular trispectrum,spherical harmonic transform of the four-point correlation function, fromprimordial non-gaussianity in primordial curvature perturbations characterizedby a constant non-linear coupling parameter, $f_{\rm nl}$. we fully take intoaccount the effect of the radiation transfer function, and thus provide themost accurate estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio of the angular trispectrumof cmb temperature anisotropy. we find that the predicted signal-to-noise ratioof the trispectrum summed up to a given $l$ is approximately a power-law,$(s/n)(&lt;l)\sim 2.2\times 10^{-9}f^2_{\rm nl}l^2$, up to the maximum multipolethat we have reached in our numerical calculation, $l=1200$, assuming that theerror is dominated by cosmic variance. our results indicate that thesignal-to-noise ratio of the temperature trispectrum exceeds that of thebispectrum at the critical multipole, $l_c \sim 1500~(50/|f_{\rm nl}|)$.therefore, the trispectrum of the planck data is more sensitive to primordialnon-gaussianity than the bispectrum for $|f_{\rm nl}|\gtrsim 50$. we alsoreport the predicted constraints on the amplitude of trispectrum, which may beuseful for other non-gaussian models such as curvaton models.

astro-ph;0607284	primordial non-gaussianity and analytical formula for minkowski  functionals of the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure	we derive analytical formulae for the minkowski functions of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and large-scale structure (lss) from primordialnon-gaussianity. these formulae enable us to estimate a non-linear couplingparameter, f_nl, directly from the cmb and lss data without relying onnumerical simulations of non-gaussian primordial fluctuations. one can usethese formulae to estimate statistical errors on f_nl from gaussianrealizations, which are much faster to generate than non-gaussian ones, fullytaking into account the cosmic/sampling variance, beam smearing, survey mask,etc. we show that the cmb data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probeshould be sensitive to |f_nl|\simeq 40 at the 68% confidence level. the planckdata should be sensitive to |f_nl|\simeq 20. as for the lss data, the late-timenon-gaussianity arising from gravitational instability and galaxy biasing makesit more challenging to detect primordial non-gaussianity at low redshifts. thelate-time effects obscure the primordial signals at small spatial scales.high-redshift galaxy surveys at z&gt;2 covering \sim 10gpc^3 volume would berequired for the lss data to detect |f_nl|\simeq 100. minkowski functionals arenicely complementary to the bispectrum because the minkowski functionals aredefined in real space and the bispectrum is defined in fourier space. thisproperty makes the minksowski functionals a useful tool in the presence ofreal-world issues such as anisotropic noise, foreground and survey masks. ourformalism can be extended to scale-dependent f_nl easily.
